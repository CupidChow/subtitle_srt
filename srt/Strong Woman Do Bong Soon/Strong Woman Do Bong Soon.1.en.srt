1
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:48,649
What happened?

2
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,300
What's happening?

3
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:58,986
-Ouch, it hurts.
-Ouch.

4
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:43,102
Gosh, I was about to see her face...

5
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,266
Yes, this is An Minhyuk from Ainsoft.

6
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:55,889
I think I warned you...

7
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,848
...to get rid of "Chronicles of Albertan".

8
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,872
Or you'll die.

9
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,925
You jerk.

10
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,628
Do you know what time it is?

11
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:07,506
Blackmailing doesn't work
on someone half asleep.

12
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:11,972
It's only scary when I'm fully awake.
You're so stupid!

13
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,818
Don't be too surprised
if something happens later.

14
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,004
You asked for it.

15
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:20,460
Ainsoft will go down
and you asked for it...

16
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,560
Who the heck are you?

17
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:46,504
"Ms. Do Bongsoon, we regret to inform you
that you've failed the interview"

18
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,086
Okay, I got it. I didn't get the job.

19
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,639
"Resume"

20
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:53,827
"Name: Do Bongsoon"

21
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:05,202
I'm tired of writing cover letters.

22
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,760
My name is Do Bongsoon.

23
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,759
I live in Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu.

24
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:17,577
If I may introduce myself,

25
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:22,028
I'm a little too special.

26
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,362
Maybe not?

27
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:27,740
"Records of Superhuman strength
in Do Bongsoon's maternal line"

28
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:29,444
I have a secret.

29
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,892
I'm different as compared to others.

30
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,495
I'm strong.

31
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:37,318
Very strong!

32
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:42,372
The progenitor of this secret gene
killed more enemies throwing stones,

33
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:46,561
than the number of stones she carried
during the time of "Battle of Haengju".

34
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,452
She's my ancestor, Park Gaeboon.

35
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:57,251
And there's a big secret
behind this incredible strength.

36
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:00,905
In 1862, during the rebellion
of Jinju peasants and slaves...

37
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:05,406
...my ancestor, Ga Okbang,
fought for the royal forces...

38
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:07,072
...killing many innocent people.

39
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,420
As she used her strength to feather
her own nest, she lost her strength...

40
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,095
...and spent her latter days alone,
suffering from leprosy.

41
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:20,004
Since then, my maternal ancestors learned
that if they used this power unjustly...

42
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:21,994
...they'll pay a price.

43
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:25,006
This became a jinx that's
almost like black magic.

44
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,360
But...

45
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,894
"Book of Ability"

46
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:32,306
Hwang Jinyi, my mother,
deliberately ignored this jinx.

47
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:36,210
And her undue desire and madness
became a problem.

48
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:50,061
It was all fine when she used her strength
to boost national prestige.

49
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,028
But...

50
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:04,239
Give me that.

51
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:05,761
You, jump.

52
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,960
On your knees!

53
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,360
I said on your knees.
On your knees.

54
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:20,794
Goodness!

55
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:31,594
It was true that using the strength
unjustly made her pay the price.

56
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:39,553
The promising Graeco-Roman style wrestler,
Do Chilgu...

57
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:43,773
...and Hwang Jinyi, the weightlifter
who suddenly lost her strength...

58
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,106
What happened to your face?

59
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,394
-I'm fine!
-Hey, hey. Wait!

60
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:52,644
They made history that night.

61
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:55,627
Gosh!

62
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:57,894
Chilgu!

63
00:06:57,993 --> 00:06:59,127
Push!

64
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,840
The first one of the twins is a girl.

65
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:06,840
The boy is taking his time?

66
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,262
Look at this. She's clenching her fist.

67
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,861
What?

68
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:20,695
That's how I, Do Bongsoon,
came into the world.

69
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,304
"My name is..."

70
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,090
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

71
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:32,352
It's been always so difficult
to hide my strength.

72
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:39,274
The me that has
to overlook that situation...

73
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:43,163
...and the other me that
has been fighting for 27 years.

74
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:46,527
I've restrained myself whenever I could,
though it felt cowardly.

75
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:54,227
The doors are open.

76
00:07:55,127 --> 00:08:00,089
I had to hide my superhuman strength
as to not make a spectacle of myself.

77
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:05,573
If the accident was caused intentionally,
the policy might not cover...

78
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:08,063
No, I don't mean you caused it.

79
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:10,972
There are no jobs I haven't tried
since I graduated high school.

80
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,439
Oh, you're a brave handsome boy.

81
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,827
She's a girl.

82
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:19,773
I've even tried farming.

83
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:22,438
Ten years from now,
only farmers will survive.

84
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,606
Because men will use up the oil
and we won't be able to travel.

85
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:28,628
When that happens, we'll have to be
self-sufficient like in the primitive age.

86
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,794
Bongsoon, don't spare your strength.

87
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,939
You should be a farmer.
Farming!

88
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,348
Being a farmer is so good.

89
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:40,406
When Bonggi made it to medical school
and uncle made a lot of money farming...

90
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:44,195
...mom insisted we close her
walnut store and start farming.

91
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:47,633
And she sent me to uncle's
house as an envoy.

92
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:58,994
Granny, look...

93
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:03,962
And so I failed in farming.

94
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,528
Then, I found a job that's right for me.

95
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:14,405
In real life, I must hide my strength,
but in this world, I can be myself.

96
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:18,606
My dream is creating a game
where I am the main character.

97
00:09:18,694 --> 00:09:19,928
Oh, yes!

98
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,795
This is easy.

99
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:23,524
Providing the right content...

100
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:26,820
...to the users defines the success
or failure of RPG games.

101
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:29,162
That's the case of
"Chronicles of Albertan."

102
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:33,063
They showed the users new worlds
where they could experience catharsis.

103
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:34,698
They don't give users time to get bored.

104
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,338
The CEO of that company goes to his office
only twice a week.

105
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:39,333
He spends the rest of the week
hanging around.

106
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:40,784
Don't you want that kind of life?

107
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:42,928
I wish you all good luck!

108
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,756
Hey! Stop right there!

109
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:25,792
Hey!

110
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,053
Stop right there!

111
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:37,127
You're dead!

112
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:13,956
Darn!

113
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:18,530
I need a bodyguard.

114
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:20,914
Find me someone right now.

115
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:41,982
And one day,
the feared and expected happened.

116
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,628
Hey!

117
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:12,703
Nobody here?

118
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:16,696
Who the heck parks their truck like this?

119
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:17,971
Where...

120
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:19,533
What is it?

121
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:31,404
-Are you the driver of the truck?
-No, he's eating.

122
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:35,025
But you're blocking the road.
Why'd you do that?

123
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,438
You old man!

124
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:39,152
You can't pass through this road.

125
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,060
That's nonsense. You don't own this road.

126
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,604
Old man, go back while
I'm still being nice to you.

127
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:49,421
Unless you want to be
beaten up like a dog.

128
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,084
What are you doing?

129
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:06,819
My... my...

130
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:08,292
My phone.

131
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:12,792
I gave you a chance
and you didn't take it.

132
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,526
What's all that groaning? What?

133
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,893
What's all that groaning?

134
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:25,159
Come here. Come on.

135
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,857
-Come, come.
-Goodness!

136
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,023
Hello?

137
00:13:41,546 --> 00:13:45,743
I want to file a report.
It's Dobong-dong...

138
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,487
-What are you doing? Give it back!
-Wait.

139
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:53,727
Women always post photos of food.

140
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:55,094
Oh?

141
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:59,494
-Your boyfriend?
-Why are you looking through my photos?

142
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:02,438
-Give it back.
-You're quite daring, aren't you?

143
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:05,114
You called the police?
You're looking for trouble.

144
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:08,628
So, you're a law abiding citizen, huh?

145
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:11,040
Then I'm the perfect thug.

146
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:15,921
You harassed the weak old man first.

147
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,136
Did we harass you?

148
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:21,225
Did we beat you?

149
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,337
Geez.

150
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,873
Your boyfriend likes to mess around, huh?

151
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,830
-Go!
-What? Darn it.

152
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:34,213
You broke my phone!

153
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,179
Mister...

154
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:41,914
Pay for it.

155
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,360
What the heck?

156
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,707
It's under a three-year contract...

157
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:52,530
...and I used it for only five months!

158
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,728
I'm asking you one last time.

159
00:14:57,326 --> 00:15:02,502
-Pay for it.
-Women these days are just too brave.

160
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,593
Do you want to be ripped into tatters
and hung on your clothesline?

161
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:18,460
-You're as tiny as a peanut.
-What's going on?

162
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:20,527
I could finish you with one punch.

163
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,460
-Don't hit me!
-Where's the police?

164
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,281
-This is why I don't like the police.
-I said don't hit me!

165
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:36,904
Poor lady.

166
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:39,739
Your face is so tiny. Like a CD.

167
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:41,961
Lower your gaze.

168
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:43,525
Lower your gaze.

169
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:45,047
I said lower your gaze.

170
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:47,813
Lower your gaze.

171
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,275
Hello?

172
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:56,102
Here's...

173
00:15:56,468 --> 00:15:58,381
A redevelopment area in Dobong-dong.

174
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,914
I think we'll need the patrol
and the police squad.

175
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,236
There's a lot of people.

176
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:05,698
Thugs are threatening
a woman and an old man.

177
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:12,037
I might lose my strength forever
and have smallpox all over my body...

178
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,857
...but I will not tolerate this thug.

179
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:20,993
What do you policemen do?

180
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,759
Boss? Boss!

181
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:40,080
What?

182
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:56,941
What? What happened?

183
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,283
Boss! Boss!

184
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,171
Mister, you have to pay for my phone.

185
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,171
-Who are you?
-Don't try to defy her!

186
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,793
You know how things work.

187
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,253
The numbers are all inside here.

188
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:11,004
-You know how inconvenient it gets.
-Don't fight! Don't fight!

189
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:13,505
-She's crazy!
-You're a lunatic.

190
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:14,793
Hey.

191
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:20,371
You bent it. You bent back my hand!

192
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,759
-Oh, no.
-Don't grab it!

193
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,461
-Oh, no. I'm sorry.
-Don't grab it!

194
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:27,226
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

195
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,626
I didn't mean to.

196
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:35,594
You.

197
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:43,283
What?

198
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:47,926
Mister, you have to pay
for the phone you broke.

199
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,492
My hand. My hand!

200
00:17:55,238 --> 00:17:56,075
Who...

201
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:57,240
Who is she?

202
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:16,946
Oh, I'm sorry.

203
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,565
Yes! We won!

204
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:47,621
-Over here! Help him.
-My hand. She bent my hand!

205
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,259
Should I call 911?

206
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,633
-What's this mess?
-Someone control them.

207
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:29,434
I'm telling you the truth!

208
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:31,610
-That girl grabbed me...
-Look at what happened to him.

209
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,305
I didn't do it.

210
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,926
"Violent Crimes Team 3"

211
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,692
What do I do?

212
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:45,084
He'll get suspicious.
What do I tell him?

213
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:09,060
Do I look okay?

214
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:23,713
Hi, Gukdoo.

215
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,911
Gukdoo, long time no see.

216
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,325
You're working so hard, Gukdoo.

217
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:34,160
What is she doing?

218
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:41,741
-Geez seriously. This is so unfair.
-I didn't start it!

219
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,178
-She threw me in the air!
-I almost died.

220
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,352
We're not lying!

221
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,441
-So she really did that to you?
-Yes!

222
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:51,457
Do Bongsoon!

223
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:52,585
Then she...

224
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:55,493
It's her.

225
00:20:57,593 --> 00:20:59,760
It's her. It's her.

226
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:04,526
-Please, I beg you.
-So you're saying...

227
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:22,772
Detective, kids don't lie!

228
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,589
-You have to believe them!
-Name?

229
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,059
Do Bongsoon.

230
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,323
Address?
No. 1342 Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu.

231
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:35,237
So you're saying they were blocking
the street and wouldn't let anyone pass.

232
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:38,029
The bus driver asked them
to pull out the car,

233
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:40,560
but they refused and beat him.

234
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:42,426
You tried to call the police
to report the incident...

235
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:46,739
...when Kim Kwangbok showed up...

236
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:50,654
You asked him to pay for the damages
and a quarrel ensued.

237
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:54,611
Do Bongsoon, who lives in Dobong-dong,
Dobong-gu, slapped him in the face.

238
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:57,160
-After taking that medicine...
-You really don't get it.

239
00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:02,459
Causing a serious injury where
his face sank and he lost four teeth...

240
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,626
I'm not joking. She threw us in the air.

241
00:22:05,097 --> 00:22:08,931
Meanwhile Hwang Hyundong,
who found out about Kim Kwangbok...

242
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:14,325
...tried to suppress the situation
but fractured five fingers.

243
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,938
Oh Jintae and Yang Yongchul came later,

244
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:20,385
and were thrown 30 meters
onto the back of a truck.

245
00:22:20,593 --> 00:22:24,148
Each man suffered injuries.
Their leg and neck were fractured.

246
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:26,963
Cha Youngnam who approached you,

247
00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:29,068
to avenge them
was crashed against Mr. Kim.

248
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:34,567
Mr. Kim was blown away 10 meters,
hit a dump truck and fell.

249
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:40,426
Do you think this makes sense?

250
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,959
Well, but...

251
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,126
It doesn't make sense.

252
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:51,071
Under the current law, the testimony of
kindergartners have no legal force.

253
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,392
And their statement is illogical,
from legal and  common sense viewpoint.

254
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:55,431
The problem lies...

255
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:59,304
in the testimony of the bus driver.

256
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:02,059
If he's saying the truth,
according to Civil Code Clause 750...

257
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,335
...this is deliberate and
culpable assault. You can get prosecuted.

258
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:07,304
Unless the testimony of
the witness who reported it...

259
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,852
Are you writing a martial arts novel?

260
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:10,811
Who's that?

261
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,219
Korean policemen are a problem.

262
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:18,282
You write those kinds of reports
and get paid for it?

263
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:19,211
Paid what?

264
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:21,783
I reported it and I'm the witness.

265
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:23,317
What? Who is he?

266
00:23:25,693 --> 00:23:28,594
Kids, you shouldn't lie to the police.

267
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:31,227
Do you seriously believe she beat them?

268
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,760
-All alone?
-Yes!

269
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,571
-See?
-Kids don't lie.

270
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:38,726
You must have watched
"The Avengers" today.

271
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,708
How are they educating you in school?

272
00:23:41,896 --> 00:23:45,086
They name it audio-visual education
and show them movies day in and day out.

273
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,320
You should seize
and search that kindergarten.

274
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:48,891
Are you the one who reported it?

275
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,857
Yes, I reported it and I witnessed it.

276
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:54,772
The driver's testimony
will obviously be different.

277
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,405
He was in the scene and he's the victim.
He can't have an objective view.

278
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,807
The situation was...

279
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:03,756
How do I put it?

280
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:10,315
It was a total chaos where
the universe fell into confusion.

281
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:14,489
False testimony by a witness
is not punishable.

282
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,072
However, if the victim brings
a civil action, you must go to court.

283
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:19,926
Then you will be charged with perjury.

284
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:22,894
Then how did those men
get injured like that?

285
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:26,026
Tell him the truth. The truth.
Look at me and tell him.

286
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,159
Those men?

287
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,626
They fought against each other.

288
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:41,959
Everyone, sit! Sit!

289
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,321
That's not true!

290
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:49,755
She beat them up alone.

291
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:54,894
Kids.

292
00:24:57,826 --> 00:24:59,473
Do you know how to read?

293
00:25:04,392 --> 00:25:05,449
See?

294
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:07,874
They don't teach them how to read.

295
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:10,309
All they do is show them movies.

296
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:14,007
Preschool is the basis of education
and it's a mess.

297
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:18,871
A girl that beats up seven men
without any weapons?

298
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,794
This makes absolutely no sense.

299
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:24,031
-Why not?!
-You have to believe us!

300
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,471
Hollywood movies are ruining lives.

301
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,794
Hey, you all!
What charges would you like?

302
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:32,360
Do you want to go to jail
for blackmailing?

303
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:34,671
What did you just say?

304
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,593
Who the heck beat you?

305
00:25:36,693 --> 00:25:38,827
Who broke your leg?

306
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:43,216
And who did that to you?
Who broke your leg?

307
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,916
Don't be such a perfectionist.

308
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:54,670
If you report this, I'll lose my job.

309
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,469
Does it make sense to you that
they lost teeth and were fractured...

310
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,726
...because a girl beat them?

311
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,993
You're just trying to make a case
because you need a new case.

312
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:09,626
They assaulted the driver
and falsely accused an innocent citizen.

313
00:26:09,726 --> 00:26:12,193
They must be arrested and investigated.
They all have criminal records.

314
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,909
Sit, sit! Everyone, sit!

315
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:20,493
-You're the best!
-You're the best!

316
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:23,227
-You're the best!
-You're the best!

317
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:27,793
You're the best!

318
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:33,660
You're the best! Thumbs up!

319
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:37,360
Are you enjoying this?

320
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:41,322
If you don't want to
meet thugs like them...

321
00:26:41,411 --> 00:26:44,670
...don't just stay at home
and find yourself a job.

322
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,772
What was that?

323
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:48,697
What the heck is he saying to her?

324
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,180
Mr. An!

325
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,274
What happened that you had
to come to the police station?

326
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:10,963
I've seen some very odd stuff.

327
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:13,536
Excuse me.

328
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,426
Shouldn't you say "Thank you" to me?

329
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:29,915
Why did you lie in there?

330
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:33,471
What on earth?

331
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,393
I helped you out so
you wouldn't be arrested for assault.

332
00:27:36,526 --> 00:27:38,587
You don't thank me or apologize to me.

333
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,819
-What is this supposed to be?
-Why did you try to help me?

334
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:48,033
You were born a man, so live as a man.

335
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:50,969
You just watched
when a woman took measures.

336
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:54,573
You should feel ashamed as a man.

337
00:27:58,459 --> 00:27:59,744
What's up with her?

338
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:02,080
She's very peculiar.

339
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:04,290
Gosh.

340
00:28:05,693 --> 00:28:06,891
She's so sexy.

341
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:08,620
What?

342
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,523
But...

343
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:48,051
"Ainsoft"

344
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,090
She was more powerful than
any other character I've seen.

345
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:51,167
Oh, hi.

346
00:28:51,256 --> 00:28:52,401
What do you mean?

347
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:56,004
I mean... Oh, Ms. Seo!
I liked the prototype plan.

348
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:58,844
-Thanks, Mr. An. I'll work very hard.
-Please do so!

349
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,125
You can do it!

350
00:29:01,432 --> 00:29:02,432
You know...

351
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:05,026
She was more thrilling than any game.

352
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:07,613
-Who?
-That woman!

353
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:09,278
"Dobong Walnut"

354
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:23,193
Enjoy.

355
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,126
-Thank you!
-Bye.

356
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:28,805
-Hello.
-Oh, hi. Thank you.

357
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,435
-Bye.
-Bye.

358
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:38,826
How are the sales?

359
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,692
This is all?

360
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:56,679
If I find any in your pocket,

361
00:29:56,768 --> 00:29:58,499
it's ten slaps per bill.

362
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,970
Good. You should've done that earlier.

363
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:04,337
Geez.

364
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:06,805
Don't be such a loser.

365
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:08,740
You're a man, okay?

366
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,973
-I'll try.
-Give me a cup of coffee.

367
00:30:24,092 --> 00:30:25,708
I'm back.

368
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,972
Why are you so late?

369
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:31,452
Nothing. I had something to do.

370
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,075
Something like what?
All you do is eat and do nothing.

371
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:36,904
You went to the
internet cafe again, right?

372
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:39,807
I'm so embarrassed that
I can't even look at Myungsoo's mom.

373
00:30:39,896 --> 00:30:42,182
Gosh, what should we do about you?

374
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:44,705
I heard there are three million
unemployed young people...

375
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:47,405
...but I never imagined my daughter
would be one of them.

376
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:48,560
My goodness.

377
00:30:50,776 --> 00:30:52,931
Just get married, okay?

378
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,012
Find a rich guy to fall in love with you.

379
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,928
-You hear me?
-Water, please.

380
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,324
-Lieutenant In.
-Yes!

381
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:05,169
How do you know that Avenger's girl?

382
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:07,122
We went to the same school.

383
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:10,647
Right. You lived in Dobong-dong, right?

384
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:13,839
Wow...That witness...

385
00:31:14,392 --> 00:31:16,635
I just checked his background
and he's the CEO of Ainsoft.

386
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:20,078
-What kind of company is Ainsoft?
-You haven't heard of it?

387
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:22,598
It's the company that created
"Chronicles of Albertan".

388
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:24,804
Their CEO's name is An Minhyuk.

389
00:31:24,893 --> 00:31:26,904
He's the son of An Chuldo,
the Chairman of Ohsung Group.

390
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:30,555
No wonder he acted up like that.

391
00:31:30,852 --> 00:31:33,772
Where are Kim Kwangbok
and Hwang Hyundong?

392
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:35,861
-Are they still in the hospital?
-Yes.

393
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:42,383
Did you guys check who she is?

394
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:46,272
No. Everything hurts so much.

395
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:49,638
I feel so ashamed!

396
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,710
But she was so strong.

397
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:55,371
She's the strongest person
I've ever fought against.

398
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:57,559
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

399
00:31:58,663 --> 00:32:02,303
Hey! What's her name?

400
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:03,889
-Do Bongsoon!
-Do Bongsoon!

401
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:07,225
Do Bongsoon!

402
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:10,395
Do Bongsoon!

403
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:15,500
Do Bongsoon!

404
00:32:19,893 --> 00:32:21,633
Look at this fracture.

405
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,036
I've never seen anything like this
in my 15 years of practice.

406
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:30,323
The bones were folded at once
and then put back together perfectly.

407
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,071
Unless it's a person
with some mysterious strength...

408
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,380
...this is impossible.

409
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:37,698
And look at this arm.

410
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:40,304
This arm turned the other way around.

411
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:45,004
They want us to study again
the dynamics of bones and muscles...

412
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:47,271
...when physical force is applied.

413
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,243
It could become
a revolutionary research paper.

414
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:55,059
This patient lost four teeth in one punch.

415
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:57,742
Doctor Shin, what do we make of this?

416
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:01,941
He kept crying claiming
that a woman caused everything.

417
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,411
Maybe he needs
psychiatric treatment as well.

418
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:06,885
Psychiatry?

419
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:09,026
Should we call Doctor Kim?

420
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:29,371
Mister, my brother is peeing in his pants.

421
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:30,593
Darn.

422
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:32,359
You're wetting the seat.

423
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:35,113
-Let us go!
-Shut up!

424
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:40,252
Bonggi.

425
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,501
Don't cry.

426
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,723
Do you want to go back to mom and dad?

427
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,458
Then keep quiet.

428
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:51,095
If you keep crying,

429
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:54,425
I'm going to get angry.

430
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:00,026
My brother is crying. Stop the car!

431
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:05,243
If you cry or pee in your pants again,
I'm going to kill you. Okay?

432
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,160
Where are you going?

433
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:24,360
Come here!

434
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:26,064
-Let me go.
-You brats.

435
00:34:31,318 --> 00:34:32,237
Help!

436
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,860
You completely crushed them.

437
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,627
They started the fight.

438
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:39,259
Don't you dare tell mom.

439
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,193
I'm going to tell.

440
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:46,143
I wonder if you'll be fine
tomorrow morning.

441
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,837
You know that curse.

442
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,930
When we were kids, the kidnapper
was a bad guy so that doesn't count.

443
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,160
-But this time...
-Well, they were bad guys, too.

444
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:01,793
Gosh, keep studying.

445
00:37:02,327 --> 00:37:03,515
Thank god.

446
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:30,772
I'm fine!

447
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,828
Yeah!

448
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:13,827
Good morning, guys.

449
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,229
Good morning!

450
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,642
"President"

451
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:33,947
"Resume"

452
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,861
Fourth-Dan Judo, fifth-Dan Hapkido,
certified sixth-Dan Taekwondo.

453
00:38:42,693 --> 00:38:46,093
Second place in Pan-Korea
Jiujitsu Championships 2014.

454
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,886
Worked at one of the 3 branches
of the Presidential Security Service.

455
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:06,800
That woman.

456
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,903
I want you to find that woman
I met at the police station.

457
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:13,166
Yes, the woman!

458
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:15,270
The woman you're thinking about!

459
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:16,360
Okay?

460
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:17,471
Well, actually...

461
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,817
According to the Public
Officials Act Clause 60...

462
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:22,408
...a police officer is not allowed to
disclose any information obtained...

463
00:39:22,497 --> 00:39:24,229
...during and after his tenure of office.

464
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:26,405
-But...
-Please leave.

465
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:29,287
We never disclose personal details.

466
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:35,404
They can never disclose personal details.

467
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:37,872
The policeman in charge was really strict.

468
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,369
What's his name?

469
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:41,132
It's In Gukdoo.

470
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:42,334
In Gukdoo?

471
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,160
It's open! Come in!

472
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,880
Hey, are you doped?

473
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,453
Yeah, you know my taste.

474
00:40:16,104 --> 00:40:16,970
Now show me!

475
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:25,727
Hey, stop!

476
00:40:27,326 --> 00:40:28,493
Stop that!

477
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:30,548
What the heck is this?

478
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:35,360
-You have the right to remain silent.
-What?

479
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,959
-You have the right to talk to a lawyer.
-What? Are you a cop?

480
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:40,866
Do you have a warrant?

481
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:44,487
The warrant will be requested
within 24 hours after the arrest.

482
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:47,270
I'm arresting you first
since you might run.

483
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,004
Wait. Are you a man?

484
00:40:49,092 --> 00:40:50,971
-Yes.
-Do you know who I am?

485
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:53,133
Am I supposed to know that?

486
00:40:53,226 --> 00:40:55,086
-Darn you!
-Darn it!

487
00:40:58,095 --> 00:41:01,228
According to
the Public Officials Act Clause 61...

488
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:04,042
...a public official must not accept
any compensation or be treated...

489
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:08,399
...regardless of direct or
indirect relation to his duty.

490
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:11,296
I was given orders to investigate without
exceptions and after I arrested him...

491
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,793
...he turned out to be a member
of the National Assembly.

492
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:14,182
Is that my fault?

493
00:41:15,426 --> 00:41:17,594
Lieutenant In, take it easy.

494
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:21,627
Or you'll vanish off without a trace.

495
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:24,393
Then bring it on!

496
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:27,220
I apologize, sir.

497
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:28,751
Yes, sir!

498
00:41:29,673 --> 00:41:32,907
Is he out of his mind?

499
00:41:33,306 --> 00:41:34,755
The superiors are complaining.

500
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:37,792
Sir, he's a little out of his mind.

501
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:41,832
He was known to be very stubborn
since his days in the police academy.

502
00:41:42,593 --> 00:41:44,200
-So...
-Transfer him...

503
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:47,523
...to Traffic Control so he suffocates
to death breathing in fumes.

504
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:50,497
But there are many eyes watching, so...

505
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:55,036
Then transfer him to a team
with the worst performance!

506
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:56,681
Get your head down. I can't see.

507
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:09,615
The old movies have the answers.

508
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:14,665
We need to take one step at a time
from the basics.

509
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:30,125
Hello. I've been appointed to Violent
Crimes Team 3.

510
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,607
My name is In Gukdoo.

511
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,171
He's nuts. You can't even talk to him.

512
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,657
I get a headache just thinking about him.

513
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,918
He's the real deal.

514
00:42:44,007 --> 00:42:44,896
What?

515
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,724
But why do you want her number?

516
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:49,762
She's my type.

517
00:42:49,856 --> 00:42:52,091
You want to date her?

518
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:53,471
Kind of.

519
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,306
How is your father doing?

520
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:57,475
He's doing great thanks to you.

521
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:01,505
You've been such a help
to my father his entire life.

522
00:43:01,593 --> 00:43:07,946
I'm proud that you made it so big
without the support from your father.

523
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:13,190
But success without support
doesn't last very long.

524
00:43:23,526 --> 00:43:25,668
Maybe I should get a job
that requires physical strength.

525
00:43:25,757 --> 00:43:27,704
They pay you well for physical labor.

526
00:43:27,793 --> 00:43:29,498
It's not a bad thing.

527
00:43:30,615 --> 00:43:34,203
Bongsoon, you had enough.
Leave some of it for Bonggi.

528
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:38,971
I've had the worst luck for
wrongly using physical strength.

529
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:40,259
And you want to do what?

530
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:44,460
I married him.

531
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:45,794
What about me?

532
00:43:46,638 --> 00:43:47,592
Geez.

533
00:43:53,593 --> 00:43:54,593
Hello?

534
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,441
Yes, this is Do Bongsoon. Who's there?

535
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,989
So you're not doing anything
in particular?

536
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:23,233
I'm actually looking for a job.
I'm not jobless.

537
00:44:24,382 --> 00:44:25,574
I see.

538
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,322
Anyway.

539
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:30,127
My boss saw you that day
and he was very impressed...

540
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:33,637
...so he made this bold decision.

541
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,309
He's such a loser.

542
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:39,492
What?

543
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:43,596
He could come himself and ask
instead of sending someone.

544
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:45,898
You even look much older than him.

545
00:44:49,526 --> 00:44:52,571
You can consider this the first interview.

546
00:44:53,045 --> 00:44:53,911
Sure.

547
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,671
-The first interview?
-Yes.

548
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:57,593
I see.

549
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:05,137
So you're saying I have to guard
your boss. Is that right?

550
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:09,217
Yes. We'll pay you the highest
in the industry.

551
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:13,965
Mister, there's no job I haven't tried
ever since I graduated high school.

552
00:45:14,054 --> 00:45:18,422
I know too much about companies that lie,
that will close, or expect too much.

553
00:45:18,511 --> 00:45:25,011
I'd rather use my head than my strength.
That's the view I have about jobs.

554
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:28,616
I don't know
what made you give me this offer...

555
00:45:28,705 --> 00:45:34,036
...but there's a precise industry
and business I'd like to work in.

556
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:37,230
May I know what field
are you looking into?

557
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:38,956
That's private.

558
00:45:39,793 --> 00:45:41,872
You came a long way
and I'm sorry to reject your offer.

559
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,561
Now if you excuse me.

560
00:45:44,095 --> 00:45:45,237
60 million won annually.

561
00:45:49,537 --> 00:45:50,473
And an extra bonus.

562
00:45:58,092 --> 00:46:00,258
Excuse me, but...

563
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:05,693
...it's not adult entertainment business
disguised as bodyguard services, right?

564
00:46:05,793 --> 00:46:09,437
Why would you pay so high?
You don't know me.

565
00:46:09,526 --> 00:46:11,027
-Is he interested in me?
-Oh, no.

566
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,659
Now come to think of it,
how did you know my number?

567
00:46:12,793 --> 00:46:13,926
Are you stalking me?

568
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:15,726
-Oh, no. Not at all.
-And one more thing.

569
00:46:15,826 --> 00:46:21,060
Why would you have a female bodyguard?
That's the weirdest part.

570
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:23,805
-It's really weird.
-Excuse me, your ear.

571
00:46:23,893 --> 00:46:25,937
My ear? Why?

572
00:46:26,025 --> 00:46:28,921
He actually likes men,
so to prevent any scandals...

573
00:46:29,025 --> 00:46:33,771
Jeez. That makes no sense.
What's the name of the company?

574
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,661
Oh, it's Ainsoft.

575
00:46:38,192 --> 00:46:39,026
What?

576
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:43,559
-What is it?
-Have you heard of Ainsoft?

577
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:45,289
Ainsoft?

578
00:46:48,992 --> 00:46:49,860
Mister.

579
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:53,872
When can I meet your boss?

580
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:07,160
I know, right?

581
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:11,010
-Thank you.
-Here's your order.

582
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,633
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

583
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:14,926
I added sugar.

584
00:47:16,373 --> 00:47:22,004
So you call the borough office
and city hall ten times a day.

585
00:47:22,093 --> 00:47:24,126
To tell them you're against redevelopment.

586
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:28,438
No, I think one of us
should just shave her head.

587
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:31,326
-How about you?
-Oh, come on!

588
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:34,926
Shaving your head and fasting
doesn't work.

589
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:39,505
We should torture the person in charge
and confront the redevelopment person.

590
00:47:39,593 --> 00:47:42,784
But I'm actually for redevelopment.

591
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:47,047
That alley of the laundry shop
is so scary after 10 PM to walk there.

592
00:47:47,136 --> 00:47:50,634
Yes, that needs to be fixed quickly.

593
00:47:50,757 --> 00:47:54,726
There are so many thugs
around the neighborhood lately.

594
00:47:54,815 --> 00:47:56,215
Jinyi, look.

595
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:03,726
-Hello.
-Hi.

596
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,491
-Look how she's dressed.
-Welcome.

597
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,829
Shaking her hair out loose.

598
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:10,410
Four egg tarts and two pecan pies, please.

599
00:48:10,499 --> 00:48:12,820
Egg tart, pecan pies.

600
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:16,332
Ma'am, I enjoyed reading your novel.

601
00:48:16,788 --> 00:48:18,756
"Hormones in the Room."

602
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:21,970
Oh, you liked it?

603
00:48:22,059 --> 00:48:24,505
Yes, I finished it in one day.

604
00:48:24,594 --> 00:48:28,773
I've never read a book so fast before.

605
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:30,751
It was so easy to read.

606
00:48:34,092 --> 00:48:34,960
Oh, right.

607
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:40,417
Gukdoo told me he met Bongsoon
at the police station a few days ago.

608
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,378
-What?
-Did you hear that?

609
00:48:52,726 --> 00:48:53,594
Right.

610
00:49:02,493 --> 00:49:03,526
Bongsoon!

611
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,593
-Bongsoon, come here.
-Let's eat.

612
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:09,405
-You!
-What?

613
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:12,142
Why did you go to the police station?

614
00:49:12,231 --> 00:49:13,398
How did you know?

615
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:15,853
Gukdoo works there.
Why wouldn't I know?

616
00:49:16,057 --> 00:49:19,433
Why did you go there? Why?

617
00:49:19,526 --> 00:49:21,394
It just happened.

618
00:49:21,493 --> 00:49:24,827
Did you beat someone? Did you?

619
00:49:24,926 --> 00:49:28,164
-Mom, let me explain.
-Are you crazy?

620
00:49:28,317 --> 00:49:29,838
You didn't hear grandma's story?

621
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,805
She beat one man at the market...

622
00:49:31,893 --> 00:49:34,348
...and she ended up having diarrhea
for a month and hemorrhoids later.

623
00:49:34,437 --> 00:49:36,430
-And what about me? Look at me!
-Mom...

624
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:37,989
I'm fine.

625
00:49:38,246 --> 00:49:40,853
Honestly, I've done that very often...

626
00:49:41,065 --> 00:49:43,425
-...but I'm fine.
-What?

627
00:49:43,526 --> 00:49:47,906
Mom, I think I'm a mutant.

628
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:52,389
And I found a job, too!

629
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:56,327
I'm going to use my talent!

630
00:49:56,526 --> 00:50:00,517
-Bongsoon, mom, I'm hungry.
-Bonggi, are you hungry?

631
00:50:00,759 --> 00:50:02,471
-What's wrong with you?
-I'll cook something good...

632
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,312
Oh, no. I'm sorry! Are you okay?

633
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:07,026
I got too excited. Sorry.

634
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:09,993
Let's go inside.

635
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,360
Mom, taste it.

636
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,059
Okay.

637
00:50:21,759 --> 00:50:22,792
-Enjoy!
-Enjoy!

638
00:50:22,893 --> 00:50:23,929
It looks good!

639
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:32,597
Who's that?

640
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:34,959
It's good.

641
00:50:39,426 --> 00:50:40,813
Hello?

642
00:50:40,902 --> 00:50:41,839
Hey, it's me.

643
00:50:46,249 --> 00:50:47,526
Yes, I know.

644
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:50,997
I checked those guys that assaulted
the man in the redevelopment area.

645
00:50:51,086 --> 00:50:52,739
They're really bad people.

646
00:50:52,828 --> 00:50:54,430
So don't stay out too late.

647
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,720
And you'll need a taser.

648
00:50:56,944 --> 00:50:59,736
I have a couple I keep as supplies.
I'll hand it to you after work.

649
00:50:59,992 --> 00:51:01,326
Okay.

650
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:04,528
-I'm hanging up.
-Gukdoo, I think I'm going to get a job.

651
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:05,504
I'm hanging up.

652
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:10,559
You're so bad.

653
00:51:11,926 --> 00:51:13,804
He's so rude...

654
00:51:17,192 --> 00:51:19,221
But I still like him so much!

655
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:27,493
There we go again.

656
00:51:27,593 --> 00:51:30,169
-This needs some seaweed.
-Right!

657
00:51:32,888 --> 00:51:33,748
Come in.

658
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:37,151
Good  morning.

659
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:38,929
Come on in.

660
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:45,880
-Sit. The ceiling won't collapse.
-Okay.

661
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:49,548
-Do you have a resume?
-Yes.

662
00:51:56,423 --> 00:51:58,493
-You've been interviewed here before?
-Yes.

663
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,454
You wanted to get a job here
with these qualifications?

664
00:52:03,722 --> 00:52:04,623
Great courage.

665
00:52:04,712 --> 00:52:07,959
I applied because you don't consider
academic background, age, or gender.

666
00:52:08,048 --> 00:52:08,958
You're brave.

667
00:52:09,403 --> 00:52:10,430
You really are.

668
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,567
Do Bongsoon from Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu?

669
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:15,070
Did you move to Dobong-dong
so it'll match your name?

670
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:19,269
Then? Banghwas live only in Banghwa-dong?
And Yeonhuis live in Yeonhui-dong?

671
00:52:22,326 --> 00:52:24,326
Sorry, I thought it would be funny.

672
00:52:24,415 --> 00:52:25,789
-That's not funny.
-Okay.

673
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:29,580
-Why did you want to get a job here?
-Because it's a good company.

674
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,691
-Let's make this work.
-Okay.

675
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:36,670
I'm sorry it's not for
planning and development.

676
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:37,593
Me, too.

677
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:40,880
I have a question.

678
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,782
You are not physically disabled
and you look healthy.

679
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:47,205
Why do you need a bodyguard?

680
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:49,166
I have enemies everywhere.

681
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,783
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not a bad person.

682
00:52:51,872 --> 00:52:54,092
I'm sure you're not.

683
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:59,628
What about incentives
and the national pension plan?

684
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,812
It depends on your competence.

685
00:53:02,945 --> 00:53:04,728
We need to see your performance first.

686
00:53:04,817 --> 00:53:07,226
-Do you have an in-house cafeteria?
-Yes.

687
00:53:07,315 --> 00:53:08,568
Menstrual leave?

688
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:12,087
We don't have that.

689
00:53:13,006 --> 00:53:14,216
That's bad.

690
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:17,227
Bodyguards have no holidays
because of the nature of their job.

691
00:53:17,713 --> 00:53:19,420
Okay, then...

692
00:53:19,787 --> 00:53:21,452
...do you offer stop motions?

693
00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:33,001
What's a stop motion?

694
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,161
Stop motion.

695
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:35,646
You don't know?

696
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,443
You mean stock options?

697
00:53:40,532 --> 00:53:42,446
Yes, those.

698
00:53:47,231 --> 00:53:50,427
How should we offer a bodyguard
a stock option plan?

699
00:53:51,075 --> 00:53:52,096
I'll think about it.

700
00:53:52,926 --> 00:53:54,832
That's another bad point.

701
00:53:56,826 --> 00:54:00,304
May I have a look at the contract?

702
00:54:04,626 --> 00:54:06,599
-Let's try arm-wrestling.
-What?

703
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,317
To settle your salary.

704
00:54:08,406 --> 00:54:09,533
It's a test.

705
00:54:09,866 --> 00:54:10,700
Come on.

706
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:13,525
Come on.

707
00:54:15,203 --> 00:54:16,224
Arm-wrestling.

708
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:22,027
Pin me.

709
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,561
You try to pin me.

710
00:54:28,793 --> 00:54:29,767
What...

711
00:54:34,226 --> 00:54:36,102
You can use that one, too.

712
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,171
I don't believe this.

713
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:55,393
Don't be ashamed or angry
that you lost against a woman.

714
00:54:55,482 --> 00:54:57,537
I'm a special case.

715
00:54:57,626 --> 00:55:00,458
And please, keep this secret.

716
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:14,565
Mr. Kong, the contract, please.

717
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:18,730
Have a seat.

718
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,131
"Employment Contract"

719
00:55:34,754 --> 00:55:35,732
Seriously?

720
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,003
"60 million won"

721
00:55:40,092 --> 00:55:41,608
60 million won?

722
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:48,482
You can sign here.

723
00:55:48,623 --> 00:55:49,479
Okay.

724
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:53,016
"Do Bongsoon"

725
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,108
When do I start?

726
00:55:56,197 --> 00:55:57,687
Do you have strong legs, too?

727
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:58,989
What?

728
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:01,618
Have a one-legged fight with her.

729
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:03,726
But...

730
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,094
-With who? With her?
-Yes.

731
00:56:07,695 --> 00:56:10,489
Sir, I used to be a marine. Please.

732
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:13,002
I can't fight with a woman.

733
00:56:13,091 --> 00:56:13,985
Just do it.

734
00:56:14,074 --> 00:56:17,104
Sir, stop it.

735
00:56:17,192 --> 00:56:19,876
Mr. Kong, if you win...

736
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,845
...I'll give you my car.

737
00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:26,859
Players, come to the ring.

738
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,048
Okay.

739
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:37,689
Ready?

740
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,763
Wait!

741
00:56:40,278 --> 00:56:42,180
-Can he wear a helmet?
-What?

742
00:56:43,387 --> 00:56:45,937
-What?
-He might hurt his head.

743
00:56:46,025 --> 00:56:47,559
So let him wear a helmet.

744
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:49,826
A helmet?

745
00:56:52,051 --> 00:56:53,343
Then let's order Chinese food.

746
00:56:53,532 --> 00:56:55,045
Order black bean sauce noodles.

747
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,942
-Enjoy it!
-Wait, can I have your helmet?

748
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:08,591
-Excuse me?
-Your helmet.

749
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:10,526
Let me take it.

750
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:17,323
Buy a better one with that.
And that's for the noodles.

751
00:57:18,344 --> 00:57:20,494
-Enjoy!
-Thank you.

752
00:57:21,826 --> 00:57:23,893
No. Come on!

753
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:26,462
Let's do it before the noodles get mushy.

754
00:57:27,726 --> 00:57:28,438
Quickly.

755
00:57:28,526 --> 00:57:31,173
One-legged fight with a woman.

756
00:57:31,262 --> 00:57:33,423
I'm bringing disgrace to my family.

757
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:37,604
-I really get your car if I win, right?
-You can take it right away.

758
00:57:37,693 --> 00:57:40,432
Start on the count of three, okay?

759
00:57:40,526 --> 00:57:41,381
Okay.

760
00:57:44,693 --> 00:57:45,562
One.

761
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:47,167
Two.

762
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:48,765
Three!

763
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:37,147
-He's not dead, is he?
-I don't think so.

764
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:38,644
Hey, wake up.

765
00:58:38,733 --> 00:58:40,119
Are you okay?

766
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:44,326
Thank goodness. He's fine.

767
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:47,759
-Are you okay?
-It hurts!

768
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,478
-Excuse me...
-Are you okay?

769
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:11,440
-What?
-You signed, so I'm your boss now.

770
00:59:12,188 --> 00:59:14,276
I can't be too polite to my bodyguard.

771
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:15,370
Okay.

772
00:59:15,459 --> 00:59:17,080
-Well.
-What were you saying?

773
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:20,257
I'd like to know my job description.

774
00:59:20,346 --> 00:59:21,591
Your main job?

775
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,641
Protecting me is your main job.

776
00:59:23,812 --> 00:59:25,746
Protecting my mind and body.

777
00:59:25,835 --> 00:59:28,940
I have a favor to ask.

778
00:59:29,172 --> 00:59:29,837
What is it?

779
00:59:29,926 --> 00:59:34,289
If I do a good job as your bodyguard...

780
00:59:34,526 --> 00:59:37,095
...let me work in
planning and development.

781
00:59:37,184 --> 00:59:38,288
Well...

782
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,025
I can't tell if you're good at that.

783
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,863
What I can tell is not your planning
and development capability...

784
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,780
...but your capability as a bodyguard.

785
00:59:47,594 --> 00:59:50,820
I was just asking for a chance.

786
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,744
Okay, I'll give you a chance.

787
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,853
But first of all, protect me.

788
00:59:56,161 --> 00:59:56,998
Understand?

789
00:59:57,195 --> 00:59:58,036
Yes.

790
00:59:58,125 --> 00:59:59,763
Clean this up and leave.

791
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:02,003
And come to the secretary's office
tomorrow at 10 AM.

792
01:00:02,092 --> 01:00:03,626
-Okay.
-Mr. Kong is injured...

793
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,470
-...so you need to stay in the office.
-Okay.

794
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,093
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

795
01:00:10,192 --> 01:00:11,341
Bye!

796
01:00:13,893 --> 01:00:17,089
Talking down to me
and trying to be bossy.

797
01:00:17,178 --> 01:00:20,080
How can someone like that
be the CEO of this company?

798
01:00:20,926 --> 01:00:23,593
I'll have to succeed
if I find this unfair.

799
01:00:27,482 --> 01:00:29,802
"Okay, I'll give you a chance."

800
01:00:30,315 --> 01:00:32,863
What a jerk.

801
01:00:33,226 --> 01:00:35,359
I'll tolerate it only because
the salary is high.

802
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:40,093
Letting you talk down to me
is included in the salary.

803
01:00:40,793 --> 01:00:41,738
Gosh.

804
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:43,761
It got mushy.

805
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,243
All because of the leg fight.

806
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:49,026
Bodyguards...

807
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,831
"Bodyguards"

808
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:01,043
Come out. I'm in front of your house.

809
01:02:12,188 --> 01:02:13,033
Gukdoo.

810
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:15,798
Gukdoo.

811
01:02:16,513 --> 01:02:17,367
Here.

812
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,504
I'll use it well. Thank you.

813
01:02:20,593 --> 01:02:22,605
"Use it well?"
You shouldn't need to use it.

814
01:02:22,714 --> 01:02:24,171
Try to lead a life where
you don't need to use this.

815
01:02:24,259 --> 01:02:26,909
It doesn't require a license
so it's not very powerful.

816
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:28,811
It's for self-defense.

817
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:29,902
Go inside.

818
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:32,389
-You're leaving already?
-It's late. Go.

819
01:02:32,493 --> 01:02:36,130
Are things alright with your girlfriend?

820
01:02:36,226 --> 01:02:37,060
Hi, Heeji.

821
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,427
Did you finish practicing?

822
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:40,821
-Heeji...
-Did you eat dinner?

823
01:02:41,354 --> 01:02:42,331
I'm on my way home.

824
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,326
-Are you leaving?
-Oh...

825
01:02:44,493 --> 01:02:46,529
Gukdoo! Bye...

826
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,509
Goodnight!
Thanks for the taser.

827
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:35,551
We wrapped everything up here.

828
01:04:38,192 --> 01:04:39,705
Attention, everyone!

829
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:43,394
There's been a murder last night
while team two was on duty.

830
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:45,526
What? A murder?

831
01:04:45,626 --> 01:04:47,393
-Where?
-In Dobong-dong!

832
01:04:47,493 --> 01:04:49,227
What happened?

833
01:04:49,326 --> 01:04:52,980
-That's blood.
-Oh my goodness. What happened?

834
01:04:53,092 --> 01:04:56,003
-There's never been a crime here.
-Tell me about it.

835
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,037
-Wait.
-Where are you going?

836
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:02,280
Oh my goodness. What happened?

837
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:06,126
-It's so scary.
-She's dead?

838
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,580
"Kill"

839
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,683
-I told you I'm surrounded by enemies.
-You surprised me.

840
01:05:22,058 --> 01:05:24,222
-What's this?
-I don't know.

841
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:25,377
What could that be?

842
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,305
This is one of the reasons I hired you.

843
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,597
Those in the IT industry
even blackmail people digitally.

844
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:31,961
Interesting, right?

845
01:05:37,526 --> 01:05:40,637
I've been followed
and blackmailed recently.

846
01:05:40,726 --> 01:05:42,018
-By whom?
-I don't know.

847
01:05:42,107 --> 01:05:44,172
-I'd have caught him if I knew.
-Then report it to the police.

848
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:46,142
I don't like the police.
I don't trust them.

849
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,785
I will catch him.

850
01:05:49,715 --> 01:05:51,001
-I need your help.
-What?

851
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:52,315
You said you like games.

852
01:05:52,493 --> 01:05:53,799
It's exciting.

853
01:05:54,009 --> 01:05:55,642
Let's catch him like in the games.

854
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:56,780
It'll be fun.

855
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,907
You want to develop a game.
You should do it.

856
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,828
We'll win anyway.

857
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,419
Are you kidding me?

858
01:06:07,508 --> 01:06:09,670
Life is a game and game is life.

859
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:11,234
Don't be so serious.

860
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,076
What do you think? Cool, right?

861
01:06:16,165 --> 01:06:19,866
If we catch him, you'll get
a permanent job as a developer.

862
01:06:19,955 --> 01:06:21,678
I'll also develop your idea.

863
01:06:21,893 --> 01:06:23,327
How about that? Deal?

864
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:26,961
-There's been a murder last midnight.
-Deal.

865
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:33,366
The victim was a 31-year-old single woman
who had her wedding planned in two months.

866
01:06:33,529 --> 01:06:38,763
As there were no witnesses,
cameras, dash cams, or any clues...

867
01:06:38,852 --> 01:06:41,710
...the police are having difficulty
conducting the initial investigation.

868
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:45,715
The victim worked in
a large bookstore nearby.

869
01:06:45,804 --> 01:06:48,213
She had worked overtime and walked home...

870
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,610
"Unknown Caller"

871
01:06:56,988 --> 01:07:00,988
You'd better not ignore my warnings.
Look forward to what's coming.

872
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:36,960
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

873
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:39,371
Someone is watching us from somewhere.

874
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,802
We don't know for sure.
There could be a bomb.

875
01:07:40,893 --> 01:07:42,660
-You want me to die, then?
-Then should I die?

876
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:45,293
A crazy rich guy. Aren't there rich guys
who are sane?

877
01:07:45,392 --> 01:07:46,926
Sleep with me in my house.

878
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,775
-How about this?
-He's so good! He's so good!

879
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:50,133
You like that cop, right?

880
01:07:50,259 --> 01:07:52,902
-Totally my type.
-He's gay.

881
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:56,141
It's okay. Rich and flawless guys
don't exist anymore.

882
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,707
Another woman was murdered.

883
01:07:58,429 --> 01:08:00,796
-Don't kill me!
-He dared to come there!

884
01:08:00,885 --> 01:08:03,273
The suspect showed up!
Shut down the hospital!

885
01:08:03,362 --> 01:08:05,050
Right! I heard his voice.

886
01:08:05,139 --> 01:08:07,618
Minutes after I left there.

887
01:08:07,707 --> 01:08:08,758
Call 911! Quickly!

888
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,318
He saw Bongsoon's face.

889
01:08:10,407 --> 01:08:13,656
Being strong doesn't help
in this kind of situation.

890
01:08:13,793 --> 01:08:16,405
Bongsoon, stay with me today.

891
01:08:16,579 --> 01:08:19,137
My friend, Bongsoon, is a feeble woman.

892
01:08:19,226 --> 01:08:20,115
Let's go.

893
01:08:20,492 --> 01:08:21,529
She's staying.
