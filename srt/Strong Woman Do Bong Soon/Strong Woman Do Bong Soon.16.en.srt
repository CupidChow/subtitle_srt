1
00:00:01,588 --> 00:00:04,152
Now I can sleep without worries.

2
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:08,778
Do you remember?

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,014
Remember what you said after
I came out of the police station?

4
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:18,464
"Why did you lie? You should be ashamed."

5
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:21,235
You looked at me right in the eyes.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,179
Now I can say this.

7
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:26,016
You looked so...

8
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:31,302
Are you asleep?

9
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:35,170
Who am I talking to?

10
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:37,426
Yeah, sleep.

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,697
You need some sleep. Sleep tight.

12
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:46,928
Were you tired? You're snoring.

13
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,752
"Under Interrogation"

14
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:03,430
Why did you do it?

15
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:09,403
For fun.

16
00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:14,432
-What?
-They all begged me not to kill them.

17
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,076
They obeyed my commands.

18
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:18,499
They starve if I tell them to.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,179
They crawl if I tell them to.

20
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,187
-You scum!
-Hey!

21
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:25,037
Gukdoo, calm down!

22
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:27,754
You got just relieved
from your punishment!

23
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:31,713
A human might deserve a beating
but he's an animal!

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,800
You son of a gun!

25
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:37,032
-You should just die!
-Sir, stop!

26
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:38,529
-Why did you kill her?
-Why did you do it?

27
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:41,281
-Why did you kill her?
-What was your motive?

28
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:42,800
"Notorious Kidnapper
Kim Janghyeon Arrested"

29
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:44,633
We managed to earn our keep this time!

30
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:47,140
We put noblesse oblige into action!

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,775
They finally caught him!

32
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:57,978
-They finally got him.
-What a relief!

33
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:11,598
Good morning!
Good morning!

34
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:15,268
Captain Tak: Leader of
the Nutcracker Soldiers

35
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,623
Why does this character look so familiar?

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,892
-I know, right?
-Yes, he's someone who works here.

37
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:26,518
I've seen him somewhere.

38
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:29,153
But I can't tell who it is.

39
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:30,939
Oh, Mr. An.

40
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:32,240
Ms. Do!

41
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,157
-Let's start the meeting.
-Yes, Mr. An.

42
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,789
-Mr. Kong, join us.
-Okay.

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,086
Our planning team is known
for being very sharp.

44
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,275
They'll ask you sharp questions.

45
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,647
So don't panic and answer them calmly.

46
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:48,597
It's not easy to jump over that barrier
but I can't help you.

47
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,971
You must deal with it on your own.

48
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:52,873
-Got it.
-For instance.

49
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:59,405
Do you think a 2D side view game
stands a chance in today's market?

50
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,748
Yes, you create trends.

51
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:08,034
These kinds of casual games...

52
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:12,943
...can be easily accessed by everyone.

53
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:17,163
-And that means?
-Users of all ages can play it.

54
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:20,195
Kids that used to play these kinds
of games back in the day...

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,547
...are now adults
and they feel a nostalgia for them.

56
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:28,742
That's an advantage that can work for us.

57
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:32,057
Good. You should prepare for
other expected questions.

58
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:34,895
Prepare yourself for them
so you can wrap it up well.

59
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:41,149
But what happens to
the main characters in the end?

60
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:47,393
Bongssuni rescues Prince Min-min
and they live happily ever after.

61
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:48,442
It's a happy ending.

62
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:51,240
Happily ever after.

63
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,310
Oh...

64
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:55,881
Do they get married and have kids?

65
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,939
Oh, Mr. Kong.

66
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,941
I'm not sure about that.
Maybe in the second part.

67
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:09,590
Why are you so happy?

68
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:12,656
I love how cheerful it is.

69
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,899
I hope it passes quickly
and gets launched.

70
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,356
So we can make the second part.

71
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,791
Should I leave?

72
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,764
No, you stay. We'll leave.

73
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,346
-Let's go, Ms. Do!
-Okay.

74
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:28,356
But...

75
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:33,484
I need your approval...

76
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:42,696
Why the long face?

77
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:47,227
Wait. Bongsoon and Mr. An
left you out in the cold again?

78
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:50,081
I feel so lonely these days.

79
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:54,145
The days are getting warmer
but I feel colder and colder.

80
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,246
A crow is crying within me.

81
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,600
Oh, my!

82
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:03,380
That is so poetic.
A crow crying within you.

83
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:08,308
My crow laid an egg in my heart.

84
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:13,446
Your dad hasn't come back yet?

85
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:16,516
I'm worried.

86
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,073
Did you try calling him?

87
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:22,731
I did but he said he wants
to spend some time alone.

88
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:24,800
He's acting like a rebellious adolescent.

89
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,811
He needs time to think.

90
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:29,677
Did your mom try calling him?
Maybe if she calls him...

91
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,453
I see.

92
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:35,836
He doesn't even answer.

93
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:37,011
Right.

94
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:41,380
Okay, maybe I can help.

95
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:43,076
-How?
-How?

96
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:51,351
I'll call him and tell him,
"Sir, I'm here to get you."

97
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,087
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

98
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:55,856
Cute.

99
00:05:56,107 --> 00:06:00,011
You're making my heart flutter again.

100
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:02,701
-What?
-We're at work.

101
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,574
-Nobody's watching.
-It's a glass window.

102
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:06,846
I didn't do anything.
I'm just holding your cheeks.

103
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:09,411
I'm just saying.

104
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,454
-Saying what?
-Oh, stop it.

105
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,084
-Stop it?
-I'm shy.

106
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:14,373
Stop what?

107
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:16,959
People can watch us.

108
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,437
Nobody's here.

109
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:19,520
Really?

110
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:22,173
Why? Why should I call him?

111
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:26,501
Leaving home is up to him
but coming back is not.

112
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,513
Why should I call and apologize?
What did I do to him?

113
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,525
I don't want to meddle with your life...

114
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,972
...so I didn't want to say this.

115
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:43,148
But when I saw how he got
beaten black and blue by you...

116
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,942
...I thought it was wrong.

117
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:47,607
You can't beat men just
because you're a woman.

118
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,399
What are you talking about?

119
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:50,980
Who beat who?

120
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:56,512
His eyes were bruised
and his lips were cracked.

121
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:58,561
His hair was all torn out.

122
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:02,842
You're getting it all wrong.
I didn't beat him!

123
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:05,156
We got into a fight and I pushed him...

124
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,942
...and he bumped into
the edge of a sewing machine.

125
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:10,221
How can you be so misguided?

126
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,333
I haven't beaten a man since I was 19.

127
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:15,195
You can't be serious.

128
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:19,460
I'm the type to insult and curse.

129
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:21,593
I lay down the facts
so you can see for yourself.

130
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:25,278
That's what I follow.
You can't be serious.

131
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,816
That adds some aroma.

132
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,038
This is mugwort.

133
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,014
-Crown daisy.
-Oh, crown daisy?

134
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,379
I picked up the phone because you called.

135
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:42,729
I'm officially out of reach.

136
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:47,632
It looks uncomfortable here.
Is this where you sleep?

137
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:53,555
I guess Bongsoon told you
about me running away.

138
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:57,151
-Yes.
-I feel embarrassed.

139
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:58,706
Don't say that.

140
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,815
I live alone but I run away
from home sometimes.

141
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:07,258
It was supposed to be a joke.

142
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,262
I'm sorry. It wasn't funny.

143
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:11,364
-No, it's not funny.
-Sorry.

144
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,850
-Have a drink.
-Thank you.

145
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,369
Sir.

146
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,974
Can't you just go back?

147
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:33,946
No.

148
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:37,304
I want to find myself.

149
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:42,612
Find yourself a little later
and go back home first.

150
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:44,540
-Why should I?
-I...

151
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:52,048
I want to marry Bongsoon.

152
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:57,241
-What?
-I want to marry her.

153
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:00,677
-I'm asking for your permission.
-What did you say?

154
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:02,631
-Do you mean it?
-Yes, I mean it.

155
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,290
I want to marry her as soon as possible.

156
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:07,872
-I'd do it tomorrow if I could.
-Jeez.

157
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,860
If you take too long finding yourself...

158
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:11,819
...my marriage will also
have to be postponed.

159
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:15,306
I need your help.
One day without her feels like a year.

160
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,664
Time just doesn't move on.
Especially at night.

161
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:19,626
What on earth?

162
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:21,874
I'm her father, you fool.

163
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,487
-Yes, sir.
-Be careful about what you say.

164
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:24,555
-Yes. Sorry, sir.
-You fool.

165
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,626
"Especially at night"?

166
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:30,824
As you can see, I'm losing my mind.

167
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:34,274
I love her so much!
Please, save me!

168
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,223
-You feel like dying?
-Yes!

169
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,658
-And lose your mind?
-I'm about to die and go crazy!

170
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,073
I'll fall into the water
if you ask me to.

171
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:41,596
-Then do it.
-What?

172
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,706
Go into the water.

173
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:45,819
-I'll really do it.
-Go ahead.

174
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:48,873
-If that's what you want...
-Hey, hey! Forget it.

175
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,793
Okay.

176
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,416
Pour me more alcohol.

177
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:10,669
You won't make her sad?

178
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:14,180
What do I gain from making her sad?

179
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:16,034
If I do, she'll beat me to death...

180
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:21,221
Anyway, I won't make her sad.

181
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:26,092
My Bongsoon might be strong...

182
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:30,144
...but inside, she's fragile like glass.

183
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:32,432
She gets hurt easily.

184
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:35,081
Well...

185
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:39,038
Oh, yes. Right.

186
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,508
What do you like so much about her?

187
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:44,640
What do I like about her?

188
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:52,986
Bongsoon is...

189
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,191
...like me.

190
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,238
You know...

191
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,163
...I only exist when she's with me.

192
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,639
And I feel like I'm nothing without her.

193
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,000
I really love your daughter, don't I?

194
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,832
Yes, I think you do.

195
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,497
Thanks for raising her
to be a lovable woman.

196
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,641
Now I'll take care of her
and make her happy.

197
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:41,701
Okay, you do that.

198
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,243
Thank you.

199
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,538
You have good persuasive skills.

200
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:55,481
Are you a player?

201
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:56,583
What?

202
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:01,530
Did you catch this fish?

203
00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:02,524
I bought it.

204
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:04,375
Pollacks don't live in rivers.

205
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:07,660
Thanks.

206
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:12,083
I'm leaving next month for Vienna.

207
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,062
I might be able to join
the orchestra there.

208
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:17,237
Yes, I heard.

209
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:18,596
From whom?

210
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,201
From Gukdoo.

211
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,311
I didn't know this before...

212
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:28,771
...but now, there's one thing
I'm sure about.

213
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,951
Fate.

214
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,474
Or destiny.

215
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,157
I think it really exists.

216
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:40,906
Gukdoo, you, and I will keep...

217
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,093
...feeling attracted to others
and forget them again...

218
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:47,667
...and then meet someone else.

219
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:51,506
And one day, if we're very lucky...

220
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,928
...we'll find the love of our lives.

221
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,743
I guess...

222
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,258
...we're not meant to be.

223
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:05,752
Is it different when you meet
the love of your life?

224
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:07,987
They say it is.

225
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,319
Who says so?

226
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:10,490
My sister.

227
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:14,260
She says you feel like...

228
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:17,564
...that's the only person you need.

229
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,609
Do you know what makes
the love of your life different?

230
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:26,399
You see yourself in his eyes.

231
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:27,626
What?

232
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,770
You see yourself in his eyes...

233
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:35,832
...and you look really happy.

234
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,313
That's what you see.

235
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,433
That's how you can tell
it's the love of your life.

236
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:41,552
Wow...

237
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,640
It's a little hard to understand...

238
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,643
...but anyway, I envy you.

239
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:51,055
Hey, by the way.

240
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,469
Isn't the neighborhood
so clean and peaceful these days?

241
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:57,100
Totally. So nice and clean.

242
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,159
So nice and clean?

243
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:01,207
Let's go back home.

244
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,913
-Dad!
-Hey, Bongsoon.

245
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:08,660
-Bongsoon will do it for you.
-Yes, she will!

246
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:10,281
-Over here.
-Sir, please.

247
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,979
-My Jinyi will do it all...
-Dad.

248
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:16,525
-I will... Hey, hey! Hey...
-Dad.

249
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:18,739
Thank you so much.

250
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:20,379
I'll leave now.

251
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:23,301
No, you can't just go.

252
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:25,568
You went through so much trouble.
Stay for some tea.

253
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:27,467
-No, I...
-Have some tea.

254
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:29,959
-Then...
-Go, go. Go.

255
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:31,868
-My room?
-Go up and have some tea.

256
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:34,309
-Go quickly.
-Okay.

257
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:36,662
Jinyi!

258
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,839
Should we have some tea?

259
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,994
Jinyi!

260
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:48,411
What have you been doing all night?
Look at your dirty nails.

261
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,582
What is this tomfoolery?

262
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:54,861
Gosh.

263
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:58,383
Here's my room.

264
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:01,634
Come in.

265
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:05,787
Isn't Kyungsim in Seoul?
Where is she?

266
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:10,209
She's staying with her aunt
in Bongcheon-dong tonight.

267
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,656
It feels so strange.

268
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:25,076
What?

269
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:30,308
The bed.

270
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:33,797
So this is where you sleep.

271
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:36,068
And tell me from here,
"Goodnight, Min-min."

272
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:41,957
I did a good job, didn't I?

273
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:43,236
With what?

274
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:45,147
I brought your dad back.

275
00:15:45,232 --> 00:15:49,724
Yes, great job. I'm proud of you.

276
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,686
Listen...

277
00:15:54,937 --> 00:16:01,262
Your mom wouldn't suddenly barge in
and interrupt us, would she?

278
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:02,795
Mr. An!

279
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:04,216
Yes?

280
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:08,718
Thank you for everything.

281
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,392
-It's okay.
-Have some fruit.

282
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:15,868
I'm leaving.
Have a good time together.

283
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,110
-Thanks, Mom.
-Okay.

284
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,647
-By the way.
-Yes?

285
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,599
-You can stay over.
-Mom!

286
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,002
-What?
-Thanks. Bye.

287
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,788
She brought some strawberries...

288
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:33,459
-She left.
-Yeah.

289
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:34,859
The strawberries...

290
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:37,858
She won't come back, right?

291
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,040
Well... Why do you ask?

292
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,887
Why else?

293
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:45,171
I mean...

294
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:46,506
-You know why.
-Bongsoon!

295
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:50,387
-Hi.
-I...

296
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:53,796
-Hi, Mr. An.
-I was about to leave.

297
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:54,714
Yes.

298
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:59,868
I brought your father back
and I came to see her room.

299
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,190
-Keep doing whatever...
-Oh, no!

300
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:02,605
-Bye, Bongsoon.
-I'll see you off.

301
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,525
-I should go. Bye.
-Let's go.

302
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,171
Come on...

303
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:19,005
I really don't want to go home alone.

304
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,245
Oh, come on.

305
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,235
You should go.

306
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:30,216
You really...

307
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,806
Go home. I'll appear
in your dreams tonight.

308
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,992
You better get home before I fall asleep.
Then I can appear in your dreams.

309
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:45,853
You know that you're not
making any sense, right?

310
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:48,340
Yeah, I know.
I'm cringing while saying it.

311
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,843
-Bongsoon.
-Yeah?

312
00:17:54,258 --> 00:17:55,841
See you in my dreams.

313
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:56,855
Okay.

314
00:17:57,146 --> 00:18:01,092
Actually, I see you in my dreams.

315
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:04,016
-Really?
-Yes, I dream about you often.

316
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,386
You dream about me often?

317
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:12,058
Oh, come here.

318
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:16,462
See you tomorrow at work.

319
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:17,379
Okay.

320
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:18,731
Now go.

321
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,138
Go inside.

322
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:21,846
You go first.

323
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,099
No, you go first.

324
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:24,022
Go!

325
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:25,365
Go!

326
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,890
-Go now.
-Go. Why won't you go?

327
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,803
-Go!
-Go. Why won't you go?

328
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:33,108
-Why won't you go?
-I'm fine. You go first.

329
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:34,494
Go now.

330
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:38,618
-I'm fine. You go.
-Okay, I'll go.

331
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:41,475
-Bye.
-Okay.

332
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,955
-Go now.
-Bye.

333
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:45,428
-Goodnight.
-Go.

334
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,001
Come on. Go.

335
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,202
How humiliating!

336
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,946
Sit down, sir.
Your blood pressure is rising.

337
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:04,159
So Nizamuddin is Korean?

338
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,839
That's what they said.
His real name is Jo Dalbong.

339
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:09,248
Jo Dalbong... Jo Dalbong?

340
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:13,282
How could he do this to me?
How could he fool me?

341
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:17,690
He conned many innocent
people and made...

342
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,743
...50 million won.

343
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:21,879
Then...

344
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,202
...how did he cure me?

345
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,841
I'm definitely cured.

346
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:28,647
The wound on my body disappeared!

347
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,413
I guess that's how your body is.

348
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:33,283
Your body reacts better
to illegal or folk remedy...

349
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:34,789
...than scientific medicine.

350
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,625
-The poop wine worked on you.
-Poop...?

351
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,810
He's a wanted man.

352
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:40,384
Jo Dalbong.

353
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:48,393
"Suspect Wanted for Religious Fraud"

354
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:51,303
No, that's not under our jurisdiction.

355
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,525
Darn it.

356
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:55,129
-You're not understanding.
-Darn it.

357
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:59,526
I'm not trying to have a fight.

358
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,504
The defendant brutally murdered...

359
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:10,810
the first victim, Jeong Hyangsook,
for no reason.

360
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:14,085
The life of a person
has an absolute value...

361
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,348
...and can't be exchanged
with anything in the world.

362
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:21,153
Violating this value is unpardonable.

363
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:27,926
Also, the defendant deliberately
kidnapped and confined...

364
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:30,262
...four more women without any reason.

365
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,818
The defendant inflicted
irreparable pain to the victims.

366
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:40,958
And terrorized a community
and the country's citizens.

367
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:49,142
And yet, the defendant
does not show any remorse.

368
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:55,222
Considering the crime's motive
and its accounts as well as its impact...

369
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:58,660
...it is highly likely
that he could do it again.

370
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:05,531
Therefore, taking into account
the motive, means, results...

371
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:07,918
...and the circumstances
after the crime...

372
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,138
...we sentence the defendant
to life imprisonment.

373
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:22,512
I caught him with my own hands.

374
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,803
"Dobong-Gu, Safest Zone"

375
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:32,518
"A Happy Cultural Town, Dobong-Gu"

376
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,260
"Letter of Appreciation"

377
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,108
Come closer.

378
00:21:39,193 --> 00:21:41,590
"Our True Hero Citizen"

379
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,535
Get closer.

380
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:48,841
Hurray.

381
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,479
"Cheongwoon Police Station"

382
00:21:56,003 --> 00:22:00,563
We were able to achieve this
with the help of a good citizen.

383
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:03,807
We want to make this public
to encourage more involvement.

384
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:08,172
We will continue to do our best
to keep the city safe.

385
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:11,497
-Wow, "Civilian Gallantry Award."
-Thank you.

386
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:14,710
I can't believe I'm getting
a prize from the police.

387
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,771
Only because I can't let
your identity get exposed.

388
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:21,599
But you have no idea
how embarrassed I feel.

389
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:26,728
Sorry, but you'll have to get used to it.

390
00:22:27,274 --> 00:22:28,868
-Are you serious?
-Please.

391
00:22:28,952 --> 00:22:30,458
Why me?

392
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:32,273
What?

393
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:37,856
Let's get out of here.
I really don't want to stay here.

394
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,979
You did a good job, brave citizen.

395
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:42,482
We look forward to your help.

396
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:45,598
I've been transferred to
the Gangnam Police Station.

397
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,092
We won't be seeing each other.

398
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,611
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

399
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,063
Can't he get transferred
to Ulleungdo Island?

400
00:22:57,147 --> 00:22:58,343
Why to Gangnam?

401
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:00,970
Let's go, brave citizen.

402
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:03,202
For you.

403
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,439
Brave citizen?

404
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,922
Hello. I'm Do Bongsoon
of the pre-development team.

405
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,603
Pre-development team?

406
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:30,746
There's a team called that?

407
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,806
Pre-development team?

408
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:34,458
What? Really?

409
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:43,206
Today, I want to introduce you
to a new game.

410
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,257
It's called
"Super Girl Bongssuni."

411
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:49,184
It's a side view mobile game
that can be controlled...

412
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:52,601
...by simply touching the screen
and can be played by anyone.

413
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:56,328
The goal is to rescue Prince Min-min
of the Land of Walnuts.

414
00:23:56,413 --> 00:24:01,573
Super Girl Bongssuni goes through
hardships and troubles to do so.

415
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:06,472
She has to defeat
the nutcracker soldiers...

416
00:24:06,557 --> 00:24:09,152
...and their leader, Captain Tak.

417
00:24:09,237 --> 00:24:10,262
That's original.

418
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:17,957
Bongssuni uses this nut cracking
hammer as an item in the game.

419
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:24,669
This hammer can be upgraded
as she cracks more nuts.

420
00:24:25,142 --> 00:24:28,351
The first upgrade I have in mind...

421
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:30,569
Who's Bongsooni rescuing?

422
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:33,965
A prince that lives alone in a castle.

423
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,431
-A prince?
-Yes.

424
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:38,196
It's a very lonely prince.

425
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:40,856
It was you, right? The bus girl.

426
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,415
I thought you were an angel
my mom sent from heaven.

427
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:46,614
And it was you?

428
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:47,600
I feel like...

429
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:51,044
...I'm the heroine.

430
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:53,537
Are you saying that I'm King Kong?

431
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,385
A very special King Kong.

432
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:57,863
A peanut-like King Kong.

433
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,468
I'll protect you.

434
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,671
It's very simple to
go from friends to lovers.

435
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:07,639
One of the two...

436
00:25:09,672 --> 00:25:11,351
...has to take one step closer.

437
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:12,888
I missed you.

438
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:18,027
I think we can discuss that later.

439
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:19,178
Thank you.

440
00:25:32,403 --> 00:25:34,168
You're breaking it.
We can't sell it like this.

441
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:35,226
It's okay.

442
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:36,806
No, it's not.

443
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:42,008
I checked to see if Mr. An
and Bongsoon are a good match.

444
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:44,059
Apparently they're a great match.

445
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:46,640
They're the same age, so no wonder.

446
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:48,690
Not all couples of the same age
are a good match.

447
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:49,867
We're the same age.

448
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,831
Oh for goodness' sake.

449
00:25:56,673 --> 00:25:57,632
Hello. Come in!

450
00:25:57,716 --> 00:25:58,703
Welcome.

451
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:00,352
There are more seats inside.

452
00:26:00,437 --> 00:26:01,912
-Hello!
-Hello.

453
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:04,502
It's good to see how
the neighborhood regained life.

454
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:06,581
We live in a nice neighborhood.

455
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,873
I know.

456
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,237
Do you know why I can't
leave this neighborhood?

457
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:12,662
I don't get the same inspiration
in other neighborhoods..

458
00:26:12,747 --> 00:26:14,065
Maybe you're not a good writer.

459
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,993
Hey.

460
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:17,656
The feng shui is good here.

461
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,284
They used to say great men are made here.

462
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:21,793
You're right.

463
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:28,115
Gukdoo got transferred
to the Gangnam Police Station.

464
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,555
Oh, congratulations.

465
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,364
Bongsoon.

466
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:43,620
I remember.

467
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:48,329
We went on a graduation trip
in our last year of junior high...

468
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:53,852
...and you did a hip-hop dance
with Younghoon from Class Five.

469
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:56,663
Hey! Do you still remember that?

470
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,377
It's time you forget it.
I want to erase it from my memory.

471
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:03,115
How can I forget that? It was hilarious.

472
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:07,443
I knew you were different back then.

473
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,997
You did a hip-hop dance.

474
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:12,097
-Why put a flower in your hair...?
-Stop it.

475
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,792
Do you remember?

476
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:18,937
What?

477
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:24,161
When we ran into each other
at the fountain after gym class..

478
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:28,402
...I said I like women
that are like cosmos flowers.

479
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:32,851
Of course I remember.
How could I not?

480
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:35,832
After I heard you say that...

481
00:27:36,145 --> 00:27:38,915
...I tried to be a girl like cosmos.

482
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:42,665
So I hid my strength.

483
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:45,364
You fool.

484
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,981
You really are a fool.

485
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:55,247
You don't know how others see you.

486
00:27:57,492 --> 00:27:59,678
The cosmos that I was referring to...

487
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:02,722
...was you.

488
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,423
You were so fragile and small.

489
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:15,207
That's how you looked to me.

490
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:22,179
I said that so you'd hear it.

491
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:26,097
Really?

492
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:29,274
I didn't know.

493
00:28:33,731 --> 00:28:34,593
Bongsoon.

494
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:36,151
Yes?

495
00:28:40,726 --> 00:28:44,423
I would have liked you
regardless of your strength.

496
00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:51,728
You were a warm-hearted
and considerate weirdo friend.

497
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:55,137
And I just liked you.

498
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:00,858
We'll be...

499
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,079
...friends...

500
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:13,644
...forever, right?

501
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:18,307
Right.

502
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,834
Bongsoon.

503
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:30,521
Yes?

504
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:32,575
Be happy.

505
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:37,142
Okay. You, too.

506
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:40,368
You be happy, too.

507
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:08,373
The cosmos that
I was referring to was you.

508
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:10,647
I like women that are soft as the cosmos.

509
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:12,116
Someone you want to protect.

510
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,443
I always felt reassured
because you were my friend.

511
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:20,550
We'll be forever friends, right?

512
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:34,366
"Wonderful Gukdoo"

513
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:40,772
"Wonderful Friend Gukdoo"

514
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:53,412
I'm sorry.

515
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,912
About what?

516
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:57,674
About Heeji. It never felt right.

517
00:32:04,316 --> 00:32:05,229
Did you see her off?

518
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:06,147
Yes.

519
00:32:09,856 --> 00:32:12,810
Why didn't you take it further?
Because of me?

520
00:32:26,937 --> 00:32:29,089
You've always known, right?

521
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,030
What?

522
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:31,261
About Bongsoon and I.

523
00:32:31,837 --> 00:32:33,736
-Yes.
-Why didn't you tell me?

524
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,209
You knew, too.

525
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,426
It was so obvious she liked you.
You didn't know?

526
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,763
I didn't know.

527
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:46,631
I liked Bongsoon, too.

528
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:51,603
That's why I didn't know.

529
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:56,407
My feelings were so big...

530
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:59,194
...that I didn't notice hers.

531
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:03,322
Had I told you...

532
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:06,846
...would anything be
different between you two?

533
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:14,670
One more game.

534
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,070
Did Mr. Oh approve this?

535
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:31,006
No, not yet.
He'll decide very soon.

536
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:35,153
I don't think he'll let me in.

537
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:39,150
No, he's not like that.
Business is business.

538
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:42,447
Come in.

539
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:52,182
We have decided...

540
00:33:52,468 --> 00:33:54,171
...that Do Bongsoon will join our team.

541
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:55,876
Everyone on the team agreed.

542
00:33:58,088 --> 00:34:02,181
Your project will be developed
under my leadership.

543
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:05,828
It needs some adjustments
but it's a good project.

544
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:09,223
The female character is
differentiated from existing ones.

545
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:11,421
And that's a big advantage.

546
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:14,282
We'll amend and adjust it
based on the suggestions...

547
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:16,668
...we got after the presentation.

548
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:19,597
-That's it.
-Good. Thank you.

549
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:22,074
Not bad.

550
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:36,822
If he said yes,
it means it'll be successful.

551
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:39,484
-That's right!
-An 80 percent chance for success.

552
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:42,215
He's known as the hawk eye
in this business. He's the one.

553
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,631
-Really?
-Yes!

554
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:46,215
Congratulations, Bongsoon.
This is just the beginning.

555
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:47,436
Thank you.

556
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:50,239
But his twin... Never mind.

557
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,324
Thank you!

558
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:55,694
Oh, yeah!

559
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:59,364
I really don't get this.

560
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,338
I'm a busy person.

561
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:03,930
I've been waiting long enough.
What's taking so long?

562
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,914
The dental hygienist has to see you.

563
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:08,181
Is the dental hygienist a doctor?

564
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:09,721
-No, sir.
-A nurse?

565
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:11,719
-No, sir.
-Then what is she?

566
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:14,857
Like nurses in a hospital,
we have dental hygienists.

567
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:16,434
Oh, you sound so smart.

568
00:35:16,518 --> 00:35:19,672
Okay, good. Let me see
the face of that dental hygienist.

569
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:21,635
Tell her to come out!

570
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,819
"Bong Soonyi"

571
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:25,457
I'm the dental hygienist.

572
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:32,901
Who's the next patient?

573
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,585
Please say, "Ah."

574
00:35:40,895 --> 00:35:42,065
Good.

575
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,323
Lean back, please.

576
00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:05,630
He almost hit us.

577
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:07,631
Who are you?

578
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:09,467
He's good-looking.

579
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,634
Hey, hey, hey!

580
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:16,710
-What's that?
-Look at that.

581
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:18,554
What is he doing?

582
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:20,133
-What is that?
-What?

583
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:23,150
-What's that?
-Advanced technology.

584
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,683
What's that?

585
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:30,298
Hey!

586
00:36:32,939 --> 00:36:34,225
Is this a player kill?

587
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,094
Or a one-on-one PVP?

588
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,068
You rascals.

589
00:36:38,603 --> 00:36:40,839
So you're the boyfriend
of our sister, Bongsoon?

590
00:36:40,924 --> 00:36:42,327
Is it true?

591
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:44,051
Your sister, Bongsoon?

592
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,945
-He has money.
-He seduced her with money.

593
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,279
-She has no money.
-She only had three thousand won.

594
00:36:53,363 --> 00:36:54,226
Eight thousand won.

595
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,971
How are you related to
your sister, Bongsoon?

596
00:36:58,056 --> 00:37:00,363
She's our boss, our mentor.

597
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:01,604
Your mentor?

598
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,529
She's our hope, our light, our hero!

599
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:07,720
The refuge of our soul.

600
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,801
Anyway.

601
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:14,173
Are you going to dump her after
dating her a couple of times?

602
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:15,393
Do you even go to school?

603
00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:17,638
School isn't what matters!

604
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:18,929
-Right.
-It doesn't matter.

605
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:20,508
Then what matters to you?

606
00:37:20,592 --> 00:37:21,425
Well...

607
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,903
Say something.

608
00:37:24,987 --> 00:37:27,859
Go to school and stop
worrying about her love life.

609
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,268
And don't play games too much.

610
00:37:29,352 --> 00:37:31,669
Your moms hate me
because you don't study...

611
00:37:31,754 --> 00:37:33,078
...and only play games.

612
00:37:33,162 --> 00:37:36,168
Are you really the CEO of Ainsoft
or are you just a puppet?

613
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,340
Don't dare to hurt our sister.

614
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,315
-Thank you.
-Food.

615
00:37:46,153 --> 00:37:48,689
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

616
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:50,101
Stop!

617
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:52,137
Answer me!

618
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,788
Promise you won't hurt her!

619
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,666
I don't think you know
who your sister is.

620
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,011
She's not someone I can hurt.

621
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:03,481
Just eat. Eat.

622
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:12,070
Take your time
and order more if you want.

623
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:13,628
It's good!

624
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,598
"Pre-development Team"

625
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,433
What's this?

626
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,935
-"Mr. An"...
-Mr. An.

627
00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:36,474
I was waiting for you until
I left to the Development Team.

628
00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:40,819
I won't forget all the things
you've done for me. Intern Do.

629
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:44,036
Gosh, she's the prettiest
weirdo in the world.

630
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:47,048
"Mr. An"?

631
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:50,375
"Intern Do"? She's screwing me over.

632
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:55,622
Gosh, you're cute.

633
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,344
Don't compare it to this and just...

634
00:39:08,398 --> 00:39:10,099
Don't be so harsh on her.

635
00:39:19,212 --> 00:39:20,491
You'll do a good job.

636
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:36,245
-The loading time got shorter.
-Yeah.

637
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:39,756
The items of the offensive
characters were upgraded.

638
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:41,830
-Yeah.
-Small changes in all characters.

639
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,622
Are the updates
for next week getting ready?

640
00:39:45,706 --> 00:39:47,424
Yes, according to the plans.

641
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,459
"The Jerk: Let's talk"

642
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,694
"The Jerk: Let's talk"

643
00:39:58,757 --> 00:39:59,726
Let's talk.

644
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:06,104
I'm busy.

645
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,640
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

646
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,170
I'm busy. What do you want?

647
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:16,748
That's why I came here.

648
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:20,219
So what is it?

649
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:26,813
I'll be watching you.

650
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:28,954
Watching what?

651
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:33,316
If you hurt Bongsoon...

652
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,562
...I'll kill you.

653
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:47,634
This is so ridiculous
that I can't even laugh.

654
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:50,267
I don't like your disrespectful tone.

655
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,917
I don't care. She's my friend.

656
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:57,803
So make her happy.

657
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:02,468
I really don't like you...

658
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:04,555
...but I'll wait and see.

659
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:07,402
I'll see how good you are to her.

660
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:11,842
You'll give up eventually,
so just mind your own business!

661
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:19,439
Seriously.

662
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:25,272
Bongsoon likes spicy food.

663
00:41:27,086 --> 00:41:28,774
She's allergic to peaches.

664
00:41:29,908 --> 00:41:31,153
She likes baseball.

665
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:33,946
She likes mountains more than beaches.

666
00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:46,442
Oh, right.

667
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,994
If she can't fall asleep...

668
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:51,946
...then get her a book.

669
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,150
It works every time.

670
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:55,913
What the heck?

671
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:02,278
He's a jerk from beginning to end.

672
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,322
I can't find a way to like him.

673
00:42:06,388 --> 00:42:09,343
I know that already!
She likes spicy chicken feet.

674
00:42:09,836 --> 00:42:10,795
Baseball and mountains.

675
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,932
And I can put her to sleep.

676
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:24,896
My dream finally came true.

677
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:27,858
A game inspired by me was developed.

678
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:31,735
I used to hide my strength.

679
00:42:31,907 --> 00:42:36,233
And I wanted to be myself,
at least inside a game.

680
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:40,301
Many things happened
and many things changed.

681
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:45,068
Let's try to lift this.
One, two, three.

682
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:49,902
I won't only be a character in a game.

683
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:56,072
I need everyone's help.
We need to lift this.

684
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:59,256
Let's lift it!
One, two, three!

685
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:02,273
Hey, isn't that Sis?

686
00:43:07,183 --> 00:43:08,597
She lifted the car!

687
00:43:08,682 --> 00:43:10,729
Wow, super power girl!

688
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:33,925
Hey! Bongsoon!

689
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,086
I'm sorry.

690
00:43:43,233 --> 00:43:46,390
Do you know what I hate the most?

691
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:49,796
Being late. Being late to work!

692
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:54,009
We have a flexible working environment...

693
00:43:54,094 --> 00:43:57,435
...to encourage creativity, but!

694
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:03,698
Then people will break rules
and everything will crumble.

695
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:06,650
So I put being punctual
in first place, always.

696
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:08,946
But you're one hour late.

697
00:44:10,745 --> 00:44:14,619
I'm sorry. I couldn't
avoid the circumstances.

698
00:44:16,037 --> 00:44:17,555
I don't take that as an excuse.

699
00:44:19,082 --> 00:44:19,988
Go back to your desk.

700
00:44:26,863 --> 00:44:28,299
Okay, let's take it.

701
00:44:30,912 --> 00:44:31,904
Ta-da!

702
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:32,934
Wow!

703
00:44:33,214 --> 00:44:34,708
It's done!

704
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:37,259
Wow, it looks delicious.

705
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:38,670
Good work with all the cooking.

706
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:42,250
-Drink up. Come on.
-My son in law can even cook.

707
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:44,354
There.

708
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,529
-Thank you.
-Bottoms up.

709
00:44:47,328 --> 00:44:49,895
-Drink it all up.
-There you go.

710
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:53,104
Such a sweetie.

711
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:54,848
Oh, my!

712
00:44:55,455 --> 00:44:57,559
Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Dad.

713
00:44:57,643 --> 00:45:00,112
-Mom, it's for you.
-Okay, son.

714
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:03,191
-Good. Good.
-That looks very tasty.

715
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:05,803
You have a good son.

716
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:09,854
Why are you staring at me?

717
00:45:09,939 --> 00:45:11,795
You wrap one for him.

718
00:45:14,032 --> 00:45:15,006
Do you want it?

719
00:45:22,006 --> 00:45:24,243
-Enjoy, Minhyuk.
-Thanks. You, too.

720
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:25,183
Eat up.

721
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:29,269
We can't leave Kyungsim out.

722
00:45:31,454 --> 00:45:33,935
It's good to see everyone so happy.

723
00:45:34,212 --> 00:45:35,045
What?

724
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:40,349
I want to protect those I love,
so they can always laugh.

725
00:45:41,801 --> 00:45:43,444
I know what you mean, but...

726
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:46,819
...you can't protect everyone.

727
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:49,314
I know.

728
00:45:50,703 --> 00:45:53,590
I can't save the world all by myself...

729
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:57,888
...but I was given back this strength,
so I want to use it for good.

730
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,543
How did I end up loving
such an amazing woman?

731
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:05,255
I told you, I'm a femme hommetale.

732
00:46:06,401 --> 00:46:07,862
Oh, femme hommetale?

733
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,000
Yes, you're fatal.

734
00:46:11,084 --> 00:46:12,791
Yes, I am.

735
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,837
-Bongsoon.
-Yes?

736
00:46:15,762 --> 00:46:17,171
I'm always be on your side.

737
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,104
I know.

738
00:46:20,463 --> 00:46:22,470
I'll protect you, too.

739
00:46:22,768 --> 00:46:24,490
Like that girl in your dungeon.

740
00:46:29,905 --> 00:46:30,990
Who I am?

741
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,073
You?

742
00:46:33,235 --> 00:46:34,465
The strong girl Do Bongsoon.

743
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:36,594
You are outrageously strong.

744
00:46:38,954 --> 00:46:40,773
I told you not to do that.

745
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:44,512
I knew it ever since
we played with the go stones.

746
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:50,065
Rock, paper, scissors!

747
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:24,764
Ever since I made up my mind
to use my strength to do good,

748
00:47:24,956 --> 00:47:27,582
24 hours in a day became too short.

749
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:30,742
Pull out your car!
It's an emergency!

750
00:47:30,826 --> 00:47:32,829
What are you doing?
Pull out your car!

751
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:37,624
What's going on?

752
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:41,637
What's going on?

753
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,271
"An Elephant Escapes the Zoo"

754
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,957
"An Elephant Escapes the Zoo"

755
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,898
"Escaped Elephant Returns in Three Hours"

756
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:02,723
Something came floating from afar.

757
00:48:02,807 --> 00:48:04,987
It was the elephant floating.

758
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:06,843
I thought I was seeing things.

759
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:09,522
But it really was the elephant!

760
00:48:09,607 --> 00:48:12,407
I looked under and saw
someone lifting it up.

761
00:48:12,508 --> 00:48:16,901
It was a woman.
A girl really lifted the elephant.

762
00:48:16,986 --> 00:48:18,579
I saw it with my own eyes.

763
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:20,844
I put on glasses to get a good look.

764
00:48:21,085 --> 00:48:22,973
Where have you been during working hours?

765
00:48:23,058 --> 00:48:24,881
Do you think work is a joke?

766
00:48:24,966 --> 00:48:26,452
Or do you take me as a joke?

767
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,193
How dare you! You!

768
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,831
You keep playing sneaky.

769
00:48:32,491 --> 00:48:35,770
More and more people
started to need my help.

770
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:38,070
Let's see what we have today.

771
00:48:38,155 --> 00:48:39,985
"A Flasher Appears Near a School"

772
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:42,534
That's a good one.

773
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:43,654
Let's tell our sister.

774
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:07,427
I really don't know
why she's always so late.

775
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:08,861
Is work a joke?

776
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,440
I have no idea where she is right now.

777
00:49:12,524 --> 00:49:15,869
She has no respect for me.
I didn't come this far by luck.

778
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,966
You deserve to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

779
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,286
So where has she been?

780
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:24,499
I wouldn't be telling you this
if I knew that. How annoying.

781
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:26,536
It's like she ate dirt on her way here.

782
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:29,948
The other day she had
her hands stained with dirt.

783
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:32,774
Oh, that was when she planted
that uprooted tree.

784
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:34,513
Mr. An!

785
00:49:34,598 --> 00:49:38,209
-You startled me.
-She's making me go crazy!

786
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:40,899
I think she's an alien...

787
00:49:40,984 --> 00:49:44,753
...but she eats human food. And a lot!

788
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:48,741
Her mouth gets big like this
when she eats. Like a monkfish!

789
00:49:48,826 --> 00:49:53,057
She's here now and there later
like some kind of superhero.

790
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:56,907
I can't deal with her anymore.

791
00:49:56,992 --> 00:49:58,693
I'm about to have a mental breakdown.

792
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:00,778
Because I'm...

793
00:50:02,153 --> 00:50:04,370
...worth it!

794
00:50:05,233 --> 00:50:06,066
Gosh!

795
00:50:10,037 --> 00:50:11,061
Listen to me.

796
00:50:12,985 --> 00:50:16,602
She's not on my team anymore.
Excuse me.

797
00:50:25,874 --> 00:50:28,328
The interview I told you about...

798
00:50:30,312 --> 00:50:31,145
Oh.

799
00:50:32,982 --> 00:50:34,832
Hi.

800
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,667
You were let go.

801
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:48,658
Yes.

802
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,111
I don't know what to say.

803
00:50:50,825 --> 00:50:52,556
I never thought I'd come back here.

804
00:50:53,154 --> 00:50:54,190
-Assistant Manager Do?
-Yes?

805
00:50:54,275 --> 00:50:57,131
Oh, no. You're Intern Do again.

806
00:50:57,661 --> 00:50:58,494
Yes.

807
00:50:58,677 --> 00:50:59,577
Are you happy?

808
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,653
Yes, I am.

809
00:51:06,341 --> 00:51:08,388
Drink this and pull yourself together.

810
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,603
Thanks.

811
00:51:12,034 --> 00:51:15,791
Am I supposed to welcome you
or comfort you?

812
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:19,442
I feel at home here.

813
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:23,173
I think being an intern
is the right work for me.

814
00:51:23,262 --> 00:51:27,693
We could do the welcoming party today.

815
00:51:27,862 --> 00:51:30,352
-Just the two of us?
-You have to come.

816
00:51:30,437 --> 00:51:32,436
Or it'll be too obvious you aren't there.

817
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,735
-Mr. Kong, you should come.
-Well, I...

818
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:36,917
I don't feel like welcoming you.

819
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:39,266
Oh, come on.

820
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,085
That's enough. You'll end up
losing your job as intern, too.

821
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:43,878
What if I lose that job?

822
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:48,345
Should I go back to being your bodyguard?

823
00:51:48,581 --> 00:51:50,343
Can I?

824
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,676
Gosh.

825
00:51:53,437 --> 00:51:55,657
I can't fire you.
What do I do with you?

826
00:51:55,742 --> 00:51:56,626
What will you do?

827
00:51:57,194 --> 00:51:59,841
Will you fire me? You won't.

828
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:02,132
Don't smile like that.

829
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:03,665
Then should I cry?

830
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,161
Oh, I'm so sad.

831
00:52:05,245 --> 00:52:06,504
Why are you so cute today?

832
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:10,960
What do I do with you?
My goodness!

833
00:52:11,592 --> 00:52:13,230
Should I start as a bodyguard again?

834
00:52:13,555 --> 00:52:15,540
What do we do today?

835
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:18,410
Just ask me to leave.

836
00:52:19,024 --> 00:52:20,636
Why are you dressed up so nicely?

837
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,763
I'm leaving.

838
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,045
Your hair looks pretty, too.
Why are you so pretty?

839
00:52:24,129 --> 00:52:25,934
You're taking it too far.

840
00:52:26,022 --> 00:52:26,854
Is it done?

841
00:52:26,938 --> 00:52:28,019
Should we go outside?

842
00:52:28,255 --> 00:52:29,510
That sounds fun!

843
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,781
Awesome.

844
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:41,239
I blame myself for getting fired.

845
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,192
Mr. Kong.

846
00:52:45,014 --> 00:52:47,453
Mr. An, see you again.

847
00:52:47,537 --> 00:52:49,345
Okay, Intern Do. Good job.

848
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,118
-See you tomorrow.
-Get home safely.

849
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:52,035
Yes, Sir.

850
00:52:58,171 --> 00:52:59,162
Min-min!

851
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:03,766
I want chicken.

852
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:04,884
-Chicken?
-Yes, chicken!

853
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:06,846
-Let's go to the movies, too.
-Okay, what movie?

854
00:53:07,263 --> 00:53:12,339
She treats him so differently
when they're not at work.

855
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:13,587
My goodness.

856
00:53:13,672 --> 00:53:15,811
That's why people date.

857
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,227
They're enjoying themselves.
I envy them.

858
00:53:20,311 --> 00:53:22,201
You should meet someone nice.

859
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:26,164
I don't date co-workers.
It feels like incest.

860
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:27,228
Jeez!

861
00:53:27,313 --> 00:53:28,751
Don't be attracted to me.

862
00:53:28,835 --> 00:53:30,492
What are you talking about?

863
00:53:30,727 --> 00:53:33,310
I really like women!

864
00:53:33,915 --> 00:53:35,836
Stop overreacting!

865
00:53:36,665 --> 00:53:41,289
You always go overboard.
What? Why?

866
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:43,152
Do you want me to
talk down to you at work?

867
00:53:43,236 --> 00:53:46,524
Why do you do this to me?

868
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:53,134
Oh Dolpyo and Mr. Kong are dating!

869
00:53:53,259 --> 00:53:56,308
Catch me if you can!

870
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:09,400
-What's my daughter doing?
-Dad.

871
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:10,608
Writing in your journal?

872
00:54:12,722 --> 00:54:14,392
Yes, it's part of my job.

873
00:54:14,476 --> 00:54:16,194
Don't overwork yourself.

874
00:54:16,279 --> 00:54:18,660
You write in it every day.
Take it easy.

875
00:54:19,243 --> 00:54:21,325
-Okay.
-Always be careful.

876
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,946
-Okay.
-Bongsoon.

877
00:54:23,031 --> 00:54:23,864
Yes?

878
00:54:24,793 --> 00:54:25,741
I...

879
00:54:27,574 --> 00:54:28,580
...like Mr. An.

880
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,344
I don't like the fact...

881
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:35,182
...that another man loves you
and cares for you as much as I do.

882
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:38,542
But what can I do?

883
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,679
If that man is Mr. An...

884
00:54:43,577 --> 00:54:45,299
...I can be generous and share.

885
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,276
Dad.

886
00:54:47,361 --> 00:54:48,390
Come here.

887
00:54:48,474 --> 00:54:49,695
My little girl.

888
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:53,800
When did you grow up so quickly?

889
00:54:56,647 --> 00:54:58,070
-Bongsoon.
-Yes?

890
00:54:58,321 --> 00:54:59,262
Now...

891
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,666
...I feel at ease.

892
00:55:05,628 --> 00:55:07,016
You can spread your wings now.

893
00:55:08,474 --> 00:55:10,055
And fly high.

894
00:55:11,784 --> 00:55:13,658
Do everything you wanted to do.

895
00:55:16,806 --> 00:55:18,121
Thanks, Dad.

896
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:20,243
I'm thankful too.

897
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:24,482
Thank you.

898
00:55:38,609 --> 00:55:39,780
I'm asking you out on a date.

899
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:41,545
From Prince Min-min.

900
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:48,069
Should we go on a date, Prince Min-min?

901
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:54,958
Doesn't he cringe
calling himself a prince?

902
00:55:55,192 --> 00:55:58,956
Though I know he loves to praise himself.

903
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:03,936
I'll put up with it
since he's so adorable.

904
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,057
It's hard, isn't it?

905
00:56:10,142 --> 00:56:11,190
No, it's not.

906
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,711
What do you mean?

907
00:56:17,095 --> 00:56:19,083
-Sorry!
-That's okay.

908
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:23,689
That scared me. Are you okay?

909
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,334
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

910
00:56:25,476 --> 00:56:26,890
Wow!

911
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:29,186
It looks like snow.

912
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,054
It does.

913
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:34,558
Five centimeters per second.

914
00:56:35,615 --> 00:56:37,167
That's the speed they fall.

915
00:56:37,649 --> 00:56:38,794
I saw it in a movie.

916
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:44,186
I wonder at what speed
my heart ran to you.

917
00:56:47,214 --> 00:56:50,874
Since when did you like me?

918
00:56:52,334 --> 00:56:53,572
From the moment I saw you.

919
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:00,217
At the police station.

920
00:57:06,279 --> 00:57:07,825
You are one of a kind.

921
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:15,933
How could you wait for so long?

922
00:57:17,954 --> 00:57:20,737
I waited until you fully came to me.

923
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:22,673
But...

924
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:27,089
...I was happy while waiting.

925
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:30,279
And I was confident.

926
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:33,676
We were meant to be together.

927
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:47,947
-Let's come back next year.
-Okay.

928
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:50,945
And the year after that,
and the year after that.

929
00:57:53,695 --> 00:57:57,548
Let's come back here together
even after ten years.

930
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:05,582
When I asked you
to go away on the rooftop...

931
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:10,345
...you said you wouldn't leave me.
You had something to tell me.

932
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,437
What was it?

933
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:29,711
I don't think I can live
one moment without you.

934
00:58:40,493 --> 00:58:42,123
Let's stay together forever.

935
00:59:52,129 --> 00:59:54,873
What do I do?
You look so pretty today.

936
00:59:55,132 --> 00:59:56,505
I'm almost blinded.

937
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,340
-Bongsoon!
-Bongsoon, we're here.

938
00:59:59,425 --> 01:00:01,683
Mom! Dad!

939
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:03,479
-We're here.
-Hello.

940
01:00:03,564 --> 01:00:07,393
Oh, you're beautiful.
Congratulations.

941
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,072
You look very nice.

942
01:00:09,611 --> 01:00:11,139
-Thanks.
-Congratulations.

943
01:00:18,836 --> 01:00:21,450
Oh, my goodness.
How did he get so skinny?

944
01:00:22,117 --> 01:00:23,394
Take the photo quickly.

945
01:00:27,668 --> 01:00:29,664
What? She's too beautiful.

946
01:00:30,366 --> 01:00:32,225
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

947
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:34,476
-Congratulations.
-It's honest money.

948
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,715
-Not now, sir.
-Not now?

949
01:00:45,855 --> 01:00:46,717
Bongsoon.

950
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:48,078
Hey.

951
01:00:53,758 --> 01:00:54,615
You look pretty today.

952
01:00:54,699 --> 01:00:56,153
"You look pretty today"?

953
01:00:57,993 --> 01:00:58,826
Congratulations.

954
01:01:06,506 --> 01:01:07,424
Be good to her.

955
01:02:36,393 --> 01:02:37,355
You're so thin.

956
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:40,890
Hey! What are you doing?

957
01:02:51,753 --> 01:02:53,089
No!

958
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:56,273
Stop! No!

959
01:03:17,866 --> 01:03:22,793
My cool, generous Buddha.

960
01:03:23,228 --> 01:03:26,478
Thank you for all your hard work.

961
01:03:27,711 --> 01:03:31,562
I have one last thing to ask.

962
01:03:32,037 --> 01:03:36,751
Please help my Bongsoon to have a son.

963
01:03:36,886 --> 01:03:39,483
So that my sweet son-in-law...

964
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:44,228
...can sleep without worries.

965
01:03:44,464 --> 01:03:49,305
I don't believe in carrying on
the genes in our family.

966
01:03:49,513 --> 01:03:55,165
Please help them have sons
so they enjoy an easier life.

967
01:04:04,003 --> 01:04:05,577
No news yet?

968
01:04:05,662 --> 01:04:06,979
You're here.

969
01:04:07,241 --> 01:04:09,242
Not yet. I hope she's fine.

970
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:10,830
Why aren't they telling us anything?

971
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:12,304
Ma'am, are you sure it's a boy?

972
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:14,033
Yes, it's a boy.

973
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:17,396
He's out!

974
01:04:18,726 --> 01:04:19,616
Bongsoon!

975
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:31,284
What's wrong with having twin girls?

976
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:33,804
"Daddy of twin girls."
Rolls right off the tongue.

977
01:04:34,643 --> 01:04:36,831
I'm just so happy.

978
01:04:40,904 --> 01:04:42,412
I have to do something.

979
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,514
What was it?

980
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:46,980
A nanny.

981
01:04:47,064 --> 01:04:48,758
Right, a nanny.

982
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:50,441
You know, a baby...

983
01:04:50,906 --> 01:04:53,456
-A babysitter.
-Yes, babysitter!

984
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:55,677
This is serious.

985
01:04:56,061 --> 01:04:59,250
According to feng shui,
odd is here and even is there.

986
01:04:59,335 --> 01:05:00,753
Feng shui! Right!

987
01:05:00,837 --> 01:05:01,968
You checked that?

988
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:03,922
Hey, if that's the case...

989
01:05:04,338 --> 01:05:05,820
Mr. An, what's going on?

990
01:05:05,905 --> 01:05:08,595
-Where's should the door go?
-The door should here.

991
01:05:09,955 --> 01:05:11,226
Everything's fine here!

992
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:12,795
Yes. What?

993
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:16,003
Babies? Twins?

994
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,337
What? Bongsoon's babies?

995
01:05:19,556 --> 01:05:22,018
Peekaboo!

996
01:05:22,203 --> 01:05:23,867
Peekaboo!

997
01:05:24,098 --> 01:05:26,111
Please, sleep. Will you?

998
01:05:26,196 --> 01:05:28,552
You didn't like the milk?

999
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:31,015
I'll feed you milk...

1000
01:05:39,347 --> 01:05:42,642
Mr. An, I can't do this anymore!

1001
01:05:42,726 --> 01:05:46,706
These babies hit us
and it's just too painful.

1002
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:48,378
I can't do this either.

1003
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:51,120
I'd rather go to a gang
fight with my boys.

1004
01:05:51,408 --> 01:05:52,577
Good luck, then.

1005
01:05:52,766 --> 01:05:53,866
You'll need it.

1006
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:58,759
They had two liters of formula earlier.

1007
01:06:00,629 --> 01:06:01,616
But wait...

1008
01:06:10,987 --> 01:06:13,102
Hello, my princesses.

1009
01:06:14,577 --> 01:06:17,340
Do you want milk?
Daddy will feed you.

1010
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:23,286
Say, "Ah."

1011
01:06:24,488 --> 01:06:26,712
Oh, my little girl.

1012
01:06:42,188 --> 01:06:43,575
That tank is floating.

1013
01:06:46,105 --> 01:06:47,118
What's going on there?

1014
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,047
Let's go and check.

1015
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:04,450
Don't call me when I'm working.

1016
01:07:04,985 --> 01:07:08,669
The nannies ran away again.
What do I do?

1017
01:07:08,754 --> 01:07:09,648
What?

1018
01:07:11,043 --> 01:07:13,572
What about me?

1019
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,067
Gosh!

1020
01:07:51,623 --> 01:07:54,951
The world still needs someone
that can stand up against evil.

1021
01:07:55,165 --> 01:07:58,479
So that my kids
can live in a better world.

1022
01:07:58,563 --> 01:08:02,169
News flash. A terrorist took
hostages in a trade center...

1023
01:08:02,254 --> 01:08:04,015
...where an international convention
is being held.

1024
01:08:04,099 --> 01:08:06,632
The police are trying to negotiate.

1025
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:14,765
Here I come.
I'm strong woman Do Bongsoon!

1026
01:08:15,005 --> 01:08:16,522
Yes!

1027
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,555
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

1028
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,412
Who is she? She's so sexy.

1029
01:08:52,486 --> 01:08:53,997
Do you offer stop motions?

1030
01:08:57,291 --> 01:09:00,811
I'm going to take your butt away!

1031
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,520
What are you? An alien?

1032
01:09:04,156 --> 01:09:04,989
-Bongsoon.

1033
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,339
-Yes?

1034
01:09:07,066 --> 01:09:08,001
Let's go now.

1035
01:09:10,456 --> 01:09:12,020
Are you saying that I'm King Kong?

1036
01:09:12,105 --> 01:09:15,210
A very special King Kong.
A peanut-like King Kong.

1037
01:09:18,553 --> 01:09:20,689
Why are we friends?

1038
01:09:20,836 --> 01:09:24,490
I think a crush has an expiration date.

1039
01:09:24,596 --> 01:09:30,400
But that day, he came
one step closer to me.

1040
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:34,650
Marry him.

1041
01:09:34,734 --> 01:09:36,629
Knock him down. Make him drink.

1042
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,321
He's so dashing!

1043
01:09:41,496 --> 01:09:43,835
Intern Do!

1044
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:47,054
Reveal your identity!

1045
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,063
You're like a peanut,
so I can put you in here.

1046
01:09:52,466 --> 01:09:54,556
But it seems like I'm not in your heart.

1047
01:09:55,978 --> 01:09:56,925
You are.

1048
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,682
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

1049
01:10:05,771 --> 01:10:07,136
I missed you.

1050
01:10:07,731 --> 01:10:10,221
I thought you were an angel
my mom sent from heaven.

1051
01:10:11,046 --> 01:10:12,635
And it was you.

1052
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,029
Then that's...

1053
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:17,828
Super Bongssuni saves Prince Min-min.

1054
01:10:17,912 --> 01:10:21,219
They have a happy ending.

1055
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:23,906
Happily ever after.
