1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,309
Suspect of the serial kidnapping
in Dobong-dong was arrested recently.

2
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:09,706
A total of three women
got kidnapped in this area...

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,120
...following a murder.

4
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:14,705
Amidst all that, a fourth woman
was kidnapped last night...

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,895
...shocking the neighbors.

6
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:21,472
-The special investigation unit...
-They caught him.

7
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:25,376
-...caught the criminal.
-There he is.

8
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:27,369
It's not him.

9
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:31,971
The man with the voice
I heard is the criminal.

10
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,859
She listened to the recorded
voice of Kim Janghyeon.

11
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,562
This is the identity
of the man they caught.

12
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:40,149
Take a look!

13
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:46,833
He stalked the kidnapped
college student for six months.

14
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:49,223
Then he's just the student's stalker.

15
00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:51,034
This man didn't kidnap the other women.

16
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,031
The stalker that was arrested,
claimed that he kidnapped...

17
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:59,134
...the other missing
women from this region.

18
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,620
The police are investigating,
whether his claims are true.

19
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:06,402
The police said,
that the arrested man, Jo...

20
00:01:07,803 --> 00:01:10,390
How dare he take credit for what I did.

21
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,676
Don't start investigating on your own.

22
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,862
Hey, look at that!

23
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:32,849
Gukdoo, is his name Kim Janghyeon?

24
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:35,249
-Tell me where he is.
-For what?

25
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:38,367
-Are you going to go there?
-Just tell me.

26
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:42,343
No. That's the police's job.
Don't meddle with it.

27
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:44,038
Please. Tell me.

28
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:46,832
No! Go home. I'll take you.

29
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:49,919
No, I'm fine. I'm not going home.

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,611
Are you...

31
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:55,318
...going to the hospital he's at?

32
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,223
-Yes.
-As his bodyguard?

33
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,718
Or because you feel guilty
he got hurt because of you?

34
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,020
Or...

35
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:07,516
Do you really have to?

36
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,508
Do you have to be with him?

37
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,518
You don't have to do this.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,613
I'll do it.

39
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:23,219
I think I should.

40
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:37,102
The man that the police caught
is not the true criminal.

41
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:39,713
He might kidnap another girl.

42
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,627
Kim Janghyeon...

43
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,722
Where is she?

44
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,020
I'm back.

45
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,012
-Good job.
-Have you eaten?

46
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:58,312
They caught the criminal.
No more reasons to meet Gukdoo.

47
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,414
Well.

48
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:01,613
-He's not the one.
-What?

49
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,415
He's not the true kidnapper.

50
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,113
Now you're a cop?

51
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,400
-Doesn't it hurt?
-It hurts.

52
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,407
But this is better than you getting hurt.

53
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:15,121
Do you...

54
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:19,518
...still like Gukdoo?

55
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:26,715
I really don't get it.
When you have a man like me...

56
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:33,129
Is this what you're thinking?
Something like this.

57
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,618
How can such a perfect guy
who is of such noble character...

58
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,713
...like someone like me?

59
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:43,519
It's impossible. He's too good for me.

60
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,715
-Is that it?
-You're kidding me.

61
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:50,405
I thought you liked men.

62
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:53,510
-Do you not?
-My goodness.

63
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,411
You wanted to work for Ainsoft, correct?

64
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,705
-Yes.
-Look.

65
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,502
I don't have time to date women
if I want to run a company,

66
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,812
that people like you
dream of getting hired at.

67
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:10,615
Then why didn't you deny such claims?

68
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:12,814
That's called noise marketing.

69
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:16,315
I'm not sure if you'll
understand, if I tell you...

70
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:17,926
...that was also part
of my business strategy.

71
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,029
Your brain circuit is too
simple to understand that.

72
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:23,529
-You don't have to understand.
-Doesn't it hurt to talk so much?

73
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:27,316
Oh, right.
No wonder I was feeling pain.

74
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:33,006
So anyway, I'll warp up
everything I need to say to you.

75
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:34,005
I...

76
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,518
...love women.

77
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:38,415
I go crazy for women.

78
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,121
Why do you look at me like that?

79
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:51,132
I don't like this hotel robe.

80
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:54,921
You know I hate everything
that's too standard.

81
00:04:55,021 --> 00:05:00,016
I'm sure you do.
You can't be like others.

82
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:04,630
Did you take that as a compliment?

83
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:09,716
Did you just imitate me?
That's not how I say it.

84
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:10,930
Are you crazy?

85
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,927
-How dare you.
-I just tried.

86
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:17,720
That's not how you say it.

87
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,521
Did you take that as a compliment?

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,616
-That's how you say it.
-You should be so proud.

89
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:28,219
We used all our resources
in staking out Janghyeon.

90
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,142
My goodness.

91
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:34,227
The superintendent nagged
at me the entire night...

92
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,124
...for our poor performance.

93
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,622
You should investigate
another case. Let it go.

94
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:48,424
I need a warrant, sir.
I must investigate this.

95
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,012
-Your friend heard wrong.
-No, she didn't.

96
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:55,814
You fool. The suspect confessed.

97
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:58,806
Where are the other victims, then?

98
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:03,102
I know what you want to say!
He hasn't told them yet.

99
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:07,307
He can't. He didn't do it.

100
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:09,601
Why are you doing this?

101
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:14,197
I'll go by myself.
I understand your position.

102
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:17,500
-I'll investigate on my own.
-What?

103
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:18,801
If I must lose my badge,

104
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:21,310
I'll lose it alone.

105
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,509
You idiot! That's not how it works!

106
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,594
If you cause trouble,
I have to answer for you!

107
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:30,507
Hey! You fool!

108
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:32,607
That cheeky monkey.

109
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:34,892
Yeah,

110
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:37,901
you do what you have to do.

111
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:39,503
Please do so.

112
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:46,906
Gosh. Janghyeon.

113
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:50,715
Janghyeon...

114
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,403
What's the address?

115
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:56,308
Hey, Do Bongsoon.

116
00:06:57,093 --> 00:06:58,205
Kim Janghyeon...

117
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,224
-Hey!
-What? What do you need?

118
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:08,627
Put your all into taking care of me.
Not just out of obligation.

119
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,922
By any chance...

120
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:13,724
Can you run a background
check on someone?

121
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:14,620
Who?

122
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:17,932
-That criminal?
-How did you know?

123
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,241
How do you think I knew?
It's so amazing, right?

124
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:25,149
You stay here and don't move.
You think you're Detective Conan.

125
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:28,535
-By the way, I need to go home.
-Why?

126
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,033
I know it's absurd that in such a
situation, I'm worried about my hygiene.

127
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:38,046
But a caretaker needs
a great deal of things.

128
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,247
I'll go home and be right back.

129
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:44,235
And I'm quite a clean person.

130
00:07:45,646 --> 00:07:46,432
I'll...

131
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:48,646
...be right back, okay?

132
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:52,550
Okay! But don't go anywhere else.

133
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:54,551
Don't go around your neighborhood, okay?

134
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:57,154
-Okay!
-Wait, before you leave...

135
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:59,055
Help me wash my face.

136
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,960
-Wash your face?
-You see...

137
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,352
Okay, I got it.

138
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,546
-I can't do it.
-Okay, okay.

139
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,555
Help me.

140
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:20,051
That's it.

141
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:26,087
I will have my revenge.

142
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:30,199
Forget it! You're not cut out for this!

143
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:31,794
All we can do is start a new business!

144
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:35,294
We were beaten up!
We can't just give up like this!

145
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:38,408
Right, we can't give up. We can do this.

146
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:40,494
I'm sure we can if we try harder.

147
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:44,094
My best asset was my face.

148
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:46,517
Do you know what I went through...

149
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:49,912
...to make my face as pretty as this?

150
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,840
They said it's too pretty.
That it's not manly enough.

151
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:02,623
-That I'm too cute.
-It's swollen. Freaking swollen.

152
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:09,821
Welcome!

153
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,865
Detective, what brings you here?

154
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:17,159
Did you have breakfast?

155
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:23,956
Are you happy they think
they caught the criminal?

156
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:27,063
You think heaven is on your side.

157
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:32,365
I don't think he's the one, either.

158
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:34,764
You sensed it, too.

159
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:39,375
Where are they? Where are the victims?

160
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:41,469
Where are the women?

161
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:47,543
Did you kill them?

162
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:51,250
You didn't. Forget it.

163
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:55,650
Don't do that to women like a coward.
Fight me.

164
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:56,959
Isn't that more fair?

165
00:09:57,044 --> 00:09:59,348
All I did was cooperate with the police.

166
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:02,440
-Why are you doing this to me?
-You scum!

167
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,321
You scum!

168
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:18,325
Size 295 is rare.

169
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:25,529
Help me! A cop is trying to kill me!

170
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,533
What are you doing?

171
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,636
Call the police!

172
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:33,144
Tell them a cop is beating me up!

173
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:46,648
-Call the police!
-Yes, sir.

174
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:52,753
What are you? A mobster?

175
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:12,444
Sorry.

176
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:15,753
Sorry. Sorry.

177
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,730
Mr. Kong, it's me. I need you here now.

178
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:10,126
Okay.

179
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:20,889
Jo, the suspect of the kidnapping
incident of Dobong-dong denied...

180
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:25,010
...the kidnapping of the three
women and the murder of one...

181
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,694
...that occurred before
the stalking of Ms. Oh.

182
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:41,535
Assign Bongsoon to the development team.

183
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,336
I already talked to HR.

184
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:46,626
I thought you would do that
after getting out of the hospital.

185
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,721
-So it means I'm leaving tomorrow.
-Already?

186
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,818
I don't know what she might do,
if I leave her alone like this.

187
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:55,024
I'll tie her to the office,
so she won't go around.

188
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,307
-Oh, okay.
-She's not coming back. See?

189
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:58,402
She didn't even call me.

190
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:01,814
I'll call her, and inform her
that she's been reassigned.

191
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,622
Yes, do that.

192
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:06,723
-Don't say I'm being discharged.
-Got it.

193
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:10,615
By the way, sir.

194
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:14,434
-To which development team, sir?
-What?

195
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,433
-Which team?
-Yes.

196
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,125
"Serial Kidnapper of Dovong-dong caught.
Investigation Moving on Quickly?"

197
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,529
"Information on first victim.
Information on second victim."

198
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,345
What's this?

199
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,942
"Fan Cafe for the Strong Sister"

200
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:45,831
Jeez! What? Are they crazy?
I don't believe this!

201
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:48,527
-Hey.
-Hi.

202
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:51,027
-Are you going to the hospital?
-Yes.

203
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:57,526
I'm with your mom.

204
00:13:57,617 --> 00:14:01,714
-What do you mean?
-I support Mr. An to be with you.

205
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:06,117
Don't you be like this, too.

206
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,823
I'm confused.

207
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:12,825
-Confused?
-Anyway, I have to go.

208
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,034
Don't leave the house.
They didn't catch the guy yet.

209
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,956
Hello? Hi, Mr. Kong.

210
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:32,469
Really? I've been officially transferred?

211
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,282
Oh, thank you!

212
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:41,582
Oh, I'm so moved right now.

213
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:45,567
Okay, bye. Thanks!

214
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,951
Kyungshim, I finally got
a permanent job at Ainsoft!

215
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,346
-Bongsoon.
-Sorry, sorry.

216
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:57,536
It's about time for her to call.

217
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:03,232
Five, four, three, two, one.

218
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:05,740
There.

219
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:09,020
I know you too well.

220
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:11,622
-Hello?
-Mr. An.

221
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:17,937
-Thank you so, so much.
-Okay. A promise is a promise.

222
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:22,542
I'll work really hard.
I'll work myself to the bone.

223
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,438
-You do that.
-What are you doing?

224
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,417
What else? I'm waiting for you.

225
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,029
I'll be there soon.

226
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:35,718
Oh, but if I have to go to work tomorrow,
I would come back...

227
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:39,624
...very late at night
from the hospital, so...

228
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,235
That's your problem.

229
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,030
My friend says
you'd let me stay home.

230
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:50,128
That I can't go there,
if I have to go to work tomorrow.

231
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:55,534
Kyungshim says you wouldn't
ask me something like that.

232
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:58,341
Anyway, I'll head out right now.

233
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:00,437
Gosh, I'll be really tired tomorrow.

234
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:03,940
No. You don't need to come over.
Just stay home tonight.

235
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:08,552
Oh, no. Why did you say that?
I can't do that. I'm leaving right now.

236
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:10,246
No, no. Don't come.

237
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:13,349
I don't know what you have to do
to get ready for work, but anyway.

238
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:16,460
If something were to go wrong,
my stitches would just burst.

239
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:22,157
You know what to do. Bye.

240
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:25,147
-Mr. An!
-What?

241
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:27,353
I respect you.

242
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,107
Yes! I got the job!

243
00:16:42,212 --> 00:16:45,210
What should I wear tomorrow?

244
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,718
The witness reported
this video to internal audit.

245
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,716
You're the team with
the worst performance.

246
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:57,201
Not only do you investigate
a case you were told not to,

247
00:16:57,286 --> 00:16:59,207
but you also beat up a witness?

248
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,199
It's not like the old days!

249
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:04,688
If this video spreads through
the internet, I lose my job!

250
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:07,997
Where is In Gukdoo? Where is he?

251
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:11,270
Sir,

252
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,080
let me explain.

253
00:17:16,198 --> 00:17:18,692
He had his reasons.

254
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:23,191
The special unit said the guy is
not connected to the other cases.

255
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,801
-If you let us investigate...
-Shut up!

256
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:29,302
Use your brain.

257
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,690
Why would the criminal come
and give a statement to the cops,

258
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,500
that are in charge of the case?
Does that make any sense?

259
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,302
And the shoe size is 270.

260
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,912
Even a kid would know he's not the one.

261
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,015
In Gukdoo will be punished.

262
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,018
He's out of the Crime Squad!

263
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:47,503
He needs a good lesson
to get back to his senses.

264
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:05,189
-Hey, Gukdoo.
-Lieutenant In!

265
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:08,395
Hey! Where are you going now?

266
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:11,899
-He's just too young...
-Look at him.

267
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:14,193
Stunning mutiny.
He has always been like that.

268
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:19,286
I'm impressed.
Team Three, you're the best!

269
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:23,599
Sir! What are you doing?

270
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:24,996
Let go.

271
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:28,788
Detective! What are you doing?

272
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:31,708
Your boss kidnapped women!

273
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,101
Where are the women?

274
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:37,115
What on earth are you talking about?

275
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,909
Under Criminal Law Clause 151,
you can be sentenced...

276
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:41,916
...up to three years in prison
for misprision of felony.

277
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,909
Don't stop me.

278
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:48,005
But, detective, you can't do this!

279
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:53,375
-What's your problem?
-Let go!

280
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:54,470
Detective!

281
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:58,573
We tend to meet quite often.

282
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:05,361
Hey! You shouldn't do
this on private property.

283
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:09,983
You scum.

284
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,610
What? You'll beat me up again?

285
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,991
Gukdoo, no!

286
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,482
Let's get out of here. Let's go. Take him.

287
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,989
-You scum!
-Calm down, please!

288
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:31,276
-Calm down!
-I quit!

289
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,083
Stop this. Don't try to dissuade me.

290
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:37,582
-We're not trying to.
-We think you're right.

291
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:39,385
That play,
"Bluebeard and His Seven Brides."

292
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:41,799
The director and the
actors recognized his face.

293
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:43,793
He saw the play ten times.

294
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:48,702
He liked that play too much.
You get what I mean.

295
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,615
Then take him to the station
and search the premises!

296
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,905
Yes, we'd like to do that, too!

297
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:56,207
But it's not our case.
We can't get a warrant.

298
00:19:56,525 --> 00:19:59,318
The Chief wants you back.
You can't quit over this.

299
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:00,713
You can't always act on your own!

300
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:04,708
Don't be so stubborn
and come to work tomorrow.

301
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:06,804
We'll discuss about it tomorrow.

302
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,807
♪Permanent employee♪ 

303
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:17,892
♪Permanent employee from tomorrow♪ 

304
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:20,388
♪Yes, I got the permanent job!♪ 

305
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:23,098
Permanent, permanent.

306
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:26,289
♪Permanent employee from tomorrow!♪ 

307
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:29,284
Yes, I did it.
I'm a permanent employee.

308
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:31,991
-Aren't you going to the hospital?
-Well, mom.

309
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:39,077
My kind boss let me stay home
since I have to work tomorrow.

310
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:42,775
-Then who's looking after him?
-I don't know. He must be alone.

311
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:46,783
He shouldn't be left alone.

312
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:50,084
He feels lonely easily
though he doesn't show it.

313
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:52,482
-I think I should visit him.
-Forget it!

314
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,276
You stay home.

315
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,078
Mom, but...

316
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:00,175
Okay. Say, "Ah."

317
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:06,761
I asked...

318
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,162
...Bonggi, and he said
you don't need to fast anymore.

319
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:14,182
Spicy chicken feet is
Bongsoon's favorite dish.

320
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:17,174
I don't understand why
young people like this so much.

321
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,569
Say, "Ah."

322
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:23,349
Thanks.

323
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,940
You're leaving tomorrow?

324
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:30,448
-What?
-Really? You're leaving already?

325
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:34,727
Yes, it doesn't hurt much,
and I have work to do.

326
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:38,140
Mom, you can't feed him that
while wearing medical gloves.

327
00:21:38,228 --> 00:21:40,940
They feel like your second skin.

328
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:43,328
-Do you want more, Mr. An?
-No thanks.

329
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,523
Oh, please don't refuse.

330
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:48,729
Come on. Say, "Ah."

331
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:51,355
I like how you enjoy it.

332
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,621
Do you want water?

333
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:04,320
Wait. I'll be right back.

334
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,734
Excuse me. It's fine
for your mother to go home.

335
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:15,507
-Tell her to go home.
-I can't tell her.

336
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:19,007
-She never listens.
-Then what?

337
00:22:25,497 --> 00:22:26,398
It's too sour.

338
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,600
My goodness.

339
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:37,095
Your face looks like old rags.

340
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:39,603
Well...

341
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:43,310
What brought you here this time?

342
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:47,707
My daughter got a permanent job
at Ainsoft so she starts tomorrow.

343
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,314
-I came in her place.
-A permanent job?

344
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:55,995
If I had beat you instead,
you wouldn't look like this.

345
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,511
Let me see.
My goodness.

346
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:01,702
-Look at you.
-It hurts!

347
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:04,018
See? Why do you do bad things?

348
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:08,604
She beat up too many of my boys.

349
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:11,997
All we wanted was to recover our honor,

350
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,695
but that rather worked against us.

351
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:15,989
I am truly sorry.

352
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:19,996
I never gave orders to use any weapon.

353
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,195
Whatever. I heard everything.

354
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,708
Your face looks creepy.

355
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:27,908
Like the head of a pig that's
been boiled two weeks ago.

356
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:29,598
What? Pig?

357
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,797
-Where does it hurt the most?
-My eyes, actually.

358
00:23:32,896 --> 00:23:37,726
I can't feel if they're
actually open or closed.

359
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:43,025
I can hardly recognize your face.

360
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,604
Where are you?

361
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,397
Oh, my gosh.

362
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,682
So all these men got
beaten up by my daughter?

363
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:56,484
And they're eating now? Gosh.

364
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:01,082
Oh, the looks of you.

365
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,176
How embarrassing.

366
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:12,184
Those pigs.

367
00:24:28,362 --> 00:24:30,769
Oh, he's so pretty.

368
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,271
Oh, Bongsoon.

369
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:47,391
Oh, Romeo. Romeo.

370
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:50,681
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

371
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,490
-Deny thy father.
-Romeo!

372
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,386
And refuse thy name.

373
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:58,887
-Where?
-Or, if thou wilt not...

374
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,484
...but be sworn...

375
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:04,572
What...

376
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:09,770
Romeo!

377
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:15,568
-Romeo, doff thy name.
-What the heck? Whatever.

378
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:18,685
Romeo!

379
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:21,788
-Juliet!
-Romeo?

380
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,471
-Yes.
-Korean?

381
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:24,566
Yes, why?

382
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,566
-Do you like women?
-Of course. I go crazy for women.

383
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,088
Look how plump they got.

384
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:01,372
Hey, Bongbong.

385
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,979
Are you having...

386
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:07,479
...sexy dreams lately?

387
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,568
I have to go to work.

388
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,308
-I'll take that.
-Okay.

389
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:11,237
Congratulations on your new job!

390
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:33,463
Oh, my.

391
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:38,357
You left the hospital already?
Don't you need more treatment?

392
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:40,151
Well, I...

393
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:43,062
I didn't have a choice.

394
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:46,855
It was actually more of an escape.

395
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:48,163
-What?
-Anyway.

396
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:52,671
Congratulations, for getting the job
on Ainsoft's Development Team.

397
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,362
Thank you.

398
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,151
What's this?

399
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:09,342
-Open it.
-Oh, you didn't have to.

400
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,145
Wow!

401
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:34,976
Work hard. I'll be watching you.

402
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:37,460
-The bag is your present.
-Thanks.

403
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:39,468
When did you get this photo?

404
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,749
I used the photo you
submitted with your resume.

405
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,753
I can do a really good job.
I'll really do my best.

406
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,750
-I look forward to it.
-By the way, where's my desk?

407
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:54,954
-To which team do I go?
-What?

408
00:28:57,334 --> 00:29:00,631
Anyway, do a good job.
If you do foolish things,

409
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:02,330
you'll get fired, understand?

410
00:29:02,928 --> 00:29:03,717
Yes, sir!

411
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:10,032
My employee card.

412
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,538
You really love it?

413
00:29:17,642 --> 00:29:19,344
Tada!

414
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:22,142
Development Team.

415
00:29:28,646 --> 00:29:32,448
No wonder I had
a bad feeling about this.

416
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:39,339
I thought it was just too easy.

417
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:41,651
For your reference,

418
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:46,857
the most intelligent people
work in our development team.

419
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,572
They'll say you pulled strings
if you join them right away.

420
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:51,663
I don't want you to get isolated.

421
00:29:51,763 --> 00:29:54,752
So you'll first start an internship here.

422
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,543
I won't have a manager or colleagues.

423
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:03,241
I'll have to eat alone, work alone,

424
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:07,143
and do everything alone.

425
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:09,643
Of course not. You do have a manager.

426
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,238
-Really?
-Yes, the brightest brain here.

427
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:17,636
-You should have told me.
-Wait.

428
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:19,536
-Come in!
-Now? Right now?

429
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:21,136
Coming now?

430
00:30:22,422 --> 00:30:24,627
Where is he? It's me.

431
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:35,853
Let's start the meeting after
an introduction. Nice meeting you.

432
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,661
I'm An Minhyuk,
Manager of Pre-Development Team.

433
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:44,758
I'm Do Bongsoon.

434
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,543
I know. We met before.

435
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:51,842
-You told me to introduce myself.
-Okay, let's start the meeting.

436
00:30:52,937 --> 00:30:55,942
It's just you and me.
This is not a meeting.

437
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:58,148
This is more like a conversation,
since it's just the two of us.

438
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,442
Is it?

439
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:04,132
Then we'll call one more person.
That's not a problem.

440
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:06,616
Come in.

441
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,022
-Yes, sir?
-Come here.

442
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:18,428
There's three of us now.
Let's start the meeting.

443
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:19,721
Sit.

444
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:21,616
Did you have breakfast?

445
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:34,957
Hi, mom.

446
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:37,858
Yes. You're coming today?

447
00:31:38,152 --> 00:31:41,755
Really? Then can you bring it?

448
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,162
Okay, got it.

449
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,783
Yes, I choose to lead a
good life and forgive them.

450
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:52,369
I want to thank Buddha.

451
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:54,884
He sent us Mr. An.

452
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:57,479
I like him so much.

453
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,298
Okay, let's start our meeting.

454
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,052
Come in.

455
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,509
What? No way.

456
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:42,342
Is he a doppelganger?

457
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:50,144
These are the reports
for tomorrow's presentation.

458
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:59,345
Did the managers confirm
these conceptual graphic drafts?

459
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:00,257
Of course, sir.

460
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:06,750
Good. Good job, Mr. Oh.

461
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:07,646
Okay.

462
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:17,846
But, isn't he...

463
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:21,941
He's Oh Dolbyung the manager of Team One.

464
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:23,742
We call him Oh Dolppyo.

465
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,139
Does he have a twin brother?

466
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:27,045
I don't think so.

467
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:30,735
He said he grew up lonely
because he's an only child.

468
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,847
Okay, let's start the meeting.

469
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:37,441
Excuse me. Let me take this call. Sorry.

470
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,849
-Hello?
-Okay, Ms. Do...

471
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:42,460
Yes.

472
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:45,647
-Concentrate.
-Yes.

473
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:47,950
What is the game you want to create?

474
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:50,646
Shouldn't we wait for Mr. Kong?

475
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:54,734
No. If you leave the meeting,
you can't come back.

476
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:57,435
-Oh, I see.
-So tell me.

477
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,134
What is this game you want to create?

478
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:02,534
Oh, the game I want to create...

479
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,221
...has no violence
and doesn't make people spend cash.

480
00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:09,134
It's a very healthy and educational game.

481
00:34:09,232 --> 00:34:12,525
I want to develop a game
that is good for people.

482
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,033
You don't want to make money.

483
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,223
No, we can make lots of money.

484
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,738
It's a game that even preschoolers
and old people can play.

485
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:23,841
Preschoolers and old people
don't spend money on games.

486
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:28,352
I think that's it for today.

487
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:32,753
-We didn't do much.
-Ms. Do, we did quite a lot.

488
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,037
What did we do?

489
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:36,942
What progress has been made?

490
00:34:37,045 --> 00:34:39,656
Now I know what kind of game
you want to develop.

491
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,649
Now you know, so what?

492
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:47,451
I plan to discuss this with our
CEO, Mr. An.

493
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:50,244
-With Mr. An? Really?
-Yes.

494
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,746
Why are you doing this?

495
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:59,458
Don't do this, please.
My head is going nuts.

496
00:34:59,553 --> 00:35:01,255
The meeting is over.
You can go to the restroom.

497
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:05,160
I go to the restroom when I need to.

498
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:08,138
-I don't need to go now.
-You should go.

499
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:10,257
You'll change your mind there.

500
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:12,442
You should learn to
control your instincts.

501
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,753
-At the restroom?
-Yes, go.

502
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:25,255
You.

503
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:30,748
-Where are you going?
-To the restroom.

504
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:33,457
-Hold it.
-Okay.

505
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:35,560
We need to talk.

506
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,469
-Close the door.
-Okay.

507
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:55,258
Aren't you the one without experience?

508
00:35:55,644 --> 00:35:58,163
-Come over here.
-Okay.

509
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:01,632
Stop. Stand upright.

510
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,736
-Do Bongsoon.
-Yes?

511
00:36:03,837 --> 00:36:07,848
Who do you think you are
to stick around Mr. An?

512
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,435
-Do you think you're that pretty?
-What?

513
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,333
No, he said I need to do...

514
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:15,125
...an internship before joining the team.

515
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,817
This is unbelievable.

516
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:23,122
You can't be serious. Internship?

517
00:36:25,629 --> 00:36:27,235
-Hey.
-Yes?

518
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,652
-Louder!
-Yes!

519
00:36:31,737 --> 00:36:34,741
I am the rabid dog here!

520
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:40,644
The rumors say you're the
shadowy power behind Mr. An.

521
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:45,044
-You can't influence me.
-No, I'm not a shadow.

522
00:36:45,143 --> 00:36:49,755
How dare you talk back to me?
Do you have a death wish?

523
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:54,543
Listen to me carefully.

524
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:57,456
You'd better be good to me.

525
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,265
You know why?

526
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:03,757
Because anyone that wants to
join the development team...

527
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,843
...has to pass through me!

528
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:17,485
I'm warning you. Don't try to outsmart me.

529
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:18,484
I won't.

530
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:32,421
You.

531
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:37,913
-Don't hang around Mr. An.
-What?

532
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:42,922
By any chance, do you have a twin brother?

533
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,509
Crazy wench.

534
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,999
Oh, gosh. He's so scary.

535
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:28,200
-It's urgent.
-I'm staying here.

536
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:30,398
Why? You should go to your desk.

537
00:38:30,503 --> 00:38:33,204
I want to stay here. Don't mind me.

538
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:35,202
You can't. Go inside.

539
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:37,016
Don't mind me.

540
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:38,813
-Let me stay here.
-Ms. Do!

541
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,007
Ms. Do!

542
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:46,325
Ms. Do!

543
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,713
I'm coming!

544
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,135
-Bye.
-Ms. Do!

545
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,030
-Why is he doing that to her?
-Ms. Do!

546
00:38:54,122 --> 00:38:57,018
-Is he taking his revenge?
-Ms. Do!

547
00:38:57,116 --> 00:39:01,018
-No, never mind.
-Ms. Do!

548
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,711
Ms. Do!

549
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:08,913
Ms. Do!

550
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:10,311
Miss...

551
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,210
Oh, there you are.

552
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:17,409
What is it?

553
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,306
-How's work treating you?
-Work?

554
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,813
I haven't done much, so I'm not sure.

555
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:26,716
We should have a welcome party.

556
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:28,793
-You should come.
-A welcome party?

557
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:29,594
Yeah.

558
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:31,794
-You and I?
-Yes.

559
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:33,813
It'll be too obvious, if you don't come.

560
00:39:33,898 --> 00:39:36,115
I don't know.

561
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,100
-I don't feel like it.
-Why?

562
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:43,108
Anything you don't like
about your working environment?

563
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:47,013
I'm sorry.
The call took longer than expected.

564
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,619
-Mr. Kong.
-Yes?

565
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:52,920
-Would you tell Mr. An, please?
-What?

566
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:56,416
This is not what he promised.
How can he do this to me?

567
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:59,209
Tell him I want to do some real work!

568
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,017
Thank you.

569
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:05,608
"Pre-development team"

570
00:40:18,446 --> 00:40:20,562
The prototype plan.

571
00:40:20,746 --> 00:40:22,866
The conceptual graphic draft.

572
00:40:22,974 --> 00:40:24,576
The graphic resources.

573
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,082
Anything else?

574
00:40:27,474 --> 00:40:29,075
They were all rejected.

575
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:32,484
Analyze why they got
rejected, and submit a report.

576
00:40:32,578 --> 00:40:34,682
-Okay.
-By the way, Mr. An.

577
00:40:34,774 --> 00:40:35,492
Yes.

578
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:37,678
May I have a word with the intern?

579
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,404
I'd like to have some time
to tell her about our protocols.

580
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:43,686
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

581
00:40:46,189 --> 00:40:48,101
-This way.
-Okay.

582
00:40:57,135 --> 00:41:00,644
Why choose him?
He's really harsh on the newbies.

583
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,930
Let's see who wins.

584
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:09,944
Do Bongsoon.

585
00:41:12,944 --> 00:41:14,545
-Yes?
-Get me a cup of coffee.

586
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:16,952
-One spoon of sugar.
-Sure.

587
00:41:18,053 --> 00:41:18,953
Hey!

588
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,747
I don't like brown sugar.

589
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,337
-I don't like the color.
-Sure.

590
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:29,758
Gosh, I'm reminded of
something Gukdoo said.

591
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:34,248
"Bongsoon, what's wrong with
the employees of that company?"

592
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:40,256
Yeah, Gukdoo.
That's what I'd like to know.

593
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:50,924
Here.

594
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:59,239
-Did you spit in it?
-Oh, of course not.

595
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:02,249
You don't like the color of brown sugar...

596
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:04,634
...but you're fine with
the color of coffee?

597
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:09,117
-Don't be a smart mouth.
-Okay.

598
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:21,164
Shoot!

599
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,544
Hey!

600
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:26,754
This is poison, not coffee!

601
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:28,937
I like my coffee sweet!

602
00:42:29,044 --> 00:42:31,145
You said one spoon of sugar.

603
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:36,546
You're talking back again.
Not a teaspoon, a big spoon!

604
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:41,530
-One tablespoon!
-I see.

605
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:44,011
-Then I'll make it again.
-Forget it.

606
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:48,208
What did I tell you?
Don't try to outsmart me.

607
00:42:48,812 --> 00:42:50,405
-Why do you keep flirting?
-What?

608
00:42:50,497 --> 00:42:53,888
-I'm not flirting.
-Come closer.

609
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:00,896
-You had a nose job, right?
-No.

610
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:05,492
Don't lie. You can't fool me.
You're not Mr. An's type.

611
00:43:05,607 --> 00:43:09,396
Mr. Oh Dolppyo, that has
nothing to do with work, so...

612
00:43:09,497 --> 00:43:11,900
Hey! Who's Oh Dolppyo?

613
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:16,710
It's Oh Dolbyung! Oh Dolbyung!
My ID number is 1029314!

614
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:20,126
Oh Dolbyung discharged
as sergeant of the army!

615
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:22,211
Repeat after me!
Oh Dolbyung!

616
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:25,714
Oh Dongbyeong!
Oh Dongppyong?

617
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:27,714
Oh Dol...

618
00:43:28,424 --> 00:43:32,820
Do you really want a beating?
I don't believe this.

619
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:36,619
You're too little to beat.
Look at your tiny face.

620
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:39,911
It's the size of a CD. Oh, gosh.

621
00:43:42,117 --> 00:43:44,823
What did you just do? Did you just hit me?

622
00:43:44,908 --> 00:43:47,928
Yes, I did. So what? Go and tell your mom.

623
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,232
Hey, do you like playing darts?

624
00:44:00,236 --> 00:44:02,539
Go and pick it up. Do it!

625
00:44:03,546 --> 00:44:07,332
-Okay.
-Oh, right. You're "Do."

626
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:12,729
That is so funny! Hilarious!

627
00:44:16,455 --> 00:44:19,547
Pick it up. Now!

628
00:44:38,587 --> 00:44:39,787
What's going on?

629
00:44:41,987 --> 00:44:44,382
What's going on? Oh, my!

630
00:44:46,295 --> 00:44:48,784
What's going on? Hey!

631
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,690
Hey! Hey! Do Bongsoon!

632
00:44:52,778 --> 00:44:54,888
-Get me out of here.
-Here's your dart.

633
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:57,895
-Did you push the table?
-No.

634
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,980
Was it an earthquake? Get me out of here.

635
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:03,789
Oh, by the way. I'll get you a new coffee.

636
00:45:03,874 --> 00:45:06,181
I don't need coffee! Get me out of here!

637
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:09,285
-I'll be right back.
-Hey! Do Bongsoon!

638
00:45:09,383 --> 00:45:12,609
Oh, my gosh! I'm stuck!

639
00:45:12,694 --> 00:45:16,403
You crazy... Do Bongsoon!

640
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:20,696
-The sound is too rough.
-Okay.

641
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,393
-Less effects.
-Alright.

642
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,108
The characters are too flashy.
Tone them down.

643
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:30,291
-Yes, sir.
-What's taking them so long?

644
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,315
Where's Mr. Oh?

645
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,402
Oh, he's having his coffee over there.

646
00:45:43,205 --> 00:45:43,807
But...

647
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,697
Now that you mention
it, I want some coffee.

648
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,499
Let's go for coffee.

649
00:45:49,294 --> 00:45:49,982
Okay.

650
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:56,293
I'm stuck! I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

651
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:03,680
Help! Help me! I'm stuck!

652
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:05,800
Help...

653
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:09,608
I'm stuck here! Hello! Mister!

654
00:46:09,693 --> 00:46:11,797
Hey! Hey!

655
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:18,400
-Mr. An.
-Thanks.

656
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:19,693
There you go.

657
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,693
What did you do to Mr. Oh?

658
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:27,994
Did you beat him up?

659
00:46:30,191 --> 00:46:31,391
Did you knock him out?

660
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:35,479
-Then what?
-He's sitting.

661
00:46:35,578 --> 00:46:39,682
-And why isn't he coming?
-He's a little stuck.

662
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,278
-Bongsoon.
-Yes?

663
00:46:48,777 --> 00:46:50,572
-Help him get out.
-No.

664
00:46:50,671 --> 00:46:52,564
-No?
-No!

665
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:53,977
No?

666
00:46:56,877 --> 00:47:00,677
"From Baek Tak"

667
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:08,081
What's this?

668
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:13,082
Wishing Do Bongsoon the best?
You're kidding me. He's crazy.

669
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:19,794
Sir, I can't find Mr. Oh. He disappeared.

670
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:21,407
-Let's go.
-What?

671
00:47:23,993 --> 00:47:28,195
Please, get me out! Help me!

672
00:47:28,317 --> 00:47:30,806
Help me! Mr. An!

673
00:47:31,198 --> 00:47:34,403
-What happened here?
-Get me out of here.

674
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:36,894
Get me out. Quickly, please.

675
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:42,478
Who did this?

676
00:47:42,587 --> 00:47:44,390
Do Bongsoon!

677
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:46,271
-Go and ask for help.
-Yes, sir.

678
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,675
Help me get out of this.

679
00:47:48,473 --> 00:47:51,270
Don't look at me, please.

680
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,470
-Don't look.
-Hang on.

681
00:47:53,555 --> 00:47:55,054
Oh, don't look!

682
00:47:57,151 --> 00:47:58,761
Please, don't look.

683
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:04,055
I told you. Wait and see who wins.

684
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:09,170
Mr. An, I'm curious about something.

685
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:14,560
You're a man that looks
after yourself very much.

686
00:48:14,663 --> 00:48:17,662
You always have to
have things done your way.

687
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,948
Why did you take the fall?

688
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:22,739
-You slipped accidentally?
-No.

689
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:26,041
Did you really intentionally
let yourself get stabbed?

690
00:48:26,354 --> 00:48:28,238
-Yes.
-Why?

691
00:48:42,272 --> 00:48:45,684
Oh, I was...

692
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:55,404
-I'm going to the library.
-Okay...

693
00:48:55,506 --> 00:48:58,102
Then I'll go there
after I clean things up.

694
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:35,055
You're a man that looks
after yourself very much.

695
00:49:35,144 --> 00:49:38,159
You always have to
have things done your way.

696
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,770
Why did you take the fall?

697
00:50:07,028 --> 00:50:12,331
Well... About the welcome party.

698
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:14,916
I think we should do it later
after they take out your stitches.

699
00:50:18,524 --> 00:50:20,331
You shouldn't drink.

700
00:50:30,085 --> 00:50:32,892
Okay. Let's do that.

701
00:50:35,484 --> 00:50:38,389
Let's go. I'll take you home.

702
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:01,829
I will never forgive her. Never.

703
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:05,448
You were defeated by a girl.
There's nothing to be proud of.

704
00:51:05,535 --> 00:51:07,452
Forget about it.
That's the best you can do.

705
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:11,039
You can say that
because she didn't do it to you.

706
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:15,041
You don't know how I feel.

707
00:51:17,643 --> 00:51:18,735
What about you?

708
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:21,330
What do you know about me?

709
00:51:22,234 --> 00:51:24,030
You know nothing!

710
00:51:24,718 --> 00:51:27,117
Don't judge me like that!

711
00:51:27,224 --> 00:51:30,013
What makes you think,
she didn't do anything to me?

712
00:51:32,218 --> 00:51:36,804
What she did to you is nothing
compared to what she did to me!

713
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:41,095
I was totally...

714
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:46,492
I can't even wear skinny jeans anymore.

715
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,284
-Do you know how that feels?
-Oh, no!

716
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:56,187
What you see is not everything!
What you can't see...

717
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:03,514
I didn't know. I didn't know. I'm sorry.

718
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:06,806
Where are you going?

719
00:52:07,302 --> 00:52:12,906
I hate that about men.
They leave during a conversation.

720
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:16,592
I really hate that.

721
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:22,180
It's not fully fermented yet.

722
00:52:22,288 --> 00:52:26,196
-It looks clear.
-It's fresh. Take it to him.

723
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:28,897
Thanks, mom.

724
00:52:39,951 --> 00:52:43,161
It tastes very good. What is it made of?

725
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:45,558
It's not fully fermented yet.

726
00:52:45,653 --> 00:52:48,460
It'll be more effective,
if you drink it after a week.

727
00:52:48,547 --> 00:52:52,460
Wow, it tastes very refreshing.

728
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:56,883
I hope you get well soon.

729
00:52:56,968 --> 00:52:59,752
Oh, but what is it made of?

730
00:53:01,944 --> 00:53:03,146
It's poop wine.

731
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,780
The professor will make
his rounds tomorrow.

732
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:22,883
Tell him about your pain, okay?

733
00:53:28,368 --> 00:53:31,102
-Are you feeling better?
-My neck hurts a little.

734
00:53:31,156 --> 00:53:33,757
-We'll do another X-ray tomorrow.
-Okay, thank you.

735
00:53:33,854 --> 00:53:37,963
-Our boss...
-What happened?

736
00:53:38,067 --> 00:53:39,963
-He's very distressed.
-Why?

737
00:53:40,048 --> 00:53:43,749
He drank something he shouldn't.
He said he's not human anymore.

738
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:47,454
I don't know what he had.
I'm really curious.

739
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:49,858
We asked, but he won't tell us.

740
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:52,648
-Is your constipation gone?
-No.

741
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:55,243
The poop is stuck here.
It's driving me nuts.

742
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:57,661
You must have poor circulation.
Do you want medications?

743
00:53:57,754 --> 00:54:02,153
Oh, no. I've never
had constipation before.

744
00:54:02,268 --> 00:54:05,664
I always expel as much as I eat.

745
00:54:05,749 --> 00:54:08,259
Will you stop it now? I hate poop.

746
00:54:08,362 --> 00:54:11,642
-I don't like it, either.
-Stop! Stop!

747
00:54:13,631 --> 00:54:16,667
-Oh, did you have poop wine?
-Poop wine?

748
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:22,969
-That?
-Yes.

749
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:34,987
Did you, sir?

750
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,081
He did. He did. He did.

751
00:54:39,788 --> 00:54:41,886
-There were bits inside.
-He did.

752
00:54:54,969 --> 00:54:57,961
You left the hospital too early.

753
00:54:58,176 --> 00:55:00,563
You could've left after
taking out the stitches.

754
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,668
Are you okay?

755
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:04,383
-Yes.
-Then get some rest.

756
00:55:04,478 --> 00:55:05,578
I'm leaving.

757
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:25,100
Just stay like this for a moment.

758
00:56:14,968 --> 00:56:16,368
Is that...

759
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:28,502
The next bus to arrive is 470.

760
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:35,303
Let's meet tomorrow.
I need to talk to you.

761
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,810
Listen, Gukdoo.

762
00:56:57,519 --> 00:56:59,318
I know how much you want to catch him.

763
00:57:00,012 --> 00:57:01,515
That's how we all feel.

764
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:02,517
You...

765
00:57:03,314 --> 00:57:05,215
But let me say this to you.

766
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:08,207
Ma'am, can we have some kimchi?

767
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,518
-We don't have any.
-Never mind then.

768
00:57:11,103 --> 00:57:13,320
That's how the system works.

769
00:57:13,602 --> 00:57:16,313
They give the orders, we obey.

770
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:21,210
If they say, "Do it!" We just do it.

771
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:24,801
That's it. Do you get it?

772
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:29,143
Sometimes you have to obey
even if you know it isn't right.

773
00:57:29,254 --> 00:57:31,643
That's how the system works.

774
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:38,931
I can't obey,
when I know something's not right.

775
00:57:40,244 --> 00:57:41,535
And if something must be done,

776
00:57:43,115 --> 00:57:44,634
I'll definitely get it done.

777
00:57:44,824 --> 00:57:48,755
You really are a fool, aren't you?

778
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:51,136
You little brat!

779
00:57:53,945 --> 00:57:56,738
Well, we need cops like you.

780
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:04,337
Let's do it without a warrant.

781
00:58:04,627 --> 00:58:08,345
Let's just go for it
and work it out amongst us.

782
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,042
So come to work tomorrow.

783
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:22,042
I'm getting drunk.

784
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:24,931
Sir,

785
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:26,138
-What?
-but...

786
00:58:27,243 --> 00:58:28,735
Tomorrow's my day off.

787
00:58:32,544 --> 00:58:36,646
Your day off? Cops don't have days off.
It's 24/7 for us.

788
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:37,543
Drink up.

789
00:58:39,722 --> 00:58:41,323
Then today is my day off.

790
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:20,745
Bonggi, when are we
going on our first date?

791
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:29,538
Okay, then I'll text you later.

792
00:59:31,144 --> 00:59:32,133
Bye.

793
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:42,730
Bongsoon!

794
00:59:44,431 --> 00:59:45,738
Bongsoon!

795
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:08,793
Dress your wound every five hours,
and don't skip your medicine.

796
01:00:10,886 --> 01:00:11,877
I will.

797
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:30,623
Hand it over to her.
They are Bongsoon's from now on.

798
01:00:30,738 --> 01:00:32,933
These are all yours now.

799
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,339
This has been passed down
from generation to generation.

800
01:00:36,435 --> 01:00:41,936
It's the history of our strength.
It's like a chronicle.

801
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:45,827
With records of the strength
that was passed down to our women,

802
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:49,129
you will learn how to use this blessing.

803
01:00:49,216 --> 01:00:53,920
We must record things in detail
for our future generations.

804
01:00:54,021 --> 01:01:00,026
Your mom wrote two sentences
when she was 19 and gave up.

805
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:04,632
Bongsoon, you must now keep the records.

806
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:07,821
Grandma, I don't even keep a
journal during my holidays.

807
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:10,416
-I hate keeping a diary.
-Do it!

808
01:01:11,317 --> 01:01:12,521
It's your calling.

809
01:01:12,611 --> 01:01:16,029
You're no longer the unwise Do Bongsoon,

810
01:01:16,227 --> 01:01:19,527
that lives in Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu.

811
01:01:19,623 --> 01:01:22,823
Heaven gave you a special mission.

812
01:01:22,908 --> 01:01:26,729
You're no longer like everyone else.

813
01:01:26,821 --> 01:01:31,923
Do not go in hiding or avoid it anymore.

814
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:36,302
Use your strength for good.

815
01:01:36,403 --> 01:01:37,599
And,

816
01:01:38,596 --> 01:01:39,495
record...

817
01:01:41,017 --> 01:01:42,694
...everything in these books.

818
01:02:02,584 --> 01:02:03,870
Book of Ability

819
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:38,570
It'd be perfect if it was
five millimeters higher.

820
01:02:39,479 --> 01:02:42,580
By the way, you said you're confused.

821
01:02:42,878 --> 01:02:45,384
Are you having feelings for your boss?

822
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:47,869
-Are you wavering?
-I don't know.

823
01:02:47,971 --> 01:02:53,872
-Why?
-My heart races when I see him.

824
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,380
Am I changing on a whim?

825
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:58,872
-And little by little, Gukdoo...
-Little by little?

826
01:03:01,151 --> 01:03:04,865
-I mean little by little...
-Little by little what?

827
01:03:06,371 --> 01:03:08,672
Bongsoon, you need to go outside!

828
01:03:08,764 --> 01:03:10,686
-Why?
-Mr. An came.

829
01:03:10,771 --> 01:03:12,567
-What?
-Faster!

830
01:03:13,677 --> 01:03:14,583
Go.

831
01:03:31,984 --> 01:03:35,076
-I have something to say.
-You can tell me tomorrow at work.

832
01:03:35,175 --> 01:03:36,369
I have to say it now.

833
01:03:38,968 --> 01:03:39,861
I think,

834
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:48,602
I'm sick!

835
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:54,197
I know. I told you to
not skip your medicine.

836
01:03:54,282 --> 01:03:58,292
You don't listen to the
police or to the doctor.

837
01:03:58,407 --> 01:03:59,689
It's not like that.

838
01:04:06,902 --> 01:04:08,009
It hurts here.

839
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:18,507
You should...

840
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:23,801
...get over your one-sided love.

841
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:47,630
I think, I...

842
01:04:51,128 --> 01:04:52,942
...like you.

843
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:35,986
"Strong Woman Do Bong Soon"

844
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,666
Something's definitely not right with me.
I'm not in my right mind.

845
01:05:38,782 --> 01:05:39,915
Do Bongsoon!

846
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:46,115
-Let's go.
-Who are you? Reveal yourself!

847
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,315
Actually, I'm an alien.

848
01:05:48,405 --> 01:05:50,306
You wicked thing.

849
01:05:50,415 --> 01:05:52,819
She left after she got a call
from a friend. A male friend.

850
01:05:52,904 --> 01:05:56,208
-I waited.
-I don't want to be just friends.

851
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:57,820
-I like...
-Gukdoo.

852
01:05:58,115 --> 01:06:00,238
-Who's Bongsoon rescuing?
-The prince.

853
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:01,944
It's a very lonely prince.

854
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:04,046
Then she should rescue him! He's lonely.

855
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:07,735
I hope tomorrow will be different for us.

856
01:06:08,623 --> 01:06:09,934
Are you sleeping, Bongsoon?
