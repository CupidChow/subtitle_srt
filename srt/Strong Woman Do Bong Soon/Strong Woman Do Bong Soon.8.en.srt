1
00:00:00,143 --> 00:00:02,215
-Hey, Do Bongsoon.
-Who are you?

2
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:04,767
How dare you touch her!

3
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:16,664
Gukdoo!

4
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:23,804
Gukdoo...

5
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:33,686
Sorry. I got confused and pressed it.

6
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:35,201
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

7
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:38,028
-You can go. I'll take care of it.
-Okay, then.

8
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:48,544
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

9
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,324
I should have taken you home.

10
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:52,859
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:54,271
It's okay.

12
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:56,285
Are you okay?

13
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:58,260
What do you mean?

14
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:00,516
I pushed you.

15
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:01,719
What about it?

16
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:06,652
You worry too much, little one. Go home.

17
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,204
I'm the one that got beaten up.
What the heck?

18
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:16,405
I only suppressed an attempt to assault.

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,962
We'll talk in the station.
You were caught in the act.

20
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:20,561
She beat me.

21
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:21,479
Come with me!

22
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:24,171
-She beat me!
-Sir, wait!

23
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:25,626
I'm not that old! I'm not even married!

24
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,219
Your cane.

25
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:32,131
-What?
-Come with me.

26
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:33,552
You crazy...

27
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:34,886
Go home quickly!

28
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:37,056
-Hey!
-She's crazy.

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,085
You just wait!

30
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:40,244
Hey, Do Bongsoon!

31
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,767
Oh?

32
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,835
Lie low from now on, okay?

33
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,482
I didn't do anything.

34
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:02,567
I was just walking. He came at me.

35
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,709
You make me worry.

36
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,435
But what are you doing
in my neighborhood?

37
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:14,081
I came to get a walnut pie.

38
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,672
Oh.

39
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:21,041
The world got too dangerous.

40
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:26,446
It's so difficult for weak women
and powerless people to live.

41
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:29,648
-Bongsoon.
-I won't tolerate it anymore!

42
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:34,388
Bongsoon! Come to my office tomorrow.

43
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:36,185
Bye!

44
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:41,918
I'll file a report to
the Ministry of Labor!

45
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,550
-What? Who, me?
-Yes!

46
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:44,883
-Why?
-You promised me...

47
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:49,650
...you'll let me work in the development
team if I catch the blackmailer.

48
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,979
You say one thing and do another.

49
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,450
I didn't promise that I'll...

50
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:56,410
-I did.
-You did.

51
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:57,690
Who says I won't keep my promise?

52
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,032
But look, Bongsoon.

53
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:00,929
Yes, you caught the man
that was blackmailing me...

54
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,048
...but the killer
is still out there, right?

55
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,428
If you catch him, then you can work
in the development team.

56
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:08,440
-Until then, I'll stay with you.
-That has nothing to do with it.

57
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:10,528
See? See?

58
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:13,707
You never wanted me to work
in that team, did you?

59
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,638
That's not true! I swear to you.

60
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:20,167
I'm going to quit!
You are so dirty and cheap!

61
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,429
Cool your jets and think.

62
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,684
I am on your side!

63
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,095
I'll help you.

64
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:29,115
I mean it.

65
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,008
-Really?
-Yes.

66
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:36,367
Then I'm joining the development team.

67
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:37,293
Of course!

68
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,484
-No more excuses.
-I promise.

69
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,697
No, we're making
pinky promises too often.

70
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,770
Why do you want to work in
the development team so much?

71
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:50,154
I want to develop a game.

72
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,972
Then do it while you're with me.
We can work together.

73
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:54,118
-No, thank you!
-Why?

74
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:58,367
I want to officially go to work,
get approvals on my ideas...

75
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:00,247
...and put on my employee card.

76
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:05,674
Gosh. I want to be part of
Ainsoft's development team.

77
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,368
I really don't get it.

78
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:09,416
What is wrong with you?
Getting obsessed about nothing.

79
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:12,600
That's not it.
I'm just responsible and punctual.

80
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,174
Anyway, bye.

81
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,727
Gosh. Do Bongsoon.

82
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:23,367
Bye!

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,233
Goodnight!

84
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,314
Name?

85
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,530
Kim Kwangbok.

86
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:45,405
I should have arrested you last time.

87
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,448
The victim didn't want a punishment.

88
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:51,758
She forgave you.
Why did you try to kidnap her?

89
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:53,797
I don't believe this.

90
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:58,281
"Forgive"? "Kidnap"? "Victim"?

91
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:05,796
Listen. All this time
I was in the hospital.

92
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:12,655
These teeth are new implants.
They are not my natural teeth.

93
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,576
My goodness. Get it back in.

94
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,883
Put it back quickly.

95
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:22,096
Say ah. Say eeh.

96
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,651
Do they fit well?

97
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:26,050
Yes, they do. Perfectly.

98
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:31,697
Sir, my entire body's a mess.

99
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:33,438
My arm...

100
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:36,492
...won't move more than this.

101
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:38,833
I need a bidet to clean myself
after I go number two.

102
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:39,911
My goodness.

103
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,964
People will treat me like
a loser if they find out...

104
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,668
...that I got beaten up by a woman.

105
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:47,854
So I just let it slide.

106
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,309
I wasn't even paid for the injuries.

107
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:51,753
But...

108
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:59,120
...it's just so humiliating!

109
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:05,572
So, Do Bongsoon did hit you that day...

110
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:11,271
...and you lost four teeth and
seven ribs were fractured? Right?

111
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:13,627
Poor you.

112
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:18,082
I can hardly breathe.

113
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,368
-My ribs...
-I can see that.

114
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:24,403
I can't even chew my favorite food, squid.

115
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,453
Because my jaw got so weak.

116
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:34,273
-All I can eat is tofu.
-Because a woman beat you?

117
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:40,333
Yes, a woman beat me!
This is so humiliating.

118
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,367
It must have been so traumatic.

119
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:49,313
Wipe your face.

120
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:51,305
Thank you.

121
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,533
Gosh.

122
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:01,000
Do Bongsoon is not a woman.

123
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:04,157
You wouldn't know unless
you get beaten up by her.

124
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,625
So you wanted to beat her?

125
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:10,117
I wanted to have a proper fight.

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,947
Hey, hey. Calm down.

127
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,548
-My head was ringing.
-Okay, okay.

128
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:17,533
Okay, it's ringing.

129
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:20,100
He's under stress. Be gentle.

130
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:25,336
-I'm the victim.
-Okay, okay.

131
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:29,963
-Come here.
-I'm the victim, really. I got hit.

132
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,675
I am the victim!

133
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,740
We live in a democratic country!
You can't force an investigation!

134
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,315
-Open the door quickly.
-I'm not getting in there.

135
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:44,107
You can't do this to me.
My teeth! My teeth!

136
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,128
-Wait! My teeth!
-Get him in.

137
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:50,139
-Stay there and calm down.
-It's not me!

138
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,107
It's not me! I'm the victim!

139
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:05,843
This isn't democracy!
I am the victim!

140
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:41,456
Did you get home safely?

141
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:00,121
-How dare you touch her!
-Gukdoo!

142
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:01,174
Are you crazy?

143
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:05,145
He's pretending to be only friends.
I don't like it.

144
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,754
I'm so glad that Kyungsim is okay.

145
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:21,061
That man is really a psycho.
How can he go back there?

146
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,870
Is my pretty girl upset because
she missed the criminal?

147
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,074
Why doesn't life work out as I plan it?

148
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:40,980
Why wasn't I good at studying?
Why is nothing I do right?

149
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:47,101
Why can't I be open
with the man I like? Why?

150
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:50,350
-What are you talking about?
-What's wrong, sweetie?

151
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:55,633
-Bongsoon.
-I can't even do things my way at work.

152
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:00,140
I bought this for you. It's your favorite.

153
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,828
-What's this?
-What is it?

154
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:06,315
Spicy chicken feet! Bongsoon's favorite.

155
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,650
-It's spicy chicken feet.
-They're so plump. Look!

156
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,581
Bongsoon, have some.
I bought your favorite.

157
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,461
-Come on.
-Let me try one.

158
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,889
Let's eat.

159
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:21,948
-Let me see.
-It's good!

160
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:35,435
Why am I so simple-minded?

161
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:41,908
Kyungsim, did you sleep well?

162
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,142
Don't worry, my friend.
I got your back.

163
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:52,285
I have never felt this confused
in my life before.

164
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:56,628
I wanted a permanent job
at Ainsoft so much...

165
00:10:58,235 --> 00:11:01,995
Now I want to catch
that killer more than ever.

166
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:40,472
I heard your transfer to
the development team was put off.

167
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:41,626
So it seems.

168
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:43,766
Gosh, Mr. An...

169
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:49,105
Doing this in the morning
brings me good luck.

170
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:50,900
Gosh.

171
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:57,294
Wow, you are amazing.
You caught the blackmailer.

172
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:01,696
Yes, I'm very good at what I have to do.

173
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:03,017
I was really surprised.

174
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:06,080
The culprit was a total stranger.
Just a psycho.

175
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,631
I thought it was
one of Mr. An's brothers.

176
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,108
He's not here yet.

177
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:26,554
Oh? What's this?

178
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:30,166
What's this?

179
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,524
What's this? I guess this is not mine.

180
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,977
That shocked me.

181
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,272
Good morning!

182
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,997
Hello, Mr. An.

183
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:45,589
Did you sleep well?

184
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:47,629
Sorry?

185
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:50,596
-Yes.
-I slept well, too.

186
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,691
Is this laptop for me?

187
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:55,482
Yes, you wanted to work
in the development team.

188
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:57,347
You should start working on
a presentation for a new game.

189
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:59,695
Work on that while you're here.
Everything you need is installed.

190
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:02,333
Can I use this anyway I want to?

191
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:04,572
It's yours. No need to ask.

192
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:05,985
Thank you.

193
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:11,075
Open it.

194
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:12,308
Okay.

195
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:14,849
Okay.

196
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:32,038
If you ever go near her again...

197
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:36,659
...not only won't you be able to chew
squid, but you won't be able to drink...

198
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,754
...or even walk again.

199
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,335
No, I'll make sure you
can't use your legs. Got it?

200
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,329
Don't forget that.

201
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:06,751
Oh my...

202
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,493
It's fake.

203
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:28,760
The case of missing women
in Dobong-dong...

204
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:30,651
...took a new turn with another victim.

205
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:34,253
To prevent more incidents
and speed up the investigation...

206
00:14:34,337 --> 00:14:37,547
...the police will conduct
an open investigation.

207
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:41,167
-It'll be an open investigation!
-What?

208
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:45,525
The police are questioning suspects
based on the footprints he left.

209
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,055
They're also gathering information
on the missing women.

210
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:56,001
Criminal profilers say it's
a typical misogynistic crime.

211
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,849
The Dobong-dong kidnapping
recalls one particular case.

212
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:05,826
Recently, in UK, a movement against
misogyny called "Reclaim The Internet"...

213
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:07,740
...has become a huge interest.

214
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:10,858
This movement is actually based
on another movement that was active...

215
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,614
...during the 1970s when 13 women
became victims of a serial murder.

216
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:19,141
Women demanded to walk the streets
at night without fear of crimes..

217
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:22,527
...hence, the movement was called
"Reclaim The Night."

218
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,994
Times might have changed, but
crimes against women are still committed.

219
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:31,356
Violent acts of the strong
against the weak.

220
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:35,831
The survival of the fittest might be
the rule in the animal world...

221
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:42,812
...but power should not be used
to oppress the weak in our world.

222
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,658
It should not! It can never be allowed!

223
00:16:14,868 --> 00:16:16,460
What is she working on so hard?

224
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,283
Jo Insung?

225
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:36,462
Perfect. My gosh! Who's that?

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,934
Sir, your father wants
to see you right now.

227
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,600
-Now?
-Yes.

228
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:46,535
I don't want more scandals
before the shareholder meeting.

229
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:48,256
There won't be.

230
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:50,443
I'll cover it up.

231
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:55,388
I believe in you
and I respect your decision.

232
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,982
If the board finds out that it
was a fight between brothers...

233
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:01,820
...it won't be of any good for us.

234
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,938
Announce an official engagement
before the shareholders' meeting.

235
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:13,471
And bring that girl home.
I want to get to know her.

236
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,044
The faster, the better.

237
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,833
Yes, father.

238
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,235
Where is he?

239
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:32,737
Oh, my goodness! What did he do? Jeez!

240
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:36,142
Gosh. Insung.

241
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,424
There.

242
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:42,862
Should I take a break?

243
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:46,850
Oh?

244
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:50,770
"Fourth Victim of the Dobong-dong Case"

245
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:55,541
That son of a...

246
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:02,492
"Emergency Conference,
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency"

247
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:05,834
-Another victim.
-He's not just another criminal.

248
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,302
Let's think about what we can do
to protect our neighborhood.

249
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:16,670
The criminal is after skinny women
weighing between 40 kg to 48 kg.

250
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:20,173
-Why skinny women?
-Skinny women are his type?

251
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:23,930
We can't eliminate the possibility
of his liking for such women.

252
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:27,001
-Do you think they're alive?
-Yes, they're alive.

253
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:29,769
We found no bodies of the victims so far.

254
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:33,579
-What about the first victim?
-Why was she killed?

255
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:37,886
As you can see, she resisted violently.

256
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:41,342
He didn't mean to kill her.
It was an accident.

257
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:43,285
She was also very skinny.

258
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,190
Yes, she was like the others.

259
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:49,119
Gukdoo's mom said
there's a play similar to this case.

260
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:52,816
This is the poster of a play
performed in Daehak-ro.

261
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:55,367
A man kidnaps and breeds seven women.

262
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:58,529
-Seven?
-To have a group marriage.

263
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:03,657
We tracked down the footprints
the suspect left in the scene...

264
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,078
...and found that they came
from the male lead.

265
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:09,178
He's claiming he lost his shoes,
but we have many doubts.

266
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:12,251
So, we're investigating him right now.

267
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:16,725
There's a fourth victim.
Pull out of this case!

268
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:20,361
Send the special investigation unit
to the neighborhood's precinct.

269
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:22,780
The special investigation unit
will go to the neighborhood.

270
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:25,741
What? What do you mean?

271
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,093
We have to catch the criminal...

272
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:31,181
...to clear Gukdoo of the deferred
disciplinary action against him.

273
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:33,780
Then let's catch him.

274
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:37,918
Before the special unit does.

275
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:01,207
You scared me.

276
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:04,384
What are you doing?

277
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,215
-Nothing much. Let's go.
-Where?

278
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,151
I'm going to catch him myself.
I won't leave it to the police.

279
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:14,068
Let's go!

280
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:20,083
Today you'll learn defensive skills.

281
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,782
-The best defense is...
-A good offense.

282
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:24,582
Exactly. Attack me.
I'll show you the best defense.

283
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,634
-Can I?
-Yes.

284
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:29,126
Then your neck breaks.

285
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:30,627
Come on.

286
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:33,849
Then you're dead already.

287
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:36,300
-I can use this arm.
-Then I'll do this.

288
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,429
You can't use your arm.

289
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:41,373
-You can't move.
-Yes.

290
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,691
Gosh.

291
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:48,900
Get up.

292
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:53,283
Now I'll attack you,
so you protect yourself.

293
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:55,218
Here I go.

294
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:02,834
Wait!

295
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:04,141
Hey.

296
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:15,037
Jiu-jitsu. Go!

297
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:21,394
What on earth?
You are firing me up.

298
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,606
It's not too hard.

299
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,409
You're driving me nuts. Okay, Jiu-jitsu.

300
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:30,163
Jiu-jitsu starts like this.

301
00:21:42,364 --> 00:21:43,263
Hey, that's...

302
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,081
Oh, yeah!

303
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:57,855
Here.

304
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:04,434
Hydrate yourself.

305
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,793
Open it for me.

306
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:10,746
There.

307
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:16,702
One, two! One, two!

308
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,986
You're getting faster.

309
00:22:22,768 --> 00:22:24,039
-Of course.
-Good!

310
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,360
-Knees up to your chest!
-Gosh.

311
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,781
-Lift them up!
-Stop doing that!

312
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:40,674
Good. That's it.

313
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,017
Duck down. All the way.

314
00:22:59,198 --> 00:23:00,613
Become one with the jump rope.

315
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,968
There must be a reason
I was given this power.

316
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,072
A world where the powerful
abuse their power. Oh, no!

317
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:31,131
I will use my power to punish them!

318
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:35,311
I'm the strong woman,
Do Bongsoon! Here I go!

319
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:39,752
Pick it up quickly.
It got nice and clean.

320
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:41,245
Pick that up.

321
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:43,510
Good job.

322
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:45,708
What?

323
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,458
Hey! You can't throw
cigarette butts here!

324
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:55,557
-Then you pick it up.
-You threw it, you pick it up!

325
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:59,605
Don't talk back, you're still
wet behind the ears. Get lost!

326
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:00,966
Leave him alone.

327
00:24:01,697 --> 00:24:04,176
You guys are good boys picking up garbage.

328
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,868
As punishment from school, right?

329
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:09,405
No, to keep our neighborhood clean.

330
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,997
I don't like the way you look at me.

331
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:15,854
And I think a beating will fix that.

332
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:18,325
You little brat. Eyes down.

333
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,489
You want a piece of me?

334
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:20,807
-You punk.
-Oh! Bro!

335
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:28,883
Who's your leader? It's not your teacher
who is watching your back.

336
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,331
-What gang?
-How dare you glare at me?

337
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,423
I'll show him whose turf it is.

338
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:37,216
-I'm not telling you!
-You're not telling us what?

339
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:39,144
Call your boss. Now!

340
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,542
Boss, we need you here.

341
00:24:46,627 --> 00:24:48,597
Say what? Hey!

342
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:51,226
We got beaten up. Come quickly.

343
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:54,884
What the heck?

344
00:24:54,968 --> 00:25:00,235
I told them to pick up garbage
and they got in trouble anyway.

345
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,537
-You want some?
-I can starve to death.

346
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:06,135
-We'll never eat that!
-Never!

347
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,210
I shouldn't have been nice to you.

348
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:11,918
You little brats.

349
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,995
Hey. What are you doing here?

350
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,652
-Boss!
-Boss!

351
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:19,226
-You're dead now!
-Boss!

352
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:22,367
Boss!

353
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,219
Isn't that Do Bongsoon?

354
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:32,167
What are you doing to these minors?

355
00:25:32,252 --> 00:25:34,713
Did you beat them?

356
00:25:34,996 --> 00:25:37,139
-How can you do this?
-She's Do Bongsoon.

357
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:40,202
Oh, so you're the famous Do Bongsoon?

358
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:43,012
Let the kids go. We should have a talk.

359
00:25:44,236 --> 00:25:45,405
Can't you see this?

360
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,878
We're guarding the neighborhood.

361
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,512
I'm sorry but we have to
protect the ladies.

362
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:53,218
I should just...

363
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:58,023
If you're guarding
the neighborhood do just that.

364
00:25:58,395 --> 00:25:59,487
What are you doing? Go home.

365
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:00,927
-Boss!
-Who said you can go home?

366
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:06,598
We asked them to not throw
cigarette butts, but they did.

367
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,184
What? Gross!

368
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:13,578
-Clean that up!
-You clean it up, crazy woman!

369
00:26:13,663 --> 00:26:17,338
-Clean it up!
-Come on. Hit me.

370
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:19,523
You have to hit us first
to start a fight.

371
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:22,418
Or the kids will say
we hit the lady first.

372
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:24,441
-So come on. Hit me.
-Then don't whine later.

373
00:26:24,526 --> 00:26:26,320
Of course!

374
00:26:58,063 --> 00:26:59,923
Don't ever touch the kids again!

375
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:02,664
-Yes!
-Yes!

376
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,225
She's awesome!

377
00:27:24,618 --> 00:27:27,134
What? Do Bongsoon again?

378
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:30,208
Why does she stand in our way?

379
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:33,105
What gang is she in?
Do we have any information?

380
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,103
I think she's working freelance.

381
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,051
Some say it's a Taiwanese gang from China.

382
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:41,005
Others say she's being
trained by the Triad, sir.

383
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:44,222
Darn! It's so humiliating!
My pride is crumbling!

384
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:48,939
Do Bongsoon is no longer a woman!
She is our enemy! Understood?

385
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:50,576
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

386
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:53,480
Okay, I got it.

387
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:55,670
Someone help him.
Are you doing that on purpose?

388
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:57,550
Okay, it's fine. It's fine.

389
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:02,041
Okay, I got it. Now sit.
Okay, okay.

390
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:03,533
Someone help him!

391
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:08,767
But how do we crush her?
Ah, my head!

392
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:11,982
I don't think it'll be easy, sir.

393
00:28:19,608 --> 00:28:21,342
You think I don't know that?

394
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:23,635
Who said it'll be easy?

395
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,920
-Someone help him.
-I can't chew.

396
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:32,317
I got it.

397
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,872
Why didn't you get him softer tofu?

398
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:35,199
So I can eat with a straw.

399
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:39,305
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
Darn it. Okay, okay.

400
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,660
So you're not staying
at your boss's anymore?

401
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:44,242
I'm not. I'm going to
protect Dobong-dong.

402
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:45,357
Wow.

403
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,974
You can go home now.

404
00:28:48,064 --> 00:28:51,297
I'm getting sick of this hospital.

405
00:28:51,382 --> 00:28:55,853
Thanks for recovering
so quickly, Kyungsim.

406
00:28:55,938 --> 00:29:01,630
Hey. But you're not putting
much strength in your grip.

407
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:08,010
Yes. Now I can control my strength.
I have more skills now.

408
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:09,819
I'm a new Do Bongsoon.

409
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:17,851
Kyungsim, Bonggi's seeing
Gukdoo's girlfriend.

410
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,252
-What do I do?
-Is it a love triangle?

411
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:25,413
Isn't she really mean?
How can she do that to Gukdoo?

412
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,483
Why not? Bonggi is a cool guy.

413
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:30,440
I'd date Bonggi even if
I were dating Gukdoo.

414
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:33,331
-What? You can't be serious.
-I am serious.

415
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:36,862
You can't break a promise so easily.

416
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:41,375
If you decided to date someone
and give him your heart...

417
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,303
...you stay with him.
Why do you hesitate?

418
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:45,975
Love changes.

419
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:49,608
Love is like a seesaw,
it goes up and down.

420
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:54,703
Like a swing, it goes up and down.
It moves. You never know.

421
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,723
-You might end up liking Mr. An.
-What?

422
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:02,255
That's how love is.
You really don't get it.

423
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:13,691
Heeji!

424
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:22,220
I've been thinking about it.

425
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:25,415
And I think it's my fault.

426
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:28,093
Well, my friend told me this.

427
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:33,156
Women waver endlessly
if her man doesn't give her...

428
00:30:33,241 --> 00:30:34,772
...the confidence she deserves.

429
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,653
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:39,978
No, it's not like that.

431
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:45,243
But... I couldn't help it.

432
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:46,818
Because...

433
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:51,828
...I always had
someone else in my heart.

434
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:58,954
I think I've liked someone
for a long time.

435
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:04,776
And I realized that just now.

436
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,802
Have you been seeing someone else?

437
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:12,614
No.

438
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:17,699
I'd nag at her all the time.
I've been so harsh on her.

439
00:31:17,854 --> 00:31:20,098
She does such stupid things.

440
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:22,814
And I got angry every time I saw her.

441
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,288
Because I didn't want her to get hurt
or feel pain.

442
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:30,838
I felt like I'd lose my mind
if people treated her badly.

443
00:31:32,502 --> 00:31:33,992
You do like her.

444
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:37,196
And very much.

445
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:42,001
I'm sorry.

446
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:51,543
So don't feel guilty.

447
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:06,257
Hey, stay in bed until
you're fully recovered.

448
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,159
Don't take a step out of this house.

449
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:11,611
Okay. The police gave me this.

450
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,509
And don't trust in that too much.

451
00:32:13,594 --> 00:32:17,225
As soon as your treatment is over,
go to Busan and stay there, okay?

452
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:23,562
And this... Ta-da.

453
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:26,997
-A present to welcome you.
-What is it?

454
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:29,129
It's shampoo with perfume
of natural ingredients.

455
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:30,973
It'll help you relax.

456
00:32:32,026 --> 00:32:33,429
-It smells nice.
-It does.

457
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:34,713
Thanks.

458
00:32:41,423 --> 00:32:42,294
Are you sleeping?

459
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:44,156
Yes.

460
00:32:44,348 --> 00:32:45,447
Then wake up.

461
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:46,640
I don't want to.

462
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,674
There's somewhere we need to go.

463
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,097
I'm going to sleep.

464
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:53,538
I'll pay you double for overtime.

465
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:57,242
I'll go and pick you up now.

466
00:32:57,378 --> 00:33:00,312
Wear clean clothes, wash your hair,
and wait for me looking decent.

467
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:03,153
Where are we going?

468
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:04,240
To my parents'.

469
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:06,617
Why should I go there?

470
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:08,690
I'm leaving now. Get ready!

471
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,794
-He's coming now?
-Who?

472
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:17,815
-My boss.
-What?

473
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,216
Don't move.

474
00:33:19,674 --> 00:33:22,541
Bongsoon, let's go to the temple.

475
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:26,551
Let's go and say hello to Buddha
or he might forget us.

476
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:28,981
-I can't. I'm going out.
-Where?

477
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:32,422
-I don't know.
-Mr. An is coming.

478
00:33:32,507 --> 00:33:33,340
What?

479
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:36,162
-Oh, my. Oh, my.
-Mom!

480
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,973
Like he's so important.

481
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,463
Jump!

482
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:52,109
Mr. An! Hello.
Bongsoon isn't ready yet.

483
00:33:52,194 --> 00:33:54,496
Wait inside.

484
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:56,628
I'm sorry for making her
work on a weekend.

485
00:33:56,713 --> 00:33:58,429
Oh, don't worry.

486
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,639
She can work her all the day
throughout the year.

487
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,419
Come in and wait inside. It's okay.

488
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,023
Be quiet!

489
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:15,424
-But I...
-Make yourself at home.

490
00:34:15,614 --> 00:34:16,803
But I...

491
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:19,159
Mom!

492
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:27,323
We were having breakfast.
Come and join us.

493
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:28,572
What is she doing?

494
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:29,523
No, I'm fine.

495
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:34,315
Don't tell me you're picky with food.

496
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:37,118
Do you only eat high-quality food
at fancy places?

497
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,827
Of course not.
I'm never picky with food.

498
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,220
-Then join us for breakfast.
-I'll just...

499
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:47,282
Okay. Thank you.

500
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:54,202
This is our usual breakfast.
Okay, let's eat.

501
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,435
There are so many new dishes
in our usual breakfast today.

502
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:02,247
He's too busy in the hospital
so he can hardly come home.

503
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:06,683
Who makes so many dishes
for breakfast? We're leaving.

504
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:09,126
Bongsoon, that's not how I taught you.

505
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:11,591
Didn’t I tell you this all the time?

506
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,965
Never let a guest leave without eating
if he comes at mealtime.

507
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:19,777
-Enjoy it.
-Thanks.

508
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,695
Eat up!

509
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,093
-Thanks.
-Okay.

510
00:35:26,177 --> 00:35:29,126
-Enjoy.
-You don't have to.

511
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,491
Don't feel too pressured.

512
00:35:30,803 --> 00:35:33,465
No, I'll enjoy it. Thanks.

513
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,393
-Dad, I want chives kimchi.
-Okay. Here it is.

514
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:40,875
Have some more.

515
00:35:41,143 --> 00:35:43,261
There's japchae, too. Take it.

516
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,173
-Bongsoon, eat this.
-This is good.

517
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,477
-You eat well.
-Have some meat.

518
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:52,280
Have this.

519
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:53,427
Oh, thanks.

520
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:59,314
-They're so small.
-They're baby crabs.

521
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,792
Son of a crab.

522
00:36:08,861 --> 00:36:11,394
All you have to do is act like
you're my fiancé.

523
00:36:11,524 --> 00:36:14,576
Double isn't enough. Double the double.

524
00:36:18,605 --> 00:36:23,778
You could have told me
it was a breakfast gathering.

525
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:26,265
When was I supposed to tell you?

526
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:30,528
What do you like so much about Minhyuk?

527
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:34,474
Sorry? Well, he's...

528
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:35,606
He's...

529
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:37,706
He's handsome.

530
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:48,673
Well, and he has a great personality.

531
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:56,368
Actually...

532
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:58,519
...he's nuts.

533
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,250
-What? He's nuts?
-Yes.

534
00:37:10,178 --> 00:37:12,731
And not just nuts.
He's ultra-super nuts.

535
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:29,714
Yes, he's nuts. He is!

536
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:35,034
Sometimes he makes me wonder
if he's really in his sane mind.

537
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:39,700
That's right! He's nuts!

538
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:46,714
Your father knows.

539
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,904
This looks great! Let's eat.

540
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:00,754
I was worried about the rumors.

541
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:04,580
Now that I see you I can rest at peace.

542
00:38:05,478 --> 00:38:07,589
I sent him abroad to study
as soon as his mother died.

543
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:12,513
While he was overseas,
he met too many women...

544
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:14,538
...that I was very worried.

545
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,778
But suddenly he stopped meeting women.

546
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:19,511
Then I heard about this absurd rumor.

547
00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:25,597
Gosh. No, I've sinned a lot.

548
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,963
Anyway, please take good care of him.

549
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:37,248
He's not gay. I'm sure he's not.

550
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:40,803
He's not gay. Wake up!

551
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:44,389
Your vocabulary improved a lot.

552
00:38:45,313 --> 00:38:49,673
"Ultra-super nuts"?
See? Education works.

553
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:53,083
You improved because you look
at the dictionary I gave you.

554
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:54,001
Sorry.

555
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:40,171
You should buckle it
as soon as you get in the car.

556
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:52,315
Where are we going now?

557
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,477
I bought your time today, remember?

558
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:02,400
Where are we going?

559
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:05,137
To meet the woman I loved the most.

560
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,691
Hi, mom.

561
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:59,225
I came with someone I wanted you to meet.

562
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:13,840
There's an old movie called
"When Harry Met Sally."

563
00:41:14,604 --> 00:41:16,601
It was my mom's favorite.

564
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,265
And in that movie,
there's a line that goes...

565
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:24,354
"No man can be friends with
a woman that he finds attractive."

566
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,494
Then I guess no one finds me attractive.

567
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:30,319
Men are friends with me.

568
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,630
I don't think so.

569
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:38,337
Your friend likes you.

570
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:40,492
And very much.

571
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:45,353
Having you as a friend...

572
00:41:48,337 --> 00:41:51,003
...is very difficult.
Especially for a man.

573
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,779
Your friend is lying.

574
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:59,700
Or he might have you as a friend
so he doesn't lose you.

575
00:42:02,665 --> 00:42:06,224
No, we're just friends.

576
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,832
I'm sure about that.

577
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:13,106
It's very simple to become
lovers from friends.

578
00:42:14,837 --> 00:42:19,771
One of the two has to
take one step closer.

579
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:51,832
This one step is enough
to change the relationship.

580
00:42:56,918 --> 00:42:57,751
Like this.

581
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:28,198
One step.

582
00:43:29,532 --> 00:43:32,743
No one took that one step
between Gukdoo and I.

583
00:43:33,203 --> 00:43:36,152
But that day...

584
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:42,286
...he came one step closer to me.

585
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:49,727
"Special Investigations Unit"

586
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:59,550
The special unit took the case,
but we're not giving up.

587
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:02,025
We'll keep investigating
behind closed doors.

588
00:44:02,537 --> 00:44:05,847
They won't share important
information with us.

589
00:44:05,932 --> 00:44:08,466
-We have to investigate on our own.
-Chin up, everyone.

590
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:11,782
This is a famous line of the 86th
episode of "Chief Investigator."

591
00:44:12,623 --> 00:44:16,190
"The criminal lets himself be caught
if the police tries hard enough."

592
00:44:16,275 --> 00:44:19,724
Sir! I reached the owner of
the dash cam and got it.

593
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:24,729
So this is the street that
leads to a national highway.

594
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,323
But the byway...

595
00:44:27,491 --> 00:44:28,324
Wait!

596
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,727
It smelled like gasoline.

597
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:34,170
It's the smell of asphalt.

598
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,514
Sorry. I'll be right back.

599
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:39,060
What? Where are you going?

600
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,729
He doesn't understand
the concept of teamwork.

601
00:44:41,814 --> 00:44:43,728
It's an individual combat from now on.

602
00:44:43,813 --> 00:44:45,750
You mean we won't share information?

603
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:48,359
That's not what I meant!

604
00:44:48,828 --> 00:44:50,081
The play actor is here.

605
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,591
All the actors went out
for dinner that day.

606
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,461
You can confirm that with
the director and the company.

607
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,514
I was performing a night play.

608
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,881
It's been quite long
since I lost those shoes.

609
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:06,137
-Anyone you have in mind?
-I'm not sure.

610
00:45:06,647 --> 00:45:09,267
There have been theft cases
in the dressing rooms...

611
00:45:09,753 --> 00:45:11,340
...but there are no CCTVs.

612
00:45:11,465 --> 00:45:14,423
Seriously. I never imagined someone
would steal my shoes.

613
00:45:29,388 --> 00:45:30,507
Excuse me.

614
00:45:33,306 --> 00:45:34,825
Where is the owner?

615
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:37,297
-He's abroad on a business trip.
-Where?

616
00:45:37,382 --> 00:45:40,002
To Sudan to sell car parts
from scrapped cars.

617
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:43,482
Korean car parts are popular
in Africa these days.

618
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:46,250
-When did he go?
-Last week.

619
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:48,841
-Does he go abroad very often?
-Yes.

620
00:45:49,155 --> 00:45:51,763
The price of scrap iron
is too low these days.

621
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:56,354
So we make a living out of
exporting car parts from scrapped cars.

622
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:58,266
That's why he goes often.

623
00:45:58,351 --> 00:45:59,302
I see. Thanks.

624
00:46:17,883 --> 00:46:19,310
Wait for me!

625
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:22,265
Oh, gosh!

626
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,758
-Come home early.
-Okay.

627
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,329
Sir, we confirmed the alibi of the actor.

628
00:46:35,678 --> 00:46:37,080
He's certainly not the one.

629
00:46:39,068 --> 00:46:44,966
Spectacles, you investigate further
with the other actors and staff.

630
00:46:49,597 --> 00:46:50,542
Same old, same old.

631
00:46:52,015 --> 00:46:56,534
Yeah, you know. My wife cooks for me.

632
00:46:58,061 --> 00:47:00,299
I have to work late again. I'm so tired.

633
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,424
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

634
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,996
Hold on. How can I help you?

635
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,124
I was told to come and give
my statement as witness.

636
00:47:08,937 --> 00:47:09,771
I'll call you back.

637
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:11,488
Come with me.

638
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:25,629
-Gukdoo must be so busy.
-I'm worried.

639
00:47:25,714 --> 00:47:27,893
I regret sending him
to the police academy.

640
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,554
-Law school would have been better.
-What are you talking about?

641
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,872
Someone like Gukdoo
must be a policeman...

642
00:47:32,956 --> 00:47:34,908
...so we have a brighter future.

643
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:41,424
Alain De Botton,
a writer that I like said...

644
00:47:41,654 --> 00:47:43,749
"Earning a lot of money
and holding a high position..."

645
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:45,113
"...doesn't mean success."

646
00:47:45,198 --> 00:47:50,677
"It has to be success defined
by yourself, not by others."

647
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:54,971
Gukdoo probably thinks he's successful.

648
00:47:55,056 --> 00:47:56,784
Of course he is.

649
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:00,107
Here it is. Enjoy it.

650
00:48:00,908 --> 00:48:04,249
The pastry chef apron
looks so good on you.

651
00:48:07,065 --> 00:48:10,732
Thank you! Do you mean it?

652
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:13,029
Thank you!

653
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:19,633
How can you laugh when
the neighborhood is in trouble?

654
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:23,729
What did Gukdoo do while
the case became so serious?

655
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:29,239
Jinyi, don't try to tick me off
with absurd comments.

656
00:48:30,149 --> 00:48:32,511
So many people are dying of cancer.

657
00:48:32,596 --> 00:48:34,428
-What is Bonggi doing?
-What?

658
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:37,793
Bonggi is an orthopedist.

659
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,372
I can't talk to you.

660
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:42,161
Yes, don't talk to her.
Please get going.

661
00:48:42,246 --> 00:48:44,293
Anyway, I'll get going.

662
00:48:46,696 --> 00:48:49,427
-Bye. Goodbye.
-Bye.

663
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,471
-Can't you be more civilized?
-What?

664
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,692
How can you say that
after you heard what she said?

665
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:02,478
What does cancer have to do with Bonggi?

666
00:49:02,832 --> 00:49:05,277
She's a writer and she makes
such ignorant comments!

667
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,881
You started it!

668
00:49:06,966 --> 00:49:08,774
She's already worried about Gukdoo!

669
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:11,113
How can you ask her what he's doing?

670
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:15,155
What? Why do you smile like
an idiot when you're with her?

671
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,122
-I did not smile like an idiot!
-You can't look more like an idiot!

672
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,638
You give her everything, don't you?

673
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:22,692
You might even give her
all your entrails!

674
00:49:22,777 --> 00:49:25,861
When? When? Watch your mouth!

675
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:30,234
-You got quite daring.
-I won't tolerate it anymore!

676
00:49:32,157 --> 00:49:33,100
Where are you going?

677
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:54,105
Alain De Ron?

678
00:49:57,089 --> 00:50:00,303
Alain De Ton?

679
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:03,539
Where did Jinyi go
after she beat her husband?

680
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:07,916
To the hospital to give Bonggi
some clothes to change.

681
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:10,303
He got so beaten up.

682
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,709
Poor man.

683
00:50:13,332 --> 00:50:15,236
I feel so bad for him.

684
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:18,740
It makes me want to treat him
to some hot soup and rice.

685
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:21,218
I feel pity for him.

686
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:25,322
-Alain De Botton.
-Look at this eye.

687
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:27,659
Will it stay red for long?

688
00:50:27,744 --> 00:50:29,614
"Baek Tak Industries Development"

689
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:33,932
I thank Mr. Beak and
everyone for coming...

690
00:50:34,017 --> 00:50:40,238
...despite your busy schedule
to this countermeasure meeting.

691
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:46,414
Charles Go, the brain of
Baek Tak developments...

692
00:50:46,499 --> 00:50:49,080
...holds the MBA degree
of Harvard University.

693
00:50:49,164 --> 00:50:50,262
He's written...

694
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:56,480
"Economy of the 22nd Century!
No Worries, We'll Be Dead by Then"

695
00:50:56,565 --> 00:51:00,147
He'll come out to give
a presentation on our business.

696
00:51:00,232 --> 00:51:03,646
Please welcome him with
a big round of applause.

697
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:05,421
Now let's call him out.

698
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:08,677
Charles Go!

699
00:51:17,723 --> 00:51:20,155
Hello, I'm Charles Go.

700
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:25,070
Baek Tak Developments is facing
a very important time.

701
00:51:25,154 --> 00:51:28,038
It's the right time to
expand our business!

702
00:51:28,123 --> 00:51:31,720
But due to various
unwanted accidents, I know that...

703
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:34,747
...our CEO and many employees
are very concerned.

704
00:51:34,832 --> 00:51:37,978
The fate of a company
depends on its people!

705
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:43,000
It depends on how and when
you allocate your resources.

706
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,918
This is a report of the damages
our people suffered recently.

707
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:54,247
First, the redevelopment site
in Dobong-dong, Dobong-Gu.

708
00:51:54,332 --> 00:51:55,981
Seven men, including Kim Kwangbok.

709
00:51:56,299 --> 00:51:59,583
Second, three men
in Dobong-dong, Dobong-Gu.

710
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,892
Third, two men in the house
of Ainsoft's CEO, An Minhyuk.

711
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:07,249
Fourth, three men in the playground
near Dobong High School.

712
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:10,781
Surprisingly, they were attacked
by a woman called Do Bongsoon...

713
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:13,993
...aged 27 and of very small size.

714
00:52:14,078 --> 00:52:19,879
But these men were not
beaten by Do Bongsoon.

715
00:52:20,851 --> 00:52:22,814
It was Kang Banggu, aged 76.

716
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:26,206
She's an old woman that lives
in Goejeon-dong, Daegu.

717
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:32,216
But Kang Banggu turned out to be
Do Bongsoon's grandmother.

718
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:35,308
-What?
-Surprising?

719
00:52:35,392 --> 00:52:38,547
We were attacked by a family.

720
00:52:38,632 --> 00:52:40,631
It is a very scary organization.

721
00:52:40,898 --> 00:52:43,844
Now let me brief you about the damages.

722
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:46,069
A total of 15 men were injured.

723
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:48,094
Forty percent of them must be
treated for 28 weeks at a hospital.

724
00:52:48,178 --> 00:52:50,745
Six teeth were lost
and faces were crushed.

725
00:52:51,512 --> 00:52:53,414
Optic nerves damaged,
hearing was impaired!

726
00:52:53,499 --> 00:52:55,573
Ribs and femurs got fractured!

727
00:52:55,658 --> 00:52:58,755
Na Seonggi, who is the eldest son
of a family with few men...

728
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,579
...got injured in his testicles
that represent manliness!

729
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,299
The most serious aftereffect
they suffer are...

730
00:53:05,398 --> 00:53:09,806
...loss of confidence, anxiousness,
and fear of being attacked again!

731
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:11,533
Psychological trauma of women!

732
00:53:11,618 --> 00:53:14,500
Above all, the urge to avenge oneself!

733
00:53:14,585 --> 00:53:15,760
Cheolsoo!

734
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:18,082
-That's enough.
-It's Charles.

735
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:20,695
Forget it! That's enough!

736
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:24,810
Tell us what we can do!
We all know what happened!

737
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:25,931
There is...

738
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,173
...a way.

739
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:33,385
We'll take our revenge.

740
00:53:34,365 --> 00:53:37,571
-We'll defeat Do Bongsoon...
-That jerk.

741
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:40,204
...and clear our name from
bad rumors and reputation.

742
00:53:41,787 --> 00:53:43,705
Hey, hey! Stop! Stop!

743
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:47,455
So how do you suggest we defeat her?

744
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,886
We were beaten up,
we will rise up to beat up.

745
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:53,849
That is a gang fight!

746
00:53:53,934 --> 00:53:55,024
The last resort!

747
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:00,805
Gang to gang fight!

748
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:06,514
So we all beat her up together?

749
00:54:06,598 --> 00:54:08,233
No, no, no.

750
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,787
It'll be a one-on-one fight.

751
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,212
We live in a time where
the fist is stronger than the law.

752
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:17,158
We must build up our power
again on that basis!

753
00:54:17,243 --> 00:54:19,503
Okay, I get the logic.

754
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:22,128
How do we get Do Bongsoon here?
She won't just come!

755
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:26,930
There is a way.

756
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:29,344
That will be voice phishing.

757
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:35,630
Amazing! Yes, that's it!
Why didn't we think of that?

758
00:54:35,715 --> 00:54:36,974
He trained abroad, all right.

759
00:54:39,531 --> 00:54:40,969
So I have...

760
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:46,849
...invited some specialists in the area.

761
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:50,019
-Come out!
-Specialists! It's different!

762
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:54,377
What?

763
00:54:54,462 --> 00:54:55,461
Aren't they...

764
00:54:55,661 --> 00:54:58,085
-Aren't they comedians?
-Pull up your pants.

765
00:55:01,293 --> 00:55:02,126
Hello!

766
00:55:02,394 --> 00:55:03,826
Hello!

767
00:55:04,952 --> 00:55:06,326
-Hello.
-Hello.

768
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,924
Did he kidnap them?
They're comedians.

769
00:55:11,577 --> 00:55:13,181
How much do we pay them?

770
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,090
-Hey, hey.
-What?

771
00:55:17,174 --> 00:55:20,146
-Do we upload it in YouTube?
-What? No, never!

772
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:22,219
The boss won't like it.

773
00:55:22,465 --> 00:55:25,698
She wants a quiet life,
so we'll help her have it.

774
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:27,499
-Okay.
-Yeah.

775
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:29,550
Though...

776
00:55:29,847 --> 00:55:33,197
Punch! Kick!

777
00:55:35,076 --> 00:55:36,835
Do you have a death wish?

778
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:41,125
I think it won't be bad that
we let people know...

779
00:55:41,209 --> 00:55:44,434
...who's watching our back
and what she can do.

780
00:55:44,718 --> 00:55:45,551
What do you think?

781
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:47,876
Let's do it!

782
00:55:55,663 --> 00:55:56,678
What are you doing here?

783
00:55:57,623 --> 00:56:01,321
You're working on weekends
so I came to visit you.

784
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:03,077
-Wow!
-Here.

785
00:56:03,938 --> 00:56:06,475
-What's this?
-I got my salary.

786
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,877
I bought mom and dad a present,
but I want you to have it in cash.

787
00:56:09,962 --> 00:56:12,928
Whoa!
Awesome!

788
00:56:13,012 --> 00:56:15,173
-You must be busy. I'm off.
-Bongsoon.

789
00:56:18,784 --> 00:56:20,312
I like her, too.

790
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:24,875
I'd like to meet her,
but I shouldn't, right?

791
00:56:25,561 --> 00:56:27,251
Of course you shouldn't.

792
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:32,385
That's not fair play, so don't.

793
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:37,822
You're all grown up now,
getting into a love triangle.

794
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:39,959
-I'm off.
-Oh, come on.

795
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:41,773
Good luck to you, too!

796
00:56:42,285 --> 00:56:44,368
-For what?
-Go on a date.

797
00:56:44,689 --> 00:56:46,428
-With who?
-An Minhyuk.

798
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:48,829
I think he's a nice guy.

799
00:56:48,994 --> 00:56:51,821
As a doctor, I can say
he's not gay, at least.

800
00:56:51,906 --> 00:56:54,878
I think mom brainwashed you.
I'm off!

801
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,492
I'm on duty tonight.
I won't go home.

802
00:56:57,576 --> 00:56:59,057
I know!

803
00:57:00,314 --> 00:57:02,137
-Pick up your tools.
-Get ready!

804
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,557
We're fighting against Do Bongsoon.

805
00:57:04,642 --> 00:57:06,862
She is not an easy opponent.

806
00:57:06,947 --> 00:57:11,128
Poke her, roll her, beat her...

807
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:15,875
What are you doing?

808
00:57:16,843 --> 00:57:18,147
-Sir!
-Sir!

809
00:57:18,904 --> 00:57:20,937
You'll go armed to fight a girl?

810
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:23,067
I'm afraid someone might find out!

811
00:57:24,248 --> 00:57:29,538
Sir, it's Do Bongsoon.
She might kill all of us.

812
00:57:30,443 --> 00:57:31,497
You stay here!

813
00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:33,250
I'm ashamed of you.

814
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:35,862
Stay home.

815
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:37,832
Put that down and come.

816
00:57:37,982 --> 00:57:38,918
-Yes, sir!
-Yes!

817
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:44,761
Don't just leave it there.

818
00:57:56,022 --> 00:57:59,040
-Bongsoon! Bongsoon!
-Dad!

819
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:05,048
Dad, are you so happy
that mom is gone on a trip?

820
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:08,179
I feel great!

821
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,095
-Why are you so happy?
-Wait. One, two...!

822
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,543
-Hello?
-We have training today.

823
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:20,097
-I know.
-I'm in your neighborhood. Come out.

824
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:21,775
Right away.

825
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:31,174
To Bongsoon

826
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:43,050
To my pretty granddaughter Bongsoon.

827
00:58:44,178 --> 00:58:49,126
The little kid has now become a lady.

828
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:51,740
You even got a job.

829
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:56,202
You don't know how proud I'm of you.

830
00:58:56,743 --> 00:59:01,838
I know you can't lead
a normal life like the others.

831
00:59:02,643 --> 00:59:07,482
People might ask why be
ashamed of being strong.

832
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:09,946
But the world isn't so easy.

833
00:59:11,854 --> 00:59:16,180
They backbite and bully you
if you're different to them.

834
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:23,260
Bongsoon, I always told you to hide...

835
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:29,288
...but don't ever be
ashamed of your strength.

836
00:59:30,073 --> 00:59:36,840
Because it is a gift from heaven
that we must be used for the good.

837
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:40,629
I love you, my sweetie.

838
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:42,869
From your granny.

839
00:59:44,142 --> 00:59:47,452
Just do it. What's the problem?

840
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:51,478
Do it like you do it on TV.
It's all set up. Go ahead.

841
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:53,414
Sit.

842
00:59:56,231 --> 00:59:58,089
We'll get arrested
if it's real voice phishing.

843
00:59:58,173 --> 01:00:00,909
-Do we look like we're lawful?
-We never succeeded.

844
01:00:00,993 --> 01:00:03,454
So put your mind to
make it happen this time.

845
01:00:03,538 --> 01:00:05,368
Call this number. Plug it in.

846
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:09,931
They'll do a good job
if they want their limbs intact.

847
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:12,001
It doesn't fit.

848
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,761
-Hello?
-I said I'm coming.

849
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:34,131
She's coming.

850
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:38,238
-Hello?
-Bongsoon, help!

851
01:00:38,322 --> 01:00:41,297
They kidnapped me!

852
01:00:44,257 --> 01:00:47,224
Did you hear that?
We kidnapped your mom.

853
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:50,757
-What?
-So come to that address quickly.

854
01:00:50,842 --> 01:00:53,377
If you call the police...

855
01:00:53,743 --> 01:00:55,843
...your mom dies!

856
01:00:57,514 --> 01:01:00,444
-Kyungsim, mom got kidnapped!
-What?

857
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:04,835
-Try calling Mom.
-Hey! We should call the police.

858
01:01:04,919 --> 01:01:08,051
No, we can't call the police.

859
01:01:08,136 --> 01:01:09,799
-Mom!
-Hey!

860
01:01:10,098 --> 01:01:11,004
Sir!

861
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,605
See? They're professionals.

862
01:01:18,957 --> 01:01:20,867
Why isn't she picking up?

863
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:32,650
Please, pick up.

864
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:33,628
She doesn't pick up?

865
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:36,320
Why do you keep calling me?

866
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,777
-Were you not kidnapped?
-Kidnapped?

867
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,812
Why would anyone kidnap me?

868
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,391
It'll only make their lives miserable.

869
01:01:42,476 --> 01:01:44,204
But what are you talking about?

870
01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:46,525
Oh, never mind.

871
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:49,665
Have a lot of fun on your trip.

872
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:51,109
Bye.

873
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:54,930
-She didn't get kidnapped.
-Then what happened?

874
01:01:56,124 --> 01:01:57,658
-Voice phishing!
-What?

875
01:01:57,743 --> 01:01:59,099
-What do we do?
-Voice phishing?

876
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:01,123
How did they know she got paid?

877
01:02:12,842 --> 01:02:14,109
Mom!

878
01:02:15,408 --> 01:02:16,533
Mom!

879
01:02:18,496 --> 01:02:20,557
-Hello?
-Where are you?

880
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:23,798
I'll deduct 100,000 won for every
ten minutes you're late.

881
01:02:23,883 --> 01:02:27,436
Mr. An, my mom got kidnapped.

882
01:02:27,521 --> 01:02:29,110
-What?
-Mom!

883
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,644
Where are you? Do Bongsoon.

884
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,291
-Mom!
-Bongsoon!

885
01:02:37,227 --> 01:02:40,182
Gukdoo, it's Bongsoon's dad.

886
01:02:40,267 --> 01:02:41,103
Yes, sir.

887
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:45,401
What? I'll look into that.

888
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:53,965
Hello, Control Team?
Please locate Do Bongsoon.

889
01:02:57,695 --> 01:02:58,829
Locate Do Bongsoon.

890
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:39,015
Mom!

891
01:03:40,102 --> 01:03:41,527
Mom!

892
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:44,309
Mom...

893
01:04:42,752 --> 01:04:43,787
Hey.

894
01:04:45,534 --> 01:04:46,852
Where's my mom?

895
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:49,953
What? Your mom?

896
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:56,931
Hello?

897
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,461
Bongsoon, where are you?

898
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,370
Your mom's fine.

899
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,053
I think it was voice phishing.

900
01:05:05,138 --> 01:05:08,004
Yes, I think so.

901
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,959
Okay, don't worry. Bye.

902
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:17,189
Ms. Do Bongsoon.

903
01:05:18,703 --> 01:05:23,586
The reputation of our organization
got dumped into a poop bucket!

904
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:29,225
So let's have a fight.

905
01:05:30,276 --> 01:05:34,903
Oh, wait. Before we do,
get on your knees...

906
01:05:37,776 --> 01:05:43,176
...and beg for forgiveness
so we can film a video.

907
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:49,119
Okay.

908
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:52,091
-Let's do that.
-What?

909
01:05:52,176 --> 01:05:54,350
-Let's do that.
-Really?

910
01:05:56,634 --> 01:06:01,416
But you'll get on your knees, not me.

911
01:06:02,515 --> 01:06:04,199
Me? Me?

912
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:05,791
On my knees?

913
01:06:11,424 --> 01:06:13,319
What's that?

914
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:17,194
Walnuts?

915
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:41,647
Come at me.

916
01:06:42,974 --> 01:06:44,179
Let's begin.

917
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:16,327
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

918
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:20,069
Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes!

919
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:24,001
-Are you okay?
-She fainted!

920
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,977
You have to look happy.

921
01:07:30,623 --> 01:07:34,076
You're happy.
You're eating with Bongsoon.

922
01:07:34,161 --> 01:07:35,139
It's okay.

923
01:07:36,324 --> 01:07:38,634
Rich and flawless guys don't exist.

924
01:07:41,336 --> 01:07:43,673
Sorry. I won't look at her.

925
01:07:43,885 --> 01:07:44,993
Do as I say.

926
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:46,325
Okay.

927
01:07:49,123 --> 01:07:50,313
Are you okay?

928
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:53,838
We should put a computer generated halo.

929
01:08:00,178 --> 01:08:02,844
-Your lines.
-You have to do this...

930
01:08:02,929 --> 01:08:05,110
-I don't have lines here.
-But to do this...

931
01:08:05,188 --> 01:08:09,926
You have to come closer
and I should see your face.

932
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:12,593
That's how it works.

933
01:08:12,594 --> 01:08:15,010
-No, that can't be.
-What can't be?

934
01:08:15,074 --> 01:08:18,713
If I thought he was a man,
I wouldn't come at night...

935
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:21,029
...and stay up all night.
What am I saying?

936
01:08:21,452 --> 01:08:22,829
What are you saying?

937
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,443
You can see us all!

938
01:08:37,394 --> 01:08:38,820
Cut!
