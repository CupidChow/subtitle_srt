1
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:06,006
He surely is from the neighborhood.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,610
Sorry.

3
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:30,764
I smelled something unusual.

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,367
A rusty steel.

5
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:38,672
That smell of iron when you
touch something rusty...

6
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,543
...and the smell of grease, too.

7
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:58,392
If I use my strength,

8
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,460
will the world become
a better place?

9
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:12,018
The doors are closing.

10
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:18,211
My hand!

11
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,070
If there were a female warrior
like her in real life...

12
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,603
You'll get bugs in your mouth.

13
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:18,905
Hello, Sir.

14
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,208
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

15
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,046
It's for you.

16
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,635
-Let's get some hangover soup!
-What?

17
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:31,437
Let's go.

18
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:33,525
-Come on.
-Okay.

19
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:40,720
What is that?

20
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,133
This?

21
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,137
It's a wear... rubber?

22
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:51,738
Wear rubber.

23
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,341
-A wearable.
-Yes.

24
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,742
Anyhow.

25
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,145
Gukdoo gave it to me.

26
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,415
He said I can call him
anytime if I'm in danger.

27
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,617
I hope you won't have to use it.

28
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:05,419
What?

29
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,622
Actually, I almost pressed
the button this morning.

30
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:10,791
-Why?
-On my way to work,

31
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,093
I think I heard the voice
of the criminal.

32
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,895
-Where?
-In my neighborhood.

33
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,097
Near the subway station.

34
00:03:17,726 --> 00:03:22,536
-You sure? Did you see his face?
-No. He walked past me.

35
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:26,006
I'm worried.

36
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:30,610
You and I are both high-risk individuals.
I wonder if we should stay together.

37
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:34,881
I should hire someone
that can protect both of us.

38
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:42,589
No. Don't worry.
I will protect you at all costs.

39
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:52,265
You say you'll protect me and
what did you do to me yesterday?

40
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,869
Said you'd break all my teeth?

41
00:03:55,967 --> 00:04:00,173
-But I was...
-Don't ever drink again.

42
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,178
Mr. Kong left the hospital.
He'll come to work soon.

43
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,482
Then what will happen to me?

44
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:12,085
You're not my secretary,
you're my bodyguard.

45
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,725
I have a position for you.

46
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,828
You know I plan very carefully.

47
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,729
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,834
Yes, thank you.

49
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:30,730
-Hello, Sir.
-Good job.

50
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,139
-Thanks, Sir.
-Let's go.

51
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:37,644
Ta-da! You can study here
during your free time.

52
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,820
Study English vocabulary.
Words like "stock options" are in here.

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,522
Not "stop motion."

54
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,325
We're developing a new game.

55
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,828
I'm going to come to work
every day until it's launched.

56
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,631
-You can stay here and study.
-Oh, can I...

57
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,935
Can I join that project?

58
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,236
That project?

59
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:08,208
No. A promise is a promise.

60
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,010
After we catch the blackmailer.

61
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,479
Go and study.

62
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,559
Hey. The graphics are too sloppy.

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,676
I want a new draft for this.

64
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:30,430
Who drew it?

65
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:36,226
I want Mr. Jung to revise it
before they bring it to me. Bye.

66
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,982
Change the UI again.

67
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:04,264
We'll adjust the levels so that
beginners can also move up.

68
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,566
Then we need a new
character power-up system.

69
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,168
So people will spend money on it.

70
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:11,071
-No one wants to pay to win.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:12,672
I want something more exciting.

72
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:14,741
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

73
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,742
Go back to work.

74
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,384
Hi, Mr. Kim.

75
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,188
How are you?

76
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,991
Yes, I know.

77
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,931
Then maybe next week...

78
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,534
Oh, I'm sorry.

79
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,138
Yes, we can schedule
a meeting for next week.

80
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:47,140
Okay, bye.

81
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,454
Did you hear that? The director of
the ballet academy is missing.

82
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,457
No, she's not missing.

83
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,460
She's in Busan with her friends.

84
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:10,263
No! I heard she's in Sokcho
with her boyfriend.

85
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,364
-No.
-Sokcho?

86
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:15,168
The report was filed late
because she lives alone...

87
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:16,471
...but she surely is missing.

88
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:19,765
She never missed a class in
the three years she ran the ballet school.

89
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:25,345
She was absent without leave
and now they can't reach her.

90
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,247
Oh my goodness. That's horrible.

91
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:31,351
The woman that was murdered
and the one that was kidnapped...

92
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,752
...were both slim, weren't they?

93
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,342
Yes, the criminal is only after size XS.

94
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:38,042
Jinyi, I'm worried about Bongsoon!

95
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,161
-She's so thin.
-Mr. Do!

96
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:41,861
-What?
-Mr. Do!

97
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,263
-What? What is it?
-It's Bongsoon!

98
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,446
-What about Bongsoon?
-Look at her.

99
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:48,311
Oh, no!

100
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,405
-What is it?
-No, no. It's nothing!

101
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,607
No, no! No!

102
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,844
-What is it?
-No, don't watch! Stop! Oh, no!

103
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,322
To celebrate the launch
of the new game,

104
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:04,718
we will hold a cosplay event.
What item do you think is good?

105
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:11,758
The new system to choose...

106
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,860
Mom, I'm working. What is it?

107
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,163
-We're done for now!
-Why?

108
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,765
We have to leave the country.

109
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,201
I'm so ashamed I can't live
in this neighborhood anymore!

110
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,881
-What are you talking about?
-You haven't seen the video?

111
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:25,287
Video? What video?

112
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:30,210
Search "wasted pole dance".
Your face made the headlines!

113
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,320
Hello...

114
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,514
What?

115
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:38,418
What is it?

116
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:47,527
Bongsoon, are you okay?

117
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,135
I don't like it.

118
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:51,931
Don't take photos!
Stop taking photos! Stop!

119
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,735
Don't take photos!

120
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,238
I'm not an attraction!

121
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,743
It's not my fault that I'm strong!

122
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,949
Okay. Good job.

123
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,651
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

124
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,585
Okay.

125
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:18,792
Where is she now?

126
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:23,163
Ms. Do? Ms. Do?

127
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,370
Can't even study for ten minutes.

128
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,180
What are you doing?

129
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:42,982
What are you doing?

130
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:45,885
Excuse me.

131
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:48,602
Excuse me?

132
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,990
-No.
-What is it?

133
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,188
It's humiliating.

134
00:09:55,273 --> 00:09:58,180
Whoa, you're a celebrity now.

135
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,567
Can I get an autograph?
You're in trouble.

136
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:03,870
This will spread at the speed of light.
Even people in faraway Marado Island...

137
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,974
No, even people in Africa
will get to watch it.

138
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,277
I want to be alone. Give me that!

139
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,690
Go away!

140
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:18,685
Excuse me,
I think I saw you somewhere.

141
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,186
-You didn't.
-Yes, I did!

142
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:22,288
-No!
-You're the pole dancer, right?

143
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,591
-I'm not!
-What a scumbag.

144
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,194
-She begs for attention.
-What's that?

145
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,097
What? What?

146
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,096
-Isn't that Bongsoon?
-It is.

147
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,901
Sister!

148
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,803
-Sister!
-Sister!

149
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,007
-I shouldn't have pressed like!
-What is this?

150
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:51,084
Boss! Boss, look! Isn't this that wench?

151
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,487
-What wench?
-Do Bongsoon!

152
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,890
-It is!
-Yes, it's her.

153
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,993
She beats me to a pulp
and goes dancing?

154
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,196
-She's enjoying the party.
-She's enjoying the party.

155
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,899
But she plucked out the pole.

156
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,169
How would I know someone would film me?

157
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,272
If someone should be pissed off,
it's me, not you.

158
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,974
-Come in.
-I don't know. I'm hanging up!

159
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,946
-Sir, I'm back.
-Mr. Kong, you're back!

160
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,448
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes.

161
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,350
You went through so much trouble.

162
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:30,056
My neck hurts for lying
face down all day long.

163
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:35,461
I felt so powerless with
my manly body parts squashed.

164
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:37,964
You should take more days off.
Why are you here?

165
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,067
How could I do that?

166
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,736
By the way, I heard from
the patients next door...

167
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,929
...that they lost four teeth after
getting beaten up by Bongsoon.

168
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,443
One of them was beaten so badly
his voice fails every morning.

169
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,214
A broken tail bone was nothing.

170
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,317
It's nothing compared to that.

171
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,419
They were all beaten to a pulp.

172
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,523
Arms, ankles, ribs,
every bone got smashed.

173
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,825
Can you believe that?

174
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,311
She's a woman and she's strong
but like a brute.

175
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,501
Think about it Mr. An, she's so tiny.

176
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,901
How can she commit
such an act of brutality?

177
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,503
There are all sorts of rumors about her.

178
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:21,074
That she's a North Korean spy.
That she's an alien.

179
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,775
Mr. Kong.

180
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:28,881
I think you should keep
a distance from her.

181
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,112
Shouldn't you finish
handing over your tasks?

182
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,915
Take Mr. Kong and resolve it with him.

183
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:06,586
Okay.

184
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,388
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,307
Let's go.

186
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,404
This is An Minhyuk from Ainsoft.

187
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,076
How are you, Mr. Park?

188
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,377
I think your website needs
some monitoring.

189
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,080
Could you remove a video for me?

190
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,330
-Hello?
-It's An Minhyuk.

191
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:19,236
-Hi.
-Did you know?

192
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:22,511
Bongsoon thinks she ran into
the kidnapper on her way to work.

193
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:25,522
I think she heard his voice clearly.

194
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:29,836
Sometimes the audio impacts the
hippocampus more than an image.

195
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:31,413
Where is she?

196
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:35,007
She's here at work. Don't worry.
She's fine when she's with me.

197
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,110
The problem is when she's not.

198
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,606
I think you should
protect her as a witness.

199
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,782
I don't think a mere alert device will do.

200
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,085
I'll believe you understood. Bye.

201
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,293
Why didn't she tell me
something this important?

202
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,317
Darn it.

203
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,534
Hey...

204
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,337
-Where are you going?
-To protect my witness!

205
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,538
But...

206
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,644
-We're back, sir.
-Did you get anything?

207
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,981
It's a cloned phone so it's not
in the system. We'll track it.

208
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,884
The problem is,
we checked for the ballet teacher's car.

209
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,185
It disappeared without trace.

210
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,655
We checked the footage of
CCTVs over the last three days.

211
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,465
Her car disappeared
in Dobong-dong 39-Gil.

212
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,962
-Don't tell me.
-After that, it can't be tracked.

213
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,870
We found a car that was parked nearby...

214
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:36,269
...and contacted the owner to check the
dash cam, but he's out of the country.

215
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,872
He's coming back in three days,
so we'll check when he's back.

216
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:41,174
Excuse me...

217
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:45,344
-Does that hurt a lot?
-No, I just...

218
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,647
I only feel a twinge when I cough.

219
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,750
You don't want to break it again.

220
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,521
Be more careful now.
And watch your mouth, too.

221
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:59,225
You can't live the rest
of your life face down.

222
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,628
The powerlessness you felt
when that body part is squashed.

223
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,833
-I apologize once again.
-Oh, no, no.

224
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,335
You didn't do it intentionally.

225
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:14,240
Don't worry about what I told Mr. An.

226
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,642
I'm sorry about the backbiting.

227
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,744
That's okay.

228
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,148
Those aren't things
you can tell me directly.

229
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:25,117
But backbiting is cowardly.

230
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,821
It actually wasn't backbiting
because I was there.

231
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,826
Sorry.

232
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:38,097
As you know, his life is idle,
so nothing really happened.

233
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:46,005
I thought being his secretary
would be the most meaningless job.

234
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,907
Sorry.

235
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:52,612
So in conclusion, there's
nothing much I have to hand over.

236
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,015
I've had the chance to
dine with his family.

237
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,920
His father announced that
he'll leave the business to Mr. An.

238
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,155
His brothers looked as if
they were chewing insects,

239
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,728
while Mr. An unabashedly
said he'll think about it.

240
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,462
Well, so he'll think about it.
Anyway. Things like that happened.

241
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:12,064
Oh... Anything else?

242
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,967
No, nothing much.

243
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,869
He doesn't do much, you know.

244
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,938
Oh. Sorry.

245
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,042
Yes, Sir.

246
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,652
We have an emergency meeting
tomorrow with the developers.

247
00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:25,756
I want them in the meeting room by 11.

248
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:27,747
-Yes, Sir.
-And Bongsoon.

249
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,563
What are you doing there?
Come here quickly!

250
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,666
-Are you gossiping about me?
-What? Is this room wired?

251
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:38,192
-No. I'm sorry.
-What? Is it?

252
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:42,596
-No, no, it's not.
-Is my body wired, then?

253
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,943
Stop taking photos!

254
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,612
Stop taking photos!

255
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,185
Stop taking photos!

256
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,265
Stop taking photos!

257
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,691
I'm not an attraction!

258
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,094
-Bongsoon.
-Yes?

259
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:54,767
-Let's go now.
-Not my fault that I'm strong.

260
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,068
Let go of the pole.

261
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,471
The pole came to me.
You know that, right?

262
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,374
-Would you...
-I won't let it go. It's mine.

263
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,076
-It belongs to them.
-It's mine.

264
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:12,151
It's not my fault that I'm strong!

265
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:36,742
Do Bongsoon!

266
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,347
Gukdoo.

267
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,051
You broke into my house
without a warrant...

268
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,252
...and now you show up
in my office without knocking.

269
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:49,578
I came to check facts. Did you run
into the criminal this morning?

270
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:52,258
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I planned to tell you.

271
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,266
You planned to, but you didn't!

272
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:56,979
Why should your boss
be the one to tell me?

273
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:57,863
What?

274
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:05,037
I'm saying this because
I need your cooperation.

275
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:08,140
Did you request protective custody?

276
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,446
I already did. I'll come and pick her up
tonight. When is she done?

277
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:15,457
I'll give her a ride,
so don't worry about her.

278
00:20:15,552 --> 00:20:16,674
I'll pick her up.

279
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,163
Do Korean workers have
an exact finishing time?

280
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:21,053
That's why I'm asking
the employer.

281
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,156
-When will she finish?
-I'll give her a ride home.

282
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,585
-I'll pick her up.
-I'll give her a ride home.

283
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,361
I'll pick her up.

284
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:33,666
Don't do this because of me.

285
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:35,569
I'm really fine.

286
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:40,452
Having an argument because of me,

287
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:44,643
it makes me feel very uncomfortable.

288
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:46,245
Okay?

289
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,450
Okay, then you pick her up.

290
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:51,183
-No, you do it.
-Police must protect witnesses.

291
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,252
No, the employer must protect her.

292
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,155
-The police should!
-You're responsible for it.

293
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,957
You must protect your witness!

294
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,925
She's your employee.
You should protect her!

295
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:03,129
-You give her the ride!
-Isn't she on your premises?

296
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,522
He can't give you a ride after all.

297
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:13,005
Like he's the busiest policeman in Korea.

298
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,808
He should be after the criminal
instead of taking you home.

299
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:18,210
-Stop it.
-Okay.

300
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,513
The employer protects the employee.

301
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,751
But are you not my bodyguard?
Something's switched.

302
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,420
Mr. An, I'm getting off work...

303
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,823
...and you're going for
walnut pies, aren't you?

304
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,515
You said you'd drop me off
and insisted when I refused.

305
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:37,218
I told you I would go alone.

306
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:38,998
Is the walnut shop this way?

307
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,211
-26 MA 4453.
-What?

308
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,213
Look, 26 MA 4453.

309
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,115
-We got it! Sir, we found 4453.
-We got it?

310
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,213
-Here!
-Did we get it?

311
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,418
It's in an alley in
Dobong 3-dong 40-Gil.

312
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,619
-Did we find it?
-Yes.

313
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,522
-Here.
-Good! Let's go!

314
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,928
-It's the same guy.
-I know.

315
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:11,630
He's after weak and slim women.
That scumbag.

316
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,933
-It's here. Pull over.
-Okay.

317
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:36,422
No more CCTVs from here.

318
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,324
I can see that.

319
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:12,892
Hello.

320
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,062
How can I help you?

321
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,165
Are you here to scrap your car
or buy a part?

322
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,334
We're the police.

323
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,236
We're looking for a car.

324
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,539
A silver 2001 model. It's this car.

325
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:31,543
-Have you ever seen it?
-How recent?

326
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:35,147
-Two to three days ago.
-No, not a silver 2001 model.

327
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,657
Excuse me. Are you the owner?

328
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:48,160
No, he's not here now.

329
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:57,884
Call us if you see that car.
Here's my number.

330
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,672
Okay, I will.

331
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,174
Thank you.

332
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,967
I'll take all of this and the pie.

333
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:21,660
Okay.

334
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,672
-Oh, Mr. An.
-Hello.

335
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:31,470
Hello.

336
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,373
-Did you come to get pies?
-Yes.

337
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:48,053
No, please. No need to pay.

338
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,855
We're like family.

339
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:55,260
Bongsoon is my daughter
and she's part of your company.

340
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:59,164
I think that means we're all a family.

341
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:06,238
-Oh. But you should be selling...
-Oh, no. That's fine.

342
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:10,261
Just don't eat too many
walnut pies at once.

343
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:13,145
-I won't.
-You'll get diarrhea.

344
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,751
We have to go.
Mom, we're off now.

345
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,855
Bye, everyone!
Bye, everyone! Bye, Mom!

346
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:24,623
See you again!

347
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:28,627
He's gone.
He came in his luxury car again?

348
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,929
He looks so sleek and elegant.

349
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,799
-Here.
-Thanks.

350
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:36,502
May I know where Doctor Do Bonggi is?

351
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,103
He's doing his round visit.

352
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,606
-When will he be done?
-I'm not sure.

353
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:42,775
I think it'll take him
another hour more.

354
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,882
Okay. Thank you.

355
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,880
Titled "Turn On The Boiler."

356
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,848
The wind is blowing.

357
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,450
The wind is blowing in my bones.

358
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,853
Will you stop that?

359
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,257
-Okay.
-Gosh, this nurse...

360
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:01,060
-I'll memorize it, sir.
-By the way...

361
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,852
What will you do about her
after you leave here?

362
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:08,367
You know what I'll do.
I'll knock her over.

363
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:11,470
Should I find her and bury her now?

364
00:26:12,182 --> 00:26:15,674
I don't know how much truth
there is to these rumors.

365
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,341
But some say her brother
is a doctor in this hospital.

366
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,247
-What?
-According to Hyun Tak.

367
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,817
Her brother is a doctor here.

368
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:29,523
Her dad runs Dobong Walnuts
and her mom is a housekeeper,

369
00:26:29,626 --> 00:26:32,124
but she hardly stays at home.

370
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,928
Leave her to me.

371
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,532
I'm going to crush her.

372
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,235
You'll die if you face her alone.

373
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,571
Shut your mouth, jerk.

374
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,243
I will recover my broken pride myself.

375
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,181
I will break her spine.

376
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,919
I'll bend her in two.

377
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,689
-What?
-I'll...

378
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,128
-What are you doing? Doctor?
-What are you doing, doctor?

379
00:27:08,228 --> 00:27:10,028
What are you doing?

380
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,800
His mouth needs more healing.

381
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,602
It needs dressing
so it won't get infected.

382
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:21,673
What kind of dressing is this?
He needs a hole there to eat!

383
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,177
-He's a mummy now.
-Doctor, I can't see.

384
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:27,146
I'm the doctor here.

385
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,849
If it gets infected,
the face will get even more rotten.

386
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,553
But...

387
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:37,122
It'll get infected?

388
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,826
I think I got the vaccine for hepatitis B.

389
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,228
Oh, Heeji.

390
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,031
Right, you have treatment
scheduled today.

391
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:50,335
Yes, but the waiting takes longer than
the actual treatment.

392
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:53,038
-When will you finish today?
-I'm on duty tonight,

393
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,540
so I'm staying here all night.

394
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,142
-What about tomorrow?
-I finish early tomorrow.

395
00:27:57,247 --> 00:27:59,044
Then let's meet up tomorrow at night.

396
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,446
Wait, you might be tired
after working all night long.

397
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:03,849
Let's still meet up.

398
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:08,253
-Okay, let's do that.
-My doctor must be really good.

399
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:12,057
I'm healing too fast.
It shouldn't be so fast.

400
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,443
I wish it would take longer.

401
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:20,666
Oh, it usually takes long to heal.

402
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:24,252
You have to visit your doctor
even if it feels alright.

403
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:29,041
Really? Then I'll keep coming.

404
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:35,113
Heeji, you have an appointment
with the doctor today, right?

405
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,117
Get the treatment and call me
when you're done.

406
00:28:38,394 --> 00:28:39,818
I think I should go.

407
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:42,921
Our conversation was too short
compared to how long I waited.

408
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:45,691
We can have a longer
conversation tomorrow.

409
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,897
-Okay.
-Bye.

410
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:48,794
Okay.

411
00:28:52,287 --> 00:28:54,136
"Call me when you're done."

412
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,009
Hey, Gukdoo!

413
00:29:04,506 --> 00:29:06,111
-What are you doing?
-Coming!

414
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,650
"The video has been deleted"

415
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,223
Knock, knock.
Is the wasted pole dancer here?

416
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:19,858
-Stop calling me that.
-The wasted pole dancer.

417
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:21,471
-Stop it. Hey!
-Wasted dancer.

418
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:23,463
A disaster in a nightclub.

419
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,533
"The video has been deleted"

420
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,036
-The video disappeared.
- What?

421
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,437
I thought you asked them to remove it.

422
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:34,640
-I didn't.
-Then who removed it?

423
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,820
The person in question
has to request to remove it.

424
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:38,110
Who did it?

425
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,631
Someone appearing in that video.

426
00:29:40,716 --> 00:29:43,415
Me, you, or Bonggi...

427
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,585
-Or your gay boss?
-What? He'd never do that.

428
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:49,488
He'd spread the video widely.

429
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,490
There you go again.

430
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,192
You said he was a nice guy.

431
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,295
Old habits die hard.

432
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:00,108
His tone and his mind-set...

433
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:04,670
-You're so inconsistent.
-I'm not inconsistent, he is.

434
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,771
No.

435
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:09,975
He's consistently weird.

436
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,978
Hey, that's not what matters.

437
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,668
No matter how I look at it,
I don't think he's gay.

438
00:30:15,753 --> 00:30:17,049
He is, for sure!

439
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,419
He got so excited telling me
that Gukdoo's butt is nice.

440
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,621
Gukdoo's butt is nice.

441
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,924
It's so toned and perky.

442
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:29,328
Hey, how do you know
Gukdoo's butt is nice?

443
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:32,130
You can tell right away.
It's so obvious.

444
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:36,935
Why is even his butt nice?
That's so frustrating.

445
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:39,538
Now not only women, but men too.

446
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,341
I hate competition.

447
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:46,144
Bongsoon, why don't we...

448
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,848
...make some spicy stew with pork meat,

449
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:54,653
half a tofu, ripe kimchi,
and a pair of red peppers?

450
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,923
And we decorate it with a crown daisy.

451
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,424
A mixed stew would be so good.

452
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:00,759
Okay!

453
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,405
The store is right around the corner.

454
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,774
It's only tofu.
Why is she taking so long?

455
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:28,019
Why isn't she picking up?

456
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:36,922
How dare you hurt my friend?

457
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,094
Kyungsim!

458
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,797
Kyungsim!

459
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:48,400
Oh my gosh!

460
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:51,503
I'm sorry!

461
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,208
Wake up.

462
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:00,954
Bongsoon!

463
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:02,954
How is she?

464
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,367
Don't worry. Her rib fracture
and contusions are severe,

465
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,620
but her organs are intact
and she's conscious.

466
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,722
She's athletic,
so she'll recover fast.

467
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,424
Thank God.

468
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:18,265
-I'll take her to her room.
-Okay.

469
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:38,884
Kyungsim, are you okay?
Do you recognize me?

470
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,187
I'm sorry, Kyungsim.

471
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:45,290
I should have gone for the tofu.

472
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,694
What about the stew?

473
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,099
Leave me some, okay?

474
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,705
You're fine now.

475
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:02,507
Take rest.

476
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,703
We'll lose all the young ladies
if we don't do something.

477
00:34:07,787 --> 00:34:11,917
Let's make teams of three people
and protect them ourselves.

478
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:13,218
-Yes.
-Right, right.

479
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,122
It's our neighborhood,
so we must protect it.

480
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,621
-Right.
-What's the cut-off line?

481
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,791
Young ladies from age 17 to 30.

482
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,895
I don't agree. Some women
in their 40s look like teenagers.

483
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:28,400
And the criminal doesn't mind
if they're 16 or 17.

484
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,403
Anyway, slim young ladies.

485
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:36,107
I think he's after them,
so we prioritize...

486
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:42,080
Do you mean fat women
don't even deserve protection?

487
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,985
I can't believe I'm discriminated
in a situation like this.

488
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,585
Oh, please!

489
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:50,188
The kidnapper would have
a hard time with heavy women.

490
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,192
Why get angry at this?

491
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,059
Says who? The kidnapper?

492
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,995
-He can't lift heavy women?
-Sit down!

493
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,497
If that's how it is,
he shouldn't be the kidnapper!

494
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,501
Anyway! We're closed...

495
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:05,183
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

496
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:06,771
Good evening, ladies.

497
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,474
-Here it is, ma'am.
-Please read it.

498
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,276
Give them one, too.

499
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:16,948
Excuse me. This is an emergency
meeting to discuss about security.

500
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,317
Can you come back later?

501
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,019
Are you the leader of the committee?

502
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,754
Yes, I am, but...

503
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:26,858
May I have a minute? Please, sit.

504
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:28,660
Okay...

505
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,477
Good evening.

506
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,381
I'm from Baektak Developments,
the developer of Saebit.

507
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,384
My name is Baek Tak.

508
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,984
Let me introduce you to my employees.

509
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:54,786
-Good evening!
-Good evening!

510
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:01,259
We know how concerned you are about
the recent series of misfortunes.

511
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:04,362
We'd like to offer our condolences.

512
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,966
-Guys.
-We're sorry.

513
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,238
You might think redevelopment...

514
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,741
...in such unrestful and
tumultuous times isn't right.

515
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:20,345
But I believe that is why
we and the neighbors...

516
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:24,449
...should cooperate even more.

517
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,550
Excuse me.

518
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,255
What are you talking about?

519
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:33,327
What I'm talking about is how
we'd like to protect Dobong-dong.

520
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:37,831
Judo, hapkido, jiu jitsu, boxing,
Muay Thai, and taekwondo.

521
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,217
Our 60 employees are highly
trained in these areas.

522
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,114
We will offer protection
in groups of three.

523
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,706
Have you ever heard of
Yeomni-dong Salt Way?

524
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,208
No, I haven't heard of it.

525
00:36:51,805 --> 00:36:53,611
You don't read the newspaper.

526
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,514
Anyhow, it's a good example of
neighbors working together with...

527
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:58,616
...developers and public officials
to create a crime-free alley.

528
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:02,020
Buildings are left for demolition
due to opposition to development.

529
00:37:02,122 --> 00:37:05,423
And that shady atmosphere
has affected you for three years.

530
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:09,332
The alleys and Dobong-dong must be
redeveloped as soon as possible...

531
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:13,531
...to bring life to the streets
and prevent crimes!

532
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:17,736
However, hasty construction can
lead to rough-and-ready buildings.

533
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:23,341
So we believe offering you
protection and safety first...

534
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:28,246
...would be the true noblesse oblige.

535
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,852
Look at our employees.

536
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,123
Don't they look strong and trustworthy?

537
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,923
Criminals wouldn't dare
commit a crime.

538
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,327
They'll lose the motivation
after they see them.

539
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:49,100
We'll provide our protection
services starting tomorrow.

540
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,006
But...

541
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,881
You know what?

542
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:05,383
They're scarier than the criminal.

543
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:08,086
I can't distinguish
the criminal from the protector.

544
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:12,290
Things got so weird. What do we do?

545
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:14,793
Listen.

546
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,297
Let's ignore them
and we can start patrolling...

547
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:23,099
...from the bus stop to the alley
next to the laundry shop.

548
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:27,539
We should patrol from 10 PM.

549
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,340
Yes, we should do that.

550
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,944
Okay. Then let's team up.

551
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,548
-Groups of three.
-Three on each team.

552
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:42,453
Let me see.

553
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,257
Look what he did to your pretty face.

554
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:51,079
If I catch that scumbag,
I'll break all his bones.

555
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,764
Oh, how scary.

556
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,599
But...

557
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:59,473
-I think my nose is broken.
-No, they said it's fine.

558
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,091
It's not. It used to be taller.

559
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,908
It's flat now.

560
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,480
Because your face is swollen.

561
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,681
No, I know my nose.

562
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,686
I could make it taller this time.

563
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:16,588
Now you're feeling better, right?
I guess I can go to work, then.

564
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,456
No, I'm in so much pain.

565
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:21,159
-It hurts.
-Don't move, don't move.

566
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,363
-You know what, Bongsoon?
-What?

567
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,768
I got really scared.
I thought I'd die there.

568
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:36,407
I was rescued by my strong friend.

569
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:41,304
I don't want to imagine
what happened to the other girls.

570
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:43,738
It's scary.

571
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,889
Kyungsim! Are you okay?

572
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:53,691
Yes, I'm fine.
My ribs hurt a little.

573
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,363
What kind of scum did this to you?

574
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:59,867
I should find him
and break his bones one by one!

575
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:02,867
-Goodness!
-You didn't call my mom, right?

576
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:06,170
You asked me to not call her,
so I didn't, but...

577
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:09,574
She has a weak heart.
She's not like you.

578
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:16,198
You should have gone for the tofu.
You know the streets aren't safe.

579
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:20,184
-Why did you let her go?
-Stop. I'm regretting it already.

580
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,887
You'd have caught the criminal
if you went for the tofu.

581
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,290
He might not appear
in front of you anymore.

582
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,891
You missed a good chance.

583
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:31,095
That was so close.
You could have caught him.

584
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,798
My goodness.

585
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,500
Oh, Kyungsim.

586
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,403
My goodness. You could
take this chance and...

587
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,011
Never mind.

588
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,107
My goodness.

589
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,109
Darn it!

590
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,880
He thinks he's at home in the streets?

591
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,584
-Hey, is your friend okay?
-Yes, thankfully she is.

592
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:56,590
She's conscious now and was
transferred to the general ward.

593
00:40:57,891 --> 00:41:02,994
What I don't understand is
why did he suddenly run away?

594
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,165
-It's weird.
-The witness is conscious.

595
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,798
I'll go and interrogate her.

596
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:10,304
Yes, you should, but...
I really don't get it.

597
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:12,403
-Go quickly and do it.
-Yes, sir.

598
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:19,514
Hello.

599
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,916
Why are there so many?

600
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:25,616
-I'll take this one.
-Yes, sir.

601
00:41:57,774 --> 00:41:59,183
Mr. Kong, come to my office.

602
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:08,993
I'm here, sir.

603
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,604
Stay with me.

604
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,600
W-What?

605
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,802
- It feels empty.
- What do you mean?

606
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,505
Just sit at that desk.
You don't need to do anything.

607
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,407
Can you stay with me?

608
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,612
You find out how important someone is
when they're gone.

609
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:41,726
I guess you felt lonely without me.

610
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,279
But when is she coming back?

611
00:43:07,763 --> 00:43:10,254
-What's this?
-It's White Day.

612
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:19,697
How long?

613
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,928
Two or three weeks. You'll get better.

614
00:43:23,012 --> 00:43:24,602
-Kyungsim.
-Hey there.

615
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:29,073
Is this a classmates' reunion?
You've all gathered thanks to me.

616
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:33,277
Are you okay?

617
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:36,380
Did you find any clues
to catch the offender?

618
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:37,566
No, not yet.

619
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,786
So I have to ask many questions.

620
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:43,788
What happened exactly?

621
00:43:43,891 --> 00:43:46,157
I was on my way back from getting tofu...

622
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,660
...and felt chills down my back.
He was following me.

623
00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:53,464
So I started to run,
but he showed up in front of me.

624
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:59,072
I still get the chills. It was so scary.

625
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,574
-You're fine.
-Bongsoon saved me.

626
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:06,677
So he ran away as soon as
Bongsoon appeared?

627
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,679
Yes, she just...

628
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,587
She screamed really loud.

629
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,690
You know she has a loud voice.

630
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:21,726
-Right?
-Right, right.

631
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,127
It's really loud.

632
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,697
He ran away because
Bongsoon screamed?

633
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,099
What? Yes.

634
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:29,200
Then...

635
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:31,405
Did you see his face?

636
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:32,703
That guy...

637
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,307
...didn't have a face.

638
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,142
What?

639
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,662
Shut up.

640
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:14,845
I said shut up!

641
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:25,056
Why didn't you use the alert device?

642
00:45:25,183 --> 00:45:27,158
You're supposed to use it
in those kind of situations.

643
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:29,660
I forgot and I left it at home.

644
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,863
That's your problem!
How can you forget that?

645
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,667
You always forgot materials
when we were in school, too.

646
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,869
You borrowed gym suits
because you forgot yours.

647
00:45:47,796 --> 00:45:49,146
Are you okay?

648
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,853
You really drive me nuts.

649
00:45:57,976 --> 00:46:00,258
How many times has he seen your face?

650
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,660
You can't stay in
the neighborhood anymore.

651
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:07,968
-You should go hide somewhere.
-Hide where? I have to go to work.

652
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:09,592
You should just go to your boss...

653
00:46:13,794 --> 00:46:15,139
Stay in your boss's house.

654
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,143
The criminal won't find you there.
I think that's better.

655
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:22,647
Don't worry, Gukdoo.

656
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:29,296
There's something I'm good at
though you don't know about it.

657
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,694
So don't worry.

658
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:32,156
Good at what?

659
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:34,358
Screaming loud?

660
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,632
Go in hiding in his house
until I catch that criminal.

661
00:46:38,765 --> 00:46:40,965
Stay there, okay?

662
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,371
Listen to me.

663
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:48,459
I'm off.

664
00:47:10,419 --> 00:47:11,629
You fool.

665
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:22,440
Oh, I hope your ribs heal quickly.

666
00:47:22,526 --> 00:47:26,344
I asked your mom
to make some poo wine.

667
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:30,150
Mom, I'd rather die than drink that.

668
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,150
What? Don't underestimate its effect.

669
00:47:33,954 --> 00:47:36,620
-I'm going to work tomorrow.
-I'll take care of her.

670
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:38,322
You go and be with him.

671
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,828
Kyungsim, I hope you recover soon.

672
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,831
-We have a stew to eat.
-Okay.

673
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:50,334
Bongsoon.
You have to watch out, okay?

674
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:52,921
Eat up.

675
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,540
Come in.

676
00:48:09,524 --> 00:48:11,350
I have a request to ask.

677
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,928
I suppose you heard about
Bongsoon's friend.

678
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,360
Yes, I heard.

679
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,263
-Thank God it wasn't much worse.
-So I was thinking...

680
00:48:21,435 --> 00:48:23,134
Bongsoon should hide in your house.

681
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:26,036
The criminal saw her face three times.

682
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,339
It's too dangerous if she stays
in the neighborhood.

683
00:48:28,442 --> 00:48:32,943
You really don't know
anything about Bongsoon.

684
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,523
Okay, I got your point.

685
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:40,851
You're only providing her shelter.
Don't you dare touch her.

686
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:41,852
Wait.

687
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:46,757
Is Bongsoon your friend?

688
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:49,560
Are you worried about her as a friend?

689
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:51,962
I don't have to answer to that.

690
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:55,566
No, you don't have to.

691
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,271
Wait.

692
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:05,157
I didn't want to mention this...

693
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:09,180
...but why do you talk down to me?
We're the same age.

694
00:49:10,684 --> 00:49:13,153
You're using your
public authority for this?

695
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:15,252
That's my personal information.

696
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:19,256
So I didn't want to mention it,
but you're being immoderate.

697
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:23,761
Please don't tell Bongsoon
that we're the same age.

698
00:49:23,862 --> 00:49:26,063
If you talk to me respectfully.

699
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:28,165
Or should I talk down to you?

700
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:32,369
Then...

701
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,973
Please take good care of Bongsoon.

702
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:48,986
Bongsoon, I don't think
it's a one-sided love.

703
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:13,177
-Yes?
-I asked your boss.

704
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:18,085
So no matter what happens,
don't worry because I'll be there.

705
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:19,683
Okay?

706
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,086
Okay, thanks.

707
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:24,889
I'll give you a ride tomorrow to work.

708
00:50:24,994 --> 00:50:27,895
They'll patrol your house
tonight in shifts.

709
00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:29,493
So rest assured and sleep tight.

710
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:33,000
Okay. You, too. Goodnight.

711
00:50:33,097 --> 00:50:33,797
Bye.

712
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:23,993
Hi, Gukdoo.

713
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,016
-Why is your skirt so short?
-What?

714
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:29,237
Why are you wearing that?
And what about your makeup?

715
00:51:29,322 --> 00:51:31,822
Why? Do I look weird?

716
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,325
Try to not look so pretty.

717
00:51:43,176 --> 00:51:44,168
Get in the car.

718
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:46,869
Okay.

719
00:51:58,988 --> 00:52:01,742
You have to be careful, okay?

720
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:05,222
And press that button
if anything happens.

721
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:10,442
I'll call you later. Go inside.

722
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:14,565
-Go.
-Go inside.

723
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,551
-You go first.
-Go inside.

724
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:23,474
You go first. Bye, Gukdoo.

725
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:25,676
Thanks.

726
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,484
Seriously?

727
00:52:37,182 --> 00:52:39,493
Go inside. You heard him.

728
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,609
-Ms. Do.
-Oh, Mr. An.

729
00:52:58,712 --> 00:53:00,414
You must be very shocked after
what happened to your friend.

730
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:01,712
You didn't bow.

731
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:06,717
Oh, right. Mr. An,
thanks for the day off.

732
00:53:07,321 --> 00:53:10,521
You can deduct it from my salary.

733
00:53:26,907 --> 00:53:28,242
-Hey, Bongsoon.
-Yes?

734
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,644
-Pull yourself together.
-What?

735
00:53:30,744 --> 00:53:32,212
You're scaring me.

736
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:34,311
I didn't do anything.

737
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,153
Try to not look so pretty.

738
00:53:52,044 --> 00:53:53,764
"Try to not look so pretty."

739
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:02,432
Try to not look so pretty.

740
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:08,445
Try to not look...

741
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,119
You're pretty.

742
00:54:23,183 --> 00:54:26,196
Gukdoo, you make me shy.

743
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,699
Oh, my gosh.

744
00:54:41,386 --> 00:54:44,348
Hey! You'll stay in my house
for a while from today.

745
00:54:45,037 --> 00:54:46,617
Orders from the cop
that you like so much.

746
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:48,333
I'm only cooperating as your employer.

747
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,988
-I'll owe you a big favor.
-Okay.

748
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,991
I'm fine, you see.

749
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:55,796
But it's Gukdoo.

750
00:54:55,893 --> 00:55:00,297
He's worried about me. Really worried.

751
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,699
I guess he really cares about me.

752
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,806
Well, he should be worried.

753
00:55:05,906 --> 00:55:09,107
He thinks the criminal is after me.

754
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:12,009
No wonder he's worried.

755
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,816
It's a criminal that swings an iron bat.

756
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:20,417
And you smile? You're scaring me.
People might think you're crazy.

757
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:24,221
-Did I smile?
-You surprise me each time.

758
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,523
You're full of different personalities.

759
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:27,624
Right?

760
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:36,333
-When is the meeting?
-In 30 minutes.

761
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:39,837
-And also...
-I can't concentrate.

762
00:55:42,754 --> 00:55:47,162
Gukdoo is a smart boy.
He didn't take after his mother.

763
00:55:47,247 --> 00:55:49,847
How did he come up with the idea
of sending her to her boss'?

764
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:51,348
I'm so thankful to him.

765
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:56,253
You're sending your daughter to a
man's house. How can you look so happy?

766
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,457
Can you tell?
I can't hide my feelings.

767
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:02,159
Is money so important to you?

768
00:56:02,346 --> 00:56:04,528
Then why not go and
be a maid for Mansour?

769
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:08,227
I'll marry Bongsoon off to a
rich man so she lives in luxury.

770
00:56:08,346 --> 00:56:09,933
So she doesn't live
a miserable life like me.

771
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:10,801
Miserab...

772
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:23,080
We're very strict with our children.

773
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,282
It wasn't an easy decision.

774
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:29,923
We thought we should help Mr. An
in putting his philosophy...

775
00:56:30,023 --> 00:56:34,001
...of love for employees
to practice, you know.

776
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,393
What's all this?

777
00:56:36,496 --> 00:56:39,029
Oh! Put it in the car quickly.

778
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,831
Oh, right.

779
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,836
Here, please.

780
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:47,420
But what is this?

781
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:52,409
They should sleep together
in that bedding. They must.

782
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:55,712
Sleep together?

783
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,286
I'm kidding!

784
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:01,588
-I'm just kidding.
-Okay.

785
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:03,186
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

786
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:05,856
Please.

787
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,761
Goodbye!

788
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:16,967
They must sleep together.

789
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,371
-Sir.
-What?

790
00:57:22,754 --> 00:57:25,943
We can't track down that car after
it disappeared in that location.

791
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,754
-Really?
-No CCTVs or dash cams...

792
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,447
...were found in that alley.

793
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:33,684
He knows Dobong-dong very well.

794
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:38,588
Sir, he might be after my friend.
We must hurry and catch him.

795
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:41,959
This is a confidential case.
Everyone shut your mouths.

796
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,129
Don't even mention the world "serial"
or we'll have reporters storming in.

797
00:57:46,263 --> 00:57:47,965
Then our efforts will come to nothing.

798
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,266
Let's go back to work.

799
00:57:52,378 --> 00:57:55,072
Sir, he was wearing a mask.

800
00:57:55,164 --> 00:57:58,675
-Keep it down.
-A mask covering his whole face.

801
00:57:58,764 --> 00:58:00,544
Shouldn't we get an identikit?

802
00:58:03,365 --> 00:58:04,748
Watch your mouths.

803
00:58:06,548 --> 00:58:07,384
Understood?

804
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:09,486
Go back to work.

805
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:22,699
I think I should unpack my clothes.

806
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:31,008
Oh, but...

807
00:58:32,113 --> 00:58:34,378
This is...

808
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:38,382
Your mom has a very elegant taste.

809
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:42,414
-Very pretty.
-I'm picky with beds.

810
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,421
No, it's good. It's pretty.

811
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,719
I can't sleep.

812
00:59:16,913 --> 00:59:18,525
Is Bongsoon asleep?

813
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:26,530
So you're in your boss's house?

814
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,932
Yes, how are you feeling?

815
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,935
I'm recovering at the speed of light.

816
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,554
The police are on guard outside my room.

817
00:59:34,638 --> 00:59:36,239
I feel like a celebrity.

818
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,546
Hey, don't get ideas
and stay in your room.

819
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:41,645
Okay, okay.

820
00:59:41,742 --> 00:59:45,348
Ask her if she's sleeping
with him in that bedding.

821
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:48,752
She wouldn't be able to talk to me
if she was sleeping with him.

822
00:59:49,356 --> 00:59:51,825
Don't you forget.
You can't be left alone, okay?

823
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:56,026
-Don't worry. Don't worry. Bye.
-Bongsoon, you must sleep...

824
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,329
This is so frustrating.

825
01:00:20,856 --> 01:00:21,785
Hey!

826
01:00:29,638 --> 01:00:32,929
It's a cat! Kitty, kitty.

827
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,035
Let's go.

828
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,571
Get that off me!

829
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,741
Let's go.

830
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,811
Take the lead.

831
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:30,751
I think he's really only after
weak and slim girls.

832
01:02:30,836 --> 01:02:32,249
Gukdoo, look.

833
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:43,426
The first two victims...

834
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:46,329
Hey! Gukdoo.

835
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:49,232
-Sorry. I'll be right back.
-Okay, but...

836
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,234
Hey! Where are you going?

837
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,417
Oh?

838
01:03:04,338 --> 01:03:07,317
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing here?

839
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,653
I followed you.
I thought you were sleepwalking.

840
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:11,554
Why did you come here?

841
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,958
I'm going to catch him
with my own hands.

842
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,560
Let's go home and talk about this.

843
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,064
I've always hidden my strength.

844
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:23,967
But now,

845
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:29,973
I want to use this strength the right way.

846
01:03:54,106 --> 01:03:55,799
What is he doing here?

847
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:09,730
I should stay here, too.

848
01:04:45,105 --> 01:04:46,509
"Strong Woman Do Bongsoon"

849
01:04:46,593 --> 01:04:47,584
She's my bodyguard.

850
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:50,687
You're not making any sense!
She's a weak and feeble woman!

851
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:55,191
I tried to control myself.
I really tried, but I can't!

852
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,992
Okay, here we go.

853
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,496
-No!
-Get married!

854
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:01,598
I'm living with her.
I promise you'll have a grandson soon.

855
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:04,801
Think how offended my mom
would feel if she found out.

856
01:05:05,107 --> 01:05:06,603
Knock him out. Get him drunk.

857
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:10,106
I'm stronger than you think.

858
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,910
No matter how strong you are,
to me, you're a weak woman.

859
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:18,114
How can this great strength
come from someone so tiny?

860
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,316
Are you saying that I'm King Kong?

861
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,318
A very special King Kong.

862
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:23,820
A peanut-like King Kong.
