1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,100
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,466
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,466
What the hell?
What do you think you're doing?

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,766
Lower your arms. Stop pointing.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,933
Why are you yelling at us
for arresting suspects?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,633
You can't arrest them
without proper cause…

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,366
Hold on. Where did you get that sword?

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,266
I got lucky.

9
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:50,566
All right, Chief Nam.
Let's send you to prison too!

10
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:55,400
I think it's all over now.

11
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,200
What's with that smirk on your face?

12
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,500
It's not over until it's over.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm not sure if you know that.

14
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,833
-What?
-Detective.

15
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,633
I'm here to turn myself in.

16
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:16,666
For what?

17
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,700
I'm the one who ordered
the murder of Congressman Park.

18
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,000
To Anton of Rising Moon.

19
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:28,733
Goodness, Geon-u.
You were the one who ordered it?

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,933
Why did you do that?
No one asked you to do that.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,333
He called me names
whenever he came to our office,

22
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:37,366
and it upset me. That's why I did it.

23
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:49,900
You didn't do it.

24
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,266
You came as a replacement.

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,100
I ordered the murder.

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,766
You bastard.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,366
Stop lying and look at my eyes.

28
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,500
You came to go to the prison
for him, right?

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,566
I said no.

30
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:10,066
What are you doing?
Hurry and protect the suspect.

31
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,700
Why are you doing this?

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,700
Prosecutor Park Gyeong-seon.

33
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,400
Come to the chief prosecutor's office
as soon as you get to work.

34
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:53,533
Haven't you learned
from working here for years?

35
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,400
Cases like this must be handled
quietly and internally.

36
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,433
I was never taught

37
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,600
to turn a blind eye to an obvious murder.

38
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:05,733
What?

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,266
Hey, shut your mouth.

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,333
She seems pretty emotional right now.

41
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:11,733
Once she calms down--

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,766
I can't be any more rational.

43
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,333
You…

44
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,433
If this was the price of my life,
I'll give it back.

45
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,133
I'll be waiting for the measures.

46
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,366
That little…

47
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,600
That's how I am.

48
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,066
My fortune-teller told me I won't be rich.

49
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,866
That was really satisfying though.

50
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,066
Hey, Gyeong-seon.

51
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,366
You…

52
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,066
As of today,
you'll be suspended indefinitely.

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,733
I'll keep that in mind.

54
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,333
And about the Kim Geon-yong case,

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,933
Prosecutor Nam is in charge now.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,300
That jerk again?

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,300
I mean, that Prosecutor Nam again?

58
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:06,500
I know. You should have been wiser.

59
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:09,766
This is just pathetic.

60
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,633
Oh, no. It's ripped. Damn it.

61
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:31,633
NO BREACH OF DUTY IN GUDAM POLICE STATION

62
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,366
Violent Crime Squad 2 will be punished

63
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:36,066
with the following penalties
for disobedience and mutiny.

64
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:38,633
Captain Lee Myeong-su
and Detective Kim Gyeong-ryul

65
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,200
will be moved to Public Safety Team.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Detective Na Dae-gil and Heo Ik-gu

67
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,966
to Traffic Management Team.

68
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,166
Damn it.

69
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,000
Detective Gu Dae-yeong and Seo Seung-a

70
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,333
will be indefinitely suspended

71
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,266
and be confined to probationary duties.

72
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,300
Priest Kim.

73
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,900
We have a serious problem

74
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,533
regarding your future priesthood.

75
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:16,233
ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE OF KOREA

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,233
PERSONNEL RECORD
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

77
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,966
Could you explain this yourself?

78
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:11,100
Is what I was tipped about all true?

79
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,700
One thing is not true.

80
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,100
It wasn't my own decision.

81
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,733
I was commanded by my superior.

82
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,333
I see.

83
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,133
But there's still a fundamental problem.

84
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:33,266
Since you joined our faith community,

85
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,100
you have been living with fake records.

86
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,566
That's…

87
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,166
only because my previous workplace

88
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,866
deleted my records.

89
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
It couldn't be helped.

90
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,700
Even so, it's unacceptable.

91
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,233
Now I figured it out,
I can't just let it slide.

92
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,766
I will officially report this
to the order.

93
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,700
Just know that this could lead
to a big problem.

94
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,600
You caused this.

95
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:36,300
This is the last time we meet like this.

96
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,066
It's a war.

97
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,733
Goodness.

98
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,666
Is this a student dormitory or what?

99
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:32,366
At least they have internet
in a student dormitory.

100
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,900
It smells like mold here.

101
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,166
If we keep staying here,
we will get lung diseases.

102
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry for being an incompetent senior.

103
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,533
Don't be. I'm rather proud
that I'm here right now.

104
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:47,333
You're one spirited cop.

105
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Keep distance from Chief Nam
because it could be risky.

106
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,966
And let's leave
Hwang Cheol-beom alone for now.

107
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,533
He's like a guard dog
watching over a treasury.

108
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,233
So if we remove him now,

109
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,900
it will be hard to find a replacement.

110
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,166
He has a point.

111
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,766
We will need Mr. Hwang for a while.

112
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:11,266
When is the fingerprint
software programmer coming?

113
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,400
Tomorrow.

114
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,333
You can keep the safe open.
And have one of the trustworthy men

115
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,400
manage the safe
together with Hwang Cheol-beom.

116
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,633
Who can we trust?

117
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:29,566
Those cheeky bastards.

118
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,100
How dare you try to send me to prison.

119
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,600
I will take care of the man

120
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,500
who took the fall for you.

121
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,133
You focus on wrapping up
the Rising Moon's problem.

122
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,600
First, hide the accountant

123
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,000
and the ledger.

124
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:51,466
Once they get out, we will be all dead.

125
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,900
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

126
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
Those punks.

127
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,466
SEOUL GUDAM POLICE STATION

128
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,666
-Welcome back, sir.
-Thanks.

129
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,333
Let's go.

130
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,800
Hun-seok.

131
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,633
Bring the attorney to Geon-u
and make sure he shuts his mouth.

132
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:16,300
Tell him we will take care of his parents
so he doesn't need to worry.

133
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,900
-Yes, sir.
-And about the accountant of Rising Moon.

134
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,400
Make sure he's disappeared
by this afternoon.

135
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:23,466
Yes, sir.

136
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,266
What should we do with Detective Gu?

137
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,833
It looks like he's totally
on the priest's side now.

138
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,733
That son of a bitch.

139
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,100
Deal with Rising Moon first.

140
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,466
And then we will decide

141
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
if we kill him or not.

142
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,666
Damn it.

143
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,833
What's the matter?

144
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,266
Hwang Cheol-beom left.

145
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,133
And Anton changed his statement.

146
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,766
What are you talking about?
What about Kim Geon-yong then?

147
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,966
I heard Prosecutor Park isn't
in charge of that case anymore.

148
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,533
It's pretty obvious
what's going to happen.

149
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,466
We went through a lot of trouble
to catch them.

150
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,866
I know.

151
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,233
And why is Father Kim not answering
his phone? He isn't at church either.

152
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,066
I couldn't reach him either.
So I sent him a text.

153
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,866
And what were you doing?

154
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,733
I'm analyzing the hard drive
we found in Rising Moon.

155
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,466
We handed that all over.

156
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,300
I made a copy just in case.

157
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:21,700
I taught you well. You know the basics.

158
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,700
Hello, Director Kim.

159
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
What is it?

160
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:36,266
I want you to remove a person.

161
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,466
It's a female prosecutor.
Her name is Park Gyeong-seon.

162
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,466
She lives in Gudam District.

163
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,066
Make it look like it was a burglar.

164
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:46,866
How much does it cost these days?

165
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,100
Wow, that son of a bitch.

166
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,700
I can't believe this.

167
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:58,900
Hearing that in person
really pisses me off.

168
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,400
"How much does it cost?"

169
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,300
Am I a fish or what?

170
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,566
With this, we can definitely arrest him.

171
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,833
Why don't we just leak it to TV networks?

172
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,866
I'm so pissed off my head hurts.

173
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,533
Do we have Hwang Cheol-beom's voice too?

174
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,300
No. Anton didn't seem to record it
because they're on the same side.

175
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:18,600
Then we can't arrest
Hwang Cheol-beom, that asshole.

176
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:19,966
I'm afraid not.

177
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,600
But we can definitely get Kim Geon-yong.

178
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:34,066
-Come on!
-Okay.

179
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:40,366
Who knows about the recording?

180
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:43,100
So far, just me and Dae-yeong.

181
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,133
Okay. Detective Seo.

182
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,733
-Yes?
-You trust me now, right?

183
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,133
You don't think I'm that much
of an asshole now, right?

184
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,966
What? Well, sure.

185
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,000
Then let's work together.

186
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,366
Work?

187
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,666
WHO OWNS RISING MOON?

188
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:17,200
WHO OWNS RISING MOON?

189
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,566
Who did this?

190
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:28,666
REPENTANCE

191
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:30,533
ACCOUNTING

192
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:34,933
ACCOUNTING

193
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
What?

194
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:40,833
REPENTANCE

195
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,900
CLUB R GATE

196
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:47,833
GUDAM POLICE STATION CHIEF NAM SEOK-GU

197
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,733
PROVE HE IS THE REAL OWNER
DRUG AND CONNECTIONS

198
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,700
This is just like
what happened with Director Jeong.

199
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,366
We don't have any hard evidence

200
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:58,300
that proves Nam was involved
in the Rising Moon incident.

201
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,866
On the ledger we found at Rising Moon

202
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:03,000
were only records of the cash profits
they've been pocketing

203
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,366
and the illegal liquor business.

204
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:07,166
There was zero evidence
about the real owner.

205
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,766
Who owns Rising Moon?

206
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:16,866
An incomplete victory
causes a complete defeat.

207
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,666
We must bring Chief Nam down
before it's too late.

208
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,733
PROVE HE IS THE REAL OWNER

209
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,133
The tip was right here.

210
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:31,866
It's an excellent tip.

211
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,700
"Prove he is the real owner."

212
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:35,900
With this, the game is over.

213
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,333
Explain what that means.

214
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,833
The ledgers we have are all fake.

215
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,166
They're all fake.
We need the authentic ledgers.

216
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,000
We must get the real accounting documents.

217
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,566
Have you checked
the accounting firm of Rising Moon?

218
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,366
Not yet.

219
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:51,800
Come on.
That's the first thing we should do.

220
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,333
-Dig into that, Detective Seo.
- Yes, ma'am.

221
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,833
FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN HAS COME NEAR

222
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,866
ACCOUNTING

223
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:06,566
My Lord.

224
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,333
If we find this out,

225
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,633
Rising Moon and Chief Nam are done for.

226
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,833
The flow of the cash,
the owner of the bank account,

227
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,466
and all the purchase records.
They will all be on the ledger.

228
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,633
Is there a chance
that they destroyed all the records?

229
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,366
No.

230
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,300
They can never destroy it.

231
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:27,000
Why? It's a secret ledger of those

232
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:28,800
who take the money.

233
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,700
Okay. Let's start with getting
their accounting records!

234
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,433
Okay. Let's do this!

235
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's do this!

236
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,900
Why does my helmet look so ugly?

237
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,566
We didn't have any spare,
so we borrowed it from Songsak.

238
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,566
Damn it.

239
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,866
I just made eye contact with someone.

240
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,900
We're getting Chief Nam in three days.
Okay?

241
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,166
Don't hold my waist like that! It's weird!

242
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,933
But I'm scared!

243
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,600
Oh, come on!

244
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,833
Hey, Diyabol.

245
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,933
Let me be in the lead today.

246
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:17,866
Hey, stop bluffing… Oh, well.

247
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,033
All the punches will make you stronger.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,300
Those punks have no soul in their punches.

249
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,166
Good for you. You have soulful punches.

250
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,533
Accountant Kim Bu-gi, right?

251
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,966
You're Kim Bu-gi, right?

252
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,733
Yes, I am.

253
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,166
You're going to Hawaii.

254
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,700
"You go to Hawaii."

255
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,466
You can't go to Hawaii.

256
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,866
You're the accountant of Rising Moon.

257
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,333
-Yes.
-Come here.

258
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:20,266
You have to pull it diagonally.
It hurts more that way.

259
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,766
I know it's not your fault.

260
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,700
It's the guys with power
wanted to play with the numbers.

261
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,700
What else could you have done?

262
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:35,200
Yes, that's right.

263
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,866
Stop.

264
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,600
I think it's 140,000 won?

265
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:45,633
It's 150,000 won. You're wrong.

266
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,033
You guessed it wrong four times.

267
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,733
You have one more chance.

268
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,100
Now start over.

269
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:57,633
Do you think it was right to do
what they told you to do?

270
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,766
Of course, it's wrong.

271
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,933
But we just did what we were told to do.

272
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,100
True repentance

273
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,733
starts with transparent accounting. Okay?

274
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,433
That's great advice.

275
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,066
It's really great advice indeed.

276
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,766
"True repentance starts
with transparent accounting."

277
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,133
Stop.

278
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,100
It's 360,000 won.

279
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:24,566
Let me announce the final score!

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,333
It's not 360,000 won. It's 370,000 won.

281
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:32,866
Hey!

282
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:35,333
All right. You were wrong five times.

283
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,300
So bring the original accounting files
of Rising Moon

284
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,633
to me.

285
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,500
-Pardon?
-It has all the records

286
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:44,066
of the cash flow, distribution of profits,

287
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,966
and the information
about the real owner, right?

288
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:48,066
I can't do that.
That will cost many lives.

289
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:49,966
Including me, we will all die.

290
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,066
Before that happens, I might kill you.

291
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,266
Sir, I'm not sure why you're doing this,

292
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:57,766
but please be understanding.

293
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,333
Accounting fraud is the shadow and fate

294
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,233
of Korean capitalism.

295
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,233
Hey.

296
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,500
If that's the fate of the country,
it should be brought down.

297
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:06,700
How do you call that a country?

298
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,200
Please.

299
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:11,300
I beg of you.

300
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:13,433
I have two little children.

301
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,266
Gosh. You're pathetic.

302
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,933
Why did you have to commit a crime
and use your children as a shield?

303
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
Bad guys are always like this.

304
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,766
Detective Gu, hold his thighs.

305
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,166
I'm going to torture him.

306
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:24,400
Yes, Father.

307
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,666
This isn't something
you can only see in movies and dramas.

308
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,300
If you move, you'll get hurt.

309
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,333
Okay. I will tell you.

310
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,933
I don't have it.

311
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
You don't have it?

312
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,533
Truth to be told,

313
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:50,066
someone took it from me.

314
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,700
What do you mean? Who did that?

315
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:55,733
ACCOUNTING FIRM DOZEN

316
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,400
What an idiot.

317
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,166
He lost it from a gamble?

318
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,466
That means the real ledger is
in the gambling house.

319
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,600
How could he be so stupid?
He's an accountant.

320
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,100
I can't believe he gambled.

321
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,966
Chief Nam shouldn't
know about this either, right?

322
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:14,866
If he did, he would have freaked out.
By the way,

323
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,233
he said he didn't know
where the house is now.

324
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,466
How do we find it?

325
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,200
This is why

326
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,133
I got Ggongji's phone number.

327
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
When?

328
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:27,033
From the text message.

329
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,033
It looks like you don't know much
about this area.

330
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:34,066
Detective Gu,
you get arrogant very often these days.

331
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,233
Come here.

332
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:38,633
Get off me.
I won't let you hit me anymore.

333
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,466
Gosh, this is really poorly done.

334
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:51,900
It's supposed to be as shiny as a mirror.
They never work hard.

335
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:55,166
Those punks are crazy.

336
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,000
You mean they're lazy.

337
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:02,100
Who are you?

338
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,133
A priest.

339
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:07,500
I'm Tom. I catch Jerry.

340
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,433
You're the moneylender, Jerry, right?

341
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:10,666
Who the hell are you?

342
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,266
Come on. No more bloodshed.

343
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,666
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

344
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,166
Let me use another way.

345
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:21,933
Are you cops?

346
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,200
No. We're half-priest and half-police.

347
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,833
Will you drop that? It's so corny.

348
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:28,966
You know Accountant Kim Bu-gi.

349
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:30,833
No, I don't.

350
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,833
It's so hot!

351
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:38,766
Kim Bu-gi. You know him, right?

352
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,033
I do. He's an idiot.

353
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,266
Where's the new gambling house?

354
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,333
I heard it's moved.

355
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:46,700
Seriously, I…

356
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,400
I want to do it too.

357
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,166
Gosh, it's so hot! Fine!

358
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,333
I will tell you!

359
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:56,033
Tell me.

360
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,266
It has to look real.

361
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:01,866
What should I do?

362
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:07,800
Sir.

363
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:11,500
I must have lost my mind.

364
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:14,100
When I lose temper,

365
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,633
I go crazy like that.

366
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,900
I don't lose temper all the time,

367
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,733
but I can't help it.

368
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,900
It's my temper! My temper!

369
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,400
Actually,

370
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:32,200
I even take pills. I'm bipolar.

371
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
I…

372
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,666
Seriously, what's wrong with me?

373
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,600
Have I gone crazy?

374
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:46,500
You crazy bitch. Crazy bitch!

375
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,800
You crazy bitch!

376
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,966
I must have gone really crazy.

377
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:54,800
Hey, stop crying.

378
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,900
If you had such an issue,
you should have told me.

379
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:03,133
I had no idea.

380
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,433
I didn't want you to have

381
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,533
prejudices about me.

382
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,466
Do you think you can wrap up
the Kim Geon-yong case nicely?

383
00:23:16,766 --> 00:23:19,833
If you give me one more chance,
I will put my life on…

384
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,033
Okay.

385
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,900
Let me send one text. One second.

386
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,433
Last time, I kneeled down to survive,

387
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:33,166
but this time,
I kneeled down to move forward.

388
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,000
All right. Although,

389
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:48,166
I have little trust in you,
so you must regain--

390
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:51,433
If you give me one more chance,
I will show you how trustworthy I am.

391
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,733
I'm sorry for interrupting.

392
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,733
What's the matter?

393
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,266
Someone's creating a scene
in Prosecutor Park's office.

394
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,633
-What?
-Prosecutor Park Gyeong-seon!

395
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,566
Seriously, what's your problem?

396
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:09,266
-Where is she?
-Why are you doing this?

397
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,566
What are you doing now?

398
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,666
There you are.

399
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,066
You closed all the cases.
Are you happy now?

400
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:18,100
You're the one
who suggested we work together.

401
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,333
How could you ruin it?

402
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,366
How dare you…

403
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:25,300
I heard you even threatened
the witnesses of Kim Geon-yong case.

404
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,133
And you call yourself a prosecutor?

405
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,966
Answer me!

406
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Do you want to die?

407
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:37,833
Kill me! Kill me if you want!

408
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,166
Submit a petition right now.

409
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,666
I'll report this to your superior now.
Okay?

410
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:44,766
Do it! Go on and do it!

411
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,000
Do whatever you want!

412
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,200
You come here.

413
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,666
What are you doing right now?

414
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,200
I will kill you and kill myself!

415
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,333
Hey, it hurts for real!

416
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,666
Hey! Break it up! What are you doing?

417
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:06,233
Let go!

418
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:07,666
I will kill you!

419
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:09,566
Goodness!

420
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:10,933
Exactly.

421
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,900
This is what I want from you.

422
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:16,700
-Get off of me!
-Stop it!

423
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:17,900
Come on!

424
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:21,833
HAPPY CITIZENS AND JUST PROSECUTION

425
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,033
Is your cheek all right?
I hit you too hard, didn't I?

426
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:35,533
Yes. You seemed to flick your wrist
when you hit me.

427
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,733
Well, I haven't hit anyone before.

428
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,200
I couldn't control my power.

429
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:43,966
When you pulled my hair,
I could feel that you were really pulling.

430
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,566
Anyway, we completed stage one.

431
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,966
-Don't tell Father Kim about it yet.
-Okay.

432
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:52,800
-Detective Seo.
-Yes?

433
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,100
There's something
I have always wanted to ask you.

434
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:57,733
Go ahead and ask me.

435
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,166
What do you like about Father Kim?

436
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
What?

437
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,833
We're just by ourselves here.
You can be honest with me.

438
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,266
Well, he has--

439
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,666
Except for his handsome face.

440
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,633
He is--

441
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,500
Except for his height and broad back.

442
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,666
Well, then, he is--

443
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,633
Except for the slightly corny

444
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,833
but cute hairstyle.

445
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:24,400
I wasn't going to say that.

446
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:27,533
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:31,566
I like him because he's like a wizard.

448
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,500
Wizard?

449
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,266
A wizard that says magic spells?

450
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:40,633
Yes. He makes changes.

451
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,233
He changes people
and situations around him.

452
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:49,166
At first,
it was too much and I was confused,

453
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,333
but as time went by,

454
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:54,700
I got used to the change
as if it always has been like that.

455
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:56,933
You're right.

456
00:26:57,133 --> 00:27:00,400
Change requires pain and confusion.

457
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,333
Pardon?

458
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,700
Good luck then. I'll be off.

459
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:06,366
Thank you.

460
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:10,933
All right.

461
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
What? Who took it?

462
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:14,966
The gambling house?

463
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,066
At first, he lied that he had it.

464
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:18,400
And now he came clean.

465
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:20,600
Goodness.

466
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,066
Which gambling house? Who?

467
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:25,166
I'm not sure about that,

468
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:27,533
but we are searching the guy
who lend money to the accountant.

469
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:30,033
Find him as soon as possible, okay?

470
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:32,466
Yes, sir. Oh, and one more thing.

471
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,533
It seems like
Father Kim already came here.

472
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:38,000
Damn it.

473
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,433
That damn priest cut in line.

474
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:45,533
I hope Geon-u is getting fed well.

475
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:48,333
Why did he have to make

476
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,000
my right-hand man replace him?

477
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,300
It's so annoying. I don't like it.

478
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,966
-Enjoy.
-Hey.

479
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,933
Bring new ones. They're all dried.

480
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,566
This is dried radish, not pickled radish.

481
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:04,633
They're all the same.

482
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,900
Seongwongak's pickled radish is
always good.

483
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:11,766
Don't act up
and just listen to what I say.

484
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,900
What's with the look?

485
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,633
You got something in your eyes again?

486
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:24,566
You go

487
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,433
and get the pickled radish yourself.

488
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:30,133
You damn Long-D bastard.

489
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,200
Are my ears ringing?

490
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,600
What did you say? Long what?

491
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Long

492
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,166
D

493
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:43,700
bastard.

494
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,000
You're funny.

495
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,566
There must be an epidemic these days
that makes people fearless.

496
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:54,066
Historically speaking,

497
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,300
the best medicine to cure epidemics

498
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,333
is to be beaten to death.

499
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,666
Songsak.

500
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,933
-Today is the day.
-Okay.

501
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:06,266
Follow me to the outside.

502
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:12,366
What kind of situation is this?
Is this a teen drama?

503
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:16,100
Hey, guys. Step aside. You might get hurt.

504
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:18,533
Just finish him at once.

505
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,700
Have you become all confident

506
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:24,766
after the one fight at Rising Moon?

507
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:27,033
Still, you've got no techniques.

508
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,233
You rude punk.

509
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,600
One, two, three.
My power has three different levels.

510
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,900
I will hit you with level one.

511
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:38,966
If I hit you with level three,
you'll die, Long-D bastard.

512
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,466
Just go with level three.

513
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:43,866
Is there level nine too?

514
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,433
Unbelievable. Right?

515
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:48,300
Hey, Mr. Kim. You're there too.

516
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,733
This is really embarrassing.

517
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,233
A TIGER THAT PROTECTS THE KING

518
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,533
You go first.

519
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,800
A TIGER THAT PROTECTS THE KING
SONGSAK

520
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,766
Did you learn Muay Thai
because you're from Thailand?

521
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,166
You know,

522
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,733
I minored in capoeira.

523
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:13,833
Do you know what I majored in?

524
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,233
JANG RYONG

525
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,633
I majored in Muay Thai.

526
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,100
THREE-STORY BLOCKHEAD PAGODA OF BUYEO

527
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:40,266
Hello.

528
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,533
Gosh, that hurts.
I probably got another hair whorl now.

529
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,266
You…

530
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,100
You punk!

531
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:30,033
Do you think you can hit me?

532
00:31:49,466 --> 00:31:51,166
Sir, I'll see you later.

533
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,966
-Songsak!
-Songsak!

534
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:56,966
-Songsak!
-Songsak!

535
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:58,266
Ryong, are you okay?

536
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:02,633
Stay still, Ryong. Breathe.

537
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,100
-Songsak!
-Songsak!

538
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,433
-Songsak!
-Songsak!

539
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,066
You win.

540
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,733
Songsak!

541
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,133
Help me.

542
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,833
-Songsak!
-Songsak!

543
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:26,000
Ma'am, you're on a roll.

544
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,233
Nice shot.

545
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
I'm not doing bad today.

546
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:34,400
Ma'am, you look like
a professional golfer dressed like that.

547
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:35,866
I'm flattered.

548
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,233
By the way, I'm terribly sorry.

549
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,633
I want you to make
a polite apology to her again.

550
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
I'm sorry.

551
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,900
I'll work more discreetly from now on.

552
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,300
I apologize that I couldn't make it

553
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,200
work like this sooner.

554
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,566
Don't say that.

555
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:02,366
I must give you a gift, ma'am.

556
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,733
Not at all, sir.

557
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm grateful for my current position.

558
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:10,533
Mr. Kim, you should let me know
if you need anything.

559
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:11,966
Sure, I will.

560
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:19,333
Now, shall we go eat?

561
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,233
Let's do that.

562
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:36,833
Why do all gambling houses
look so depressive?

563
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,100
Why would they gamble
in a nice and sunny place

564
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,400
with terraces and a good view?

565
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:43,966
You must read books in a place like that.

566
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,633
What's the bestseller these days?

567
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,633
Bestseller, my foot.

568
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,700
Who are you? Get out of here.

569
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:58,133
Don't we have to hear
what they have to say first?

570
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:01,233
We're getting things done swiftly
from now on.

571
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:39,533
Who knows Accountant Kim Bu-gi?

572
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,066
Who are you?

573
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,000
What's your problem, Father?

574
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:53,233
None of your business.
I'm here to get back what you stole.

575
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:55,100
Are you cops?

576
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,166
No, we're half-priest and half-police.

577
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:01,000
Half what?

578
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,800
What the hell are you saying?

579
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:12,566
Are you lumberjacks?
Why are you holding axes?

580
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:15,966
Do you even know who I am?

581
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:17,800
No, and I don't want to know.

582
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,166
I am

583
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:22,666
Daegwallyeong Horsehead.

584
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:31,233
Sorry. But what kind of nickname is that?

585
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,800
Then I'm Hoengseong Cowhead.

586
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,433
Guys.

587
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,333
Chop them up.

588
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,733
Hey!

589
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:48,200
Can't you just let me sleep?

590
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,033
Goodness.

591
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,066
Can't you just talk it over?

592
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,833
Idiots.

593
00:36:01,566 --> 00:36:04,033
I'm sorry, sir. Those punks suddenly--

594
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,466
Shut your mouth.

595
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:11,800
I'm Oh Gwang-du from Suncheon.

596
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,433
What brings you here?

597
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:24,233
We just need the documents.

598
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,400
Be ready for bloodshed
if you don't want to give it.

599
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Father,

600
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:29,966
your language doesn't show respect.

601
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,500
There's no reason for it.

602
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:37,033
Hey, Father. You don't know
much about gambling, do you?

603
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:39,866
You can never get back what you lost here

604
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:41,533
even if you're with an army.

605
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,000
They keep the money they won

606
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,866
in a place no one knows.

607
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,200
We have rules here.

608
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,533
If you want it back,

609
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,633
gamble for it.

610
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,100
Should I beat
that Pyeongchang Horsehead then?

611
00:36:58,266 --> 00:36:59,566
It's Daegwallyeong.

612
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:01,466
Same difference.

613
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:02,566
No.

614
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,600
Play with me, not him.

615
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,966
Because I took it from that accountant.

616
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:15,633
Can't we just bring a warrant
and rummage the place?

617
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:18,166
You haven't been
to gambling houses, have you?

618
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,400
Those guys have the noses of dogs.

619
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,066
The second they smell cops,
they pack and run away.

620
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:26,266
Then you will only catch the small fries.

621
00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:29,566
Is the accounting file
really hard evidence?

622
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:32,633
That's the only chance we've got
to arrest Chief Nam.

623
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,200
Where should we find the person to gamble?

624
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:37,100
Should we ask
the Gambling Investigation Unit?

625
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,200
Don't.

626
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,600
Those who got caught are just small fries.

627
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,633
What's the name of their leader again?

628
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:47,000
Daegwallyeong Horsehead.

629
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,733
The real leader is

630
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:54,966
Oh Gwang-du from Suncheon.

631
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
What?

632
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,300
-What did you just say?
-Oh Gwang-du from Suncheon.

633
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:11,133
Do you know him?

634
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,033
No. It's just that his name is
similar to the name of someone I know.

635
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,066
-Sister, your hand.
-Oh, my.

636
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:23,566
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my. How clumsy I am.

637
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,033
You should've been careful.

638
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,266
I know. Please excuse me for a second.

639
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,833
My Lord.

640
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:46,966
Please don't put me in a hardship.

641
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:51,866
We'll head back to the station.

642
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:01,166
-Hey.
-Hae-il.

643
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:04,466
I remember now who the nun is.

644
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,233
Who is she?

645
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,866
Twenty years ago, a body came in.

646
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,500
It was a young man who got stabbed
while gambling.

647
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:17,566
She's the elder sister of that man.

648
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:20,200
Her name is Kim In-gyeong, right?

649
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:24,766
She cried so much then, blaming herself.

650
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,200
Wake up! I'm so sorry.

651
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:40,433
Later, I found out

652
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:43,033
that the nun was

653
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,133
Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox.

654
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,633
She used to be a really famous gambler.

655
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:53,300
Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox?

656
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,166
Could you take a look at a gambler

657
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,600
called Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox?

658
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
What did you

659
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:04,433
just say?

660
00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:08,100
The great Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox?

661
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,666
"Great"?

662
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:10,566
Yes.

663
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,766
The great Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox

664
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,833
is not just an ordinary gambler.

665
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:17,333
She's the best female gambler

666
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,666
in Korean gambling history.

667
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:25,133
She's like Joan of Arc.

668
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,733
She's a gambler. Joan of Arc, my foot.

669
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,066
Keep going.

670
00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:31,633
About 20 years ago,

671
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:34,900
there were
three notorious gamblers in Korea.

672
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,966
Suncheon Oh Gwang-du.

673
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:38,566
Masan Flounder.

674
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:39,666
MASAN FLOUNDER

675
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:42,933
Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox.

676
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,166
She's called Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox

677
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:47,600
because it was said

678
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,233
that she hides the card
under her tenth tail.

679
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,400
That's why she's called Ten-tailed Fox.

680
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,833
Stop exaggerating.

681
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,733
Anyway, the three gamblers

682
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,166
played the first and the last game.

683
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:01,100
REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE

684
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:02,266
As the word got out,

685
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:06,366
the whole police was mobilized
to get them.

686
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,466
Jongno,
which was the assumed place of gambling,

687
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,366
was completely blocked.

688
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,133
The three gamblers
shook up the whole city of Seoul.

689
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:16,966
All the gamblers in Korea

690
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:20,866
came to see this game too.

691
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,866
And what happened?

692
00:41:26,366 --> 00:41:27,900
A PAIR OF NINES

693
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:32,066
A PAIR OF LIGHT THREE AND LIGHT EIGHT

694
00:41:32,933 --> 00:41:35,866
Of course, Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox
won a perfect victory.

695
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:37,633
-Awesome.
-And that day,

696
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,300
Oh Gwang-du and Flounder
got caught by the police,

697
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,000
but Ten-tailed Fox

698
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,300
disappeared like smoke.

699
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,133
And she hasn't appeared again
even to this day.

700
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,833
That's what Mr. Park told me.

701
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:59,600
That's it then. Isn't that enough?

702
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,566
You're not going to make her gamble,
will you?

703
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,133
Why not? If she wins, it'll be fine.

704
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,966
Then we will get the file

705
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:08,766
and arrest Chief Nam.

706
00:42:08,966 --> 00:42:11,366
That's exactly why she has become a nun.

707
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,266
How could you ask her to gamble?

708
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:14,433
Come on.

709
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,200
I've become a priest myself,
but I beat people too.

710
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,333
Not everyone is like you.

711
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,933
Her situation is different.

712
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:26,100
You have your point.
I didn't think through.

713
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:30,200
You're quite thoughtful, old lady.

714
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,000
What?

715
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:34,466
Did you think I was a teenager?

716
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:35,866
This hurts my ego.

717
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,600
Why does it hurt your ego?

718
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,666
Can't she just play and beat him?

719
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:42,533
It will be simple then.

720
00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:44,866
You're like a wizard,

721
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:46,333
so talk to her.

722
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,600
Why wizard out of the blue?

723
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,266
I'm just saying,

724
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,933
you could be like a wizard to someone.

725
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,166
I wish I was a wizard for real.

726
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,166
By the way, what do we do?
This is a headache.

727
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:07,800
Hello, sir.

728
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:11,466
I'm Hwang Cheol-beom from Yeosu.

729
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:13,066
I'm honored to meet you, sir.

730
00:43:15,866 --> 00:43:18,866
I heard a lot about you from Man-ho.

731
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:21,233
-Take a seat.
-Yes, sir.

732
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,233
I'm sorry to interrupt your mealtime.

733
00:43:26,266 --> 00:43:28,700
I'm having many guests today.

734
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,966
Did you come

735
00:43:33,066 --> 00:43:34,600
because of the file too?

736
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:43,700
This is insane.

737
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:47,333
How am I supposed to beat
the best gambler in Korea?

738
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,166
Can't we just destroy them?

739
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,266
Then all the guys in Suncheon, Yeosu,

740
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,833
and Gwangyang will revolt.

741
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,533
We need to play anyway.
So find someone who can play.

742
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:01,166
Yes, sir.

743
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,300
WHO OWNS RISING MOON?

744
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:16,400
What are these?

745
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,100
What the hell?

746
00:44:24,633 --> 00:44:26,933
Who the hell did this?

747
00:44:33,566 --> 00:44:34,833
Yes, Mr. Park.

748
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:37,533
Yes. I'm on my way.

749
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,233
Okay. See you soon.

750
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,466
Is the accounting file
really hard evidence?

751
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,700
That's the only chance we've got
to arrest Chief Nam.

752
00:45:00,466 --> 00:45:01,500
You haven't gone to bed yet?

753
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:03,366
Hi, Father.

754
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,800
It's late.

755
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,733
Is there something

756
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,600
troubling you?

757
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Well…

758
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:16,933
I was just thinking.

759
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:20,033
It must be Oh Gwang-du

760
00:45:20,866 --> 00:45:21,900
that is troubling you.

761
00:45:24,866 --> 00:45:28,233
So you got to know about it.
Your friend must have told you.

762
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,766
I knew this would happen!

763
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:36,200
I had bad feelings about it.

764
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,166
He was wearing a mask then,
so I didn't recognize him.

765
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:42,633
What do I do now?

766
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:46,233
Calm down, Sister. It's okay.

767
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,200
How much do you know about it?

768
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:54,933
I didn't hear much about it.

769
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:58,300
I just heard about your brother,
Jongno sa-ga,

770
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:02,266
and Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox.
That's all I know.

771
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:05,200
Then you know everything!

772
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:08,166
Goodness. What am I going to do?

773
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:11,000
Why did I serve tea then?

774
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:12,166
Oh, dear.

775
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,133
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel

776
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,566
uncomfortable.

777
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,100
I'm sorry.

778
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:25,566
Now that you know everything,
there isn't anything I can do.

779
00:46:28,366 --> 00:46:29,433
You want me

780
00:46:30,866 --> 00:46:33,366
to play against Oh Gwang-du, right?

781
00:46:36,566 --> 00:46:37,733
Full disclosure,

782
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:40,100
yes.

783
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:43,166
I would love to,

784
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:45,800
but it's not an easy decision.

785
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:49,466
Of course, it isn't. I know that.

786
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,133
My brother wanted to be a gambler like me

787
00:46:53,366 --> 00:46:55,700
and ended up getting himself killed.

788
00:46:57,033 --> 00:46:59,733
My petty talent killed my brother.

789
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,700
And my brother was killed

790
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:05,766
by Oh Gwang-du's men.

791
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,466
It was on the evening
of the day I beat him.

792
00:47:09,866 --> 00:47:13,000
Are you saying he did that
because you beat him?

793
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:15,933
What an asshole.

794
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:20,266
He should take
the shuttle bus to hell too.

795
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:22,333
I'll give him a ride.

796
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,066
I can go to him right now.

797
00:47:24,266 --> 00:47:26,100
I know where he is.

798
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,466
Just ask me anytime, okay?

799
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,700
For many reasons,

800
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:36,200
it is hard for me to go back

801
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,066
to the gambling place.

802
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,900
I don't want to have hatred
against anyone.

803
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,266
That's my biggest concern.

804
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,366
I'm sorry.

805
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,666
I think I have thought of it too easily.

806
00:47:50,966 --> 00:47:52,900
That's okay.

807
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,833
I also can't wait to bring that Chief Nam

808
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,966
to justice.

809
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:00,166
I will happen.

810
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,733
I also hurt others

811
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,966
because of my talent.

812
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:09,433
A long time ago.

813
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:14,266
The Lord gave me a fighting talent of all.

814
00:48:15,766 --> 00:48:17,533
I didn't want to waste it.

815
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:21,600
I know people frown upon the fact

816
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:23,466
that a priest goes around fighting.

817
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:26,366
But those things don't matter to me.

818
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:29,433
What's most important to me

819
00:48:30,566 --> 00:48:32,100
is that people live

820
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,666
in the world where there is
a little bit of justice at least.

821
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:43,233
That's why I'm…

822
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,866
If you will think about it,

823
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,066
please take this

824
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:57,500
into consideration.

825
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:03,033
I have always wondered

826
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:06,100
why Father Lee loved you so much.

827
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:09,333
I think I know why now.

828
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,266
Father.

829
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,733
Both I and Sister Kim

830
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,566
had to face the truth today.

831
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,500
The truth we wanted to avoid the most.

832
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:48,033
But I wasn't as afraid today.

833
00:49:51,066 --> 00:49:53,033
Because I felt like
my burden could be shared.

834
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:00,200
And please

835
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:03,333
tell the Lord to look after Sister Kim

836
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,000
because I'm fine now.

837
00:50:07,766 --> 00:50:08,933
Please tell the Lord that.

838
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,133
Is that true?

839
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:19,100
Please don't tell Sister Kim
that you know.

840
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:23,300
I can't believe this.

841
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:25,533
This was 50 times more shocking

842
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,766
than when I found out you were Han U-ram.

843
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,333
It is indeed.

844
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,033
So she doesn't want to return, right?

845
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It seems like it.

846
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,266
No matter how urgent it is,

847
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:44,400
I don't want to force her or rush her.

848
00:50:44,566 --> 00:50:45,766
Whichever she decides to do,

849
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,733
I will follow it.

850
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:06,866
What do I do?

851
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:09,266
We don't have much time left.

852
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,033
Hwang Cheol-beom must have made
his move already.

853
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,800
This is driving me nuts. What do I do?

854
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:17,333
It's been a long time
since I've felt this way. How exciting.

855
00:51:18,066 --> 00:51:20,066
Seriously, we don't have much time left.

856
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:31,200
Oh, gosh. It suddenly pours!

857
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:33,833
My goodness!

858
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,733
Oh, no.

859
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:55,666
Thank you.

860
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:18,733
Willow…

861
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:21,666
The willow light card.

862
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,366
Lord!

863
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:36,966
The willow light card!

864
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:41,466
My Lord!

865
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:44,233
Father!

866
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:47,366
I'll do it.

867
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,400
I'll play.

868
00:52:51,433 --> 00:52:52,666
-Wow…
-Wow…

869
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Shouldn't you be more excited?

870
00:52:58,766 --> 00:52:59,833
Before that,

871
00:53:00,233 --> 00:53:03,033
I need to go somewhere.

872
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:06,933
-Wow!
-Wow!

873
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,366
So you're going to do it again?

874
00:53:16,033 --> 00:53:20,400
Sister, this is part of the plan
to catch the bad man.

875
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,900
That's right, Sister.
It's like catching a Satan--

876
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:26,033
Fathers, please be quiet.

877
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:29,300
I can try to be as generous as I can be,

878
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,466
but it's not like
someone's life is on the line.

879
00:53:33,866 --> 00:53:37,700
The situation doesn't seem very desperate.

880
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:40,266
That's right. It's not.

881
00:53:41,066 --> 00:53:43,600
But this is about justice.

882
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,533
I know my talent is petty,

883
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:50,066
but I would like to use it
to make this world a better place.

884
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:52,700
For just this once,

885
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,866
I will not follow the Lord's method.

886
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,433
It was a hard decision for her too.

887
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,266
Please allow her.

888
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,300
We will help her too.

889
00:54:05,966 --> 00:54:08,000
Even if you don't allow me, I will do it.

890
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:11,733
But I will gladly receive my punishment.

891
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:29,466
Let me take you somewhere.

892
00:54:30,866 --> 00:54:32,700
-Where?
-You'll see.

893
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:42,666
The game is at 8:00 p.m. tonight.

894
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,666
The rule is two out of three.

895
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,766
Is he your player?

896
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:51,266
Yes. Why don't you say hi to him?

897
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,333
I'm Lee Seok-sa from Ssangmun-dong.

898
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:01,733
Is the priest not playing?

899
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,033
I guess they don't have anyone to play.

900
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,633
Then…

901
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,566
I will just pay you with cash--

902
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:10,700
Not interested.

903
00:55:11,566 --> 00:55:14,333
If you make a scene

904
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,000
or call the police during the game,

905
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:22,100
that file or whatnot will be burned up.

906
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:24,166
Do you understand?

907
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,533
Yes, sir.

908
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:34,700
Who is this?

909
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,966
Pyeongtaek Ten-tailed Fox.

910
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,033
Who is this again?

911
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,100
You know what "One shot two birds" means.

912
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:50,400
Yes. It's achieving two at once.

913
00:55:50,466 --> 00:55:52,166
- One slap two flies.
- A win-win situation.

914
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:53,566
Let's do that. Come closer.

915
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,100
We're busy with the fliers.

916
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:05,966
-What's up?
-Stop with the fliers now.

917
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,333
We came up with a way
that can bring our team back to life.

918
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,466
Really?

919
00:56:16,733 --> 00:56:21,733
DAEBEOM TRADING

920
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:29,700
Good evening, sir.

921
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,933
Loosen up. Let's have a fresh start.

922
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:38,033
Is the prosecutor coming too?

923
00:56:38,466 --> 00:56:39,466
Yes.

924
00:56:41,533 --> 00:56:42,800
You look upset.

925
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,766
So this was

926
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,566
what you guys have been doing.

927
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:31,366
Mr. Lee.

928
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,300
What will you give me if you lose?

929
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:20,866
It looks like there's something you want.

930
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,133
If I win…

931
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,366
-Sister, let's wrap it up here.
-I'm okay.

932
00:59:24,433 --> 00:59:25,500
A BATTLE FOR THE MOST PRECIOUS

933
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:26,866
Shall we begin the game, then?

934
00:59:27,566 --> 00:59:29,100
I'm going to face punishment myself.

935
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:31,333
We accepted the bribes and slacked off.

936
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,200
It's great to see you
put your skills to use.

937
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:35,566
-Let's do this, baby.
-Yes.

938
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:36,833
WHAT IS THE MOST PRECIOUS TO YOU?

939
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,433
I am going to reinvestigate the case.

940
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
Please reconsider it.

941
00:59:39,566 --> 00:59:41,000
It's all over now.

942
00:59:41,066 --> 00:59:43,533
But how can you just let him leave?

943
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,100
Every encounter ends with a farewell.

944
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,700
I will sort everything out in two weeks

945
00:59:46,766 --> 00:59:48,266
and leave.

946
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:54,500
