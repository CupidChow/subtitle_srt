1
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,754
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,822
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,710
Well, I'll be damned!

4
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,345
What is this puny evil spirit

5
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,548
doing in this body, out of all places?

6
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,552
You already hurt the elderly people

7
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,986
in the neighborhood.

8
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,421
And now you dare sneak

9
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,458
into the eldest son of the family
who will carry on the family line

10
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,026
and create a scene?

11
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,228
Goodness.

12
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,030
What's going on with him?

13
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,400
What are we going to do with him?
What should I do?

14
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,138
That is one shameless spirit inside him.

15
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,439
What is it saying?

16
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,843
It says it will leave his body
as soon as it gets paid.

17
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,345
Is that true?

18
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,315
Just give me a second.

19
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,784
All right, pay up now.
Put those bills in there.

20
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,219
-I don't know.
-Should we trust them?

21
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,620
Come on, hurry.

22
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,522
-Here.
-Borrow some if you don't have any.

23
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,623
Wait.

24
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,867
Father Kim?

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,041
They really need to do something
about those rocks.

26
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,077
Someone could get hurt, goodness.

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,882
Father, I can take care of it myself.

28
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,850
Why is this bag so freaking heavy?

29
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,955
The Catholic exorcism
can't handle this evil spirit.

30
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,024
He's right, Father.

31
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,427
Master Cheon-ryong said
he can drive out this demon--

32
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,264
He just seems unwashed, not possessed.

33
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,065
Try if you dare.

34
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,067
It's easy for me to handle,

35
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,970
but this evil spirit is
actually very strong.

36
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,140
What have you got there?

37
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:07,153
St. Michael the Archangel,
illustrious leader of the heavenly army,

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,657
defend us in the battle
against principalities and powers,

39
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,064
against the rulers of the world
of darkness.

40
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,967
Gosh, that really hurts.

41
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,468
Down, evil spirit.

42
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,237
-Keep it down, come on.
-What?

43
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,140
Is he crying?

44
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,108
Does it hurt?

45
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,844
Fine.

46
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,681
Twenty times on your shin,

47
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,549
and 20 times on the back of your hand.

48
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,551
If you hold that in as well,

49
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,787
you'll pass the second test.

50
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,256
Entreat the Lord of peace
to cast Satan down under our feet,

51
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,358
so as to keep him
from further holding man captive

52
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,294
and doing harm to the Church!

53
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,362
Excuse me.

54
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,464
I think the evil spirit is gone.

55
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,102
Your face doesn't look like
it's gone yet, brother.

56
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,137
It really is gone.

57
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,806
Goodness.

58
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,608
You don't have any endurance, do you?

59
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,143
What was that about?

60
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,212
Cheon-ryong told me to do as he said--

61
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,781
Down, evil spirit.
You still haven't left him.

62
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,317
I totally fell for it.

63
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,486
Go get washed already.
You smell like stinky tofu.

64
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,723
You jerk.

65
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,524
Go home already.

66
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:19,826
That prick...

67
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,427
You're so dead today.

68
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,895
-Liars.
-What a shame.

69
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:23,830
Let...

70
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:24,897
-So it was fake?
-I think so.

71
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:25,798
Let go of me.

72
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,538
Who are you?

73
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,975
You can't mess with others' exorcism.

74
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,710
What did you do that for?

75
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,024
I'm screwed.

76
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,310
Hey, you!

77
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,646
What is that bastard following me for?

78
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,515
You're so dead when I catch you.

79
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,190
I told you not to go around

80
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,526
scamming old people.

81
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,028
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

82
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,765
-Come here, you fraud.
-That hurts!

83
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,436
-My throat tastes like blood.
-My neck!

84
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,737
You're pinching me.

85
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,573
You're not on your own, right?
Who told you to do this?

86
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,508
It's Mr. Oh!

87
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,510
Mr. Oh, the loan shark.

88
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,722
Mr. Oh's in today, right?

89
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,762
You sound pretty harsh for a priest.

90
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,501
Step aside, brothers.

91
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,604
Whether you're a priest, a monk,
or a pastor, we won't go easy on you.

92
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,072
No one asked you to go easy.

93
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,607
Hey.

94
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,117
Wait! Help!

95
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,504
Brothers, if you hit a priest,
you will go to hell.

96
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,043
I should rent
a shuttle bus to send you all off.

97
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,810
CUSTOM LOAN SERVICE FOR THE SELF-EMPLOYED

98
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,112
Brother Paul?

99
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,053
Come on out while I'm being nice.

100
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,456
Do I have to yell at you
to make you listen to me?

101
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,694
I said, come on out!

102
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,673
Gosh, that was uncomfortable.

103
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,946
Would you like a cup of coffee too?

104
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,150
I'm leaving, sweetie.

105
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,252
Call me if you need me later.

106
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,873
Come on, Father. What's the matter?

107
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,043
The Bible says that usury is a sin,

108
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,711
but it's a business in modern society.

109
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,147
Plus, I pay a lot of
offerings to the church.

110
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,216
That's not what this is about.

111
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,519
I heard it was you who sent

112
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,621
a shaman to scam the old people in town.

113
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,190
Oh, that.

114
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,294
That was to revive our town's
local culture with some mystic shamanism--

115
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,764
Revive, my ass.

116
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,468
Ripping off
the market vendors wasn't enough

117
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,870
and now you prey on
innocent senior citizens?

118
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,673
Don't be so mad at me.

119
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,009
You beat the guys
who collect money for me.

120
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,210
And now you want to beat me too?

121
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,145
Forgiveness and love.

122
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,849
Father, you must listen to what God says.

123
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,118
Hang on.

124
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,720
I hear something from the above.

125
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,163
God says

126
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:33,766
I should beat you up.

127
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,483
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

128
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,762
-There she is.
-That's her.

129
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,763
-Prosecutor Park.
-Hurry.

130
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,797
Gosh.

131
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,734
-Are you filming me?
-Are you Prosecutor Park

132
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,803
who was in charge of
the meth case in Nonhyeon-dong?

133
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,105
Yes, I am. Can we start after this?

134
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,041
I need to fix my bang.

135
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,542
The public doesn't agree

136
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,144
with the result
of the first investigation.

137
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,745
I said I wanted to start after this.

138
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,148
Don't you think
the investigation was ended too hastily?

139
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,383
There are testimonies too.

140
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,686
I'm not doing the interview.

141
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,822
You regarded Kim Geon-yong,
the meth provider

142
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,457
simply as a meth user and possessor

143
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,458
and regarded Mr. Kim,

144
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,660
a new idol singer as the meth provider.

145
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,229
Some suspect the prosecution
turned a blind eye to Kim Geon-yong

146
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,964
because he's the son
of the CEO of Hanju Group.

147
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,999
What do you think?

148
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,801
Hey, look.

149
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,470
Let's say I have candies at home.

150
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,906
If people come to my place
and eat the candies,

151
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,074
does that make me the provider?

152
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,709
Or is the one who took my candies

153
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,177
and give them to others the provider?

154
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,013
So Kim Geon-yong is the person
who has candies at home

155
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,415
and Mr. Kim is the person
who give the candies to others?

156
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,050
-Is that what you mean?
-Bingo.

157
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,886
But isn't it Kim Geon-yong
who possessed a bigger load of drugs?

158
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,956
Where do you guys work, tabloids?

159
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,526
We haven't announced
how much drug there was yet.

160
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,562
Still, people are suspicious.

161
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,397
Would you like to say a few words to them?

162
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,866
-Ma'am.
-Please say a few words.

163
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,934
-Please.
-Ma'am.

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,203
-Wait, ma'am.
-Tell us more about Kim Geon-yong.

165
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,107
I hope you get rich, dear citizens.

166
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,744
-Prosecutor Park.
-Wait.

167
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,981
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

168
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,687
What's the matter with you?

169
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,356
There's hard evidence
that shows Kim Geon-yong is the provider

170
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,358
and all the drug takers
have confessed the same.

171
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,894
I think you should arrest
Kim Geon-yong for now.

172
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,963
Please issue a warrant.

173
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,432
Didn't I tell you to make

174
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,768
the idol guy, Mr. Kim or whatever,
look like the provider?

175
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,035
I tried to,

176
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,405
but because the culprit is the CEO
of Hanju Group, Kim Jung Cheol's son,

177
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,507
I don't think it will work.

178
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,108
And the reporters already...

179
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,244
So let me get this straight.

180
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,680
I give you a warrant so you can
put a criminal behind bars

181
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,517
and become Korea's proud
and righteous police officer,

182
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,255
while I become an all-time, lying bitch.

183
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,456
That's what you mean, right?

184
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,425
-That's not what I mean, ma'am.
-Goodness.

185
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,570
Why are there so many selfies?

186
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,943
The technology these days is incredible.

187
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,814
There was no single lamp there,
but look at how clear the face looks.

188
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,815
Seriously.

189
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,621
Wait.

190
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,591
Isn't this you?

191
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,869
Come on. Don't count the money there.
That makes you look petty.

192
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,605
I'm sure the illegal massage shop owners

193
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,574
gave you a good amount of bribes.

194
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,043
That's not what it is, ma'am.

195
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,546
"That's not what it is, ma'am."

196
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,449
Stop the bullshit and listen to me.

197
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,852
Do you want to get fired for bribery

198
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,220
and live a pathetic life?

199
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,622
Or do you want to listen to me

200
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,058
and live from hand to mouth
until your retirement?

201
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,631
If you ever come to me again
regarding this matter,

202
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,734
I will destroy

203
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,403
your life and career.

204
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:34,707
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,176
Captain.

206
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,812
The human brain doesn't exist

207
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:44,183
just to decorate the insides of the skull.

208
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,219
What do you do with it?

209
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,623
What do you do with it?

210
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,424
You use it.

211
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,792
Then use it.

212
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,128
Go use your brain!

213
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,168
So much stress.

214
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,170
YEOSU POLICE STATION

215
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,039
Do you know how many times
you have done this?

216
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,276
You're a priest. Why are you so impatient?

217
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,312
This is not about patience.
You know what this jerk did.

218
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,848
What did I do? Do you have proof?

219
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,550
Is there a proof that I was in cahoots
with the shaman?

220
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,452
Proof? I heard about everything.

221
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,389
-Why you little...
-Look!

222
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,659
-Did you see him glaring at me?
-Stop it!

223
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:27,660
Stop.

224
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,796
What you heard can't be evidence.

225
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,931
Unbelievable. That son of a...

226
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,799
Sorry for the profanity.

227
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,067
Father Kim, please sit down.

228
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,138
I'll take responsibility.
Could you just let him go this time--

229
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,706
I would love to,

230
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,175
but this time you've crossed the line.

231
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,345
All my employees have been hospitalized.

232
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,547
One even had his jaw dislocated

233
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,082
and can't close his mouth now.

234
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,217
-Please be quiet.
-Where is Father Kim?

235
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,387
-I asked you where he is!
-Oh, I found him.

236
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,855
Are you okay, Father?

237
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,824
There's never too much whipping of love.

238
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,159
You did a great job, Father.

239
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,493
They should switch their seats.

240
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,128
-Say something.
-What are you talking about?

241
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,797
Look at how he beat me up.

242
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,732
-I'll beat you again.
-Hey!

243
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,133
-Come on!
-Keep it together.

244
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,601
-Just stay seated.
-Let me...

245
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,104
Let me bear the cross!

246
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,640
-Could you please be quiet?
-Please sit down.

247
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,711
You guys are always like this. Gosh.

248
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,048
RECEIVE YOUR PUNISHMENT

249
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,416
Hello.

250
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,118
Door-to-door civil service.

251
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,987
Proactive civil service.

252
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,322
I'm Detective Gu Dae-yeong
of violent crime squad

253
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,457
at Seoul Gudam Police Station.

254
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,393
If there was any illegal act
that harmed your business,

255
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,362
please report it to me.

256
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,032
I will catch all the bad guys
and punish them.

257
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,533
As if!

258
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,036
Gosh, Ms. Han.

259
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,838
Are you running for a beauty contest?

260
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,439
Why do you do this every night?

261
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,907
It's for the campaign.

262
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,510
Door-to-door civil service.
Guaranteed punishment.

263
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,745
Doesn't it sound nice?

264
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,380
Door-to-door, my ass.

265
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,882
You never pay attention to our reports.

266
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,117
I'd rather report to dogs.

267
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,787
Do something about the Russians
in the neighborhood.

268
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,590
They always come here, drink,
and make a scene.

269
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,725
They make me anxious.

270
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,094
Those bastards.

271
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,230
If the Russians come again next time...

272
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,131
We'll call you.

273
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,999
Make sure to bring
other police officers with you.

274
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,435
Mr. Kim, you dyed your hair.

275
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,004
Enjoy, and have a good evening.

276
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,973
Next time, make sure
to bring one more dumpling.

277
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,875
-Will do.
-Guys, let's eat first.

278
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,009
Go ahead, eat.

279
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,912
Hey. What's up?

280
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:27,846
Sir.

281
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,015
How long do I have to do this?

282
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,584
This is so embarrassing.

283
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,687
That's the least you can do to earn points
for the performance assessment.

284
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,590
If you want the points,
just shut it and enjoy the night air.

285
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,427
Oh, right.

286
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,531
I heard you're going to attack
the Exit Three Gang.

287
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,366
When is it?

288
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,467
Are you coming too?

289
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,302
Of course.
I'm also in the violent crime squad.

290
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,703
Oh, right.

291
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,474
Their hideout.
It's Hyeondae Manpower, right?

292
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,476
Should I make a surprise attack now?

293
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,912
Hold on, things might change.

294
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,146
Wait for my call.

295
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,383
This time, I'm will definitely show you

296
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,984
what I'm capable of.

297
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,152
My charisma.

298
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,455
I'll take the lead and take...

299
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,690
Hello?

300
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,361
He always hangs up like that.

301
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,037
CHIEF OF SEOUL CENTRAL
DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

302
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,174
My honor, sir.

303
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,777
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

304
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,445
Let's drink.

305
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,580
Let's make a toast.

306
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,014
-Cheers.
-Enjoy.

307
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,015
It's been a while.

308
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,053
She's really something.

309
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,388
Where has she been all this time?

310
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,824
She has been waiting for the right time,
working for me.

311
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,328
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

312
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,997
Please lead me, and I'll pay you back
with flesh and blood.

313
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,899
She's incredibly spirited too.

314
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,134
She's amazing.

315
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,768
Which class were you in?

316
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,003
I was in the 40th class.

317
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,172
Then she's Mr. Nam's senior by two years.

318
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,574
Well, at the training institute, yes,

319
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,409
but in college,
I was her senior by three years.

320
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,512
Right. I see.

321
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,213
I didn't know that, sir.

322
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,281
That's okay.

323
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,084
About CEO Kim Jung-cheol's son,

324
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,886
you can handle the case, right?

325
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,921
I can tell you one thing for sure.

326
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,223
I'm tenacious as a lobster
and used to taking heavy blows,

327
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,625
You can count on me.

328
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:20,926
Being tenacious won't be enough.

329
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,195
You need a strategic approach.

330
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,299
Of course. I'll make sure
to come up with a nice strategy.

331
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,867
She's really something.

332
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,303
Having her behind you
will make you feel secure.

333
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,604
Let me fill up your glasses.

334
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,142
From this day forward, stand behind me.

335
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,545
I might not be able to block a storm,

336
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,947
but I can block some cold wind.

337
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,349
Thank you, sir!
My flesh and blood are yours.

338
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,417
Good. Welcome on board.

339
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,620
To the day when the chief prosecutor
becomes the prosecutor general.

340
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,055
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

341
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,456
Let's go!

342
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,502
Wait there.

343
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:05,938
Excuse me?

344
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,809
Why were you being all cocky back there?

345
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,911
Who do you think you're talking to now?

346
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,113
Now the chief prosecutor
fancies you a bit,

347
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,215
have you lost your mind?

348
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,283
Yes, I have. 10 minutes ago.

349
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,487
I'm officially a mindless bitch now.

350
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,424
-Hey.
-College senior, my foot.

351
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,293
Do you think the class number is
like a gym locker number or what?

352
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,329
So what do you say?

353
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,098
Do you want me to assemble
all your class just because of you?

354
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,002
Aren't you also here
to impress your superiors?

355
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,670
What do we do then?

356
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,107
All we need to do is
stay humble and focus on our goal.

357
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,342
Let's keep it up, buddy.

358
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,445
Why do you have to be such a buzzkill?

359
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,847
Unbelievable.

360
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,518
If you're intimidated,
just tell me you are.

361
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,786
Don't snicker.

362
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,289
Get it together, okay?

363
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,228
One more thing.

364
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:04,997
Stop gorging on the food.

365
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,566
You kept eating like a pig.

366
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,602
I'm hungry too.

367
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,508
Detective Jang, you know

368
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:20,012
how much Father Kim
has contributed to this neighborhood.

369
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,649
Who reformed all the juvenile delinquents
in this neighborhood?

370
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,785
You brats.

371
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,288
How many times have I told you
to be nice to your friends

372
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,390
and not to fight with them?

373
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,760
But he beat up the kids so much.

374
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,662
We have physical punishment
in the temple too.

375
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,030
Whether in a temple or in the world,

376
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,666
if necessary, you need to get beaten up
in order to learn the better good.

377
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,034
And look.

378
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,204
Who put the most effort
into taking care of the orphans?

379
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,108
Children love Father Kim.

380
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,143
He's right.

381
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,312
Still, it won't work.

382
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,847
This time, I can't just let him off,

383
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,250
unless Mr. Oh settles for it.

384
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,918
Is there anything we can do?

385
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,387
This time, I have no idea.

386
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,922
Then let's all pray

387
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,091
so the detective can come up with an idea.

388
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,926
Dear God.

389
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,862
Please get rid of the demon
that is possessing the detective.

390
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,832
Dear God, the Father Almighty...

391
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,335
-Please cast out the demons...
-Help us, Lord...

392
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,636
-Ohm Mani Padme Hum...
-Stop it.

393
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,304
Please help me fight the demon...

394
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,073
Please stop!

395
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,508
Stop!

396
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,510
-The Holy Spirit--
-I said stop.

397
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,748
My gosh.

398
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,985
There's a way, but...

399
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,057
But it's a bit....

400
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,245
You're stuck there again.

401
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,813
I'm out of breath.

402
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,649
Haven't you quit smoking yet?

403
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,788
I'm trying to smoke less.

404
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,659
Quit it. It will damage your bones.

405
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,735
Oh, my.

406
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,071
If it isn't Father Matthew.

407
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,739
How have you been?

408
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,408
I've been well, thanks.

409
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,577
Is Father Kim Hae-il doing all right?

410
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,279
Well, yes.

411
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,816
Actually, I called you because of him.

412
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,103
It's still tough.

413
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:22,093
The children who were taken
are in the armory.

414
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,602
Father.

415
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,173
Come out.

416
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,615
I must have gained weight.
It used to fit me before.

417
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,917
What's with all the fuss, by the way?

418
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,420
I think the chief wants some credit
from the police agency.

419
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,088
We just need to catch a few youngsters

420
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,790
and take some pictures of their hideout.

421
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,024
-Okay.
-Attention.

422
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,228
You know what to do. Make it quick,

423
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,829
catch the culprits,

424
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,097
and take pictures of the hideout.

425
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,235
This operation is classified top secret,

426
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,036
-so keep it confidential.
-Yes, sir!

427
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,738
Okay. Let's go.

428
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,641
Be quick.

429
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,909
-Did you bring everything?
-Yes.

430
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,245
Did you give a heads-up
to the Exit Three Gang?

431
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,247
-I texted them already.
-Good.

432
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,916
-Let's go.
-Wait.

433
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,085
We must tell Dae-yeong
there was a change of plan.

434
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,020
I'm sure the leader texted him already.

435
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,822
All right. Let's go.

436
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,628
THE WARM-HEARTED AND TRUSTWORTHY POLICE
IS ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE

437
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,631
GUDAM POLICE STATION

438
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,206
RECEIVE YOUR PUNISHMENT

439
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,974
YES BEEF TRIPE

440
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,243
What's taking them so long?

441
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,414
What's that?

442
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,249
Did they go up there?

443
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,187
FOUR BEATS KARAOKE

444
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,258
Damn it.

445
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,002
Welcome!

446
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,404
-Welcome, boss!
-Welcome, boss!

447
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,005
Nice to see you.

448
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,074
You've done it many times.
You know what to do.

449
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,142
-Yes, boss.
-Yes, boss.

450
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,143
Put these on

451
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,878
and say what we told you at the station.

452
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,246
-Yes, boss.
-Is this the evidence?

453
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,881
-That's right, boss.
-You're well-prepared.

454
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,749
Let me take pictures of the evidence.

455
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,418
You are under arrest

456
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,486
for running
an illegal gambling house, okay?

457
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,487
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

458
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,489
I don't see Dae-yeong, by the way.

459
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,793
HYEONDAE MANPOWER

460
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,194
Stand up!

461
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:37,729
You punk.

462
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,565
Receive your punishment.

463
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:46,671
What are you doing?

464
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,577
Receive what?

465
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,587
Why is it so hard
to find a toilet in this building?

466
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,923
Lucky me. There's toilet paper here.

467
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,958
I need a lot of toilet paper.

468
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:10,729
Excuse me.

469
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,664
I need to go number two.

470
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:14,833
It's urgent.

471
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,502
Hey, turn around.

472
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,208
It's really urgent.

473
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,846
Goddamn it.

474
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,848
Another close call.

475
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,516
The score is 9 to 0...

476
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,685
9 to 0? Seriously?

477
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,355
Oh, right. Did I call Dae-yeong?

478
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,658
He should be fine.

479
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,403
LIVABLE CITY GUDAM, A CITY FREE OF CRIME

480
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,304
Gosh.

481
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,674
It's cold.

482
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,510
I thought I wouldn't be cold
if I'm embarrassed.

483
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,555
Excuse me.

484
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,190
Stop the car.

485
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,662
Are you the Terminator or what?
Why are you naked?

486
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,265
It's me. Gu Dae-yeong.

487
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,902
Detective Gu. What are you doing here?

488
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,371
Did you drink again?

489
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,540
I'm glad you came soon.

490
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,709
Wait.

491
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:40,952
Stop! Hey!

492
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,792
I need to leave here to get released?

493
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,695
Hurry. You don't have time.

494
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,631
Father, please tell me. What's going on?

495
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,867
If you don't leave before sunrise,

496
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,469
they will issue an arrest warrant.

497
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,905
Mr. Oh is determined to
put you behind bars.

498
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,415
Stay with Father Lee Yeong-jun for now.

499
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,721
Did you call Father Lee?

500
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,289
Why did you do that?

501
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,892
He should know, of course.

502
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,528
He's like a father to you.

503
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,530
Why do I have to leave here?

504
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,699
All those criminals are still here.

505
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,438
Father Kim, you need to be healed.

506
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,507
I don't need that.

507
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,742
Of course you do.

508
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,811
You have no self-control whatsoever.

509
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,714
How could I hold myself back
with a scumbag like Oh?

510
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,817
If you can't, take off your cassock.

511
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,119
Then you can do whatever you like.

512
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,425
Until now,

513
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,962
I have been turning a blind eye to you
whenever you crossed the line.

514
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,732
You had your reasons

515
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,369
and I believed you could control yourself.

516
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,404
But not anymore.

517
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,908
Father Kim, you're just angry.

518
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,887
I will tell the church members
and the orphans

519
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,522
on your behalf.

520
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,805
Receive your punishment.

521
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,241
Punishment...

522
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,443
Receive your punishment.

523
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,779
Receive this.

524
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,551
You found my clothes.

525
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:01,686
I didn't find them.

526
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,123
The guys from Exit Three Gang
sent them. It was cash on delivery.

527
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,627
I can claim that
as a business expense, right?

528
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,298
How can you sleep now?

529
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,802
Look. You're a police officer,

530
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,237
and you disgraced yourself.

531
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,306
Who printed this?

532
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,175
Why'd you have to print it so big?

533
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,951
Lastly, would you like to
say a word to the viewers?

534
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,087
Dear viewers and citizens of Gudam.

535
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,523
As the director of Gudam District,

536
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,558
I will make Gudam

537
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,961
a livable and safe place

538
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,295
for everyone.

539
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,897
Please keep an eye on me.

540
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,366
Now that was Gudam District's best worker

541
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,435
who topped three sectors,

542
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,537
welfare, security, and economy

543
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,972
at Seoul district evaluation,

544
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,140
the director of Gudam District,
Jeong Dong-ja.

545
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,543
-Cut.
-Good work, everyone.

546
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,578
-Good work.
-Thank you.

547
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,579
Shall we wrap it up?

548
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,884
Gosh, you looked amazing in the camera.

549
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,453
Didn't I look too tough?

550
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,921
-No way.
-Did I look all right?

551
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,022
You looked adequately tough

552
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,724
and adequately nice.

553
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:14,659
By the way, Cheol-beom,

554
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,297
haven't you wrapped up
the Gudam History Museum project yet?

555
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,965
Everyone is rushing me.

556
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,968
Hasn't Mr. Seo given in yet?

557
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,637
I'll wrap it up by the end of the day.
Don't worry.

558
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,340
Then what are you doing here now?

559
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,808
Go finish it up.

560
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,111
Gosh, I will.

561
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,847
Let me feed the old guys first.

562
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,882
Goodness.

563
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:42,487
LIVABLE CITY GUDAM, A CITY FREE OF CRIME

564
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,300
A petition for a fair investigation

565
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,568
was present to the government.

566
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,871
Look.

567
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,807
Do you think law is
like old people's card game rules?

568
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,643
You say whatever you don't like is wrong.

569
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,880
Seriously. What's wrong
with you ignorant people?

570
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,716
Then do you believe
there is no problem at all?

571
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,552
Yes, I believe I am fair.

572
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,587
Then let me ask you one more question.

573
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,089
Enough!

574
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,159
This is the true face
of Korean prosecution.

575
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,728
I'm Oh Bo-yeong of UBS News.

576
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:26,931
Hey, Sawadee Krab!

577
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,535
Say it properly, you moron.

578
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,471
Say, "Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers".

579
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:36,107
Teepee pie... Piper...

580
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,542
Pee-pee?

581
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,280
You never seem to learn.

582
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,282
Gosh, they're doing that again.

583
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,685
You're so ugly.

584
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,822
He's a foreigner.
Please cut him some slack.

585
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,424
Doesn't he have to speak Korean well
in order to make Korean money?

586
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,226
Don't you think so?

587
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,794
I do.

588
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,563
-Am I right?
-Wait.

589
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,537
-You're doing that again.
-He's my Thai friend.

590
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,709
-Hello.
-I'll see you again.

591
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,479
Thank you.

592
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,580
Hello.

593
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,019
Help yourself.

594
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,288
Try this too.

595
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,356
Thank you.

596
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,525
-It's good.
-How's your business going?

597
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,626
-It's going well.
-Good.

598
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,196
-Thank you.
-My pleasure. Enjoy.

599
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,098
Take this too. Hello.

600
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,666
Mr. Seo is here.

601
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:43,908
Hello, sir.

602
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,043
Get out.

603
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,413
Damn it.

604
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,382
Sit.

605
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,820
Mr. Seo.

606
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:02,326
Did I ask you to sell it
at a ridiculously low price?

607
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:04,762
Did I?

608
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,031
I offered a reasonable price.

609
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,167
Did you not understand what I said?

610
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,202
Well, Mr. Hwang.

611
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,038
The market price changes--

612
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,973
Market price, my ass.

613
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,944
Why don't Korean people
listen when someone speaks nicely?

614
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,345
Why?

615
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,148
This is the era of rationality.

616
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,984
Let's keep some common sense
and reason in our minds, okay?

617
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,655
-Okay.
-So you're willing to talk, right?

618
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,323
Then I'll get going.

619
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,525
Why are you so silent?

620
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,127
Yes, sir.

621
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,932
You'd better not change your mind later.

622
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,101
Mr. Hwang.

623
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,073
Could you please give me
some time to think?

624
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,179
Time?

625
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,983
Oh, well. Mr. Seo.

626
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,154
Just for one minute,
let's get back to the era of ambition.

627
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,960
-Hold him down.
-No, please!

628
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,068
Who is coming today?

629
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,604
Why is Father Lee so happy this morning?

630
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,038
Someone from Yeosu Diocese is coming.

631
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,373
He used to be Father Lee's student.

632
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,275
So not an official appointment, then?

633
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,177
No, it seems that he'll
stay as a guest for a while.

634
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,478
Could you take this?

635
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,347
Goodness.

636
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,383
Why did you buy so many things?

637
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,120
I'll do all the cooking today,

638
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,389
so stay out of the kitchen.

639
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,458
Hello, Father.

640
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,137
What brings you here today, brothers?

641
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,640
What are you asking?
You know why we are here.

642
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,543
Is it because of the same matter?

643
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,146
I said I wouldn't change my mind.

644
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,581
Please tell your boss that.

645
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,217
Oh, right. Would you like to have
some cookies before you go?

646
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,853
Gosh, I wish I could just knock him over.

647
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:12,123
-Are you deaf or something?
-Could you watch your mouth?

648
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:13,724
My, my.

649
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,361
Look at your eyes full of the Holy Spirit.
Blessed out of your mind, aren't you?

650
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,731
Hey, look.

651
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,334
If you don't stop, I'll call the police.

652
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,835
Okay. Go on and call the police.

653
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:28,706
Please don't be like this.
Come have some cookies.

654
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,108
I have cookies

655
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,811
because they stick to my teeth.

656
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,813
I will come by every day
starting from today.

657
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,624
DAEBEOM TRADING

658
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,125
-Na-eun.
-Yes.

659
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,827
You've been working here for years

660
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,662
and you still don't know
how much water to put in?

661
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,464
Do you want me to get you more water?

662
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,633
Do you think I want cold noodles?

663
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,035
-Get out.
-I'm sorry.

664
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,506
How's Mr. Seo?

665
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,875
His scalp was burst open quite bad
but his brain is fine.

666
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,712
He must be conscious then.

667
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,847
Take two copies of the contract to him.

668
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,682
-He'll sign them right away.
-Yes, sir.

669
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,686
Did Jang Ryong go to the cathedral?

670
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:16,687
Yes.

671
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,823
Make sure he bothers them every day.

672
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,225
-We don't have much time left.
-Yes, sir.

673
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,293
Good.

674
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,730
This tastes awful.

675
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,019
I'm back.

676
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,327
Welcome back.

677
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,165
Don't you eat much nowadays?
Why have you become so thin?

678
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,934
Cool people are all slim like me.

679
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,471
Let's get in and eat.

680
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,508
I made your favorite food,
seaweed soup and suyuk.

681
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,476
That's for mothers who just gave birth.

682
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,711
Don't make me sound like one.

683
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,280
Let's go.

684
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,317
Through Christ, our Lord.

685
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,219
-Amen.
-Amen.

686
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,688
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

687
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,157
-Amen.
-Amen.

688
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,594
You seem to know Father Lee well.

689
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:31,962
Yes.

690
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,298
Since when do you know each other?

691
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,233
-Since a long time ago.
-A long time ago.

692
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,635
When is that?

693
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,838
A very long time ago.

694
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,908
-And how long is a long--
-Why don't we start eating now?

695
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,276
Okay.

696
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,945
What brings you here from Yeosu?

697
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,079
-Sister.
-Yes?

698
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,148
Save your questions
until the dinner is over.

699
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,885
I came because I caused trouble.

700
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,256
I beat up a laity
and his minion almost to death.

701
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,660
I heard one of them
still can't close his mouth properly.

702
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,038
Goodness. I apologize.

703
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,608
Gosh.

704
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:22,313
A priest is not supposed
to make jokes like that.

705
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,615
I'm not joking.

706
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,620
It happened for real.

707
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,791
Why don't we eat first?

708
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,469
Father Lee made
all the food himself today.

709
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,104
At least try to enjoy the food.

710
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,475
I had some jajangmyeon
before I came here, so...

711
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:52,943
I see.

712
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,713
You should have just come.
Why did you eat--

713
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,147
I ate it because I wanted to!

714
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,718
-This is annoying.
-Goodness.

715
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,921
Why are you yelling at me?
You're scaring me--

716
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:04,922
Come on.

717
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,325
Why don't you eat some eggplants?

718
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,027
Well.

719
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,897
Please excuse me.

720
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,965
But Father.

721
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,568
You need to say grace after the meal.

722
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,769
We can do that.

723
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,604
Father Han, please show him
the way to his room.

724
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,774
-Don't worry. I know where it is.
-But still--

725
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,310
This is no maze, I can go myself!

726
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,422
What's wrong with his temper?

727
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,961
Excuse me for asking this,

728
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,462
but before you are ordained,

729
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,998
you all take the personality test, right?

730
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,134
-Yes.
-Good.

731
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:51,869
Why do you ask?

732
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,272
Do you think Father Kim Hae-il is strange?

733
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,108
Well...

734
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,745
One moment, he was so quiet,
the next, he would suddenly yell!

735
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,316
I'm sorry.

736
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,586
You don't see that often.

737
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,422
Some priests are short-tempered.

738
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,357
No.

739
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,594
I think that was different

740
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,462
from ordinary people's anger.

741
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,097
How can I put it?

742
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,334
I felt some sort of madness from him.

743
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:34,612
Just a second.

744
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,051
Just a second.

745
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,195
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

746
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,030
Already?

747
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,266
Take it out again.

748
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,002
What?

749
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,305
I know you were drinking.

750
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,774
Look. I even made the snack you like.
Take it out.

751
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,777
Do you have psychic power now?

752
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,256
Would you like some?

753
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,725
Hey, that's yours.

754
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,094
I brought my glass.

755
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,467
Let me pour you some too.

756
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:43,414
This is great.

757
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,451
You can have only two more glasses today.

758
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,220
You need to offer the Mass tomorrow.

759
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,555
I do?

760
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,291
Now that you're here,
I want to take a week off.

761
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,927
I just came. You can't start
shoving me around already.

762
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,896
Why else would I have accepted you?

763
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,465
Let me, let me.

764
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:06,470
By the way,

765
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,506
why aren't you asking
about the trouble I caused?

766
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,743
Well, what can I do about it?

767
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,612
It's not like
you haven't caused trouble before.

768
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,583
Still,

769
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,686
you must have heard about my situation
from Father Kang.

770
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,189
Why did you accept me?

771
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,460
If your child ran away from home
and came back because he fell sick,

772
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,761
will you not let him in?

773
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,533
You, boy,

774
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,570
are connected to my soul.

775
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,673
So wherever you go and whatever happens,

776
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,508
we are destined to meet again.

777
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,312
Gosh, imagine how sick we'd be
of each other when we die.

778
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,283
Stay out of trouble

779
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,253
and stay out of gossips.

780
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,988
Behave yourself.

781
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,594
When you cause trouble, my soul hurts.

782
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,502
Welcome, sister.

783
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,738
Come on in.

784
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,541
-Songsak.
-Hello.

785
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,278
Say hi to the priest.

786
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:24,114
Hello.

787
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,818
Hello, Sister Angela.

788
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,920
-How are you, Father?
-I'm good, thanks.

789
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:33,090
Is the young priest new here?

790
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,459
He's staying here for a while.

791
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,594
See you later.

792
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:38,729
Okay.

793
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,131
-Welcome.
-Hello.

794
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,136
That's one good-looking man.

795
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,444
Hello, sir.

796
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:57,915
That way, please.

797
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,819
Hello.

798
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,265
The Lord be with you.

799
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:18,335
-And with your Spirit.
-And with your Spirit.

800
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,638
A reading from the holy Gospel
according to Matthew.

801
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,243
-Glory to you, O Lord.
-Glory to you, O Lord.

802
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,446
"Love your enemies

803
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,950
and pray for those who persecute you,

804
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:38,488
that you may be
children of your Father in heaven."

805
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,092
That's what He said.

806
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,833
How can we truly become God's children?

807
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,169
We ask this to ourselves endlessly.

808
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:57,040
The first step
to truly become His children...

809
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:04,381
The first step
to truly become His children

810
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,949
is to admit our sin, and...

811
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:06,984
Hey, you!

812
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,520
You, there.

813
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,223
Two, four, six, eight.
You, mocha bread, eighth row.

814
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,392
Get out.

815
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,561
How dare you eat bread during Mass?

816
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,366
Get out right now.

817
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:38,715
Pull it.

818
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,784
You have to pull, you little...

819
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,229
So...

820
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,031
Where was I?

821
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:55,966
Great, now I forgot.

822
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,338
Oh, Father.

823
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,287
How can we truly become God's children?

824
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,323
We ask this to ourselves endlessly.

825
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,991
But,

826
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:27,564
why do you come to church
to ask for forgiveness?

827
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,301
Go to the people you did ill to
and ask for their forgiveness first.

828
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,236
Don't be just all talk.

829
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:37,007
Scrape out the bottom of your heart
as you would scrape out a scorched pan,

830
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:38,642
and go apologize to them.

831
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,845
It needs to be approved
by the people you did ill to

832
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,213
in order to be approved by God.

833
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,749
Can we approve it on their behalf?
No way. Why?

834
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,052
Because we don't do approvals.

835
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,621
We only deliver the documents.

836
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,365
What's wrong with the priest?

837
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,800
How can I ask so many people
to forgive me one by one?

838
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:04,935
If they don't forgive us,

839
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,803
we can't confess our sins to him or what?

840
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:08,772
That was a weird homily.

841
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,108
-The priest was weird too.
-I know, right?

842
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,480
-In the name of the Father, Son,
-In the name of the Father, Son,

843
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,048
-and the Holy Spirit.
-and the Holy Spirit.

844
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,416
-Amen.
-Amen.

845
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,221
It's been three weeks
since my last confession.

846
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:29,226
I got cranky at my work colleagues

847
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,294
and I spoke carelessly too.

848
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,897
Did you apologize to your colleagues
and ask for forgiveness?

849
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:34,798
No.

850
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:37,234
Go and sincerely ask
for their forgiveness.

851
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,502
You can go now.

852
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,671
You want me to just go?

853
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,306
Yes.

854
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,674
But Father.

855
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,676
Won't you give me penance or any advice?

856
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:49,613
No, think about what you did wrong
and come back later.

857
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,049
But--

858
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,220
Excuse me, Father.

859
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,092
Why do you listen
to confessions like that?

860
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,531
Anything wrong about it?

861
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,934
Gosh, he looks even more handsome
from up close.

862
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:16,039
Isn't it against the church rules?

863
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,141
A laity lodging a complaint
to a priest like this

864
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,776
is more against the church rules.

865
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,679
But you weren't carrying out
your sacrament faithfully first.

866
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,648
I think I'm being fair.

867
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,717
Yes, I believe I'm fair.

868
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,719
Then let me ask you one more question.

869
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,288
Enough!

870
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,293
Apologize to me.

871
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,161
Or I'll file an official complaint
with the diocese.

872
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,431
Suit yourself.

873
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,200
You don't know who I am, do you?

874
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,568
My.

875
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:46,870
Ma'am.

876
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,272
You want to show off you're a prosecutor?

877
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,310
Father Lee must have told you already.

878
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,178
No. I saw you on TV.

879
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,080
At the end, you were like...

880
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,484
Did you see that?

881
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,719
Except for that last stopped frame,
I looked pretty.

882
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,122
Right. Your peepers looked
very pretty, old lady.

883
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,290
Old lady?

884
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,159
Why would you call me that?

885
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,730
Anyway, people like you go
to churches, cathedrals, and temples.

886
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,166
They donate a lot of money
and commit a lot of sins.

887
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,336
But they actually come
to feel better about themselves.

888
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,607
They don't care about people
whom they hurt at all.

889
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,944
I'm not hurting anyone, Father.

890
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,312
Anyway, sister.

891
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,249
Putting holy water on your forehead
won't automatically get you to heaven.

892
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,684
Those who go to churches
to commit sins comfortably

893
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,987
can't go to heaven
even if they bathe in holy water.

894
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:37,988
Do you understand?

895
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,563
I'll let you off today.

896
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:49,432
Because you're so freaking handsome.

897
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,939
She's one of those annoying types.

898
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,615
-Father.
-Yes.

899
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,653
Father Lee told you to say hi
to the kids in the orphanage.

900
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,289
He said he told the kids
that there's a new priest.

901
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,723
He's all excited.

902
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,458
Shoving me around like this.

903
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,331
Keep it.

904
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,073
My, this is...

905
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,409
This is a big offering.

906
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,044
It's for you.

907
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,545
Buy yourself some food you'd like to eat.

908
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:42,419
You're giving me this money
because I won't listen to you, right?

909
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,988
It's just a present.

910
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,456
Just take it back.

911
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,226
Our church will manage the facilities.

912
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,364
Look. If you just entrust me
with the facilities,

913
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:56,600
the children and the disabled
will be treated even better.

914
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,501
We will build a new building

915
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,736
and feed them well.

916
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,707
It's not easy, but it's still doable.

917
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,743
I'm just trying to do a good deed.
Why won't you let me?

918
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,346
There are other good deeds you can do.

919
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:11,348
You know,

920
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:13,450
I'm rich.

921
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,285
I don't need money.

922
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:17,988
Father.

923
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,391
I always pester you.
Why do you always smile?

924
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,460
I would rather like you to yell at me.

925
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,128
Come here!

926
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,399
Have some noodles before you go.

927
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,245
One!

928
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,147
-Two.
-Three.

929
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,248
Right or left!

930
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,085
Darn it.

931
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,658
This is Gudam Police Station
violent crime squad.

932
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:55,659
I'm Gu Dae-yeong.

933
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,429
What? A mugger?

934
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,665
Where is the location?

935
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:06,336
84-1 Hwail-dong,
the 2nd floor of Gguldanji Supermarket.

936
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:07,937
Okay.

937
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,308
Detective Gu. I want you to go
to the groundbreaking ceremony now.

938
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,843
-But I have work to do now.
-Let Detective Heo take the case.

939
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:14,878
But he's eating...

940
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,846
-I'll take off.
-Hey!

941
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,315
Come on.

942
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:21,351
It's an official event. I'm sure there are
conscripted police officers there.

943
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,853
Hey, we need to at least send one officer

944
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,755
to not embarrass ourselves
in front of Mr. Hwang.

945
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,924
Embarrass ourselves? What for?

946
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,928
We're detectives,
not government officials' dogs.

947
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,764
-The chief will be there too.
-Why didn't you just say so?

948
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:36,966
There you go.

949
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,669
Go Dae-yong!

950
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:40,870
-Bye, sir!
-Bye, sir!

951
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,675
The representative of Daebeom Trading,
Hwang Cheol-beom is with us today.

952
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,445
The guests on the platform

953
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,347
may now come down.

954
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,817
Today, as of this event,

955
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:56,853
the construction of Gudam History Museum
will begin.

956
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,789
GUDAM HISTORY MUSEUM
GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY

957
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:08,398
We want the evil businessman,
Hwang Cheol-beom's explanation

958
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,833
on the unfair land acquisition!

959
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,835
-We want the explanation!
-We want the explanation!

960
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,204
On the count of three,

961
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,140
please dig up the soil.

962
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,442
-You're not supposed to cross this line.
-One.

963
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:20,844
Two.

964
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,279
-Three.
-Hey!

965
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,881
Save Gudam District!

966
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,651
We want Hwang Cheol-beom
to stay out of Gudam District!

967
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:30,954
Get off of me!

968
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,923
-Hwang Cheol-beom out!
-Hwang Cheol-beom out!

969
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,059
-Hwang Cheol-beom out!
-Hwang Cheol-beom out!

970
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,161
-Hwang Cheol-beom out!
-Hwang Cheol-beom out!

971
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,596
Withdraw now!

972
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:40,964
That concludes

973
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,701
the groundbreaking ceremony.

974
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,103
Sir, where are you going? Sir!

975
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,505
What? Hey!

976
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,907
-Get out of the way.
-Come here!

977
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,542
-Get them!
-What's happening?

978
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:53,977
-Help!
-You bastards!

979
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,212
They're stomping on people.

980
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,983
But the police officers are just...

981
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,585
Why are the people...

982
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,989
Stay out of trouble.

983
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:10,126
Stay out of gossips. Behave yourself.

984
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,061
-What...
-Let's go.

985
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,963
-What?
-Let's go.

986
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:15,532
But shouldn't we help them?

987
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,133
The police will take care of it. Let's go.

988
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,369
But why are they just leaving?

989
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,004
-We need to say hello to--
-Father!

990
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,139
Please help us.

991
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,642
We are nothing but weak lambs.

992
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,578
Father! Please don't abandon us.

993
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,647
Please don't abandon us.

994
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,348
-Please.
-We need to hurry.

995
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,384
-Let's go.
-The priest abandoned us!

996
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,618
No, I didn't.

997
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,388
Oh, God Almighty!

998
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,796
Why does it thunder now?

999
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,240
Damn it.

1000
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,076
-Cheol-beom...
-Catch him!

1001
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,445
Hey! Stop there, you rat!

1002
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,247
Get it done.

1003
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,882
Don't worry. Get back safely.

1004
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,956
You asshole!

1005
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,627
Get off of me!

1006
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:19,395
-Come here.
-Get off of me!

1007
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:20,730
You crazy bastards.

1008
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,199
-Come here.
-Damn it.

1009
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,735
-Hold him.
-Stop it!

1010
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,604
-Let go!
-I'll break something on you, punk.

1011
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,205
-Let him go.
-Let go of me!

1012
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:30,206
Let him go.

1013
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,143
What?

1014
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,046
What?

1015
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:40,950
What?

1016
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,391
State your name and rank.

1017
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,092
Detective Gu Dae-yeong
of Gudam Police Station.

1018
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,295
You can't just sit back and watch
people getting stomped!

1019
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:26,296
Sir.

1020
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,498
Make sure you don't get sick eating it.

1021
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,668
We have a rookie. Say hello.

1022
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:35,705
We need to choose her partner.

1023
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,808
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-I have a bad feeling about this.

1024
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,009
I'm sorry for concerning you.

1025
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,179
Do what thugs do
like you have always done.

1026
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,547
I love playing too.

1027
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,982
Do you want me to send you to hell?

1028
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,317
I told you to stop.

1029
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,652
They're trash that isn't even recyclable.

1030
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,087
They were let off with a warning.

1031
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,455
It shouldn't end just with a warning!

1032
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,424
You're a priest. Don't yell at me.

1033
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:56,392
My job is to judge and convict sinners.

1034
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:59,362
What kind of priest are you,
so prickly all the time?

1035
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,967
