1
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,120
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,421
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,761
Run. Father Han, run!

4
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,697
No, don't! You bastards!

5
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,332
No, come at me instead. Fight me instead!

6
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,034
Father Han.

7
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,070
Hey! Seong-gyu!

8
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,740
Hae-il.

9
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,308
It'll be fine.

10
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,681
Lee Jung-gwon, you bastard!

11
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,619
Why do you always
pick on me and curse at my face?

12
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:53,753
You should stop that.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,055
Anyway, where's the money?

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,457
Touch him again and I'll kill you.

15
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,727
Just know that everything
that happens here from now on

16
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:03,797
is all your fault.

17
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,167
Jung-gwon...

18
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,769
Jung-gwon, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,238
I'll give your money back.

20
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,075
Just show some mercy this one time.

21
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,576
Begin.

22
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,684
No. No, don't. Don't.

23
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,288
Seong-gyu, no. No!

24
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,099
Father Han.

25
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,209
Please, wait.

26
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,645
Seong-gyu.

27
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,249
Please.

28
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,235
I'm going to kill that son of a bitch.

29
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,608
What's going on? How is he?

30
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,912
They said we need to wait
until the surgery is over.

31
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,940
Is Mr. Han Seong-gyu's guardian here?

32
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,950
How is Seong-gyu... I mean, Father Han?

33
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,786
He had a severe epidural hemorrhage.

34
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,489
We were able to avoid the worst
with the surgery,

35
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,425
but he is in a critical state.

36
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,128
"Critical"? What do you mean?

37
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,631
We've done everything we can, medically.

38
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,599
We can only hope for his will to live

39
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,601
and a miracle to help him.

40
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,803
So the chances of him getting better...

41
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,039
They are extremely low, ma'am.

42
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,082
That can't be true.

43
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,486
Surgeries are supposed to save lives.

44
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,389
You need to save him.

45
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,357
You're a doctor.

46
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,427
You have to save Seong-gyu, don't you?

47
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,895
You're a doctor!

48
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,630
Doctor.

49
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,799
Please save Seong-gyu.

50
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,201
Please save Seong-gyu, Doctor.

51
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,936
-Please save him.
-Father.

52
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,539
He can live, right? Doctor!

53
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,541
Please save Seong-gyu, Doctor.

54
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,776
Doctor!

55
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,126
Father...

56
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,916
Is it...

57
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,586
Is it still not enough for you?

58
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,761
Why...

59
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,599
Why would you do this?

60
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,039
Why would you do this?

61
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,981
Why are you always so harsh on me?

62
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,022
How much more will you take from me

63
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,925
before you're satisfied?

64
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,563
How much more?

65
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,969
How much more will it take to satisfy you?

66
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,491
Why are you being so harsh on me?

67
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,530
How much more do you need?

68
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,056
It's getting late. You should return home.

69
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,292
I'll stay by Sister Kim's side.

70
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,128
Father Han is such an angel.

71
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,935
He's the kindest soul in this world.

72
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,772
Father Marco.

73
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,344
Let's go home, Detective Seo.

74
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,224
Hey, did he die?

75
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,660
If you don't tell me where the money is,

76
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,928
it will be one each day.

77
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,330
What will you do?

78
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,066
Aren't you going to answer, Hae-il?

79
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,035
Do you know what you're doing wrong?

80
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,471
What?

81
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,006
You're screwing with someone

82
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,144
who should never be taken from this world.

83
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,080
Are you drunk?

84
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,549
You didn't kill one man,

85
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,919
but the whole world.

86
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,023
Will you cut the crap
and just answer my questions?

87
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,199
Forget about the grace period I gave you.

88
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,371
You're dead the moment

89
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,508
I catch sight of you.

90
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,151
Damn it.

91
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,321
That's the voice he uses
when he's completely flipped out.

92
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,657
Then what do we do with the money?

93
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,325
That's not the problem right now.

94
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,661
The problem is we're wanted right now.

95
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,431
Then what do we do, sir?

96
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,133
Let's flee the country

97
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,603
and get the money before we do, if we can.

98
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,472
Listen to me carefully.

99
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,676
Make sure to give the guys enough
so they can last a few months,

100
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,411
and close down the company.

101
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,480
You guys stay hidden for now.

102
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,350
No, sir. I'll send them away
and guard the office.

103
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,587
Me, too. How could we hide?

104
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,157
We can bring back the company in no time
as long as we're alive.

105
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:56,262
We need to focus on
sparing ourselves right now.

106
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,430
All right?

107
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,198
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

108
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,901
Then what are you planning on doing, sir?

109
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,036
I'm already wanted

110
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,973
and you will be soon enough,

111
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,541
so let's flee the country.

112
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,943
What will you do if you can't?

113
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,112
I'll contact the Night Mole of Mullae-dong

114
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,947
and ask for a reliable passport broker.

115
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,416
Are you going to forge passports, sir?

116
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,918
Hurry up.

117
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,254
But let's meet up with Lee Jung-gwon
before we go.

118
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,492
Why don't we just teach him a lesson
when this is all over, sir?

119
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,861
I'm not trying to teach him a lesson.

120
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,130
I just need to take care of something.

121
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,371
Father, are you listening?

122
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,906
You know,

123
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,943
if the Lord is going to take

124
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,446
Father Han as well this time,

125
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,751
isn't that too much?

126
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,553
It's already this painful for me.

127
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,391
How in the world would Father Kim bear it?

128
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,826
This time,

129
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,530
even I can tell it's too harsh.

130
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,929
I must protect these people here.

131
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,166
But in order to do so,

132
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,905
I must be the one to leave them.

133
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,043
Lord.

134
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:56,048
Please drive me out
into the vast wilderness.

135
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,725
REQUEST FOR WITHDRAWAL OF PRIESTSHIP

136
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,726
What is this?

137
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,568
Have you consulted the head priest?

138
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,472
I understand that
you've been through a lot,

139
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,641
but these are times
when you should be patient and pray,

140
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,544
waiting for the Lord's guidance.

141
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,513
I don't need a consultation.

142
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,586
Father Kim.

143
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,647
Are you tracking Kang Seok-tae,
Hwang Cheol-beom, and Lee Jung-gwon?

144
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,049
Yes, ma'am.
The detectives are tracking down

145
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,651
Chief Kang and Mr. Hwang,

146
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,987
and we turned over Lee Jung-gwon's case
to the NIS.

147
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,588
"Turned over"? Why?

148
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,390
They're going to deploy special forces.

149
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,926
They said it will be too complicated
for us to handle.

150
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,863
I guess it might be hard to catch him

151
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,365
since he has too much information.

152
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,237
What an honor to have you here
at our shabby place.

153
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,572
Don't try to get cute.

154
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,707
Can you get a cloned van

155
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,709
and four passports for us?

156
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,279
We can get you the car,

157
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,047
but I don't do passports anymore.

158
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,649
I heard you did until last week.

159
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,317
I quit six days ago.

160
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,026
Then I guess you can die
on the seventh day.

161
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,430
I guess I can go back for a while.

162
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,166
Sure.
How long will it take if you rush it?

163
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,203
-About a week?
-Get it done in three days.

164
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,924
Get me an access code within an hour.

165
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,492
Make the IP address untrackable.

166
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,928
What access code?

167
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,899
-To my old office.
-The NIS?

168
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,368
I can't do that, Hae-il.

169
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,204
It will be over for me if I get caught.

170
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,074
Message it to this ID when it's done.

171
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,643
But I even helped you

172
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,113
find that place
at the French Village last time.

173
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,381
That was a favor.

174
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,484
This is an order.

175
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,387
One hour.

176
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,090
You know what happens
if you take longer, right?

177
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,726
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,097
See you, sir.

179
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,599
His phone has been turned off all day.

180
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,402
Sister Kim said he left early.

181
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,038
Where in the world did he go?

182
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,774
Ma'am, I need to show you something.

183
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,282
MT. YEONGYU ECOLOGY DEPARTMENT

184
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,123
I'm going to die.

185
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,126
Is this...

186
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,663
It's a video of Jang Ryong
and his henchman

187
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,331
moving Father Lee's body.

188
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,506
Did Father Kim see the video?

189
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,808
We weren't in the situation
to tell him yesterday,

190
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,810
and we couldn't reach him today.

191
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,646
Throw in the bobbed-hair one, first.

192
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:48,948
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,017
And you send the video to Father Kim
and keep checking,

194
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,686
in case he turns his phone on.

195
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:54,820
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:59,158
I think we should deploy armed officers
to the cathedral, just in case.

197
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,392
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,585
Mr. Hwang and I worked so hard
to bring up Daebeom Trading.

199
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,788
It was all for nothing.

200
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,333
Hey, why do you look so gloomy?

201
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,237
Aren't you supposed to be
eating jjajangmyeon right now?

202
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,540
I'm sick of it.

203
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,844
Is it because you're scared of me?

204
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,045
No way.

205
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,415
I just got magically sick of it.

206
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,450
I've lost my appetite, too.

207
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,886
You follow me.

208
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,622
It's my break time, anyway,

209
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,758
so give me 20 minutes.

210
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,059
Twenty minutes...

211
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,030
Are you going to beat me again?

212
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,232
Shut up and just follow me.

213
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,004
But...

214
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,774
That jerk's on a motorbike.

215
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,342
How am I supposed to... Where do I go?

216
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:26,612
This is

217
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,281
the fried squid.

218
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,084
Enjoy.
It's half price for employees today.

219
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,919
What brings you two here today?

220
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,991
I brought him here
because he's gotten sick of jjajangmyeon.

221
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,693
That's my problem, not yours.

222
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,595
Just eat up, dude.

223
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,030
You're getting out of line.

224
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,331
Why, you...

225
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,237
You think you're better than me, too?

226
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,507
Here. Take this

227
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,342
and eat up.

228
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,912
Are you treating me to this

229
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,247
because you felt bad about beating me up?

230
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,316
What was that, again?

231
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,285
Peter Piper picked a peck...

232
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,719
You're the one who made me do that.

233
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,488
Did you feel bad about that?

234
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,622
No.

235
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,659
It's because you're my friend.

236
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,127
Who are you calling your friend?

237
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,262
You look at least 12 years older.

238
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,499
Yes, you can't make friends that easily.

239
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,633
Forget about him.

240
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,370
Why, you rude little pig!

241
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,308
You know what, Long-D?

242
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,010
You were my friend from the beginning.

243
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,481
You're the first person

244
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,350
who spoke to me when I first got here.

245
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,786
"Where are you from, punk?

246
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,921
Why did you come here, punk?"

247
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,425
That was enough to make me happy, though.

248
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,629
Look how huge this squid is.

249
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,797
Eat up.

250
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,067
What's wrong with you?

251
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,502
Come on.

252
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:00,839
Whatever.

253
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,177
I was picking on you,
not giving attention.

254
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,413
I'm only eating this because you offered.

255
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,858
-It's tasty.
-It is, isn't it?

256
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,994
-Should we each have one?
-Go ahead.

257
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,798
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

258
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,001
PASSION SNACKS

259
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,769
This place is quite good.

260
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,371
I should come here often.

261
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,406
Hey.

262
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,912
Goodbye, friend.

263
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,346
Who are you calling your friend?

264
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,916
Stop embarrassing me.

265
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,751
Long-D,
we're the ones who should be embarrassed.

266
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,319
You dress so weirdly, too.

267
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,487
What's wrong with my clothes?

268
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,622
These are handmade by an Italian master.

269
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,257
Jang Ryong!

270
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,526
What's going on?

271
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,663
You are arrested on suspicion of dumping
the body of Father Lee Yeong-jun.

272
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,830
I did what?

273
00:19:58,897 --> 00:19:59,998
Let's make this easy.

274
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,733
What did I...

275
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,970
Make what easy?

276
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,972
-Follow me.
-What did I do?

277
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,340
I didn't do anything!

278
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,776
Songsak!

279
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,211
Come on!

280
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,112
-Oh, my gosh.
-Let go!

281
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,261
LOADING

282
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,235
LEE JUNG-GWON TRACKING HISTORY

283
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,843
REAL-TIME LOCATION

284
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,779
NIS AGENT DISPATCHED FOR ARREST

285
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,449
He's on the ground, right?

286
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,437
Who used the phone and wi-fi?

287
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,839
I'm sorry, sir.
I had to call my sister at the hospital.

288
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:51,343
I thought I told you not to use the phone
unless it's an unregistered one?

289
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,511
I'm sorry, sir.

290
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,913
They can track us down
within a minute these days.

291
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,216
How did Kim Hae-il find us here?

292
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,651
Damn it!

293
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,154
Do you admit to everything?

294
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,223
I don't remember it.

295
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,592
You don't remember it?

296
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,365
That's all right. The camera remembers it.

297
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,135
Who killed him?

298
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,870
Was it you?

299
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,106
Fine. It was me.

300
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,177
I killed him because he kept teasing me.

301
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,013
How did you kill him?

302
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,382
I beat him up.

303
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,518
It's not difficult to beat up an old man.

304
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,462
Jang Ryong.

305
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,366
This is really the end.

306
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,535
It's the end of your bobbed hair, too.

307
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,612
Yes, sir.

308
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,081
Thank you very much for your help.

309
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,052
I hope you can pull some strings
and help me out.

310
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,989
Yes, sir. I will be a great addition
to the future of Hanju Group.

311
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,093
No doubt, sir. Of course.

312
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,728
Take care, sir.

313
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,938
He'll have no choice if he wants his son
to be kept out of this.

314
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,744
What?

315
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,447
Chief Kang is going to hand himself in?

316
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,515
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,850
And he even got a defense council
from three law firms.

318
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,787
Which ones?

319
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,289
Lee and Park, Atlantic, and Taejong.

320
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,127
I see he's got himself an invincible army.

321
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,196
But you know,

322
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,299
there's definitely something fishy here.

323
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,436
That's right, ma'am. They all come
from the legal team at Hanju Group.

324
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,774
I knew that man would go asking for help
from Hanju Group.

325
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,111
That Chief Kang is a world-champion

326
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,281
at changing positions and taking sides.

327
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,586
What time is the appearance, again?

328
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:15,587
He will come at 9:30 a.m.

329
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,427
What is it, Seung-a?

330
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,397
What's going on? What did Father Kim do?

331
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,798
Hello, ma'am.

332
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,434
Let's sit down and talk.

333
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,505
What are you talking about?

334
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,441
Father Kim turned in

335
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,511
a request for withdrawal to the church.

336
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,080
Do you mean he stepped down completely?

337
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,915
There's a procedure he must take,

338
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,385
so I'm sure it wasn't accepted.

339
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,421
Why in the world...

340
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:53,658
I think he's trying to stay away from us.

341
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,527
He's doing it on purpose,

342
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,863
to keep us from danger.

343
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,933
I think he has other reasons as well.

344
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,906
I think he's going to do something serious
to Lee Jung-gwon.

345
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,574
Something a priest shouldn't do.

346
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:14,379
No. He mustn't do that.

347
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,448
Could you two focus

348
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,417
on finding Father Kim first?

349
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,619
All right.

350
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,154
If something like that does happen,

351
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,090
we might never have

352
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,260
Father Kim by our side again.

353
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,136
Hae-il.

354
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,339
It's nice, my spiritual brother Seong-gyu.

355
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,292
The phone has been turned off.
Your call will be forwarded to voice mail.

356
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,395
You may not hear this,

357
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,231
but I'm still leaving you
a message, Father.

358
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,437
I realized while working as a prosecutor

359
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:50,308
that the evil in this world
doesn't see nor listen.

360
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,445
That's why it doesn't care
who it is it hurts.

361
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,881
No matter how much you scream
to keep it from coming back to you,

362
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,850
it won't listen.

363
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,020
That's why I want to tell you

364
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:07,592
that none of this is your fault.

365
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,895
These things just happen.

366
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,498
So,

367
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,668
don't be too hard on yourself.

368
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,870
All right?

369
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,188
Kim Hae-il?

370
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,960
It's been so long.

371
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,968
I'm sorry for coming unexpectedly
and asking you for a favor.

372
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,039
Please allow me an emergency kit, sir.

373
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,749
You know only employees are allowed access
to the emergency kit.

374
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,852
Please, sir.

375
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,860
Does it have anything to do
with the attack

376
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,129
on three of our agents at Wonil-dong
earlier today?

377
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,469
Yes, sir.

378
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,171
Take it.

379
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:04,442
Director Oh told me to give it to you
if you ever came by.

380
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,074
Lee Jung-gwon.

381
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,510
He's going to flee the country soon,

382
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,980
and he won't choose risky methods,
such as a stowaway.

383
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,983
The most natural and often-used method

384
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,418
is using a forged passport.

385
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,553
PASSPORT FORGERY WATCH LIST

386
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,424
However, he wouldn't have gone
to anyone on watch.

387
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,694
It's someone who's not on the list.

388
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:02,267
I'm sure girls will be all over
someone like you.

389
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,303
Why would you come to a matchmaker?

390
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,006
I don't need a wife.

391
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,043
Goodness.
You're handsome but rude as hell.

392
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,812
That makes it even better.

393
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,781
I heard you're the biggest
passport forgery broker?

394
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,917
What are you talking about?

395
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,052
Mr. Kim!

396
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,720
I'm sorry, but Mr. Kim

397
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,689
is taking a nap due to a broken back.

398
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:32,931
You're the police, aren't you?

399
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,006
Tell me all the places you know

400
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,775
other than the ones on the list.

401
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,476
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can.

402
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,912
It's my business secret.

403
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,617
I'm sorry to have to say this
when we only just met,

404
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,122
but don't you dare call something
"a secret" ever again.

405
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:06,364
Or else your death could also be
left a secret forever.

406
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,904
There were three other passport dealers

407
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,505
who weren't on the list.

408
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,265
LOAN COMPANY

409
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,919
SEX SHOP

410
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,788
PRIVATE DETECTIVE AGENCY

411
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,395
Who are you?

412
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,629
WE BUY USED CARS

413
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,301
How much time did Lee Jung-gwon give you
for the passports?

414
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,639
Five, four, three, two--

415
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,441
Tonight! It was until tonight.

416
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,877
Was it just him or are there three more?

417
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,545
There are three more, sir.

418
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,914
I'll send you the time and place.

419
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,583
Tell Lee Jung-gwon to go there. All right?

420
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,954
Three, two--

421
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,022
Yes, sir!

422
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,406
We can only hope for his will to live

423
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,375
and a miracle to help him.

424
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,584
DETECTIVE SEO
PLEASE CHECK THE VIDEO I SENT YOU

425
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,893
MT. YEONGYU ECOLOGY DEPARTMENT

426
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,912
You killed him,
so what truth is there to find out?

427
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,548
It wasn't me.

428
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,083
What?

429
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,385
I didn't kill him.

430
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,861
-Father checked the message!
-When?

431
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,764
I've been checking every 10 minutes,
so it must be less than that.

432
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,766
-Then hurry up and track him down.
-Yes, sir.

433
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,854
Sir, Mr. Jang has been arrested.

434
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,756
Why are you telling me this now?

435
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,392
-I thought you might be worried.
-That's not the problem!

436
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,028
We could be the ones to get framed!

437
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,230
It's the end of Jang Ryong.

438
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,832
You hurry up and go hide.

439
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,569
-Yes, sir.
-All we can do for now is to stay hidden.

440
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,272
-Then what will you--
-Forget about me and just go.

441
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,582
Damn it.

442
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,831
You could've given me a heads-up.

443
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,899
I'm going to kill you anyway, so what for?

444
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,000
Why?

445
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,837
Because you think I killed the priest?

446
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,606
I already told you. It wasn't me.

447
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,975
Even if you didn't kill Father Lee,

448
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,510
nothing will change.

449
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,847
You damaged Father Lee's body and honor,

450
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,383
and you killed Detective Gu's friend
and even threatened his family.

451
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,986
Those are reasons enough

452
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,522
to have you dead.

453
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,031
I guess you're right.

454
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:35,933
But...

455
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,736
Aren't we forgiven if we repent our sins?

456
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,338
"Forgiven"?

457
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,976
That's for mistakes made by humans.

458
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,577
Are you saying I'm not human?

459
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,779
And I don't just forgive anyone.

460
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,582
The world is already harmed enough
because of that.

461
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,318
You have such a great philosophy

462
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,520
for a fighter.

463
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,890
The reason I let you be until now

464
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,094
is because of the two priests
who asked me to wait and see.

465
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:08,499
But there's no reason for that anymore.

466
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,502
You're a priest.

467
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,172
Do you really have to make
things so rough?

468
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,140
If the world wasn't so rough
in the first place,

469
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,443
I wouldn't be, either.

470
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,146
Anyways. I get it,

471
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,918
but don't you want to know
how the priest died?

472
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,589
I'm not forcing you to believe me

473
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,558
or trying to get away.

474
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,428
But I don't want to take the blame,

475
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,430
so I'll tell you this.

476
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,500
You know that

477
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,203
I had to pressure the priest
because of the foundation, don't you?

478
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,405
But things got complicated.

479
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,108
I'm going to be the one
to convince the priest today.

480
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,643
What?

481
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,512
I don't think you can do it.

482
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,548
I'm sure you can't go rough on someone

483
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,784
who practically raised you,
no matter how messed up you are.

484
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,523
Sir, I'll be the one to finish it off.
Just give me one more--

485
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,024
Tell him to come over, immediately.

486
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,860
-But sir--
-Immediately!

487
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,078
You have to sign

488
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,679
the management waiver today.

489
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,047
MANAGEMENT WAIVER

490
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,849
I'll give you everything you want.

491
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,554
MANAGEMENT WAIVER

492
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,856
I can't do that, Cheol-beom.

493
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,124
Father.

494
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,526
You have to do it today.

495
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,630
I don't know what you're trying to do
with the orphanage,

496
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,698
but one thing's for sure.

497
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,402
It's going to be something
against the Lord's will.

498
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,772
I could do worse things to make you do it,

499
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,040
but I'm giving you a chance

500
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,743
since it's you, Father.

501
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,045
Why won't you understand?

502
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,614
I'm grateful for that.

503
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:08,319
But couldn't you give me a chance
some other way?

504
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,488
Father.

505
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,526
You took me in when I was young,
and I'm practically a son to you.

506
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,762
Please do me a favor.

507
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,399
And that's why I won't do it.

508
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,235
I don't want you to take the wrong path.

509
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,670
Father.

510
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,606
Mr. Hwang. Bring him in.

511
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,244
Is there someone else inside?

512
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,016
Take a seat, Father.

513
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:44,288
It's all right. I'll just stand here.

514
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:50,828
I'm sure Mr. Hwang has explained it
many times to you.

515
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,264
He has.

516
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,833
Then I guess
I won't have to explain further.

517
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,170
I guess you're the top management
around here?

518
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,505
This won't change anything, sir.

519
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,977
Then should we try something else?

520
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,487
You know them very well, don't you?

521
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,690
You seem to be quite close to them.

522
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,230
Yes.

523
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,200
What about them?

524
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,868
Let's say

525
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,839
the church was to burn down
and the clergy burnt to death.

526
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,808
Is that considered martyrdom?

527
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,278
How could...

528
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,648
The lives of your people
will depend on your decision.

529
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,883
What will you do?

530
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,054
How dare you, you evil man!

531
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,422
Goodness.

532
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,959
That's a bit rough for a priest.

533
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,167
You...

534
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,269
You're worse than Satan.

535
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,606
How could play around
with the dear lives of people?

536
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,276
I will never forgive you,
no matter what the Lord says!

537
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,744
Calm down, Father!

538
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,679
-Let go of him.
-You...

539
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,283
You crazy old fool.

540
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,152
How dare you...

541
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:39,770
Father.

542
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,239
Father?

543
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,576
Get up, Father.

544
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,386
Damn it.

545
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,389
Hun-seok.

546
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,090
Hun-seok!

547
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,059
Did you call...

548
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,196
What...

549
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,469
-Call the ambulance.
-Yes, sir.

550
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,738
Are you crazy?

551
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,908
"The ambulance"? What will you do then?

552
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,977
Are you trying to tell the whole world?

553
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,179
What is this...

554
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,481
Take care of it.

555
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,485
Take care of it, you bastards!
Just like you always do!

556
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,644
Damn it.

557
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,553
-Jang Ryong.
-Yes, sir?

558
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,356
Take someone who can keep a secret

559
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,858
and go along.

560
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,562
-Me, sir?
-Make sure to stay hidden.

561
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,543
-Go on.
-Yes, sir.

562
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,260
About what happened today.
Let's say you did it.

563
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,798
-What?
-Chances are low,

564
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,168
but if they find out,
I'll do my best to fix it.

565
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,836
But Chief Kang--

566
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,505
It may be hard to accept,

567
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,574
but you have to, anyway.

568
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,009
Do you know why?

569
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,078
Once the prosecution starts investigating,

570
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,280
who do you think will be joining them?

571
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,482
Me or you?

572
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:07,818
And that's not it.

573
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,688
I'm going to be throwing in
all those henchmen

574
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,324
you care so much about

575
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,326
and wipe out every one of them.

576
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,996
I'm going to make their families

577
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,799
starve to death as well.

578
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:29,840
Will you accept everything
and live a happy life,

579
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,677
or fight and see who will be
the last to survive?

580
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,362
I'll take that as an acceptance

581
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,364
and go.

582
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,447
Damn it!

583
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,653
That's it?

584
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,356
But you knew, didn't you?

585
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,027
You knew that Father Lee was alive
when you moved that body.

586
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,931
How could you be so calm?

587
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,301
The man who took you in
when you were a child

588
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,704
was dying right in front of you!

589
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,173
That's right. I felt nothing.

590
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,176
My men were more important to me.

591
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:43,347
He may be dead,
but I need to live on, don't I?

592
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,116
Daebeom Trading didn't build up
on its own, you know.

593
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,451
All right.

594
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,753
You're not even worth the fight.

595
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:08,472
I felt nothing at all,
that it even surprised me.

596
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,207
Why?

597
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,444
There are things that can be forgiven
and things that can't.

598
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:15,546
I only do things that can't be forgiven.

599
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,115
And that's how it will be forever.

600
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,919
So don't fucking act up to me.

601
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,954
If you don't want to take the blame,

602
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,256
go and turn yourself in.

603
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,391
And then what?

604
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:31,562
What if Chief Kang makes it look like
I'm the culprit?

605
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,797
Then I'll be the one to be screwed.

606
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,100
I won't be able to get out of it.

607
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,369
I'll take care of Chief Kang,
so go and turn yourself in.

608
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:40,671
No.

609
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,842
I'm going to get Lee Jung-gwon myself
and make him tell the truth.

610
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,311
He's the only witness

611
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,980
other than Chief Kang and me.

612
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,550
If you're not going to turn yourself in,
just die right now.

613
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,586
Father, do me a favor.

614
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,524
There's something I need to reveal
before I die,

615
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,460
so just give me until then.

616
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,533
Ryong.

617
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,902
Do we really have to go this far?

618
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,771
We're almost there.
Damn, he asks too much of us.

619
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,387
Ryong!

620
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:21,104
One, two, three!

621
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,015
I didn't kill him.

622
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,284
I only did what I was told to do.

623
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:35,986
I was told to throw his body away.

624
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,688
I...

625
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,258
I didn't kill him.

626
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:49,733
I'm sorry.

627
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:12,723
You're late, Father.

628
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,260
-Just leave.
-Come on.

629
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:18,595
I can't just leave.

630
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,365
I know what

631
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,066
you're going to do.

632
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:30,207
We promised to stick together
until the end, didn't we?

633
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:31,775
Then that's what we're doing.

634
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,510
We're done with that.

635
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,179
We still have Father Lee's case.

636
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,348
We're done with that, too, so leave.

637
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,985
We're not done until we cuff the culprit.

638
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,422
I'll take care of it.

639
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,225
Why are you trying to do this alone?

640
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,662
Do you think the world will change
if Lee Jung-gwon dies?

641
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,332
You returned everyone else
to better places.

642
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,868
Why are you trying to return
to a painful place?

643
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:05,475
I'm not trying to return.
It was always my place.

644
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:09,546
No, Father.

645
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,483
You belong at Gudam Cathedral,

646
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,786
with us.

647
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:21,024
If something goes wrong with you,

648
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,427
we're going to be deeply scarred for life.

649
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:30,701
I'm a nobody. Just forget about me.

650
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,137
Do you really not know
what you mean to us?

651
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:37,941
Without you,

652
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,444
we would've all gone to hell

653
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,680
and lived the same lives
all over and over.

654
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,015
It would have never ended!

655
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,919
How could you say you're a nobody?

656
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,659
No, Father. You're staying with me.

657
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,429
I won't let you go anywhere.

658
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:05,969
Just stay here.

659
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,539
No. You're not going.

660
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,953
Take good care of the nuns and priests.

661
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,195
Father.

662
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,470
You were someone
who only did the right things.

663
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:45,542
That's why I was happy to help you,

664
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,245
no matter how dangerous it was.

665
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,148
But why would you...

666
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,651
This has nothing to do
with right or wrong.

667
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,689
It's something I must take care of
on my own.

668
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,205
You may not hear this,

669
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,842
but I'm still leaving you
a message, Father.

670
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,847
I realized while working as a prosecutor

671
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:29,252
that the evil in this world
doesn't see nor listen.

672
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,190
That's why it doesn't care
who it is it hurts.

673
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,460
No matter how much you scream
to keep it from coming back to you,

674
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,161
it won't listen.

675
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,499
That's why I want to tell you

676
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,571
that none of this is your fault.

677
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,908
These things just happen.

678
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:53,777
So,

679
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,346
don't be too hard on yourself.

680
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:58,782
All right?

681
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,020
How can you change the location
at the last minute?

682
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,256
So it's the address you texted me?

683
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:07,958
Isn't that too far?

684
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,026
All right.

685
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,132
I have a bad feeling.

686
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,000
Did he change the location?

687
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:19,636
Hey.

688
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,472
Gather up a few fighters.

689
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,941
Officer Kim?

690
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,676
Come out.

691
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,879
Is everything all right?

692
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,351
Come out, Officer Kim.

693
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,947
Dae-yeong! I got a text from Father Kim.

694
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,082
Show me.

695
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,486
It will be over soon.

696
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,521
Come and wrap it up.

697
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:29,199
And please investigate the rest, old lady.

698
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,869
Please be the one to accomplish

699
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,038
the Lord's final justice.

700
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:53,683
You came.

701
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,601
Hey, I had to bring her here myself.

702
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,170
This was the best option we had,
if we were going to deal with you.

703
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,678
Did you bring the passport?

704
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,019
Here.

705
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,522
Your passport to hell.

706
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,225
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
PASSPORT

707
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,026
Take it if you can.

708
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,628
Did you bring yours too?

709
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,190
Even if these guys kill us,
we will never blame you, Father!

710
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:18,027
So please stay focused and fight it out!

711
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,662
I HEARD YOUR PRAYERS

712
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,364
Why do you have to withdraw
your priestship?

713
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,333
Let's keep working together
like we used to, Father.

714
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,535
You need to remain at the cathedral.

715
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,337
I tell you.

716
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,138
Thanks for coming, my friend.

717
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:32,175
Make sure to turn over a new leaf.

718
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,378
We're all in this together.

719
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,113
MY SINS

720
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,482
Good job.
You're so cool, Park Gyeong-seon.

721
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:40,917
I SHALL NOW HEAL YOU

722
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:41,918
Thank you.

723
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,553
Thank you for following the words

724
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:45,989
of the Lord.

725
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,893
