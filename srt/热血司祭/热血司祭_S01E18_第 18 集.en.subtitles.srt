1
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,020
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,321
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,822
Get rid of them.

4
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,758
Your life will be much easier without me.

5
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,192
No one will come after you.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,330
I'm offering to head inside,
so how's that not a good deal?

7
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,666
-Father!
-No, Father.

8
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:37,037
Be wise for once
and stop picking on children and women.

9
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,239
As a former NIS agent,

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,607
you should be ashamed of yourself.

11
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,547
Try being a man this time.

12
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,592
That dirty bastard.

13
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,728
Once an asshole, always an asshole.

14
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,830
Why did you have to provoke him?

15
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,933
Exactly.
We could've persuaded him, you know.

16
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,735
You make me speechless.

17
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,171
Just kill me already.

18
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,507
It's not as suffocating
as I thought it would be.

19
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,387
What the hell?

20
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,155
That revving sound...

21
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,592
Isn't that the device

22
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,160
that sucks all the oxygen out?

23
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,829
Wait, what's this?

24
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,198
It's a 50,000 won bill.

25
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,137
We now have...

26
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,806
only 15 minutes to live.

27
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,042
That's if there were only one of us here.

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,410
Two, four, six.

29
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,747
No way. That means we only have
a couple of minutes left.

30
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,356
Is there really no way out of this vault?

31
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,394
There is, but...

32
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,364
it'll only open once we're dead.

33
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,600
The oxygen level is just for show, right?

34
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,001
We won't die when it reaches zero.

35
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,670
I'm done talking to you, Ms. Park.

36
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,808
Hold on.
Are you sulking because I fooled you?

37
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,612
You are, aren't you?

38
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,449
Are we all going to die?

39
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,851
You stink, so don't talk.

40
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,219
Don't move either.

41
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,089
Right...

42
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,290
Damn it.

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,958
I shouldn't have come in here.

44
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,637
Here comes the truck.

45
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,440
GUDAM EXPRESS

46
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,190
What the hell?

47
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,357
Shit.

48
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,196
Hold on.

49
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,131
Isn't that him?

50
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,633
-The one who knocked us flat.
-He is.

51
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,368
Captain, what do we do?

52
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,003
Put the gear in reverse!

53
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,071
Hurry!

54
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,220
It's more suffocating

55
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,188
than I thought it'd be.

56
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:46,159
What if we're really going to die?

57
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,394
Stop talking, everyone.

58
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,796
Preserve the oxygen.

59
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,433
If this will be our last,

60
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,301
let's at least pray.

61
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,270
This isn't the time for that.

62
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,038
Jesus.

63
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,107
Is there a better time for praying then?

64
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,510
Boss, let's pray.

65
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,813
It's obvious

66
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,048
that we'll meet in Hell.

67
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,617
Shut up, will you?

68
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,653
Stop talking.
You're using up all the oxygen.

69
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,123
-I...
-What's wrong?

70
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,726
Old lady?

71
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,462
Wake up. Old lady, stay with me.

72
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,730
It hurts.

73
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,398
It hurts...

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,435
Am I all right?

75
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,337
Am I?

76
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,476
A savior.

77
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,846
We need a savior!

78
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,981
No one can help us.

79
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,951
It's impossible to get it open right now.

80
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,756
I feel funny.

81
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,925
I can't keep my eyes open.

82
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,764
I feel funny too.

83
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,768
I...

84
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,039
-You bastard!
-Shit!

85
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,575
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,546
I know this is no time for jokes.

87
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,421
You...

88
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,323
Die.

89
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,760
Just die, you fuck.

90
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,064
What the hell?

91
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,567
I must be in Hell.
A Hell that has no exit.

92
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,336
I feel funny too.

93
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,771
I don't feel like I'll die.

94
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,675
Me too.

95
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:48,281
For some reason,
I'm getting happy thoughts.

96
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,885
The lack of oxygen
is making you hallucinate.

97
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,688
We're all dying right now.

98
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,329
My Lord,

99
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,466
your children

100
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,569
are on the verge of death.

101
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,571
Those good...

102
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,208
and even those evil

103
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,311
are all your children
when death is imminent.

104
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,315
Please help us escape this catastrophe--

105
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,651
My goodness.

106
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,755
I'm now having a hallucination
about an earthquake too.

107
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:33,659
Please take pity on the sins
we've committed...

108
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,333
A subway must have just passed.

109
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,208
Please hear our desperate cries.

110
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:02,188
Please save us from death, My Lord!

111
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,178
Fresh air?

112
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,131
Vladimir Gojayev!

113
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,635
Gojayev?

114
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,360
That's it.

115
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,799
Where's Gojayev?

116
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,134
You prick.

117
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,670
How dare you lie
about not reaching the vault?

118
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,473
That's not the issue right now.

119
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,809
You were going to take
all the money yourself, right?

120
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,477
Hey there, pseudo prophet.

121
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,848
What's up, pseudo prophet?

122
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,718
I'm enlightened!

123
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,687
Your jacket looks ridiculous.

124
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,158
-What the hell?
-Fuck.

125
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,795
You bastard.

126
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,099
Mr. Hwang, why are you coming from there?

127
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,067
You tried to rob the vault yourselves?

128
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,904
Of course not. It was his idea.

129
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,073
You're the one who roped me into this.

130
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,408
Shut up.

131
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,012
Be back at your posts by tomorrow.

132
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,881
If you run away, you'll really die.

133
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,019
Enough!

134
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,960
You can't just leave.

135
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,562
-Why not?
-There...

136
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,933
There's one more in there, but the poop...

137
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,368
-What about the poop?
-Poop...

138
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,304
What are you talking about?

139
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,575
-Look, he's coming!
-What?

140
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,278
The massive poop is on its way out.

141
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,980
No!

142
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,650
Pooper!

143
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,187
Shit. What the fuck?

144
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,203
Unbelievable.

145
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,141
-Damn it.
-Gosh.

146
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,444
-Darn it.
-What the hell?

147
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,246
-Why are you here?
-Where are they coming from?

148
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,853
They knew we'd follow them.

149
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,921
We were forced to back off.

150
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,056
Then you don't even know where they went?

151
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,159
-I'm sorry.
-Jeez.

152
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,897
I see you created a whole operation
around a vault that's not even yours.

153
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,799
How can you laugh when you've been robbed?

154
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,835
Should I weep on the floor instead?

155
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,269
Damn it.

156
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,072
-Ms. Park.
-What?

157
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,574
From what my men say,

158
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,976
Mr. Kang was betrayed too.

159
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:45,945
What?

160
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,381
Lee Jung-gwon laid him out flat

161
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,117
and ran off with all the money.
The 150 billion won.

162
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,318
No way.

163
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,321
So he ends up being the final winner?

164
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,124
I see he utilized
his full capacity this time.

165
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,426
Lee Jung-gwon, that fucker.

166
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:11,170
GUDAM EXPRESS

167
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,251
Take care of them.

168
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,459
Is it nice to have all of it to yourself?

169
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,295
Yes, I'm ecstatic.

170
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,197
How long do you think
it'll stay in your possession?

171
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,800
It's in my hands now, so forever.

172
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,036
It won't be easy to manage
150 billion won in Korea.

173
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,939
I guess you can spend
two million won monthly for 6,250 years.

174
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,577
That's none of your damn business.

175
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,713
Well,

176
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,248
I'm coming for that money.

177
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,457
How did they get out?

178
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:14,800
Damn it.

179
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,002
Is there still no signal on the tracker?

180
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,537
UNAVAILABLE TO TRACK

181
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,805
I'm afraid we have nothing.

182
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,441
They must have a signal scrambler.

183
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,445
Lee Jung-gwon, you fucker. You're dead.

184
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,181
Boss.

185
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,351
I apologize...

186
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,321
for the disgusting display.

187
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,190
Is there anything you can do right?

188
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,459
You get beaten up all the time

189
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,695
and poop your pants on important days.

190
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,766
How can you be so completely useless?

191
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,435
Just get out of my face.

192
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,936
I'm sorry, Boss.

193
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,606
Get lost.

194
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:57,810
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,549
Shit, the humiliation.

196
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,987
If he

197
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,290
hadn't saved my life back then...

198
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,592
Damn it.

199
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,166
Hold on a second.

200
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,871
What do you mean,
we're giving Gudam-gu up?

201
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,942
There's nothing left we can do there, sir.

202
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,812
Especially because of Rising Moon...

203
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,315
How am I supposed to explain this
to my superiors?

204
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,387
I told them not to worry about the funding

205
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,055
for the next election.

206
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,558
I apologize.

207
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,361
Also, Chief Nam and Director Jeong
seem suspicious at the moment.

208
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,997
We must deal with them in some way.

209
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,365
I heard about that.

210
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,136
Chief Nam, that prick,
called a press conference

211
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,470
so that he could spill the beans.

212
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,639
I've blocked that for now, sir.

213
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,276
But we'll still need to shut him up.

214
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,979
NO PARKING

215
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,247
Let go of me!

216
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,782
-No!
-I'll have him transferred

217
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,317
-Let me go!
-to a mental institution

218
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,952
and shut him up for good.

219
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,589
He can yell and scream all he wants,

220
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,557
but no one will believe him.

221
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,259
I know him.

222
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,967
Meanwhile, Ms. Jeong
has a son she cherishes.

223
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,837
Blackmailing her using him
will prevent any further issues.

224
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,550
All right, here you go.

225
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,986
Take one.

226
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,688
Ms. Park, that's a pretty blouse.

227
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,091
Is that so? I'll buy you one sometime.

228
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,859
I'm fine.

229
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,795
It's only pretty because you have it on.

230
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,265
It'll look even prettier on you.

231
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,533
-Damn it.
-Are you kidding me?

232
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,471
He must still be with the truck.

233
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,705
The signal's still jammed.

234
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,074
When did you put a tracker on him though?

235
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,111
A while ago.

236
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,674
You're the best, Father.

237
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,645
About that vault though.

238
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,848
Aren't the walls and floor made of steel?

239
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,917
How did Gojayev get through it?

240
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,452
I immediately figured it out.

241
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,121
-How so?
-Hwang Cheol-beom told me

242
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,490
that Lee Jung-gwon
introduced them to the vault-maker.

243
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,327
Unbelievable.

244
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,661
What does that mean?

245
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,496
Think of it as a mishap in delivery.

246
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,999
They must've skimmed
some of the money in the middle.

247
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,702
It looks like a vault,
but no steel slates were added.

248
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,872
He was once reprimanded
for equipment purchases.

249
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,709
He's a consistent prick, isn't he?

250
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,044
Thanks to him, we made it out alive.

251
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,145
Jeez.

252
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,780
Unbelievable.

253
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,384
Must we wait here until we get a signal

254
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,586
from that tracker you planted?

255
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,722
We can't sit around and do nothing though.

256
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,590
Let's find it before he disappears.

257
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,264
Yes, Sister.

258
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,801
What?

259
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,737
Who's there?

260
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,149
It was made from a Japanese master
by the name of Yamaguchi Toshio.

261
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,051
The set is worth 80 million won.

262
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,589
Sister, wait.

263
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,158
Where did you get this?

264
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,561
This? Father Kim bought it.

265
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,734
I see that Father Kim has good taste.

266
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,936
I hope you don't break it

267
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,773
and make good use of it.

268
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,442
That's something
I don't need your advice about.

269
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,351
How dare you come here?

270
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,056
Leave.

271
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,827
This isn't how you treat guests.

272
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,695
You're no guest.

273
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:44,930
Get out.

274
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,298
Father, please.

275
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,400
You know what Father Lee said.

276
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,404
Sinners or saints,
we're supposed to welcome them all.

277
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,377
We'll leave the room

278
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,913
and let you two talk.

279
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,682
Thank you, Sister.

280
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,088
Have a seat.

281
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,395
Say what you came here to say and leave.

282
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,334
Let's go after Lee Jung-gwon together.

283
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,838
What?

284
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,478
I can't ask the police for help.

285
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,446
But then again,

286
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,217
there's no one as good as you right now
that's working with the police.

287
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,255
Why would I help you catch Lee Jung-gwon?

288
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,958
We have a common goal. Getting the money

289
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,360
and ending Lee Jung-gwon.

290
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,430
So? We should find the money and split it?

291
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,132
It's not just about the money.

292
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,169
Lee Jung-gwon has hired
mercenaries to help him.

293
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,438
It'll be best to have one by my side too.

294
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,807
I can manage on my own.

295
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,910
If you help me,

296
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,080
you'll be able to find out the truth

297
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,515
regarding Father Lee's death.

298
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,918
You bastard.

299
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,420
Cut the bullshit.

300
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,757
You killed him,
so what truth is there to find out?

301
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,326
It wasn't me.

302
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,563
What?

303
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,765
I didn't kill him.

304
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,136
Continue this bullshit
and I'll kill you myself.

305
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,772
It's not bullshit.

306
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,942
There's something you must know.

307
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,579
If you kill me,
you'll be losing a key witness.

308
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,148
The murder of Father Lee Yeong-jun.

309
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,217
Father Lee.

310
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,253
What on earth happened that day?

311
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,923
So join hands with me.

312
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,293
If everything goes well,

313
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,529
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

314
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,635
So what will you do?

315
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,241
No!

316
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,776
No way.

317
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,712
You know what kind of a douchebag he is.

318
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,981
I bet he's lying about Father Lee

319
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,350
just so that you'd help him.

320
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,886
Of course. That evil prick.

321
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,723
Father Han, what do you think?

322
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,359
I'd like some time to think it through.

323
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,127
There's no need for that.

324
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,629
We can do this ourselves.

325
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,831
He's right.

326
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,033
Once the money is taken from the truck,

327
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,602
we'll pick up on the signal.

328
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,104
All we have to do is catch him.

329
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,509
I know that.

330
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,663
Is there anything you can do right?

331
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,165
You get beaten up all the time

332
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,934
and poop your pants on important days.

333
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,437
How can you be so completely useless?

334
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,508
Peter Piper picked a peck...

335
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,881
Peter Piper...

336
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,150
Peter Piper picked...

337
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,320
Save it.

338
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,688
There's no need for that today.

339
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,404
Did something upsetting happen?

340
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,306
No.

341
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,374
It looks like you cried.

342
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,143
I didn't. Don't say that.

343
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,012
Sad things happen to you

344
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,981
because you're a bad man.

345
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,083
Damn it.

346
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,920
Just because you knocked me out

347
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,489
doesn't mean you can treat me like shit.

348
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,057
Because you're bad,

349
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,594
sad things happen to you
and you don't have friends.

350
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,664
It's why you have
to drink alone like this.

351
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,907
I just want to drink alone today,
that's all.

352
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,744
If you keep being a bad man,

353
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,613
you'll be alone forever.

354
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,082
You'll be bad and alone.

355
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,017
That's enough.

356
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:07,886
I already know that.

357
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,296
Why do I keep smelling poop though?

358
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,713
You nutjob.

359
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,249
You filthy bastard.

360
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,988
Sir, he pooped his pants!

361
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,858
They weren't cheap but...

362
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,794
I'll have to discard them.

363
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,502
What can we do
when that's what you want, Father?

364
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,806
That's cool of you.

365
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,875
You're respecting his wishes. Nice.

366
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,010
Thanks.

367
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,915
Still, if Hwang Cheol-beom
does anything stupid,

368
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,316
I'll make my move too.

369
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,518
Sure, you can do whatever you please.

370
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:17,022
Go after him with both fists and feet.

371
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,797
Yes, Father.

372
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,835
Got it.

373
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,776
Let me see. Then...

374
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,777
Don't get cocky, Hwang.

375
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,846
The wind's cramping your style anyway.

376
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,982
What information do you have?

377
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,719
My boys are gathering information
as we speak.

378
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,122
Then we'll move separately for now.

379
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,757
Contact us when you have something.

380
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,760
Don't even think about
going after him by yourself.

381
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,996
The same goes for you too.

382
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,966
Detective Gu, you've cleaned up nicely.

383
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,435
How I look is really
none of your business.

384
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,971
Being a tough guy, are you?

385
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,774
I see you've now turned into a tiger.

386
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,282
Is it obvious that
I took a bath this morning?

387
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,818
Your face is practically glowing.

388
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,497
You won't even greet me now?

389
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,266
Don't you think we're past that stage?

390
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:13,104
I can't believe
I trusted the likes of you.

391
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,239
Damn.

392
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,642
Yesterday, you pulled

393
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,644
all that crap just to get the money,

394
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,646
but here you are today

395
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,882
acting high and mighty
at the Prosecutors' Office.

396
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,651
I guess that's very Korean of you.

397
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,288
I'll make sure you never step foot
in this hallway again.

398
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,992
Why don't we bet on
who'll be removed from it first?

399
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,262
You.

400
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,299
If I'm out, you'll be thrown out too.

401
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,001
I'm not afraid of that.

402
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,502
Nor am I scared of being punished.

403
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:48,373
Since when did you become
such a righteous prosecutor?

404
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,941
Go ahead then.

405
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,844
Things won't change though.
They never will.

406
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,982
There's something I must do
before we both are removed from office.

407
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,353
You and the others, as well as I...

408
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,757
have to uncover and take responsibility
for the truth behind Father Lee's death.

409
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,629
That's where this race will end...

410
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,597
even though

411
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,633
the office still stays rotten.

412
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,337
PROSECUTOR PARK GYEONG-SEON

413
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,646
Really?

414
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,882
That's faster than I expected.

415
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,718
The night flight?

416
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,621
Okay, I'll inform the detective in charge.

417
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,893
Everything's going as planned.
Once they're on board,

418
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,162
we'll be able to regain
Father Lee's honor.

419
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,364
So when will they be here?

420
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,700
Tonight?

421
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,771
Yes, I'll be ready.

422
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,372
Sure.

423
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,378
What? No attorneys?

424
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,080
Actually, it's Director Jeong herself

425
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,815
who dismissed them all.

426
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,351
Why?

427
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,888
Is she volunteering
to take the fall for everything?

428
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,690
It seems like it.

429
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,393
Director Jeong isn't the type though.

430
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,395
We all know

431
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,198
that Chief Nam and Director Jeong
are the scapegoats

432
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,200
of this Rising Moon scandal.

433
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,469
Just think about how

434
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,272
Chief Nam was dragged off
to a mental institution.

435
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:30,075
The higher-ups must've taken action.

436
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,878
They put a scenario in motion?

437
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,615
Wait, does Director Jeong have kids?

438
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,351
She has a son who's a freshman in college.

439
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,988
Then he must be the apple of her eye.

440
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,926
Do you know the dirtiest way
to blackmail a person?

441
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,929
Yes, by threatening
family members and close friends.

442
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,197
Exactly.

443
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,432
Mr. Park.

444
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,135
Yes?

445
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,771
Go, golden arms!

446
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,780
NO SIGNAL

447
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,116
In order to receive the signal,

448
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,051
we must be in a ten-kilometer radius.

449
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:14,753
Right?

450
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,455
He'll be hard to track if he leaves Seoul.

451
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,758
Damn it.

452
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,926
Yes, Detective Seo?

453
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,695
I've been tracking the truck

454
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,131
and it was last seen
going toward Yangju, Gyeonggi Province.

455
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,533
I'm still tracking its exact whereabouts.

456
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:29,901
Good, Detective Seo.

457
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,170
We'll head to Yangju too. Thank you.

458
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,671
Got it. Sure thing.

459
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,242
HWANG CHEOL-BEOM

460
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,310
He went toward Yangju, Gyeonggi Province.

461
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,113
I just heard that from my men too.

462
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,414
Then why didn't you tell us?

463
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:47,352
I was about to when you called first.

464
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,753
Stop doubting me.

465
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,089
Okay, fine.

466
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,257
HWANG CHEOL-BEOM

467
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,793
Must we tell him everything though?

468
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,728
If we don't, we're as good as thugs.

469
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,598
You can be quite generous at times.

470
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,434
"I am generous."

471
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,738
Must you do this all the time?

472
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,375
"I am generous. Sparta!"

473
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,442
Damn it.

474
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:21,386
CONSIDERATION IS A VIRTUE
BUT FIGHTING LEADS TO REGRET

475
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,057
Greetings.

476
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,893
I'm Attorney Han Pan-seung
of By All Means Law Firm.

477
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,662
HAN PAN-SEUNG

478
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,334
No matter how much
you kick me to the curb,

479
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:39,904
you're still my friend.

480
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,973
Let me take care of you now.

481
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,044
Did Mr. Hwang send you?

482
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,983
Yes, tell her that it was him.

483
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,251
Yes,

484
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,753
Mr. Hwang sent me.

485
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,056
Good. Isn't Father Han a great actor?

486
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,826
You seem to be quite young.

487
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,896
Well, I do look young for my age.

488
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:07,966
Whatever.

489
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,236
I don't wish to talk
about anything right now.

490
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,570
No, Ms. Jeong.

491
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:15,506
I can't help you
until I know the full picture.

492
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:19,477
Only I can help my situation right now.

493
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,645
Ms. Jeong,

494
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,481
your silence won't help you.

495
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,682
Mr. Han,

496
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,621
my silence is my best defense
at the moment.

497
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,291
Is it because of your son?

498
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:36,961
No.

499
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,063
You're worried about
your son's safety, aren't you?

500
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,632
I told you that isn't it.

501
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,435
I have nothing to say to you, so leave.

502
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,942
Ms. Jeong.

503
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,481
My mother served a life sentence too.

504
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,389
I had a mom who went out every single day.

505
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,992
But then one year,

506
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,030
she never came back home.

507
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,502
My aunt asked around
and found out she was in prison.

508
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,245
I was only eight at the time.

509
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,916
Gosh, he was only eight!

510
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,652
So?

511
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,624
Sorry?

512
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:41,960
So?

513
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,661
My mother served a life sentence
in prison--

514
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,663
-And?
-She served a life sentence.

515
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,033
What does that have to do with anything?

516
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:54,539
That sob story didn't work with her?

517
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,775
Should we have gone
for the death penalty instead?

518
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,613
Father,

519
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,718
I'm afraid we'll have to
stick to facts from now on.

520
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,793
Hey, we have a signal.

521
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,628
What? Where are they?

522
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,697
They're about seven kilometers from here.

523
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,933
Those idiots.
You're in the palm of our hands.

524
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,434
Father, hold on tight.

525
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,005
-Booster!
-Gosh!

526
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,676
Well, if you don't have
anything more to say,

527
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,478
I'll go back to my cell.

528
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,481
Anything. Just tell her anything.

529
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,550
Dig deep into her instincts.
You're an actor, aren't you?

530
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,086
Ms. Jeong.

531
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,788
What now?

532
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,557
Is that it?

533
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,426
What?

534
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,365
Do you want your only son
to remember you as an embarrassment?

535
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,704
Wait, he's going too far.

536
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,576
How dare you get cheeky with me?

537
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,311
I'm talking about your son.

538
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,216
Do you really think
that your son doesn't know

539
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,452
what kind of a person you've been?

540
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,655
He knows. He probably knows everything.

541
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,558
However, he'll be saying to others

542
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,561
that his mother is innocent
and that she's a good person...

543
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,131
because you're his mother.

544
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,600
If you confess to your crimes

545
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,803
and admit to the wrongdoings
that you have done,

546
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:36,140
your son won't have
to make excuses for you.

547
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,241
Don't you agree?

548
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,547
Ms. Jeong,

549
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,450
instead of becoming an embarrassment
to your son,

550
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,653
you can set him free.

551
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,064
Mr. Han.

552
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,133
Can you really

553
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,037
make sure that my son stays safe?

554
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,407
Yes.

555
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,176
I currently work with
the best man for the job.

556
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,012
Will you protect my testimony

557
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:20,151
and have a trustworthy prosecutor
take over my case?

558
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,655
Yes, of course I can.

559
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:43,608
Father, you were amazing!

560
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,513
Was that enough though?

561
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,381
Enough?

562
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,550
Father, you just heard something

563
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,819
that could shake up this entire nation.

564
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,587
I'm glad then.

565
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,757
How are all the sisters and priests

566
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,460
at Gudam Cathedral this talented?
Unbelievable.

567
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,429
Wait. We should secure
Ms. Jeong's son first.

568
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,532
-Let's go.
-Right, got it.

569
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,360
GUDAM EXPRESS

570
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,900
Did you think we wouldn't find you?

571
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,737
Get out.

572
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,339
What the hell?

573
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,274
You...

574
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,180
-They're dead.
-Dead?

575
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,883
Talk about one discouraging start.

576
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,752
Lee Jung-gwon, you son of a bitch.

577
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,090
I see he found it.

578
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,328
I planted the tracker last week,
so it got caught.

579
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,166
How can he kill people so easily?

580
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,434
Son of a bitch.

581
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:20,238
He's a piece of trash, isn't he?
Killing people in cold blood?

582
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,675
Anyway, I'm off.

583
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,179
You have no right to talk.

584
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,983
It seems like he only found
Hwang's tracker.

585
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,051
The signal caught two trackers,

586
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,820
but he only thought there was one.

587
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,154
That's a relief then.

588
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,259
Let's call this in
and retrieve the bodies first.

589
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,066
What? She talked to an attorney?

590
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:53,404
Yes, a guard reported what he had heard.

591
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,905
Who's the attorney?

592
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,440
He's Han Pan-seung

593
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,075
from By All Means Law Firm,

594
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,978
but he and the law firm don't exist.

595
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,081
Damn it.

596
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,224
What are you talking about?

597
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,659
What do you mean I sent a lawyer?

598
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:15,993
There's no need to play dumb.

599
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,729
I put my trust in you
and told him everything.

600
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,398
-What--
-Cheol-beom.

601
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,334
Let's receive our punishments
and take responsibility.

602
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,403
Keeping our silence

603
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,772
won't stop those higher-ups
from coming after us.

604
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,474
What the hell are you talking about?

605
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,080
Is Director Jeong's testimony any good?

606
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,515
She babbled about everything.

607
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,483
The Gudam cartel,

608
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,253
Maegakkyo, and even the higher-ups.

609
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,756
Father Han scores once again.

610
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,892
What about Father Lee?

611
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,861
Ms. Jeong thinks
that Hwang Cheol-beom killed him

612
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,730
and then disposed of the body.

613
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,398
Wasn't there anything more tangible?

614
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,801
How about how he did it all?

615
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,070
It's obvious that she doesn't know much.

616
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,572
She only believes
that Hwang Cheol-beom killed him.

617
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,342
From what I can tell though,

618
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,278
there's something going on
that we're missing.

619
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:09,980
So how are things on your side?

620
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,916
We've hit a dead end too.

621
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,019
What happens if they go somewhere far

622
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,188
with all that money?

623
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,023
Then we'll lose the 150 billion won--

624
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,859
No way! Don't you dare lose them.

625
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:23,994
Jeez.

626
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,664
One might think the money's yours.

627
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,533
Let's get all the bad guys first.

628
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,036
Also, don't forget
the warrant for Lee Jung-gwon's arrest.

629
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,071
Okay, you can trust me.

630
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,506
Bring it on!

631
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,175
Kang Seok-tae!

632
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,177
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KANG SEOK-TAE

633
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,813
I'm here with a warrant
so where the hell is he?

634
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,915
I don't know where he went.

635
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,084
He just said he'd be going home early.

636
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,054
He made a run for it.

637
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,391
He was so cocky only this morning.

638
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,893
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

639
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,895
Get me a fresh order

640
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,930
that bans him from leaving the country.

641
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,132
Yes, ma'am.

642
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,103
Ki Yong-mun.

643
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,706
You're under arrest for fraud,

644
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,674
assault, blackmailing, tax evasion,

645
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,042
sexual harassment, and others.

646
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,210
ARREST WARRANT

647
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,782
Those who need to be enlightened

648
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,984
must've created havoc again.

649
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,219
How dare you arrest Prophet Ki?

650
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,487
Leave right this second!

651
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,889
An Dul-ja,

652
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,426
you're also under arrest for fraud.

653
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,331
Is An Dul-ja your real name?

654
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:36,734
Yes.

655
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:44,775
My enlightened devotees
will not let this slide.

656
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,545
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

657
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:01,959
Thank you, Jung-gwon.

658
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,864
Are we heading out tomorrow morning?

659
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:07,965
Yes.

660
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,137
Let's go then.

661
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,780
What dirty trick did you pull?

662
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,816
What's wrong?
We're giving you a chance to repent.

663
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,519
Stabbing me in the back
is against our agreement.

664
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,921
Don't you want to know
about Father Lee's death?

665
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,557
We'll find out ourselves,
so stay out of it.

666
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,394
I wanted us to work together,
but you're making it difficult.

667
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,098
Anyway, there's a warrant out
for your arrest,

668
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,267
so either run for it or turn yourself in.

669
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:47,071
I will repay you
for what you did this time.

670
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,343
Fuck!

671
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,844
Damn it.

672
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,215
I really wanted
to cuff him myself, you know.

673
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,287
-Wait, I'm getting a signal!
-Where?

674
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,355
GYOHA-DONG

675
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,592
SUSPECT TRANSFER CONSENT FORM

676
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,532
Good job, everyone.

677
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:19,169
Goodness, it's been a while.

678
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,674
He held my hands,
saying he'd like to pray with me.

679
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,210
And while I was praying,
he suddenly touched my thigh.

680
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,448
Is it true that Father Lee embezzled
the church funds?

681
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,484
Yes, it is true.

682
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,685
Where on earth are we?

683
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,455
This isn't what you promised!

684
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,992
Detective Seo...

685
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,127
What?

686
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,664
What the hell? What is it?

687
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:51,869
What's this smell?

688
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,314
What's that?

689
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:40,978
Hold on a second.

690
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,027
Was it easy to find the place?

691
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,763
Cell phone GPS systems are incredible.

692
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,700
It's a return match.

693
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,736
The last time,

694
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,572
I was caught off guard.

695
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:19,983
Fight!

696
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,098
Hae-il, you'll regret this!

697
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,838
I'm sick and tired of you saying that.

698
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,007
Just go back to sleep, you prick.

699
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,953
I already called the cops.

700
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,756
All we need to do is take the money.

701
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:34,758
Songsak!

702
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:46,036
They sold me to a restaurant

703
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,274
and I was forced to clean king crabs
without getting paid.

704
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,610
I got caught trying to eat some of it

705
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,679
and was beaten to a pulp.

706
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:58,615
I was sold off to a bear breeding farm.

707
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,450
I had to feed them every day,

708
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:05,022
but they'd try to eat me
instead of their feed.

709
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:06,824
I hate bears, you know.

710
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,492
I even hate Winnie the Pooh.

711
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,594
I will never eat gomtang ever again.

712
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,996
Serves you right for committing perjury.

713
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,137
Tell us the truth then.

714
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:24,241
Did Father Lee sexually assault you
and take money from the collection box?

715
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,346
No.

716
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:30,447
He didn't.

717
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,150
We're good then.

718
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,454
Don't ever sell

719
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,122
your souls like that again.

720
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:40,557
We won't.

721
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:44,394
I'll buy, so order them
some sweet and sour pork too.

722
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,562
Sure.

723
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,231
Sweet and sour pork?

724
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,869
Did you secure the money?

725
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,704
Moving it all was exhausting.

726
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,873
Talk about it being an eventful day.

727
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,041
Can you believe
it all happened in one day?

728
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,944
Yes, I honestly had trouble keeping up.

729
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,447
We need to get
Kang Seok-tae and Hwang Cheol-beom first.

730
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,415
They're the key figures in this matter.

731
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,153
We also need definitive evidence
to uncover the truth about Father Lee.

732
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,857
I'm glad we at least have some witnesses.

733
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,495
I heard from Detective Seo.

734
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,231
Her captain will take responsibility
and resign

735
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:22,733
once we wrap up this case.

736
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,904
I heard that too.

737
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,939
Captain Lee doesn't know,

738
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,674
but the others except for Detective Seo

739
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,376
will also resign

740
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,011
to show their loyalty.

741
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,414
Why couldn't they have
been loyal from the beginning?

742
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:38,548
It took them long enough.

743
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:43,987
Right.

744
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,089
Me too.

745
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,159
The same goes for me too!

746
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,232
Once we wrap this up,

747
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,468
I'm going to quit the office too.

748
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,304
Really?

749
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,940
You know I like things to be clean.

750
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,643
It seems right and righteous too.

751
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,415
Yes, that is how it should be.

752
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,586
I'm going to start a new chapter
with a clean slate.

753
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,856
Maybe I should be a private detective.
I think it's the right job for me.

754
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,093
Is there nothing else?

755
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,362
Something else? Well,

756
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,497
I guess I have about 100 options,

757
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,667
but most will cramp my style.

758
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,905
Also, I told you once before

759
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,874
that I think my past ruined my future.

760
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,644
It's why I'm going to make sure

761
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,647
that my future doesn't ruin
my life in the long run.

762
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,187
Anyway, good job, Father.

763
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,823
-You did well.
-You too.

764
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:07,004
Gosh, I can't believe we have to work
on the weekend.

765
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,941
There are piles of paperwork to finish.

766
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,577
Really?

767
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,681
You know how slow my typing is.

768
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:18,949
I'm sorry I can't be of help.

769
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,089
"Albino" is the term used to describe

770
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:29,192
the absence of any pigmentation
or coloration in hair.

771
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,961
In Mt. Yeongyu of Gudam-gu,

772
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,897
the rare species of albino sable
was spotted.

773
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:38,568
An albino sable
completely covered in white hair

774
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,404
runs around the woods.

775
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,240
A white albino sable running around

776
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,942
with two normal-colored brown sables

777
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,612
was spotted on the CCTV camera
in the woods.

778
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,214
The security cameras have been taken down.

779
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,383
Don't tell me this is a burial ground too.

780
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,853
Wait, I just saw a white sable.

781
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,426
What seems mysterious and beautiful...

782
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,593
What's wrong?

783
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,595
What if there was

784
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,865
a CCTV camera with an autonomous sensor?

785
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,233
What?

786
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,105
Where are you going?

787
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,373
Wait for me!

788
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,508
Four suspects wanted for murder

789
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,043
that were arrested earlier today

790
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,546
ran off after assaulting the police.

791
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,081
Lee and the other three

792
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,683
are prime suspects of a brutal murder

793
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,453
and they were able
to break free in transit.

794
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,088
Here is Reporter Kim with the news.

795
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,457
Yes, we set the camera there.

796
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:34,658
ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT

797
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,394
Don't you need
Daebeom Development's approval?

798
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,430
Just so you know,
we didn't ask for approval first.

799
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,566
Was Daebeom Development against the idea?

800
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,634
Yes, but

801
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,771
after knowing that albino sables
lived in those woods,

802
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,739
we had to take action.

803
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,608
We put our jobs on the line
to set up the cameras.

804
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,411
Jeez.

805
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:58,048
Could we possibly look at the footage
from the past two months?

806
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:01,017
We're hoping to find
evidence of a murder case.

807
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,152
Sure.

808
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:05,655
-We save up to a year's worth of footage.
-Great!

809
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,825
Then we ask for your cooperation.

810
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,894
-Please, sir.
-Hold on a second.

811
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,230
I mean...

812
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,198
Such saints must work here!

813
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,566
Unbelievable.

814
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,878
Why is there dust and dirt everywhere?

815
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,181
Once you're done,

816
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,284
please wipe the kimchi fridge too.

817
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,221
You sat on it so much
that it's gotten dirty.

818
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,391
I didn't sit on it a lot
for it to have gotten dirty.

819
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,360
You're always sitting on it.

820
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:44,828
Because of you

821
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,531
the freshly made kimchi
has already fermented.

822
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:48,999
We could already make a stew with it.

823
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,500
No way.

824
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,702
How could I speed up
the fermenting process by sitting on it?

825
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,572
I can't believe
you'd accuse me of such a thing.

826
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,741
Father, Sister,

827
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,410
how about we go out somewhere?

828
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,345
I'll treat you all to something nice.

829
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,350
Goodness. If only you had offered sooner.

830
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:11,154
I'm scheduled to play Go-Stop
with the old ladies.

831
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,289
Darn.

832
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,225
I'm afraid it'll just to you two.

833
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,561
Where should we go? What should we eat?

834
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,963
-What should we have?
-Let's watch a movie

835
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,731
and enjoy some fresh air.

836
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,335
-Let's finish this up fast.
-Sure.

837
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,081
It's the best pork belly I've ever had.

838
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,950
-Let me give you one.
-What?

839
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,254
There you go.

840
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:48,124
It's weird for two men
to take an instant photo together.

841
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,327
Many men do it
to commemorate their friendship.

842
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,063
But this is embarrassing.

843
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:54,831
Wait, this is totally my style.

844
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,648
Shouldn't we inform Father Kim though?

845
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,517
We will, once we find something concrete.

846
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,487
Stop right there.

847
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,890
Press play.

848
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,959
MT. YEONGYU ECOLOGY DEPARTMENT

849
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,527
Over there.

850
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,296
It looks like a person.

851
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,064
The person's walking toward the camera.

852
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,536
No way.

853
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,340
That's...

854
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,381
The movie was quite long.
Look at the time.

855
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,749
Still, it was entertaining.

856
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,317
Yes, I agree.

857
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,321
Anyway, it's too late
to take this to Sister Kim.

858
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,556
I guess. We'll give it to her tomorrow.

859
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,724
Sure.

860
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,495
-Father.
-Yes?

861
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,930
There's something I'd like to ask.

862
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,065
Ask away.

863
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,135
I know it's against the rules,

864
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,672
but for one hour each week,
could I call you

865
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,875
by your name instead?

866
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,877
Yes, of course!

867
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,046
-Go ahead.
-It'll be fine for an hour, right?

868
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,414
Sure. Who'd even know?

869
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,984
-Then I'll go ahead.
-Sure.

870
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,486
Hae-il.

871
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,856
It's nice, my spiritual brother Seong-gyu.

872
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:27,957
This is great.

873
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,040
Father Han, stay here.

874
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:52,549
What are you doing here?

875
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,048
Run. Father Han, run!

876
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,386
No, don't! You bastards!

877
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,521
Get over here. No, come at me instead.

878
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:32,956
Fight me instead!

879
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:36,192
Hey!

880
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,294
Don't touch him, you bastards.

881
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,630
No, get over here.

882
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,599
No, don't.

883
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,402
Father Han, it's all right.

884
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:47,737
I'll be right there.

885
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:49,339
Make a run for it.

886
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,144
Father Han!

887
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,113
Seong-gyu!

888
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:02,919
I'll be right there.

889
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,089
I'm coming. Hold on. It'll be all right.

890
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:09,559
Hae-il.

891
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:11,361
It'll be fine.

892
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:18,234
Why do you always
pick on me and curse at my face?

893
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:19,803
You should stop that.

894
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,504
Anyway, where's the money?

895
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:29,913
Lee Jung-gwon, you bastard!

896
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,584
Touch him again and I'll kill you.

897
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:37,620
Hey.

898
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,757
Just know that everything
that happens here from now on

899
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,660
is all your fault.

900
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:46,896
Jung-gwon...

901
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,766
Jung-gwon, I'm sorry.

902
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,268
I'll give your money back.

903
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,971
Just show some mercy this one time.

904
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,606
Begin.

905
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:01,744
No.

906
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:07,684
No, don't. Don't.

907
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,588
Seong-gyu, no. No!

908
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,048
