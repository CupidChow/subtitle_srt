1
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,387
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,688
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,150
Stop right there.

4
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,259
You'll go to hell
for hitting women, brothers.

5
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,062
Are you okay?

6
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,230
Yes, Father.

7
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,180
Hey, stop right there!

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,849
Let them go. We just need the witnesses.

9
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,318
Brother and sister.

10
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,954
Let's return to Korea.

11
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,593
-All right.
-Yes.

12
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,329
Sir.

13
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,899
Do you have hot packs in your pockets?
Take out your hands.

14
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,101
I am sorry, sir.

15
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,339
How dare you chew gum when you talk to me?

16
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,440
Spit it out.

17
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,877
You didn't miss anything, did you?

18
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,646
I finished collecting money
for this month.

19
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,850
Divide and package it well.

20
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,219
-Yes, sir.
-Make sure you don't pilfer.

21
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,322
I don't pull tricks
when it comes to money.

22
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:03,957
I reminded you

23
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,226
-because that's exactly what you do.
-Sir, you have a call.

24
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,729
For goodness' sake.

25
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,698
What is it?

26
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,802
What? What did you say?

27
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,037
With the priest?

28
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,642
Chief Nam stopped the detectives
from investigating.

29
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,644
How... This is driving me crazy.

30
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,180
Hey, stop that bastard.

31
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,817
I don't care if you crush him or kill him.
Stop him.

32
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,887
Just stop him!

33
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,458
That bastard.

34
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,960
This won't do.

35
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,229
Make sure everything is in order.

36
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,565
Goodbye, sir.

37
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,967
There aren't any problems, right?

38
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,203
I don't need to worry, right?

39
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,405
Yes, Chief Nam.

40
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,740
Day and night,

41
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,375
I am keeping a watch on Father Kim Hae-il.

42
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,043
I am keeping myself one step ahead

43
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,112
to squash his every trick.

44
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,713
That's good.

45
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,683
That's what I expect from the unsung hero
of Gudam Police Station!

46
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,685
You have what it takes to be
the next team captain.

47
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,087
Thank you, Chief Nam.

48
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,656
I will continue to exert myself--

49
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,757
Hold on.

50
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,494
Mr. Hwang.

51
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,611
You will continue to exert yourself?
Don't make me laugh!

52
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,746
How could you let this happen

53
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:34,981
right under your nose?

54
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,151
Fix the problem right away!

55
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,987
This is an astronomic trouble.

56
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,459
CHIEF'S OFFICE

57
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,527
Hey!

58
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,429
Detective Seo, where are you right now?

59
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,531
I arrested the perjury suspects.

60
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,466
The estimated time of arrival is
58 minutes later.

61
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,235
See you soon.

62
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,369
Hey, Detective Seo...

63
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,406
I am in for another eventful day.

64
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,444
Do you know the identity of the men
you fought earlier?

65
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,247
Yes. They are from the Russian area.

66
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,916
I saw them when I went there.

67
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:14,454
Excuse me. We aren't culprits,
but witnesses.

68
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,955
You shouldn't handcuff us.

69
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,757
That's right. I will sue you when I arrive

70
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,992
at the police station.

71
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,560
Be quiet, the two of you.

72
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,096
Do you know
how grave a crime of perjury is?

73
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,064
Perjury?

74
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,633
Do you have proof?

75
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,568
How will you explain the gangsters

76
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,536
who were protecting you
while you ate French food?

77
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,874
Your plans to pay off
the credit card debt and gambling debt

78
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,175
don't seem feasible anymore.

79
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,444
You won't get
the remaining payment, after all.

80
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,189
Go to the restroom if you need to poop.

81
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,257
You are distracting me.

82
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,625
"Poop"?

83
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,861
I already pooped in my pants, okay?

84
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,064
Yes.

85
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,533
When did he say he will come?

86
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,170
I will be there soon.

87
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,473
I am nearly there. See you soon.

88
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,344
Go to the police station.
I need to drop by at the cathedral.

89
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,346
Is something the matter?

90
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,114
No, it's not like that.

91
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,617
Please drop me off over there.

92
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,852
Okay.

93
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,862
WITHDRAWAL OF THE CONSIGNMENT

94
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,398
These documents terminate
the cathedral's involvement

95
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,634
in Gudam Orphanage,
Gudam Nursing Home, and Gudam Sanatorium.

96
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,171
In a month, organize
the details of accounting and managing

97
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,605
and prepare for the changeover.

98
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,641
Why are you suddenly doing this?

99
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,776
Surely I don't need to explain.

100
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,412
Father Lee's case has nothing
to do with this.

101
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,848
Since the case,
there has been a sharp decline

102
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,250
in the number of the congregation
and sponsors.

103
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,353
Be that as it may,

104
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,389
how could you terminate the contract
so unilaterally?

105
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,291
You should have consulted us

106
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,659
and those at the facilities.

107
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,529
Your opinion isn't important
in this matter.

108
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
What if we can't accept your decision?

109
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,466
In that case,

110
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,901
we will have no choice but to force you.

111
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,637
If the facilities leave our hands,
who will manage them?

112
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,207
It hasn't been decided.

113
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,210
A legal selection will take place.

114
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,178
No.

115
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,847
We can't accept this decision.

116
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,916
Then file
for an administrative litigation.

117
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,555
Father, that's an official document!

118
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,724
We will manage

119
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,394
the welfare facilities.

120
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,529
Suit yourself.

121
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,899
I won't be responsible
for what happens next.

122
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,653
Father, where are you going?

123
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,656
If it's about this matter,
I will go with you.

124
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,025
Please know that

125
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,561
I am not following Father Kim
because he is crazy.

126
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,862
-Sister.
-Father!

127
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,564
-Sister.
-Wait for me!

128
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,533
Father!

129
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,335
We are nearly there.

130
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,472
Don't make sloppy excuses
when you arrive at the police station.

131
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,773
We can see through you.

132
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,443
Whatever. Just give us lunch
when we arrive.

133
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,379
-I would like sundae soup.
-Lunch, my foot!

134
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,425
Is it you guys again?

135
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,960
Misters are here!

136
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:01,914
Over there.

137
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,969
Hey, stop right there!

138
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,733
Are you okay?

139
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,970
I told you to stay at the cathedral.

140
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,206
No.

141
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,309
I don't know about other matters,

142
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,913
but this is one matter
I need to handle myself.

143
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,915
The welfare facilities

144
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,984
were looked after with care
by Father Lee Yeong-jun.

145
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,386
DISTRICT DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

146
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,655
I am okay. I am okay.

147
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,229
Father.

148
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,264
Sister.

149
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,600
Don't you know

150
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,571
how far the image of Gudam-gu has fallen

151
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,205
due to Father Lee's case?

152
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,908
How could you question my decision
to terminate the contract?

153
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,044
For goodness' sake.

154
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,279
Father Lee's case isn't over yet.

155
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,881
Haven't you heard about
the reinvestigation?

156
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,883
As the Gudam district director,

157
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,485
I follow the law of Korea,
not Vatican City.

158
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,256
Ask anyone in the welfare facilities.

159
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,593
Anyone would want to be with the church.

160
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,696
If another organization takes over,
they will be disappointed.

161
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,532
Are you asking me to entrust
a children's facility

162
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,134
to the church that has been tainted
with a scandal?

163
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,004
Do you really think it makes sense?

164
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,608
I won't allow it.

165
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,143
A scandal? A scandal?

166
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,979
Watch what you say!

167
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,349
It isn't a closed case.
They are reinvestigating.

168
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,086
We follow the law of the Vatican City.

169
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,721
We will always do so.

170
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,489
-Sister.
-Yes?

171
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,358
-Please calm down.
-Okay.

172
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,027
Please drink your tea.

173
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,966
Will Mr. Hwang's Daebeom Trading take over
the welfare facilities?

174
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,369
What nonsense are you spouting?

175
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,372
Daebeom Trading isn't even a candidate.

176
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,873
Then which organization will? Tell us.

177
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,809
I have no reason to reveal
confidential information.

178
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,277
Give us a hint.

179
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,414
Do you think
this is some kind of a quiz show?

180
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,983
Had this been a quiz show,
we would have gotten it right already.

181
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,685
Perhaps it's a difficult question.

182
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,955
How could you joke about
this kind of matter?

183
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,425
I have no reason to joke around
in front of you and Father Kim.

184
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,460
-There is a mountain of work
-You brought up a quiz show.

185
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,096
-I need to do for Gudam.
-Admit that you were joking around.

186
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,032
Sister, let's end
the conversation here today.

187
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,236
No. I must get to the bottom
of this matter.

188
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,904
I have to go.

189
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,106
Then go. It's okay.

190
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,311
-Will you be okay?
-Yes, I will be okay.

191
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,782
Then I will take my leave.

192
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,189
It must be convenient for him!

193
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,191
He says what he wants

194
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,527
and runs away without minding his manners!

195
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,465
Fine.

196
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,902
You should take your leave, too.

197
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,237
No.

198
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,740
Sit down.

199
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,343
Our conversation isn't over.

200
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,180
THE WARM-HEARTED AND TRUSTWORTHY POLICE IS
ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE

201
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,697
What is that?

202
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,233
Detective Seo. What is this?

203
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,368
What happened?

204
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,372
Where are the witnesses? Detective...

205
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,344
Detective Seo.

206
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,082
CHIEF PROSECUTOR, KANG SEOK-TAE

207
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,451
What a day!

208
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:36,055
The crisis has been resolved,
so please wrap up the situation.

209
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,024
Okay. I will do that.

210
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,360
Why did your junior prosecutor let
that priest go?

211
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,529
I knew this would happen.

212
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,432
I apologize.

213
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,400
I was careless.

214
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,082
Relax.

215
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,984
This time, I will send them

216
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,852
where no one can find them.

217
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,088
Where?

218
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,292
Khabarovsk, Russia.

219
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,661
They are on their way to board a ship.

220
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,862
In an hour,

221
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,231
they will be in the middle of the sea.

222
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,736
Weren't you certain
no one will find them at Petite France?

223
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,105
Well...

224
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,610
I am very curious about
how they were found.

225
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,548
I am curious about

226
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,885
why I am not killing you now.

227
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,422
Calm down.

228
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,561
I am sorry. I am very sorry.

229
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,897
For goodness' sake.

230
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,204
Hurry back to your post.

231
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,406
Either the police or the priest
will pay a visit.

232
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,176
Priest? Father?

233
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,379
Is the priest a problem?

234
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,815
See for yourself.

235
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,584
Get lost.

236
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,521
Get lost!

237
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,190
Okay.

238
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,334
How did the police find out?

239
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,339
Could it be that
the priest found out first?

240
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,609
It's impossible.

241
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,311
There was no way for him to find out.

242
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,721
It's time to receive a scolding.

243
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,958
Ms. Jeong.

244
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,800
I am someone

245
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,406
who despises people
who only talks without the right actions.

246
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,376
I apologize.

247
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,444
Even now, you are all talk

248
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,813
despite making several mistakes.

249
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,651
I wouldn't call it Mr. Hwang's mistake.

250
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,287
He simply showed a lapse
in information management.

251
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,389
Information management shows
someone's competence.

252
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,024
He shouldn't have been so careless.

253
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,458
Hey.

254
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,395
Perhaps you began to relax

255
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,864
because we let you sit with us.

256
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,999
When the adults let you sit with them,

257
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,069
you should show good table manners.

258
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,573
How dare you dirty the table?

259
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,612
At this rate,
you might overturn the table.

260
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,614
Seriously.

261
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,054
What, are you upset?

262
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,488
No, sir.

263
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,823
Are you?

264
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959
No, sir.

265
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:04,463
Gosh, look at the way that thug glares.

266
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,539
I made a grave mistake.

267
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,574
I will be more vigilant.

268
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,845
All right. Let this be your chance
to turn over a new leaf.

269
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,814
Please do better.

270
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,782
I can't sleep at night.

271
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,987
I don't care if you lack sophistication.

272
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,292
So mind your roots

273
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,562
and do your jobs perfectly. Understood?

274
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,509
Yes, sir.

275
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,414
-Hey, hey.
-For goodness' sake!

276
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,585
-Detective Seo, you need to calm down.
-That's right.

277
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,320
You were even carrying a firearm.

278
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,956
How dare they mess with a detective?

279
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,125
I will arrest

280
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,127
Gojayev and his gang in an hour.

281
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,129
You don't know if they are Gojayev's men!

282
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,965
I saw them
when I went to the Russian area.

283
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,700
Are you sure?
Are you sure you aren't mistaken?

284
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,734
I am sure!

285
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,737
Strictly speaking,
they aren't criminals, but witnesses.

286
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,508
I am sure those men had their reasons
for taking them, Detective Seo.

287
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,442
That's right.

288
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,010
There must be a reason
we don't know about.

289
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,280
On whose side are all of you?

290
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,315
-Sit down.
-That's right.

291
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,483
-Calm down and...
-Forget it!

292
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,253
We need to retrieve people
who were taken away.

293
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,421
Who were taken away?

294
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,130
Who were taken away?

295
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,169
We need to patrol the Gudam Station.

296
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,604
-Let's go.
-Oh, okay.

297
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,374
Hey, tell us why you are leaving.

298
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,875
Or not. Wait for me.

299
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,179
Oh, I just remembered my appointment.

300
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,714
I'm supposed to eat dinner
with Captain Park from RIU.

301
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,583
That means Detective Gu is on his own.

302
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,652
What do you mean by that?

303
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,855
Give me a summary of what happened.

304
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,124
While the witnesses were being escorted--

305
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,225
I didn't ask you.

306
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,327
The thing is, Father...

307
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,135
What are you doing?

308
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,280
Are you sure it wasn't your doing?

309
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,715
You heard Detective Seo.

310
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,884
She was the only one who went.

311
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,252
You talked to her on the phone.

312
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,921
I did that when she was
near the police station.

313
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,890
That means you had time
to spill information.

314
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,024
Listen, Father!

315
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,628
Why would I spill information

316
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,930
when my junior detective
was escorting suspects?

317
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,632
How could you think so lowly of me?

318
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,636
Besides,

319
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,040
we are the partners
for the cooperative investigation.

320
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,176
Why did you ignore me

321
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,645
and carried out an operation
with my junior detective?

322
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,480
There are procedures for an investigation.

323
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,282
How could you ignore me like this?

324
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,317
Those procedures apply to you, not me.

325
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,854
Don't speak nonsense.

326
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,658
The Korean police force got jumped
by the Russian gang

327
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,193
while escorting suspects.

328
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,896
But the police won't do anything about it.

329
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,732
Don't you think it's nonsense?

330
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,336
We need to get the full story.

331
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,274
Gosh, that laugh...

332
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,075
You...

333
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,024
I knew he wouldn't let me off.

334
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,562
Why did I hold it backward?

335
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,602
THE WARM-HEARTED AND TRUSTWORTHY POLICE IS
ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE

336
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,507
I didn't have a chance to ask earlier.

337
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,342
Are you hurt?

338
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,411
I am okay.

339
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,913
I am sorry I got you into this mess.

340
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,449
No, you don't need to apologize.

341
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,585
I am always thankful for you.

342
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,157
Father. I have a question.

343
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,126
How did you get information
on the location of the suspects?

344
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,095
You even got
the latitude and longitude coordinates.

345
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,164
I am sure I will have a chance
to tell you later.

346
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,566
Okay.

347
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,338
You can't leave as you want.
You need permission from...

348
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,973
I am following the pope's order.

349
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,576
Detective Seo. What has gotten into you?

350
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,178
You need to be rational.

351
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,982
I am 10 times more rational than I was
on the day of College Entrance Exam.

352
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,787
Are you coming with me or not?

353
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,059
No one can go. No one can go.

354
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,831
Hold on. Hold on.

355
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,933
I was about to get in the van.

356
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,835
You don't want to drag me down the road.

357
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,054
Ms. Park.

358
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,790
Why don't you take the back door today?

359
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:35,961
Ms. Park.

360
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,897
Wrap up and go home. I am leaving.

361
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,773
-Here she comes!
-Here she comes!

362
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,974
HAPPY CITIZENS JUST PROSECUTORS

363
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,543
Ms. Park, do you feel responsible
for Mr. Kim's suicide attempt?

364
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,179
There are rumors of a false confession
under duress. Is it true?

365
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,748
Perhaps there is a fundamental problem
with the investigative process.

366
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,550
Isn't Mr. Kim the scapegoat

367
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,552
for the son of CEO Kim Jung-cheol
of Hanju Group?

368
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,090
Does the suspect's suicide attempt point

369
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,159
to his innocence?

370
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,562
Does the suspect's suicide attempt point

371
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,931
to the flawed investigative process?

372
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,767
There were many allegations
from the start.

373
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,237
Those allegations were made by you,

374
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,505
not me.

375
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,708
Does that mean
you don't feel responsible at all?

376
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,009
It's a sad affair,

377
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,011
but the responsibility is
an entirely different matter.

378
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,446
Are we done?

379
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,748
-Ms. Park.
-Please wait.

380
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,686
-Please give us a comment.
-Ms. Park.

381
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,462
Hello.

382
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,498
What is up with this sloppy interior?

383
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:50,902
Who is Gojayev?

384
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,399
Are you Gojayev?

385
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,033
Pronounce my name properly.

386
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,604
Vladimir Gojayev.

387
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,108
Father.

388
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,346
A priest should stay in church,
not meddle with my business.

389
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,248
Priests spend time in church

390
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,017
and come outside to get Satan like you.

391
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,287
What did you do with the witnesses?

392
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,092
You should talk to your elder
more politely, you punk.

393
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,594
That's right. Gojayev must be
at least 12 years older than you.

394
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,330
You shouldn't be rude to your elders.

395
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,536
Elder, my foot!

396
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,271
He is nothing but a Russian thug!

397
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,405
Wait a minute.

398
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,241
You are that woman with a soju bottle.

399
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:04,976
Come here.

400
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,481
That punk...

401
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,317
Stop.

402
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,787
Didn't I tell you to be good?

403
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,389
We are innocent.

404
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,793
That man and woman asked us
for protection.

405
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,029
Who are you to protect them?

406
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,430
Do you think you are a bodyguard?

407
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,865
We do anything for the right price.

408
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,100
Where did you take the witnesses?

409
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,373
Witnesses?

410
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,442
What witnesses?

411
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,118
You sent them off on a ship
as you always do, right?

412
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,560
A ship? We did no such thing.

413
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,100
They are already crossing the sea, right?

414
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,775
Stop looking at me.

415
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,446
Sea?

416
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,515
You have no idea.

417
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,716
For goodness' sake.

418
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,184
It's the sea.

419
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,586
Shall we search nearby ports first?

420
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,122
Gosh, he is useless.

421
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,085
Where are you taking us?

422
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,189
Let go of me!

423
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,392
This isn't what you promised!

424
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,667
Is there no way, Father?

425
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,570
The Russian smuggling gang is
hard to catch.

426
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,204
It's a time-consuming process.

427
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,307
Let's give up for now.

428
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,676
That's right.

429
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,778
It takes weeks of stakeouts

430
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,513
to catch the Russian smuggling gang.

431
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,815
Father, how do you know these things?

432
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,319
Is it so strange? It isn't a state secret.

433
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,388
Detective Seo,

434
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,490
there is something
I am really curious about.

435
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,726
How did you know
the location of the witnesses?

436
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,064
I got it from my informant.

437
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,866
Informant? What informant?

438
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,136
Telling you would be
a breach of confidentiality.

439
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,940
It's strange.

440
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,042
How do you have an informant
when you are just a newbie?

441
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,279
Drop me off over there.

442
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,581
I will drive you to the cathedral.

443
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,250
No, I can go on my own.
Drop me off over there.

444
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,457
-Bye, Father.
-Take care.

445
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,959
-Good work, Detective Seo.
-Good work.

446
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,428
Detective Seo isn't the only one
who did good work. I...

447
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,202
Another long day came to an end.

448
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,309
For goodness' sake!

449
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,521
Why does the claw keep opening?

450
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,591
For goodness' sake!

451
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,830
The claw keeps opening.

452
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,500
You are good at catching people,
but not stuffed toys.

453
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,837
You are good at catching innocent people,
to be exact.

454
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,008
Is it really necessary to pick a fight
on an empty street at night?

455
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,045
I am not picking a fight.

456
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,380
I am talking about a suspect
who attempted suicide.

457
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,183
I would appreciate it
if you didn't go there.

458
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,952
People only appreciate opportunities
from other people

459
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,988
and shape their lives around them.

460
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,692
Opportunities from other people
may fill the bank account,

461
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,326
but they will never fill the soul.

462
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,430
Grabbing the opportunity from God

463
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,331
is the only way
to live as a decent human being.

464
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,000
That opportunity

465
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,502
is something you keep missing, old lady.

466
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,705
Perhaps you ignore it on purpose.

467
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,841
If it doesn't hurt your livelihood,
you should grab it.

468
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,110
Yes!

469
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,854
Yesterday, you were drunk.
Today, you are a seasoned priest.

470
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,659
I don't remember much
of yesterday evening.

471
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:51,696
I suggest you stop finding my faults
and start minding your behaviors.

472
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,500
When I use nice words
without getting angry--

473
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,136
You want me to listen, right?
But your words simply don't reach me.

474
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,039
By the way,

475
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:05,376
didn't God ever give you an opportunity
to live a normal and anger-free life?

476
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,484
You should grab that opportunity
before you school me.

477
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,755
Thank you for the lecture
in the middle of the night.

478
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,993
I will give you this
instead of an offering today.

479
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,831
Bye.

480
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,107
You get one free if you buy two.

481
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,042
-Just keep scanning.
-Okay.

482
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,081
You can take one for free.

483
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,416
I told you to just keep scanning.

484
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:46,885
Okay.

485
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,858
You can talk down to me
as you always have.

486
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,326
Forget it.

487
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,228
A 27-year-old isn't a child.

488
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,963
Besides, I hardly know you.

489
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,200
Since you are a regular customer
who lives in this building,

490
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,635
you could do that.

491
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,570
I told you to forget it!

492
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,338
Okay. Suit yourself.

493
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,222
She is unpredictable.

494
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,424
She is a femme fatale
who keeps me on my toes.

495
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,131
Yo-han!

496
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,133
-Did you get off work?
-Yes.

497
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,601
Let's eat this.

498
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,436
-What is it?
-Follow me.

499
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,439
The chef of the restaurant

500
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,642
made tangsuyuk for me.

501
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,045
Why did you pour the sauce?
That's not how I eat the dish.

502
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,948
Just stuff your face.
You talk too much, Yo-han.

503
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,517
Stuff my face? Where do you learn
that kind of language?

504
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,855
I am sorry. I was in the wrong.

505
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,489
Please stuff your face.

506
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:01,793
It's tasty.

507
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,699
That stuffed toy...

508
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,438
I picked it up on the street.

509
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,777
I told Sister Kim about the witnesses.

510
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:25,450
How could this happen
in a law-governed country?

511
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,285
They take away the welfare facilities

512
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,320
and kidnap people in broad daylight.

513
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,322
Gudam isn't governed by the law.

514
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,093
It's governed by Satan.

515
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,562
Had Father Lee been alive,

516
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,931
they wouldn't have dared to be this way.

517
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,769
If Father Lee could see this,
he would be heartbroken.

518
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,563
As the Prosecutors' Office

519
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,233
have been accused of overlooking the crime
of Kim Geon-yong,

520
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,868
the son of CEO Kim Jung-cheol
of Hanju Group,

521
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,238
a delay in the investigative process
seems unavoidable.

522
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,540
The prosecutor who is on this case,
Park Gyeong-seon

523
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,442
of the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office...

524
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,785
You are undergoing many hardships
these days, right?

525
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,621
I saw you on TV.

526
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,157
I see.

527
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,326
Angela,

528
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,729
you must live as the Lord himself,
not his daughter.

529
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,864
-Me?
-Yes.

530
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,767
Your work is similar to the Lord's work.

531
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,545
It's different from the Lord's work,
Father Lee.

532
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,016
Very different.

533
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,129
Please give me one.

534
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,234
I am sorry. This is the last one.

535
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,041
I hoped you would give me one.

536
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,609
Didn't you quit smoking?

537
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:32,944
I did,

538
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,747
but I couldn't stop thinking
about smoking today.

539
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,418
I think Father Lee is keeping me
from smoking.

540
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,525
When I prayed earlier,

541
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,263
I complained to God for the first time
since I became a priest.

542
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,032
It's okay.

543
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,234
There is someone who gets mad at God
every minute.

544
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,707
It's tiring to live with me, right?

545
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,042
Of course not.

546
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,111
We wouldn't have been able
to do anything without you.

547
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,180
Of course, it's tiring.

548
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,050
I go from one place to another
expressing anger.

549
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,352
That's who you are.

550
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,424
Father Lee Yeong-jun once told me,

551
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,360
"Love and mercy begin

552
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,897
when you understand
and see someone as he is."

553
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,401
Seeing someone as he is
doesn't change anything.

554
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,205
Still, I will follow

555
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,407
Father Lee's will.

556
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,312
That's my will.

557
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,041
Dae-yeong, let's wear one each.

558
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,809
I paid a lot of money to get two.

559
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,179
Do you think we are a couple?

560
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,614
Why should we wear matching necklaces?

561
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:21,185
We need God's protection
to stay safe during work.

562
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,855
Here. Hurry up.

563
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,862
Yeong-cheon, wake up!

564
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,164
Yeong-cheon, you are at the hospital.

565
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:44,942
Yeong-cheon, no.

566
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,946
Yeong-cheon.

567
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,416
Don't go, you punk.

568
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:23,814
Yeong-cheon.

569
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,487
Detective Lee, it's me.

570
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,792
It's stressful to be at the bottom, right?

571
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,263
Hang in there.

572
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,465
When I save up enough money,

573
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,302
I will move you to the premium floor.

574
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,071
LEE YEONG-CHEON

575
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,842
I have lived well for the past year.

576
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,213
As you asked,

577
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:57,682
I didn't die.

578
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,251
I stayed healthy.

579
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,790
My body feels comfortable, but...

580
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,229
everything else feels uncomfortable.

581
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,205
Still, there is no other way

582
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,675
if I want to follow your will.

583
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,218
Yeong-cheon.

584
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,156
Don't worry about your wife and Seo-jun.

585
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,361
Rest in peace.

586
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,731
Rest in peace.

587
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,877
Mr. Park, how do I reach the back door
from the East Gate?

588
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,651
PRESIDENT OF DAEBEOM TRADING,
HWANG CHEOL-BEOM

589
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,787
You need to have better control
over your subordinates.

590
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,389
It's not a matter of control.

591
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,458
Each detective has a different style.

592
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,796
The information couldn't have come
from the priest.

593
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,964
Who is the informant?

594
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,300
The one who told her about
Petite France in Gapyeong.

595
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,768
I asked, but she didn't tell.

596
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,739
You have no authority, don't you?
It's embarrassing.

597
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,941
It's not a matter of authority.

598
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,876
There are rules
between senior and junior detectives.

599
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,645
Rules, my foot!

600
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,814
Give me her information.
I will make her talk.

601
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,881
Mr. Jang.

602
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,818
Mr. Hwang is talking.

603
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,219
It's okay.

604
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,325
I have the same idea.

605
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,263
Should I grab that new detective

606
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,332
and ask?

607
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,970
No, no. I will look into it.

608
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,572
If you fail,

609
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,475
I will interrogate her myself.

610
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,643
Understood?

611
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,115
Give it to me.

612
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,491
Today is the death anniversary
of your late coworker, right?

613
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,292
Valentine's Day, right?

614
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,928
Is his son in elementary school now?

615
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,564
Give them the money.

616
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,038
It's okay. I will take my leave.

617
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,009
Take it.

618
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,278
Detective Gu.

619
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,517
He still has pride.

620
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,996
Bye.

621
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,601
If I remember correctly,

622
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,638
this is the first time you disappointed me
two times in a row.

623
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,306
I am sorry.

624
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,775
Take your hands off
the Nonhyeon-dong meth case.

625
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,411
Mr. Nam will take over.

626
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,380
Mr. Nam?

627
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,849
He is your alumnus
you saw at the get-together.

628
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,585
He graduated before you
and became a prosecutor after you.

629
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,054
Sir.

630
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,824
It's my case, so I will see it through.

631
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:01,892
Come in.

632
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,732
-I can come back later.
-There is no need.

633
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,268
Come in and take a seat.

634
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,372
You were saying?

635
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,477
It's my case, so I will see it through.

636
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,611
Ms. Park.

637
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,514
Chief Prosecutor was furious
because of you.

638
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,585
How could you ask to see it through
when that's the case?

639
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,855
-Mr. Nam.
-Yes?

640
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,390
The Nonhyeon-dong meth case

641
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,025
is yours to see through.

642
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,228
I will handle it strategically.

643
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,600
Also, the priest.

644
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,936
What are we going to do with him?

645
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,806
From the start, we should have...

646
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,675
He is like a mosquito on an autumn night.

647
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,411
A mosquito that buzzes next to your ears
when you try to sleep.

648
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,514
Unlike mosquitoes you see during summer,

649
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,117
they don't even die easily
because they survived all sorts of crises.

650
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,286
I will be sure to use bug spray soon.

651
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,856
Also, the witnesses' location became known
because of that mosquito.

652
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,793
Don't let that slip.

653
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,130
No, sir. I will see
how the information was achieved.

654
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,066
That's right. Focus on finding that out

655
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:19,303
and quelling my anger, okay?

656
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,109
Mr. Nam, would you like a cup of tea?

657
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,477
Yes, sir.

658
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:28,879
What was your score yesterday?

659
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,581
It wasn't too high.

660
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,388
-Why are you still in my office?
-I'm leaving, sir.

661
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,191
Ms. Park.

662
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,528
Work strategically, okay?

663
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,611
That bastard! That son of a...

664
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,348
For goodness' sake.

665
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:08,852
That son of a...

666
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,598
-Hello.
-Father, it's me, Detective Seo.

667
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,166
What's the matter?

668
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,569
I think you should come
to the police station.

669
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,716
We need to catch them no matter what.

670
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,883
Given the witnesses' debt,

671
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,619
it's obvious they were bought off.

672
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,188
Is there a record of the transaction?

673
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,623
They must have received cash.

674
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,291
Who transfers that kind of money?

675
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,226
Let's say there is a problem.

676
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,894
How are we supposed to find them?

677
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,997
There is Interpol.

678
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,098
Interpol?

679
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:56,567
-Sir.
-Sir.

680
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,571
Interpol, my foot.

681
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,573
Interpol, the pope...

682
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,476
Someone would think we are taking down
the Colombian drug cartel.

683
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,412
Chief, the circumstances point
to one direction.

684
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,748
Don't you agree, Detective Gu?

685
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,984
The circumstances don't tell us much.

686
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,621
How could you frame

687
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,757
those brave citizens?

688
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,026
I am not framing them. This is a fact.

689
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,093
Fact?

690
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,395
The fact is that

691
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:27,164
the Prosecutors' Office already had them
in the witness protection program.

692
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,266
You stirred up trouble for nothing.

693
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,069
The witness protection program?
I didn't know it existed in Korea.

694
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:37,274
Oh, that's right. The program is on trial.

695
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,343
Then what about the Russian thugs
who attacked me?

696
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,712
It was an act of terrorism.

697
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,515
It sounds like the collision took place

698
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,750
in their attempt to protect the witnesses.

699
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,153
You are the one who should apologize.

700
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,320
Chief!

701
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,296
The tone of his laughter changed.

702
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,031
What is the meaning of that laughter?

703
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,969
I am in tears.

704
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,140
The witness protection program?

705
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,910
On which channel does it air?

706
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,514
VIOLENT CRIME SQUAD

707
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,216
This is meaningless and boring.

708
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,123
Father, behave prudently today.

709
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:30,360
He let me off today.

710
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,931
Hold on. It's not in his nature
to forgo retaliation.

711
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,835
CRIMINAL DIVISION

712
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,472
Hold on. Hold on. Stop. Stop.

713
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,420
You broke it again!

714
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,789
It just came in yesterday.

715
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,657
Order it again.

716
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:05,796
Listen. Why don't I put a punching machine

717
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,931
in the hallway?

718
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,366
You could punch it as you come and go.

719
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,568
That's a good idea.

720
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:12,836
I will insert a coin, too.

721
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,045
He is so weird.

722
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,548
Gosh.

723
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:28,585
That priest isn't normal.

724
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:35,893
He broke it again.

725
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:05,923
Prophet Ki.

726
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,959
Children also need

727
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:10,994
enlightenment.

728
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,196
Woo-ta!

729
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,198
Woo-ta!

730
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,545
I promise you that when you grow up,

731
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:29,713
you will be an adult.

732
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,018
All right, everyone.

733
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,023
Starting a month later,
this lady will look after you.

734
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:43,327
Excuse me. What are you talking about?

735
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,496
You will get
an official announcement soon.

736
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:52,736
Then where will the chief nun go?

737
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,240
The chief nun will go someplace else.

738
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,743
I will be with you from now on.

739
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,446
I don't want that! You look mean!

740
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,149
All right. Calm down.

741
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,186
We will give you gifts. Give them gifts.

742
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,188
-Okay.
-You can't do that.

743
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,957
This place is managed by Gudam Cathedral.

744
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,659
We can't accept this kind of behavior.

745
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,895
Children, don't take the gifts.

746
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,430
Let them take the gifts.
Children like gifts.

747
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:21,899
Isn't that right, children?

748
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:24,801
Please leave.
Until the decision becomes official,

749
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,770
stay out of here.

750
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:35,545
Sister, you severely lack enlightenment.

751
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,180
I can tell by your anger.

752
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,316
It doesn't suit your pretty face.

753
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,253
Get out. Go!

754
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:44,388
Gosh.

755
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,390
-Get out.
-Woo-ta.

756
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:47,791
Woo-ta.

757
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,122
Why are you following me?

758
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,827
It's my duty to stay with you
until sundown.

759
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:58,595
Until sundown?

760
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:02,232
The sun will go down soon, so go away.

761
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,168
Don't be absurd. The sun is so strong
that I could get a suntan.

762
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,070
-Don't enter! Don't enter!
-Gosh, it's cold!

763
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,506
How dare you enter?
You have no right to enter!

764
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,407
Don't enter!

765
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,542
Are you seriously performing an exorcism
on me?

766
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:14,478
Father!

767
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,319
That's what the leader of Maegakkyo said.

768
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:23,420
My Lord.

769
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,856
-Did he really say that?
-Yes.

770
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,426
He said we will get
an official announcement soon.

771
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,630
-Maegakkyo is...
-A cult. It's a cult.

772
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:36,800
What should we do?
Those satanic followers...

773
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,935
We can't let Maegakkyo take over
the welfare facilities.

774
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,270
It's a cult!

775
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,639
This country has freedom of religion.

776
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,940
To criticize them so harshly--

777
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,942
Even if there is freedom of religion,
this is wrong!

778
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,311
What kind of nonsense are you spouting?

779
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,214
I see that a majority of people
in this church are angry.

780
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,817
They say you will lose weight,
get a smaller face, or win the lottery

781
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,152
if you pray.

782
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,254
It's the most outrageous cult.

783
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,288
That's not all.

784
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,323
They make their followers squander
their entire fortune

785
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,792
and deceive them with tricks.

786
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,094
They beat anyone who shows suspicion.

787
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:06,696
Let's check first.

788
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,032
What? What are you going to check?

789
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,634
Let's see
if the organization is deserving.

790
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,235
Why would you need to check?

791
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:17,074
Maegakkyo is a notorious cult!
I am sorry. I should have stayed quiet.

792
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,242
I will go and see how notorious it is.

793
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,511
-Stay here.
-Maegakkyo may be a bit strange,

794
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,413
but the followers aren't problematic.

795
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,916
Who told you to come in?

796
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,684
You performed an exorcism on me.

797
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,786
I went, "Gosh, it's cold!"

798
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,658
Hello. I am Detective Seo Seung-a
of Gudam Police Station.

799
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:39,162
Detective Seo Seung-a, you have style.

800
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,566
I called you over here to ask something.

801
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,267
Ask.

802
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,241
The witnesses who exposed
Father Lee Yeong-jun

803
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,577
were in Petite France in Gapyeong, right?

804
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,081
Where did you get that information?

805
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,683
I have an informant.

806
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:05,122
I can tell if someone is lying
by looking at

807
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:06,990
their pupils.

808
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,392
Tell me the truth.

809
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,962
I got the information from my informant.

810
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,663
Detective Seo Seung-a.

811
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,466
Don't get cute with me, okay?

812
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:18,768
Tell me the truth.

813
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,576
MAEGAKKYO CHOSEN AS STATE RELIGION
IN REPUBLIC OF UMBAGA

814
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,745
I went to the orphanage

815
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,714
and took a look around.

816
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,683
I bribed the children in advance.

817
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,921
You seem to bribe everyone.

818
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:42,659
Enlightenment comes more easily
with the right bribes.

819
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:43,727
By the way,

820
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:47,597
when will the decision become official?

821
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,399
Soon.

822
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:52,102
Then say thank you

823
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:53,937
and reap the fruit.

824
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,439
Also, pick a few competent men and women.

825
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,074
Once we set up a foundation,

826
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,277
they can manage it.

827
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,814
I will pick good ones.

828
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,716
Shall we go and eat yeonpotang?

829
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,886
Unfortunately,
it's time for me to heal some people.

830
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,957
You work hard even on weekdays.

831
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:15,392
Which tricks will you pull today?

832
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,730
Today, I will make myself look sincere.

833
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:22,966
I won't focus on the techniques.

834
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,101
I think I will go with you and watch

835
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:27,571
how you fool people.

836
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,441
Woo-ta.

837
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:35,812
MAEGAKKYO CHAPEL

838
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,684
-Woo-ta!
-Woo-ta!

839
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:45,388
Here comes our leader!

840
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,990
-Woo-ta!
-Woo-ta!

841
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:59,970
Today, there are many among us
who suffer spiritually and physically.

842
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,872
Why do they suffer?

843
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,175
Why do they suffer?

844
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,077
Woo-ta.

845
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:09,212
-Woo-ta!
-Woo-ta!

846
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,114
Prophet Ki's enlightenment

847
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,818
will purify your blood.

848
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,694
-What is your ailment?
-My leg hurts.

849
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,029
Your leg hurts.

850
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,531
I will pray.

851
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,277
Woo-ta!

852
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,146
-Woo-ta?
-Throw away your crutches and walk.

853
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,814
You shall walk!

854
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,794
My enlightenment will purify your souls.

855
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,729
I don't know if it's thanks to his energy,

856
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,765
but my muscle cramps went away.

857
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,101
My body feels light.

858
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,805
Woo-ta!

859
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,073
Woo-ta!

860
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,341
It's a cult.

861
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:15,545
Don't disparage other people's religions.

862
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:19,649
-For goodness' sake.
-I have been purified!

863
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,319
-Woo-ta!
-Woo-ta!

864
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,991
It's a priest. It's a priest.

865
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,526
-A priest came!
-It's a priest.

866
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:30,994
He deserted his God

867
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,696
and came to Prophet Ki!

868
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,798
-Woo-ta!
-Woo-ta!

869
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,766
Father, welcome.

870
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,802
-Congratulations.
-Welcome.

871
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,970
-Welcome.
-He isn't a priest.

872
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,473
He isn't a priest. He is cosplaying.

873
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,408
-He isn't a priest. He isn't a priest.
-Father.

874
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:46,810
Calm down.

875
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,512
Father, give an offering
and take this rice cake.

876
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,081
It's the rice cake of enlightenment.

877
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,883
Come. Give an offering
and take this rice cake.

878
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,352
-I will try it first.
-Give an offering.

879
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,854
-I will try it first.
-But... Woo-ta!

880
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,789
Share it with the priest.

881
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,502
What?

882
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,039
You did it! He did it!

883
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,942
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

884
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,344
Eat rice cake and get enlightened.

885
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:28,251
This situation makes me a bit angry.

886
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,388
You agreed to take a punch from me, right?

887
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:33,456
It's time for you to take it.

888
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,526
This is wild.

889
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:39,796
It was the funniest thing I heard
in the past 10 years.

890
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,399
Why are you so determined to punch me?

891
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,033
Let's hear your reason.

892
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,772
Mr. Hwang, his character--

893
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,574
The welfare facilities. This cult.

894
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,077
And you here.

895
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,215
Are you stalking me?

896
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,519
Why do you keep digging here and there?

897
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,989
Both of you should calm down.

898
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,925
Father, I am begging you.

899
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,094
Mr. Hwang is a scary man.

900
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,098
Shall we take this outside?

901
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,700
It would be embarrassing
to get beaten up before a security camera.

902
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:23,306
There is no need to take this outside.
I am not the one who will be embarrassed.

903
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,942
Mr. Hwang. Father!

904
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,178
You can't do this here.

905
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,347
Stay out of it.

906
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:35,285
No, no. You can be the referee.

907
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,188
My goodness.

908
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:42,559
I wouldn't be able to sleep well
after I beat up a priest.

909
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,761
I will make sure you sleep well.

910
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,130
You can talk this out.

911
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,732
You are better than this.

912
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,834
-Should I take that?
-Okay.

913
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,103
Now that you removed the Roman collar,
my guilt went away a bit.

914
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,476
Let's begin.

915
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,147
Fight.

916
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,083
What? You come.

917
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,313
SPECIAL APPEARANCE, ANCHOR PARK EUN-KYUNG

918
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,232
You need to stop testing
my patience, okay?

919
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:57,834
The information is from my informant.

920
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:58,868
Hey!

921
00:58:58,935 --> 00:58:59,769
THE TABLES ARE TURNED

922
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,638
No one will criticize you
even if you give up now.

923
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,573
What are you saying?
I haven't even gotten started.

924
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,941
KNOW YOUR ENEMY AND KNOW YOURSELF

925
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,242
Listen carefully.

926
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,844
They are evil bastards.

927
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,646
They are in this together,
so no one gets caught.

928
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,414
Those evil sons of...

929
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:12,649
YOU NEED NOT FEAR HUNDRED BATTLES

930
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,784
You act like you will fight
every evil in the world.

931
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,186
But you always show your cards
and mess up.

932
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,655
Mess up? Did you say I mess up?

933
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,390
What else did I mess up?

934
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,559
