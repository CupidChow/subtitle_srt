1
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,153
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,521
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,694
You bastard! How could you...

4
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,231
Wait there!

5
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,486
Songsak.

6
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,789
There you go. One, two.

7
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,044
A tiger

8
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,079
that protects

9
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,080
the king.

10
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,549
THE TIGER THAT PROTECTS THE KING

11
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,651
Songsak!

12
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:46,639
Dae-yeong!

13
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,478
Myeong-su.

14
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,113
Captain.

15
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,614
Sorry we're late.

16
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,383
Round them up!

17
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,618
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

18
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,462
Don't you know who I am?

19
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,731
Stop fighting me, sir.

20
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,266
Well done.

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,868
Damn it.

22
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,369
Let go.

23
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,938
My father is a congressman.

24
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,708
Songsak. You're such a good fighter.

25
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,109
Were you a Muay Thai athlete?

26
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:28,081
I was. Then I joined as a bodyguard
to the Royal Thai family.

27
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,349
A royal bodyguard?

28
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,052
Then why are you delivering
jjajangmyeon in Korea?

29
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,556
A fellow bodyguard

30
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,459
left his post
which caused a major problem.

31
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,962
He pinned the blame all on me.

32
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,497
Because of that,

33
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,635
I got fired,
and that was the end of my career.

34
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,004
Even a private security company

35
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,305
wouldn't hire me.

36
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,009
You're just too kind for your own sake.

37
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,411
You fool.
You were a pushover there as well.

38
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,479
Go away.

39
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,182
From now on,
you'll always take action like this.

40
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,050
Yes, Father.

41
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,352
I will help you too, Father.

42
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,723
-Okay, I'll get going then.
-Take care, Father.

43
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,861
That knee strike you did
where you flew in the air.

44
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,396
Could you teach me too?

45
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:17,997
What?

46
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,833
Did you hear that?

47
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,138
Sure, this Songsak will teach you.

48
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:29,375
I'll teach you all the killer moves
in Muay Thai.

49
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,212
-Me too, brother.
-Me too.

50
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,815
Stick to just watching the stars, you pig.

51
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,285
Meanwhile you... I mean, Detective Gu.

52
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,355
You can stick to what you know.

53
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,623
That's mean, you know.

54
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,458
You go and watch the stars.

55
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,060
I'll live the way I've always lived.

56
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,128
Say goodbye to the free sandwiches

57
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,363
I've been letting you have.

58
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,999
Petty little piggy.

59
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,705
Am I your friend now?

60
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,543
We're friends.

61
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,078
Are you out of your mind?

62
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,214
This could lead to a nationwide scandal!

63
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,917
I'm only trying to catch the jerk
who tried to kill me.

64
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,752
That's not the issue here.

65
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,755
You and me. We could both lose everything!

66
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,390
Still, I'll stick to catching the jerk.

67
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,360
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm not kidding.

68
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,529
Right now, this is all I care about.

69
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,931
I'm hanging up now, sir.

70
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,968
Who are you to yell at me, you shit?

71
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,947
Were the druggies all sent to Narcotics?

72
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,916
Yes, sir.
They're having a field day over there.

73
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,285
The reporters are there too.

74
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,488
The druggies are all refusing
a urine test.

75
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,690
One even chose to wet his pants instead.

76
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,293
Let Narcotics suffer for once.

77
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,595
Are we done for today?

78
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,363
Let go of me!

79
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,399
It looks like we have one more.

80
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,602
Why am I here?

81
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,237
I'm sure there's a reason.

82
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,774
How dare you touch me. Let go, you jerk.

83
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,742
Have some manners, you shit.

84
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,611
Have a seat.

85
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,847
As if. Where's your chief?
Bring me the chief!

86
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,288
Enough! Where is our chief then?

87
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,090
Does he live in Namcheon-dong?

88
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,659
You little prick.

89
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,228
Did you and our chief...

90
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,831
enjoy a meal together,

91
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,500
go to the sauna together

92
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,669
among other things?

93
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,305
How dare you.

94
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,141
If this were back in the day,

95
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,077
I would've buried you from the neck down.

96
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,813
How dare you.

97
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,781
You little prick--

98
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,516
Don't you hit me.

99
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,519
No government employee
can lay a hand on me.

100
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,655
Unbelievable.

101
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,791
You make me want to smack you
from 20 feet away.

102
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,393
Who the hell are you?

103
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,462
You said no government employee
can lay a hand on you,

104
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,864
but there's a priest who can.

105
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,432
That's none other than me.

106
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,703
There. That's what you deserve.

107
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,506
How is it that you can't tell

108
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,775
when to grovel or not?

109
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:16,876
Enough.

110
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,314
A sacred police station isn't a place

111
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,282
for such a beating.

112
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,586
Detective Gu, bring him inside.

113
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,588
Come on.

114
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,692
You wait and see.

115
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,728
I'll turn this entire place upside down.

116
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,431
Well, let me start by
doing the same to your face.

117
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,276
Welcome, Attorney Poop.

118
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,445
I'd rather you stick to my name

119
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,480
and call me Attorney Byeon.

120
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,449
Sure thing, Attorney Poop.

121
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,317
-Detective?
-Sure.

122
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,420
We'll begin since Attorney Poop is here.

123
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,522
Kim Geon-yong,

124
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,791
you have the right to remain silent.

125
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,126
You may also refuse to answer questions.

126
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,194
An attorney can...

127
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,463
Hold on. You have Attorney Poop.

128
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,333
Here's the warrant for your arrest.

129
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,235
Why is there a warrant?

130
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,504
If this is about drugs, then--

131
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,939
Drugs aren't the issue.

132
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,643
He's under arrest for soliciting murder
against Prosecutor Park,

133
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,378
-Attorney Poop.
-What?

134
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,316
-Where's your proof?
-We'll soon have it.

135
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,985
While we wait, keep yourself occupied
in our holding cell.

136
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,320
You see,

137
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,657
the tiles are of a baroque pattern,
so studying it will be fun.

138
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,991
Sure, bring it on.

139
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,128
Just don't expect me
to show mercy later on.

140
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,564
I won't. Just know that my goal

141
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,766
is to get your father to disown you

142
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,134
completely.

143
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,602
Also,

144
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,672
address me like I'm your friend,
you imbecile.

145
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,774
The warrant is only viable for 48 hours.

146
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,809
If you don't find evidence until then,

147
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,811
you'll pay.

148
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,117
It's like you're spewing poop,
Attorney Poop.

149
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,221
I knew you'd say that
and it's not funny at all.

150
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,903
SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

151
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,004
REPATRIATION LIST TO RUSSIA

152
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,441
Prisoners will be transferred to Russia

153
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,510
the day after tomorrow at 4 p.m.

154
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,045
That's in two days.

155
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,680
Are you going to bring him back?

156
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,216
Yes, it's how we can catch those

157
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,217
who ordered the hit.

158
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,752
Even though we bring him back--

159
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,887
It can go either way.

160
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,656
He'll either keep quiet
or be forced to do so.

161
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,591
Captain Lee!

162
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,363
-Yes, sir?
-Who told you to roll out?

163
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,331
Who gave the order?

164
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,274
If we hadn't rolled out,

165
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,276
Dae-yeong and Seung-a

166
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,280
would've died on the scene.

167
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,583
It's up to officers to protect themselves
in situations like that.

168
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:12,585
What about Yeong-cheon?

169
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,053
Did he die because

170
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,421
-he lacked as a cop?
-What?

171
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,690
Yeong-cheon will be the last one

172
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,393
beaten to death by thugs.

173
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,929
How dare you talk back at me.

174
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,463
How is that important right now?

175
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,233
Why is it not important?

176
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,636
What?

177
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,838
Do you even know
how Yeong-cheon's family is doing?

178
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,108
Actually, do you even remember who he is?

179
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,911
You obnoxious jerks. How dare you!

180
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,014
-Mister.
-Don't call me that!

181
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,516
Chief Nam.

182
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,419
With age, people should

183
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,154
gain dignity, not visceral fat.

184
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,323
Have some benevolence.

185
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,625
How could a chief not have any?

186
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,960
You...

187
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,494
Whatever.

188
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,264
Get ready to be reprimanded.

189
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,503
VIOLENT CRIME SQUAD 1

190
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,073
It's disgusting if you ask me.

191
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,515
A BUILDING B6

192
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,632
Seriously? Old age can be a bitch.

193
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,435
Back in the day,

194
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,005
they'd send at least five to jump me.

195
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,674
All they send is two?

196
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,877
Don't just stand there. Bring it on.

197
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,326
Don't you even work out?

198
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,029
Get up.

199
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,197
Get up already.

200
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,310
ZIPPY COURIER SERVICE

201
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,393
Thank you for saving me today, Yo-han.

202
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,263
-Here's my gift. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

203
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,298
Just tell me if you need anything else.

204
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,271
Stop it. It's my gift to him.

205
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,476
The thugs earlier
had some serious tattoos.

206
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,411
Should I get one too to look formidable?

207
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,946
You should think carefully

208
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,581
since you only have one canvas.

209
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,984
Well, if you think about it,
I look intimidating without one.

210
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,788
Old lady, if Kim Geon-yong is the target,

211
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,523
you should've only served him the warrant.

212
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,759
Why did you charge into Rising Moon too?

213
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,329
Well, it concerns my attempted murder
and those at Diyabol.

214
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,798
Then why didn't you arrest
the members of Diyabol?

215
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,468
What are you nitpicking this time?

216
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,171
Didn't you want to strike back

217
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,073
instead of just thinking about it
until now?

218
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,946
You're very well aware
that I'm not one of those

219
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,014
passionate and righteous prosecutors.

220
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,683
But you do have passion.

221
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,685
You're just using it wrong.

222
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,256
It's not easy to change
how someone functions.

223
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,927
Anyway, I'll get going.

224
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,031
I'll be at the cathedral for the meeting.

225
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,380
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

226
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,682
My energy's all gone.

227
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,921
Let me replenish then.

228
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,723
Wild ginseng!

229
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,396
What do I do now?

230
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,802
What else can I do? I'll smash them all.

231
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,740
This'll give me energy.

232
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,612
You're all dead.

233
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:36,982
Bring it on!

234
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,332
ZIPPY COURIER SERVICE

235
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,310
We're closed for the day.

236
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,517
Not for me.

237
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,516
I forgot how nice it was to move alone.

238
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,255
It brings back memories.

239
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:51,590
What is this about?

240
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,198
ZIPPY COURIER SERVICE

241
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,467
I have a question to ask.

242
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,740
The drug bust that occurred
in Club R last night

243
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,344
was a one-off incident
involving the children of some

244
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,813
of Korea's richest families.

245
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,617
Club R does not sell drugs

246
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,552
or distribute them in any way

247
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,789
and no illegal evidence or drugs

248
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,660
were found in the search
conducted by the police.

249
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,163
Moreover, the rumor about

250
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,265
the police having

251
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,967
close relations to Club R

252
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,237
is a groundless claim

253
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,141
and those spreading it online

254
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,778
will be found and severely dealt with.

255
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,646
The police having connections...

256
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,252
Thanks to the guideline for reporters
issued yesterday,

257
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,020
it was easy to control the media.

258
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,456
Do not worry, sir.

259
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,460
I won't let them get anywhere
near you or the others, sir.

260
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,570
ZIPPY COURIER SERVICE

261
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,576
Use your fake business to catch spies

262
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,445
instead of wasting it on civilians.

263
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,448
You must've turned into a cat
without me knowing.

264
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,016
It explains your nine lives.

265
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,519
Come at me like that again

266
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,122
and that'll be the start of a war.

267
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,091
Wars don't happen so easily.

268
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,993
If a war breaks out,

269
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,228
I'll start by torching the money they have

270
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,796
in the vault.

271
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,333
But I happen to be the one
who brought over the vault makers

272
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,736
from Germany.

273
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,839
It's safe from bombs, fires,

274
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,774
and even earthquakes.

275
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,077
What will you do if I manage to open it?

276
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,013
Babble your bullshit elsewhere

277
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,116
and make a decision
regarding whether you're going to

278
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,252
be a loyal lapdog
or die trying to get smart with them.

279
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,256
If you decide to be a lapdog,

280
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,425
then I won't kick away your dog bowl.

281
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,763
I tried to just let you be,
but you're making me sick.

282
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:12,931
Why are you laughing?

283
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,834
I've never shot someone with a bob before.

284
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,571
Is this a toy?

285
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:23,942
Is it real?

286
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,179
Consider me surprised.

287
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,881
Boss, it's a real gun.

288
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,051
Make up your mind and text me.

289
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,886
I hear you so move that gun--

290
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,490
I said I got it.

291
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,939
He's dirty but in a meticulous way.

292
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,541
CLUB R GATE

293
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,443
Tomorrow at 4 p.m.,

294
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,611
the two prisoners
will head to Incheon Airport.

295
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,148
Kim Geon-yong's warrant
expires at 11:30 p.m.

296
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,350
We must crack this case before then.

297
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,821
If we get them both, we'll even find out
who ordered the hit on Congressman Park.

298
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,589
-Two birds, one stone.
-That's right.

299
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,758
We can't guarantee that he'll confess,

300
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,059
so we need a plan.

301
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,728
Don't expect me to wear
a ghillie suit like last time.

302
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,498
It's warmer outside now,
so I'll sweat to death.

303
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,467
That incident still annoys me.

304
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,635
They stopped me from going to the bathroom

305
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:24,837
and smacked me in the neck.

306
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,873
Just so you know, my neck's still sore.

307
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,408
Were you all right that day?

308
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,510
You looked like you had to go.

309
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,646
But then you were knocked out cold,

310
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,748
so I was worried
that you'd poop your pants.

311
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,750
-You have a reputation--
-Whatever!

312
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,986
Let's all focus on the meeting, shall we?

313
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,287
Darn it. Gosh, I'm full.

314
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,388
Do you have an upset stomach?

315
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,790
How about some indigestion medicine?

316
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,659
Seriously? Let's get back to our plan!

317
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,133
Listen up then.

318
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,667
With terrorists,

319
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,770
we normally bait them into
telling us the others' location.

320
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,707
We'll be putting on an act,
but it's highly effective.

321
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,175
Will someone undercover

322
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,710
try and persuade them?

323
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,044
Yes, that's the general idea.

324
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,647
It's why there's something
you need to do first.

325
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,482
Ms. Park, it'll be your job

326
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,583
to handle the prisoners.

327
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:12,985
Hello, warden.

328
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,853
This is Prosecutor Park Gyeong-seon.

329
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,788
Yes.

330
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,024
Oh, you saw me on TV?

331
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,360
I see.

332
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,296
I'm calling to confirm the identities
of the prisoners

333
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,431
that are being transferred
for an investigation.

334
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,501
What? You want us to go undercover

335
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,969
as a prisoner transport team?

336
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,605
Yes, just help me this once.

337
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:34,907
Are you kidding me?

338
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,209
If we're caught, we'll lose our badges.

339
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,311
How can we do something

340
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,779
that's completely illegal?

341
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,483
Come on, guys. Let's go back to
the old days where we went in headfirst.

342
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,585
Aren't those spirits still alive?

343
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,187
They were

344
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,056
a long, long time ago.

345
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,658
Were we like that?

346
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,360
Yes, of course. You were like that once.

347
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,463
Let's take a chance just like the old days

348
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,465
and feel proud of ourselves for once.

349
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,604
All right, Dae-yeong.
But it's a one-time thing.

350
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:06,939
Count me in too.

351
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,407
Let's do this.

352
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,072
Detective Seo, find something
to provoke the prisoners with.

353
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,373
Something brutal.

354
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,112
REPEATED DRUG TRAFFICKING IN KOREA

355
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,649
TWO COUNTS OF MURDER IN KOREA

356
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,455
For this plan to work,

357
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,057
We need someone to play
the culprit to be repatriated.

358
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,427
We have our secret weapons,
Yo-han and Songsak.

359
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,528
We can't do that.

360
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:07,032
It's an important role.
We need a good actor.

361
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,737
-I'd like to give it a try.
-You?

362
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,340
Father Han is an actor type,

363
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,643
but this is about putting on a show.

364
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,346
Do you remember

365
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,417
the old TV series called
Mom, Are You Leaving Again?

366
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,186
The show received
60 percent in ratings nationwide.

367
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,523
This one's a true brainteaser.

368
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:32,991
I can almost remember it.

369
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,994
In the final episode,
says this to his mother.

370
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,800
"Mom,

371
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,471
I won't be sad even if you leave.

372
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,107
Because

373
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,411
your happiness
equals to my happiness as well.

374
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,514
Also,

375
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,516
I'm not lonely either.

376
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:03,555
All the fun I had with you,
your voice, and even your smell.

377
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,191
I still feel them all.

378
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,431
Bye, Mom.

379
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,570
In our next life,

380
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,376
I hope we meet again as mother and son.

381
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,748
I love you, Mom."

382
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,463
And then...

383
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,232
she left.

384
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,602
She left to live with
another man in France.

385
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,772
She was such a bitch.

386
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,408
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

387
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,512
How can she so cruel to her little boy?

388
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:05,016
I yelled at her from my living room
not to leave.

389
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,084
What a bad mother.

390
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,222
Tell me about it.

391
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,691
I'm glad I never saw the series.

392
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,462
Were you the kid actor
who played that boy?

393
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,167
Are you saying that
you were the genius kid actor

394
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,136
Han U-ram?

395
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,873
Yes, that's the name I was known for.

396
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,074
No way.

397
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,843
I asked my parents
if I could have you as my brother.

398
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,378
Goodness.

399
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,647
You were such a pretty boy back then.

400
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,483
Exactly. You shined so brightly

401
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,153
like the worms in a rotten chestnut.

402
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,421
That's how you were.

403
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,191
The tears still won't stop.

404
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,994
Dae-yeong, your snot
is dripping toward your mouth.

405
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,264
Am I qualified then?

406
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,133
Still, I need you
to give me a script beforehand.

407
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,003
Don't worry about it.
I'll feed you the lines.

408
00:23:58,804 --> 00:23:59,738
Right.

409
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,040
Okay, nice.
It already feels like a success.

410
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,509
Unbelievable. Father Han...

411
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,779
-You're the best.
-Look at her all excited.

412
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,981
How can she not be
when we're doing all the work?

413
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,084
I can't stop crying either.

414
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,086
Father Han, I'm a fan.

415
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:16,822
Thank you.

416
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,626
All right. Just stick to
the scenario we rehearsed.

417
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,861
It won't be a hassle, right?

418
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,263
-What?
-What? Of course not.

419
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,632
Why am I not feeling any confidence?

420
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,034
Are your receivers all working?

421
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,870
The what?

422
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:10,942
-Yes.
-Yes.

423
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,378
Father Han, stick to the lines I tell you.

424
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:14,746
I hope you're not nervous.

425
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,414
What is there to be nervous about?

426
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,620
Father, you're already in character!

427
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,688
Can you two be just as good?

428
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,690
We're veteran detectives.

429
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,659
Yes, worry about yourself.

430
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,295
All right. That being said,

431
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,596
let's do this.

432
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,131
Let's go.

433
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,536
We can do this.

434
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,674
Come on. Over here, you idiot.

435
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,655
Our target is Anton.

436
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,293
The perp
who has dark clouds hovering above him.

437
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,028
Why is that?

438
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,096
Because we believe that Anton

439
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,898
relayed the hit order.

440
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,533
Nice.

441
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,335
His drug test came back negative

442
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,803
and he hasn't committed a serious crime.

443
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,938
What does that mean?

444
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,606
It's okay to send him loose.

445
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,041
Exactly.

446
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,910
What did you think of him?

447
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,378
He seems scary,

448
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,747
but something about him
makes him seem like ditsy.

449
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,916
You have quite the eye.

450
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,987
He's obviously stupid
and can be easily persuaded.

451
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,622
That's what we're counting on.

452
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,292
We'll send him loose and then...

453
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,661
I'll finish this first.

454
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,030
Sure thing.

455
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,171
You were fuming
when you came to my office the other day

456
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,873
because I didn't order you
mapo tofu as well.

457
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,176
-Of course not.
-As if.

458
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,345
Your eyes were darting from side to side.

459
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,047
"Is she seriously eating
the mapo tofu herself?

460
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,549
I'm hungry too!"

461
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,418
It seems like I'm right.

462
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,821
You always let your emotions show.

463
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,157
You're as transparent as a glass bead.

464
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,032
Right, eat up.
We can't operate on an empty stomach.

465
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,101
What you eat doesn't go to your waist
at that age anyway.

466
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,041
Hun-seok,
are the vault keys coming in today?

467
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,443
Yes, they'll be here in two hours.

468
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:26,978
Got it.

469
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,180
-Jang Ryong.
-Yes, Boss?

470
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,282
The Russians are being transported today,

471
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,485
so follow them to the airport

472
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,220
and see them off.

473
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,855
Yes, Boss.

474
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,792
These days, predictions for misfortune
are never wrong.

475
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,230
Boss, you seem awfully sensitive lately.

476
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,635
I feel the same way too.

477
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,996
All right. It's now game on.

478
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,398
Stay frosty.

479
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,133
Sure!

480
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,006
Why are you answering me?

481
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,075
Sure!

482
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,246
Damn it.

483
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,582
Songsak!

484
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,358
Sure.

485
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,496
Sure. All right.

486
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,198
Alright.

487
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,034
Got it. Sure thing. All right.

488
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,781
So much for an easy operation.

489
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,951
Unbelievable. You're right about that.

490
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,327
What the hell?

491
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,030
Can I have a glass of soju first?

492
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,632
I can't do this sober.

493
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,567
No can do. We don't operate intoxicated.

494
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,736
-Let's get going.
-Damn it.

495
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,547
Guys, go around and introduce yourselves.

496
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,686
I'm Han Jun-sam from Yanbian.

497
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,055
I'm Songsak from Thailand.

498
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,192
I'm Bayabat from Mongolia.

499
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,667
Father,

500
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,836
don't let them intimidate you.

501
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:05,937
Show some savagery.

502
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,306
Have you tried human flesh before?

503
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,841
You over there.

504
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,712
Have you people tried human flesh before?

505
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,084
I haven't.

506
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,587
Now cut the crap.

507
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,092
Who would eat that, right?

508
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,196
-Have you?
-Of course not.

509
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,363
It's disgusting.

510
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,339
They must've been well-off.

511
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,608
Russia isn't as poor as it used to be.

512
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,276
Gorbachev isn't the ruler anymore.

513
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,979
Gorbachev? That was decades ago.

514
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,281
Don't you know who I am?

515
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,184
Unbelievable.

516
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,352
You've watched too many movies.

517
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,088
Anyway, stay quiet until 11:30,

518
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,022
and stop yelling.

519
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,758
When that time comes
you'll be begging for mercy.

520
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,060
Just wait until I get out of here.

521
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,361
You're yelling again.

522
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,030
Do you want me to scold you?

523
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,869
Yes, Prosecutor Park.

524
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,704
What?

525
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,008
We received a tip?

526
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,346
Yes, ma'am.

527
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,551
Oh, a tip.

528
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,455
You're right. Someone did tip us off.

529
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,526
We received a tip.

530
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,444
You left the office early yesterday

531
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,913
and called in sick.

532
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,314
You seem fine though.

533
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,682
Did Mr. Kang send you?

534
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,817
I'll cut right to the chase.

535
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,620
How could you

536
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,323
let them sweep Rising Moon like that?

537
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,158
From what I hear,

538
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,527
you participated because
of the one who tried to kill you,

539
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,529
but you overreacted.

540
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,298
-I overreacted?
-Ms. Park,

541
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,666
aren't you on our side?

542
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,935
I'm not on anyone's side.

543
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,837
"Every man for himself."
That's my motto too.

544
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,409
If you keep acting the way you see fit,

545
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,111
I can no longer be of service to you.

546
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,281
Then don't. Instead, take responsibility
for the attempted murder

547
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,616
of Congressman Park.

548
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:32,750
Unbelievable.

549
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,587
Why must I take responsibility
for something I didn't do?

550
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,925
Then what about
what happened to Father Lee Yeong-jun?

551
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,095
Well,

552
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,765
if it could end with me taking the fall,
then I would.

553
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,300
However,

554
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,269
it won't.

555
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,673
Someday,

556
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,809
we'll settle this.

557
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,416
Damn.

558
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,653
What am I supposed to do with her?

559
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,521
Boss, the keys have arrived.

560
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,260
Are they good enough?

561
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,397
The operator in China
is known for forging fingerprints.

562
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,798
I'm sure they came out well.

563
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,170
I hear it's all about
printing the original well,

564
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,805
so I only hope it was done properly.

565
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,175
-No way.
-Right?

566
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,777
It's what I heard.

567
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,750
Won-mu, so what?

568
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,719
Hun-seok,

569
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,156
place your fingers on them
at the count of three.

570
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,558
One.

571
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:49,927
Two.

572
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,462
Three.

573
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,438
One of the fingerprints aren't a match.

574
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,506
What?

575
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,007
What the hell?

576
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,509
It's Director Jeong's.

577
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,310
Try it again.

578
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,016
One, two, three.

579
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,822
One of the fingerprints aren't a match.

580
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,592
Give me that! Shit.

581
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,097
What did I tell you
about using Chinese products?

582
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,500
Get it right.

583
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,240
Are things not going well, Mr. Hwang?

584
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,342
Yes, everything's a mess.

585
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,845
Actually, it's all been twisted.

586
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,981
Why don't you clear your mind

587
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,217
-and be enlightened--
-Shut it.

588
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,987
Will the welfare foundation
be approved soon?

589
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,290
I think so, but what good will that do?

590
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,791
We don't have a facility yet.

591
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,828
I don't care what you do, all right?

592
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,497
Just think of a way
to obtain a few as fast as possible.

593
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,168
I may use whatever means necessary?

594
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,807
We'll get nothing done
if we drag our feet.

595
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,044
I've been too much of a gentleman so far.

596
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,947
It's true that you were enlightened

597
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,249
by rolling in the wild.

598
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,686
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

599
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,525
The operation site is still an hour away.

600
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,360
What do we do about Jang Ryong?

601
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,662
We'll deal with him right now.

602
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,134
You always wear that thing.

603
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,835
They'll recognize you.

604
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,403
But this is all I have.

605
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,339
I knew we'd be undercover like this,

606
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,307
so I brought matching outfits.

607
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,276
Why would I dress like a couple with you?

608
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,410
It's for the operation.

609
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:47,912
Open the bag behind you.

610
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:51,516
What's this?

611
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,530
Seriously? How am I supposed to wear this?

612
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,031
It's not happening so dream on.

613
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,934
Just put in on.
Otherwise, they'll recognize you.

614
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,469
I don't want to!

615
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,237
Just put it on. Here.

616
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,406
Would you if you were in my shoes?
Get it off me.

617
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,508
Here you go. Go on.

618
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,076
I said no!

619
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,718
Shit. Are you kidding me?

620
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,954
What kind of jerk would cut us off?

621
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,255
This isn't a bumper car ride.

622
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,129
What's with the shepherd mask?

623
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,635
He's in a dog mask too.

624
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,339
Raise your hands.

625
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:52,510
You! Give me your wallets,
cell phones, and car key.

626
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,013
My wallet? Shit, am I in New York?

627
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,382
Where did the guns come from?

628
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,452
Is this good enough?

629
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,522
-What--
-Keep your hands up.

630
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,257
Okay, fine!

631
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:09,160
I gave you everything. Right?

632
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,295
I have nothing left.

633
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,731
There are no bad dogs in this world.

634
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,171
What just happened?

635
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,944
Does this make any sense?

636
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,513
-In broad daynight--
-Broad daylight.

637
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,749
Right, in broad daylight,

638
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,619
we were mugged by two men in dog masks.

639
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,821
-In Korea, no less.
-Tell me about it.

640
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,357
Do you have another phone
stashed somewhere?

641
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,291
No, sir.

642
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,326
-A spare key?
-No, sir.

643
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,895
I see. Then die, you idiots.

644
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,165
Are you seriously no better than shadows?

645
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,067
What now?

646
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,437
You're lucky that
your warrant was dismissed.

647
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,773
Warrants are only for the guilty.

648
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,677
I'll be back after I wrap up my store.

649
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,084
Detective Seo, he's on the move.

650
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,320
CRIMINAL DIVISION

651
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,323
The captain informed me
about the tip we received on Rising Moon.

652
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,627
We received a tip?

653
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,731
Yes.

654
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,638
There's information
on the drugs and other crimes?

655
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,242
Sure. Let me wrap up
what I'm doing right now.

656
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,511
I'll be there in about an hour.

657
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,980
We can roll straight from Seocho-dong.

658
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,215
Sure thing.

659
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,625
SEOUL GUDAM POLICE STATION

660
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,062
Judging by his movements,
we can safely guess he took the bait.

661
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:58,302
Yes, I was just released.
I'll be there in 20 minutes,

662
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,571
so clear out the store and our books.

663
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,407
What did I tell you?
One's face never lies.

664
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:04,575
Let's go.

665
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:17,722
Shit.

666
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,292
Unbelievable.

667
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:25,162
Must you do this
when we're already behind?

668
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,931
I ate too many steamed buns.

669
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,999
You don't want me to poop
in my pants later.

670
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,702
-Why are you still wearing that?
-I'm embarrassed.

671
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,279
I sat on it!

672
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,124
What kind of dog
takes a dump sitting like that?

673
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,763
Look at that foul little mutt.

674
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,809
Let's wrap this up quickly
and eat gamjatang.

675
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,712
Finally, we're getting a signal.
If only you hadn't pooped.

676
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,616
Gambling, an affair, or debts
won't ruin you.

677
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,419
It'll be your pooping habits
that'll make your life a living hell.

678
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,887
Why are you so cruel?

679
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,190
-Father.
-What?

680
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,159
Why are you helping
Prosecutor Park like this?

681
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:31,462
Why? Are you afraid
she'll stab us in the back?

682
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,563
That and...

683
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,833
Well, people don't change that easily.

684
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,568
Everyone should get at least one chance.

685
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,103
I gave you one, remember?

686
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:41,839
I guess you're right.

687
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,909
Even saints have pasts
and sinners have futures.

688
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,445
They should

689
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,980
get a chance to explore that,

690
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,583
and we should be generous.

691
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,720
Saying that makes you seem like a priest.

692
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,592
Detective Heo, add the pressure.

693
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,662
REPATRIATION ORDER

694
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:05,863
TWO COUNTS OF MURDER IN KOREA

695
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,532
Hey, you Russians.

696
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,569
You killed two people in Korea.

697
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,437
Each?

698
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,474
Goodness. Such monsters.

699
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,710
Won't the Russian authorities
serve the death penalty?

700
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:23,280
What are you talking about?
We didn't kill anyone.

701
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,182
There's no use in telling me.

702
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,917
Tell the Russian authorities
when you get home.

703
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,254
These papers were
sent over there this morning.

704
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,322
What?

705
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,029
Something seems wrong.

706
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,565
It's as if we're being played.

707
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,335
-What do we do?
-As if.

708
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,604
One should be punished for his crimes.

709
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,674
Papers don't lie.

710
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,345
Maybe I should tell the police
I didn't do what they think I did.

711
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,048
Shut your traps!

712
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,718
If we go to Russia like this,

713
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,553
we'll be killed.

714
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,423
Send us back to the holding cell.

715
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,059
-No.
-Don't be absurd.

716
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,761
We'll be served the death penalty.

717
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,151
Move!

718
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,421
-Please don't kill us.
-Get down.

719
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,924
Get off!

720
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,995
Get down. Kneel.

721
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,933
You two, get over here. Now!

722
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,602
Kneel!

723
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,071
Kneel too.

724
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,314
Goodbye. Anton sends his regards.

725
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,033
Hurry. Before they get up.

726
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,237
If not, I'll leave without you.

727
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,640
Come with me
if you want out of these cuffs.

728
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,043
-Wait for me.
-Me too.

729
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,523
Guys, they're gone.

730
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,095
Is that the best you could do
in terms of masks?

731
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,331
-I almost burst out laughing.
-Seriously?

732
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,434
-But you look hilarious.
-It's your fault for buying these.

733
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,903
Did you have to be so over-the-top?

734
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,740
-Is this a movie from the 80s?
-You were just as bad.

735
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,274
Detectives, you can head back now.

736
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,111
-We'll round up the fugitives.
-Sure.

737
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,979
Come on.

738
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:12,049
-I had trouble breathing in this.
-Drive.

739
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:13,684
Drive, you idiot.

740
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,658
PUMPKIN NIGHTCLUB

741
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,794
It seems to be out of business.

742
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,064
Those are where they stash
unauthorized liquor.

743
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,701
Yes, ma'am.
This feels like his base of operations.

744
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,803
Shouldn't we call for backup?

745
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:36,273
It could be over soon
if he decides to move something.

746
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,110
Right, and belated backup
is the best kind.

747
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,779
I'll head inside alone.

748
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,548
Seriously?

749
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,052
There's something going on in there,
so I can't just sit out here.

750
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,521
I see you're one of the decent ones.

751
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:51,922
Please stay in the car.

752
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,425
Forget about it. I'm coming too.

753
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,393
It could get dangerous.

754
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,228
Don't you worry.

755
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,998
I'm a phoenix, you know.

756
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,067
Bring it on.

757
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,770
Let's do this. You're all dead.

758
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,714
Hold on a second.

759
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,516
This probably leads inside.

760
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:20,851
How do you know that?

761
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,686
When I was a rookie,

762
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,888
I spent most of my time
raiding illegal nightclubs.

763
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,024
You have a lot of field experience
for someone your age.

764
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,939
Use your brain first, Detective Seo.

765
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,374
No one bothered to lock the door?

766
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:49,713
-Make sure to stay on my tail.
-Yes, Detective.

767
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,990
Hold on. Wait for me.

768
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,593
Why are you so fast?

769
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,745
Look at all that unauthorized liquor.

770
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,848
What the hell is he swinging around?

771
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,383
Hey!

772
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,585
I told you not to fool around with that.

773
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,354
It's what Chief Nam cherishes the most.

774
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,791
He goes on and on about
how a Romanian master made it.

775
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,294
Just hurry up and
clear all the ledgers upstairs.

776
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,897
We'll be done for if the police find them.

777
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,502
That seems to be the place.

778
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,541
Hey. Don't leave without telling me!

779
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,979
This is a huge place.

780
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,718
Here's where the fun begins.

781
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,021
Don't be nervous
and start questioning them.

782
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,994
Why did they try to kill you?

783
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,497
What's going on?

784
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,567
Why were those two dogs
trying to kill you?

785
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,468
Have you abused animals before?

786
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,606
We almost got caught in the crossfire,
so tell us.

787
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,708
We didn't do anything to deserve that.

788
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,778
We were just following orders.

789
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:29,880
Don't you get what's going on?

790
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,183
What's written on our files isn't true.

791
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:37,321
Could you have been
betrayed by your organization?

792
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:44,761
Turn yourself into the Korean police,

793
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,897
bargain a sentence
with the information you have,

794
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,066
and serve your time in Korea.

795
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,135
He's right. My friend's

796
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,606
serving time in a prison for foreigners,
and I hear it's nice.

797
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,076
I'm going to South America.

798
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,647
Not Russia, not Korea, but South America.

799
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:05,682
Take me with you.

800
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,018
Are you kidding me?

801
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,319
Where did that come from?

802
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,688
Tell them that South America
will be hard to smuggle into.

803
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,258
Going to South America
will be just as tough.

804
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,159
Your best chance is to stay here.

805
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,895
But we don't want to.

806
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,264
I guess this is where we part ways.

807
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,232
Why won't you people listen?

808
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,700
Why should we listen to you?

809
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,536
Shut up or you'll see blood.

810
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,247
Wait. Those look like ledgers.

811
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,884
-And those briefcases--
-I bet they have drugs inside them.

812
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:41,952
Right?

813
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,354
I can even smell the meth from here.

814
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,357
They'll probably soon move them.

815
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:51,395
-You're right.
-Right? What did I tell you?

816
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,596
What the hell?

817
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,467
Shit, that's disgusting.
He breathed into my ear.

818
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,970
How dare you. You fooled me?

819
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,638
You're a fool to have been fooled.

820
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,640
How did you know
I'm stupid and easily persuaded?

821
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,409
It's written all over your face.

822
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,479
You ladies must be quite bold
to come in here all by yourselves.

823
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,149
What does being a woman
have to do with anything?

824
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:13,483
She's right, you know.

825
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,054
-Get them.
-We should leave.

826
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,288
I'll be right behind you.

827
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,690
No, I can't leave you.

828
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,292
At least one should make it out
for the investigation to continue.

829
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:23,393
But...

830
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:25,729
Get out of here, ma'am.

831
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,699
I've hit a dead end.

832
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,437
-Get out of here!
-But...

833
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,372
Stay safe, all right?

834
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,840
Damn it.

835
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,949
Let me introduce you
to a detective I know.

836
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,517
He'll clear your names.

837
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:48,685
And why would I trust you?

838
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,254
Damn, they're stubborn.

839
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,824
They're not as stubborn as you though.

840
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,327
Hush, doggy.

841
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,164
Songsak, if they don't take the offer,
just put them down.

842
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:08,472
I mean, shoulder. My shoulder.

843
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,208
Darn.

844
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,412
Wait!

845
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:18,415
You'd rather die?

846
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:30,994
What about your mothers?

847
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:35,899
Mine's gone.

848
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,834
I don't know where she is.

849
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:39,936
However,

850
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,639
I earned money every way possible
so that I can make her happy one day.

851
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,575
Your mothers are probably back at home.

852
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,178
Shouldn't you clear your names,
serve time,

853
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,548
and go back home to take care of them?

854
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,254
All right.

855
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,223
Now go for the jugular.

856
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:03,627
Is that what I think it is?

857
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,167
I was eight

858
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,804
when I last saw my mother.

859
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:16,907
This is what I said.

860
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,409
"Mom,

861
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,880
I won't be sad even if you leave.

862
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,616
Because

863
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,121
your happiness
equals to my happiness as well.

864
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,758
Also,

865
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,494
I'm not lonely either.

866
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,697
All the fun I had with you,

867
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,400
your voice, and even your smell.

868
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,104
I still feel them all.

869
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,008
Bye, Mom.

870
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:54,945
In our next life"

871
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:58,215
Mother!

872
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,551
"I hope we meet again as mother and son."

873
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,389
Mother!

874
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,891
"I love you, Mom."

875
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:16,833
Mother...

876
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,250
Mom...

877
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,461
Doesn't it always make you cry?

878
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,330
Mom...

879
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,104
Why the hell do you have that on?

880
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:57,841
I don't want you to see me crying.

881
00:52:58,408 --> 00:52:59,976
You're a lunatic, you know that?

882
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,255
No, wait. Gosh.

883
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,225
Shit.

884
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,795
Right, why would I sacrifice myself?

885
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,298
I'm Park Gyeong-seon.
Snap out of it and go.

886
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,668
We should go before the cops get here.

887
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,585
Ms. Park, why did you come back?

888
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,520
Could you have run off on your own?

889
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,856
The thought of it just felt too iffy.

890
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:20,957
Gosh, this is heavy.

891
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,827
You're all dead.

892
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:29,232
My fury has gone up five points.

893
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,179
Are you ready? Go.

894
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,319
What the hell?

895
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,066
Ms. Park?

896
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:05,902
Detective Seo?

897
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,174
-You guys are the best. Take them.
-Yes, sir.

898
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,355
Did you know that Mr. Kang
ordered a hit out on me?

899
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,124
Mr. Kang did what?

900
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,627
Shit.

901
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,963
If you had known,
you wouldn't have let him do it.

902
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,667
Cheol-beom,
don't plan some idiotic revenge

903
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,436
and let's go back to being good friends.

904
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,871
We're all too sensitive at the moment.

905
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,707
What the hell?

906
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,442
It's Director Jeong's.

907
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,311
You crossed the line with Mr. Kang too.

908
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,582
I've been doing my best not to.

909
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,884
I'll call another group meeting,

910
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,220
so let's reorganize.

911
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,802
We will over drinks.

912
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,045
What happened to your thumb?

913
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,214
This?

914
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,984
I touched the wrong machine
at the factory yesterday

915
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:29,552
and burned my skin.

916
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,588
Until it regenerates,

917
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,124
I won't be able to open the vault.

918
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:38,194
-Where's Hwang Cheol-beom?
-You can't go in there.

919
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,462
What the hell?

920
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:40,897
Hwang Cheol-beom,

921
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,767
you are under arrest for
solicitation of murder.

922
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,247
The warrant doesn't expire
for another three minutes.

923
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,282
We all know you have nothing.

924
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,017
We're leaving.

925
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,819
Just you wait and see.

926
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,255
I'll have all of your badges!

927
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:08,658
Where do you think you're going?

928
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:12,595
LET OUR WARM HEARTS BE YOUR HANDS AND FEET

929
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:15,765
We still have three minutes.

930
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:22,739
Anton,

931
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:26,409
who ordered the hit on Congressman Park?

932
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,185
Also,

933
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,555
who ordered the hit on me,
the beautiful Prosecutor Park?

934
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,096
There's still one more left.

935
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,806
Who is the one
that ordered you to kill someone?

936
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:10,553
My goodness. It just turned 11:30 p.m.

937
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,995
Hold on.

938
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:21,664
What the hell?

939
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,967
What do you think you're doing?

940
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,303
Lower your arms. Stop pointing.

941
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,807
Why are you yelling at us
for arresting suspects?

942
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:34,544
You can't arrest them
without proper cause...

943
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,651
Hold on. Where did you get that sword?

944
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,454
I got lucky.

945
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,462
All right, Chief Nam.
Let's send you to prison too!

946
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,423
