1
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,719
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,821
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,857
Come here. Who told you to do this?

4
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,892
Mr. Oh, the loan shark.

5
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,961
Now you prey on innocent senior citizens?

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,063
Father, you must listen to what God says.

7
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,766
You're a priest. Why are you so impatient?

8
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,367
Is there anything we can do?

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,236
I need to leave here to get released?

10
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,538
Welcome back.

11
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,040
Why did you accept me?

12
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:43,076
Stay out of trouble and behave yourself.

13
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,144
Hey, you!

14
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,745
How dare you eat bread during Mass?

15
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,247
What's wrong with the priest?

16
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,848
You're going to attack
the Exit Three Gang.

17
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,950
-Are you coming too?
-I'm also in the violent crime squad.

18
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,253
Receive your punishment.

19
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,323
Did you apologize to your colleagues
and ask for forgiveness?

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,224
No.

21
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,160
Go and sincerely ask
for their forgiveness.

22
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,061
You can go now.

23
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,328
But Father.

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,265
Isn't it against the church rules?

25
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,101
Putting holy water on your forehead
won't automatically get you to heaven.

26
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,236
I'll let you off today.

27
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,238
Because you're so freaking handsome.

28
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,340
Let's keep some common sense
and reason in our minds, okay?

29
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,145
-Let's go.
-The priest abandoned us!

30
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,180
No, I didn't.

31
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,115
Oh, God Almighty!

32
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,851
Why does it thunder now?

33
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,056
You asshole!

34
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,759
Get off of me!

35
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,227
Let go of me!

36
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,162
-Get off of me!
-You crazy bastards.

37
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,530
-Come here.
-Damn it.

38
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,771
Let him go.

39
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,839
Let him go.

40
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,742
What?

41
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,612
What?

42
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,549
What?

43
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,062
Don't sin.

44
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,201
Let go of him first.

45
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,981
I was wondering who it was.
You're the new priest.

46
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,283
I was wondering who it was. You're the one

47
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,484
that was sitting in the center.

48
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,987
This is between us locals,
so keep walking.

49
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,089
I'm a local as of yesterday.

50
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,324
Who are you to tell me to keep walking?

51
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,560
Are you okay, Mr. Hwang?

52
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,928
Do I look okay to you?

53
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,630
Are you a police officer?

54
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,131
Yes, I am.

55
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,034
Then you can't just sit back and watch
people getting stomped!

56
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:49,836
Gosh.

57
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,475
Where did he come from?

58
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,712
Move it.

59
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,284
-Do you go to church?
-No, I'm Buddhist.

60
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,755
-What about you?
-I've been to church once.

61
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,792
Were you calling out for God
after only going once?

62
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,527
Well, you happened to be walking by.

63
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,697
Do you know how awkward
this is for me because of you?

64
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,532
I'm caught in a mess again!

65
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,334
-Gosh.
-Should I call 911?

66
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,837
Who else would you call?

67
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,906
Stop being ridiculous.

68
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,708
Move it.

69
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,912
What happened to you? Who did this?

70
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,081
Mr. Hwang did.

71
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,317
He stapled my forehead with a huge stapler

72
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,019
for not selling land for a cheap price.

73
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,188
Look, Mr. Seo.

74
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,224
Stop lying.

75
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,460
This isn't under the best circumstances,

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,229
but I'm Hwang Cheol-beom.

77
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,733
Are you the local thug?

78
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,502
A thug? Me?

79
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,339
I don't see anyone
that looks like a thug here.

80
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,910
Everyone looks like
they belong at the police station.

81
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,181
You're not being very nice.

82
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,985
Why don't you go
when I'm being nice as a believer?

83
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,388
I'm so scared I'm pissing my pants.

84
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,857
I should get going.

85
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,192
Father Han?

86
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,298
I have all of you on camera.

87
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,667
Don't get caught on my radar
doing anything stupid.

88
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,238
State your name and rank.

89
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,107
Detective Gu Dae-yeong
of Gudam Police Station.

90
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,743
You aren't getting promoted,
since you don't do your job.

91
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,411
Gosh.

92
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,180
Let's go.
Go to the hospital if you need to.

93
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,450
-Move out of my way.
-Let's go.

94
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,721
Can he see I missed out on promotions?

95
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,123
Who does he think he is?

96
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,791
Detective Gu.

97
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,627
Set up some boundaries.

98
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,095
Okay.

99
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,031
Why do you always look upset

100
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,900
whenever I talk to you?

101
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,070
Is it still about what happened back then?

102
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,306
No, of course not.

103
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,341
Then smile.

104
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,578
Those people...

105
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,417
You have an extraordinary way
of talking to people.

106
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,585
I beat people down with my mouth.

107
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,822
Hwang whatever-his-name-was
is a gangster, right?

108
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,557
Yes, I think so.

109
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,859
Although his official title
is CEO of a company.

110
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,562
Priest Lee should be pickier.

111
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,030
He accepts everyone.

112
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
The church is open to everyone,

113
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,500
all sinners.

114
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,069
I wish we could

115
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,071
disqualify or suspend believers.

116
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,107
Isn't that against God's will?

117
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,711
Who knows what God's will is?

118
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,479
What?

119
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,348
NO ENTRY

120
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,055
-Sir.
- Hi.

121
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,224
What brings you here?

122
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,460
I went hiking nearby

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,661
and stopped by.

124
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,895
I see.

125
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,798
I'll take you to an amazing
duck stew restaurant.

126
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,734
It's okay, I have plans.

127
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,203
I came to give you this.

128
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,306
Here you go.

129
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,942
CEO Kim of Hanju Group
gave me some Korean traditional cookies,

130
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,112
but it was too much,
so I brought you half.

131
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,047
Oh, I see.

132
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,549
It would be weird to give it to you
at work.

133
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:24,884
That's why I came here.

134
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,753
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

135
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,556
Make sure you don't get sick eating it.

136
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,259
Chew it thoroughly. Got it?

137
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,628
Yes, sir. Thank you. Drive safely.

138
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,196
You're welcome. Bye.

139
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,233
Goodbye.

140
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:01,254
Why is my heart racing
when I'm opening a box of cookies?

141
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,672
Wow.

142
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,076
My gosh.

143
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,746
It's exactly half.

144
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,160
What's this? Why do I feel disgusted,

145
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,796
yet so confident?

146
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,404
SEOUL GUDAM POLICE STATION

147
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,708
Hello.

148
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,846
-I want jjamppong!
-There's only one jjamppong.

149
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,847
This is mine!

150
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,548
Right or left!

151
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,050
You get jjajangmyeon.

152
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,118
-Have a seat.
-There's another one here.

153
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,286
That's tangsuyuk sauce.

154
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,188
Have jjajangmyeon.

155
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,859
All right.

156
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,695
Detective Gu, have you closed that case?

157
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,963
Yes.

158
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,232
Since you've all been complaining
about being understaffed,

159
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,867
we have a rookie. Say hello.

160
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,536
Hello, I'm Seo Seung-a.

161
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,804
It's nice to meet you.

162
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,607
You look like a suspect, not a detective.

163
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,275
What are you good at?

164
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,378
I was on the Sepaktakraw National Team.

165
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,814
I'm good at kicking criminals faces

166
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,415
with my scissor kick.

167
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,487
You've had a rough life,
unlike your looks.

168
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,290
Can I introduce myself?

169
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,825
That won't be necessary.

170
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,764
Your sketch looks like crap
And you have no conscience

171
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm staring at you with my evil eyes

172
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,070
The blanket you'll end up with
Is the blanket of justice

173
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,972
I caught you

174
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,608
I'm the light of the world!

175
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,287
I see.

176
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,689
Of course.

177
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,759
We need to choose her partner.

178
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,034
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

179
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,736
Hey, wait.

180
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,371
Oh, that's right.

181
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,340
Nice to meet you, sir!

182
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,759
Turn faster!

183
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,930
-Faster.
-Faster.

184
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,865
-Faster.
-Faster.

185
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,100
You're here, Father.

186
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,468
-How have you been?
-Good.

187
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,008
I don't know how long I'll be here,

188
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,710
but let's be good friends while I am.

189
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,347
Father Lee lied.

190
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,282
About what?

191
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,986
He said the new priest is very handsome.

192
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,224
That's what I always hear.

193
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,794
You aren't ugly,
but you have big nostrils.

194
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,297
That's because you're looking at me
from below.

195
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,369
I look much better from here, right?

196
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,071
-Father.
-Yes?

197
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,108
I think you have lettuce in your teeth.

198
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,280
Come here, you little rascals!

199
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,944
Throw it, you idiot!

200
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,312
I heard there are children.

201
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,915
-There are no children!
-We need to check.

202
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,583
I already checked, you idiot!

203
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,318
Do you want to die? Throw it right now!

204
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,187
Throw the grenade, you idiot!

205
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,268
Father, are you okay?

206
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:48,894
Are you really okay?

207
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,063
Yes, I'm fine.

208
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,702
Here you are.

209
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,772
You almost missed him.

210
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,774
This is Father Kim Hae-il.

211
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,777
Hi, I'm Bae Hui-jeong.

212
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,978
Hello.

213
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,980
I'll be inside.

214
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,448
All right.

215
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,686
I was inspired by your sermon today.

216
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,322
It was nothing but thank you.

217
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,792
I'm sorry, but I'm running late.

218
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,662
BAE HUI-JEONG PSYCHIATRY

219
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,665
You can visit me whenever you're free.

220
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,033
Excuse me?

221
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,002
See you next Sunday, Father.

222
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,438
-Please take good care of him.
-Of course.

223
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,581
Have a talk with Dr. Bae.

224
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,051
You can open up to her.

225
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,288
I don't need help.

226
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,291
How would you know that?
You aren't a doctor.

227
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,294
All I need is to pray, meditate
and have soju with you.

228
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,997
If you catch a cold,

229
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,865
do you go to the hospital or pray?

230
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:00,966
I pray.

231
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,768
I prayed even when my appendix burst.

232
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,639
Some things don't work by praying.

233
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,474
-I don't want to go.
-Wait.

234
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,445
It's this old man's wish.

235
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,014
Give it a try.

236
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,383
I'll beg you like this.

237
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,452
-What are you doing?
-My kneecaps...

238
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,155
All right, I'll go. So get up.

239
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,225
Do you promise?

240
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,193
Thank you.

241
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,137
I fell for it.

242
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,773
I always let that old man
get the better of me.

243
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,182
What happened
at the groundbreaking ceremony?

244
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,884
-Look.
-Yes, sir.

245
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,286
Why are you being so sloppy lately?

246
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,422
Are you trying to tell everyone
you're a gangster?

247
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,959
I took care of it. Don't worry.

248
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,962
When will you get rid
of those lousy habits?

249
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,130
I'm sorry, sir.

250
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,100
I'll try my best to lose my old habits.

251
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,234
Gudam Cathedral.

252
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,236
How are the welfare facilities going?

253
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,672
I'm pushing for it.

254
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,375
You said you'd settle it
within a month. What happened?

255
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,078
The property belongs to a priest.

256
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,280
It isn't easy because he isn't a nobody.

257
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,183
That's why I had
Mr. Hwang take care of it.

258
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,486
Do what thugs do
like you have always done.

259
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,556
The most urgent matter

260
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,691
is Gudam Cathedral.

261
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,628
-Look, Mr. Hwang.
-Yes?

262
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,230
Get this settled.

263
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,633
-I'll move faster.
-Listen.

264
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,869
If you mess this up,

265
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,839
don't plan on making a living in Gudam-gu.

266
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,110
Yes, sir. I'm sorry for concerning you.

267
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,153
This one.

268
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,162
Welcome.

269
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,675
You were eating bread, right?

270
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,346
Did you know eating is not allowed
during Mass?

271
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,214
Yes, I did.

272
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,084
Did you know you can be banned from church
if you get caught eating?

273
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,853
-Yes, I did.
-Then why...

274
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,157
Then why were you eating?

275
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,959
Why did you eat something that big?

276
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,696
Father, I can't hear on an empty stomach.

277
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,899
I can't hear what you're saying.

278
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,901
What does an empty stomach
have to do with hearing?

279
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,404
It's true, I swear. I swear to God.

280
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,940
Did you just swear?

281
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,811
Still, how could you?
Don't ever eat in Mass again.

282
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,480
Don't eat even if you can't hear.

283
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,250
Don't just nod. Answer me.

284
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,752
Okay.

285
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,970
You must live near the cathedral.

286
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,173
Would I be dressed like this if I didn't?

287
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,377
Is it okay for a priest
to drink that much?

288
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,713
I'm saving it for later.

289
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,515
Yes, right.

290
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,283
Oh,

291
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,786
I'd like to go to confession
to you next week.

292
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,856
My job puts reformation
and rehabilitation first.

293
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:44,756
I decline.

294
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,860
My job is to judge and convict sinners.

295
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,230
What kind of priest are you,
so prickly all the time?

296
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,704
He's so hot even from up close.

297
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,205
I should've put some makeup on.

298
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,707
What was that?

299
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,844
Look,

300
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,847
act tough somewhere else. Got it?

301
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,228
Geez, I didn't expect that.

302
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,987
-What are you doing?
-What?

303
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,224
One of the kids

304
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,093
threw away a treasured toy

305
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,763
as she was throwing trash away.

306
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,565
It's a small toy rabbit.

307
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,369
She is bawling that she lost something
her dad bought her.

308
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,572
I promised to find it for her.

309
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,474
That's why you're going through
the recyclables?

310
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,476
What else can I do?

311
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,814
Tell her dad to buy her another one.

312
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,417
Her dad

313
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,719
went to heaven

314
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,623
in a car accident two months ago.

315
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
I understand she's sad,

316
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,066
but this is too much.

317
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,803
This is what a priest is supposed to do.

318
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,007
I find precious things people have lost.

319
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,110
I help the found item

320
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,380
give soul peace.

321
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,088
I don't believe this.

322
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,891
Forget it.

323
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,393
Go in and sleep.

324
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,230
I don't want to give you
an excuse to nag at me later.

325
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,798
Right?

326
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,136
This would be enough
for me to nag at you for a year.

327
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,575
I found it.

328
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,310
Is this the toy rabbit?

329
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,914
Yes, it is.

330
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,984
This is it! We found it!

331
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,723
Cleaning up will take ages.

332
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,659
Gosh.

333
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,861

334
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,195
He's being falsely charged.

335
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,198
Our artist was just at the party.

336
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,801
CEO Kim's son's party.

337
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,836
How could you accuse him
of distributing drugs?

338
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,808
I heard he admitted to it at your house.

339
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,077
That's because he was scared.

340
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,079
Also,

341
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,515
isn't this a coercive investigation?

342
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,318
I won't let you get away with this.

343
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,020
I'll get help from big law firms and...

344
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,121
Listen.

345
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,794
Big Pig Entertainment's...
What's your name?

346
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,829
President Park Jae-beom?

347
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,264
Yes.

348
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,599
Coercive investigation?

349
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,402
Big law firms?

350
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:23,275
You seem quite determined.

351
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,411
It's very annoying.

352
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,383
Would you like to go to court

353
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,118
along with that singer at your agency?

354
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,589
I could dig up dirt on you

355
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,858
if that's what you want.

356
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,994
I wasn't trying to annoy you.

357
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,564
I'm very annoyed.
It's the worst feeling I've had this year.

358
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,631
What?

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,769
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

360
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,171
You wouldn't be losing

361
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,840
if you shut up and accepted the situation.

362
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,743
You'd be learning how to lose.

363
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,912
You have to learn how to lose

364
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,681
to survive longer.

365
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,054
That's enough of your rash behavior.

366
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,722
Get going within five seconds.

367
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,167
I haven't had anything to eat yet.

368
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:29,040
Can you order me a jjamppong rice,
Ms. Seo?

369
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,509
I feel like something greasy.

370
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,344
Me too.

371
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,180
I'll order two jjamppong rice,
one jjajangmyeon.

372
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,581
Fried dumplings on the house.

373
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,320
All right. This is the main area
we have jurisdiction over.

374
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,756
-Watch closely.
-Okay.

375
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,360
This is Chinatown.

376
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,830
There are many good restaurants.

377
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,603
The lamb skewers at this place
are to die for.

378
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,874
-Let's get off here.
-Okay.

379
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,978
CHINATOWN

380
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,052
What's over there?
The sign is in a foreign language.

381
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,555
There?

382
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,290
That's the Russians' turf.

383
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,861
There's something you should keep in mind.

384
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,030
Don't ever go there alone.

385
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,799
It's very dangerous.

386
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,168
They don't go easy on cops.

387
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,637
They can stab you and run away on a boat.

388
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,374
That sounds exciting.

389
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,910
Then you must not go there alone, either.

390
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,079
Of course, I do.

391
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,215
Do you know who they're most terrified of?

392
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,885
Do you have a mean punch?

393
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,119
Sign up for funeral service

394
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,522
if you're going to fight me.

395
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,526
It sounds like you're bluffing.

396
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,962
Spending time with a legend,

397
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,663
you could experience cognitive dissonance.

398
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,601
I hope we get our hands
on a bad guy today.

399
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,669
I haven't kicked anyone for a long time.

400
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,672
CHINATOWN

401
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,311
Why is she kicking suddenly?

402
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,580
I have a bad feeling about this.

403
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,752
It's Pororo!

404
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,388
I love playing too.

405
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,092
Don't say a word

406
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,361
-and stay put.
-Father.

407
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,829
It's okay.

408
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,632
Welcome.

409
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,467
Are you here for cookies?

410
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,403
Why do you always offer me cookies?

411
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,840
Is that your way of swearing?

412
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,742
"Have some cookies".

413
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:44,843
Is that it?

414
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,278
-Stop it.
-Oh, no.

415
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,713
Please don't do this.

416
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,881
How dare you!

417
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,520
Please don't do this.
You're wasting good food.

418
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,922
This is the last time

419
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,623
I'm warning you.

420
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,126
I'm going to sit here all day

421
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,194
and beat everyone who comes here up.

422
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,230
Please don't do this.

423
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,532
What did we do wrong?

424
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:08,867
I'll tell you.

425
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,902
You didn't listen to my boss.

426
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,270
Stop this.

427
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,073
You're sinning by doing this.

428
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,309
Then send me to hell!

429
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,577
Oh, no.

430
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,978
Do you want me to send you to hell?

431
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,982
Go away, Michael.

432
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,252
You're the punk of a priest
we saw yesterday.

433
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,520
Let's take this outside.

434
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,322
Don't, Michael.

435
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,390
Why?

436
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,792
Are you going to beat me up?

437
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,928
I'll use your face to wipe
the entrance to the cathedral.

438
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,398
No.

439
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,535
Priests know how to bluff nowadays.

440
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,770
All right, let's take it outside.

441
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,840
-Come on.
-I told you to stop.

442
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,008
Do you need to pray?

443
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,776
Are you religious?

444
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,911
Stay here, Father.

445
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,280
They're trash that isn't even recyclable.

446
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,349
-Come on.
-Trash?

447
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,617
Stop right there!

448
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,453
Detective Seo, let's just go.

449
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,322
What's that?

450
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,192
Are you a rapper?

451
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,361
Wait right there.

452
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,163
What are you doing here?

453
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:15,834
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

454
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,270
They always come and harass us.

455
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,573
Today, they even hurt the head priest.

456
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,275
Last time, they...

457
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,983
Is this cute girl a rookie?

458
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,186
I need you to come with me.

459
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,791
If you're a rookie, act like one.

460
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:44,229
You have no idea what's going on, do you?

461
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,025
We shouldn't let people like Mr. Hwang
come to church.

462
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,662
You didn't learn anything.

463
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,599
What kind of church
discriminates believers?

464
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,068
Do you think people like that

465
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,637
would repent and follow God
if they come to church?

466
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,739
How dare you, in front of the cross!

467
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:33,578
Even if they don't change,
it's our job and calling

468
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,280
to wait until they do change.

469
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,148
Most people don't change even if we wait.

470
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,483
Why do we have to live like that?

471
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,385
Do you think this will change the world?

472
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,686
Get angry when it's necessary.

473
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,121
There are others

474
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,223
that change the world by getting angry.

475
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,227
We are to change the world in our way.

476
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:50,995
How?

477
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,765
We make bad guys feel good
by blessing them.

478
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,102
Blessing isn't something
you give out like candy.

479
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,739
It's the medicine that will warm
their cold hearts.

480
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:01,740
We should wait.

481
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,142
Why do you ask me to wait?
Waiting isn't everything!

482
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,277
I didn't lead you to become a priest

483
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,179
to fight against the world stubbornly.

484
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:12,450
I hoped you would embrace others
with your pain.

485
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:13,952
My pain?

486
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,689
Hae-il.

487
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,825
Get rid of your hate and pain

488
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,461
and save others. That's your job.

489
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:29,868
No, I'll remove scumbags
and protect good people.

490
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,904
That's my job as a priest.

491
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,656
Name?

492
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:53,925
Jang Ryong.

493
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,028
You moron. Your real name.

494
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,704
Do you think this is funny?

495
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,308
You're happy for someone
who has a purple cheek.

496
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,911
What can I do when it's funny?

497
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,582
Come here.

498
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,185
I'll slap your right cheek
to match the left one.

499
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,252
Detective Seo.

500
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:23,922
Let them go.

501
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,490
Excuse me?

502
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,159
They were harassing people
at the cathedral, including myself.

503
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,227
Come on.

504
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,996
When will you solve real cases
if you're tied down with them?

505
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,198
-Mr. Lee!
-Quiet.

506
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,966
Hurry up and uncuff me.

507
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,636
Thank you, Mr. Punishment.

508
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,573
-Don't bring that up--
-Have you heard of it?

509
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,074
Okay.

510
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,111
I'll see you again, hip hop girl.

511
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,715
Keep a helmet on.

512
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,550
You don't know when I'll kick you.

513
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,222
You should wear a bulletproof vest.

514
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,423
You never know...

515
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,759
when you might get stabbed.

516
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,563
-Why that...
-Leave it alone.

517
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,265
Hey.

518
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,069
It's her first day here.
Go out for a team dinner.

519
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,837
Thank you.

520
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,176
What do you want?
I know a great tripe restaurant.

521
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,847
-Mr. Hwang!
-Yes.

522
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,249
Is this the best you can do?

523
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,619
I told you to solve it
and you made a bigger mess!

524
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,987
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,155
Don't be sloppy
and make sure you take care of it.

526
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,557
You heard the Congressman.

527
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,025
If you don't take care of this,

528
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,094
don't plan to make a living here!

529
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:48,640
Hun-seok,

530
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,910
do you believe in God?

531
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,748
Will we really go to hell

532
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,350
if we sin too much?

533
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,125
Never mind.

534
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:08,860
Even if I go to hell,

535
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,729
it'll be okay if I'm the boss there.
Am I right?

536
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,458
That troublemaker...

537
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,114
THIS IS GUDAM POLICE STATION
THE OFFENDER WAS RELEASED

538
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,216
PLEASE GIVE US A CALL
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

539
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,899
I've emptied my stomach.
I have to stuff it with food.

540
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,901
This was it.

541
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,537
Mr. Punishment of Gudam Station.

542
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,741
Why are you watching that?

543
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,710
I heard the Gudam Station

544
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,078
Exit Three Gang got you.

545
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,881
The life of a detective

546
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,450
-means all kinds of--
-Mr. Gu.

547
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,185
All kinds of what?

548
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,787
This is just embarrassing.

549
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,391
I was wondering
why you were so scared of them.

550
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,660
Detective Seo.

551
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,028
Each area has--

552
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,129
Where did they go?

553
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,734
I asked where they are!

554
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,204
They were let off with a warning.

555
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,440
What? Why?

556
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,476
It wasn't anything serious.

557
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,911
It was just a small incident.

558
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,680
A small incident?

559
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,283
How is threatening a priest
and damaging property

560
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,350
a small incident?

561
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,886
Then should I request for a warrant
for this?

562
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,155
Of course you should.
It shouldn't end just with a warning!

563
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,257
You're a priest. Don't yell at me.

564
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,360
I was an idiot to have trusted...

565
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,430
Actually, I never trusted you.

566
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,866
It's just as I expected.

567
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,073
Excuse me, Father!

568
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,842
Put the water purifier back together!

569
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:11,843
No!

570
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,311
I don't like you!

571
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,681
What is wrong with that priest?

572
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,484
I'm leaving.
Let's have that team dinner later.

573
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,854
Where are you going?
You promised to have dinner.

574
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,123
Tripe.

575
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:26,991
Detective Seo!

576
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,761
It's precious tripe they only sell
until they run out for the day!

577
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,156
Hello?

578
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,858
What is it at this hour?

579
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:04,962
Right now?

580
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,245
It's the same here
as where you used to be, right?

581
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,614
No, it's totally different.

582
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,650
Everything sucks worse

583
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,619
and is more embarrassing.

584
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,490
Why do you let bad guys step all over you?

585
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,261
Sir.

586
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,899
Do you know the first rule
of firefighters?

587
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,269
Yes, it's to save people's lives.

588
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,805
Save people's lives.

589
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,874
-Check it out!
-No.

590
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,849
It's to keep yourself safe.

591
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,784
I see.

592
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,687
Then why are you a police officer?

593
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,322
You should become a firefighter.

594
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,493
You can't get rid of bad guys.

595
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:43,828
What?

596
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,431
If I could get rid of them
by sacrificing myself,

597
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,200
I would have given myself up.

598
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,470
But that's not how it works.

599
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,839
Give them what you can.

600
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,243
Save yourself.

601
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,414
Just make sure the world keeps turning.

602
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,018
That's what realistic cops do.

603
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:12,390
Realistic cop? Bullshit.

604
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,464
I'm leaving.

605
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,935
This is embarrassing.

606
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,325
Anyone other than Korean citizens
are considered the enemy.

607
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,093
It's okay to shoot them down. Okay?

608
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,875
Heat it up.

609
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,043
Don't skip breakfast.

610
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,219
There you are.

611
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,757
-What is it?
-Father Lee missed morning Mass

612
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,560
and I can't get a hold of him.

613
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:35,599
VIOLENT CRIME SQUAD

614
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,776
This is Detective Gu Dae-yeong,
violent crime squad, Gudam Police Station.

615
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,881
What?

616
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,050
The phone has been turned off.

617
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,151
Gosh.

618
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,724
The phone has been turned off.

619
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,194
His phone is still turned off.

620
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,496
Where did he go?

621
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,700
When did you last see him last night?

622
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,802
When he went to bed.

623
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,472
He wouldn't go anywhere
without telling us.

624
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,106
The phone has been turned off.

625
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,387
What is it?

626
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,051
Next, I have some sad news.

627
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,253
Father Lee of Gudam Cathedral

628
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,755
was found dead

629
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,457
at the bottom of a cliff.

630
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,360
The police assume it was suicide,

631
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,895
but a suicide note

632
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,964
hasn't been found at the site.

633
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:22,700
He was an honorable man and--

634
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,373
Hail Mary, full of Grace.

635
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,777
The Lord is with thee.

636
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,516
No!

637
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,969
No, this can't be true.

638
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,437
Wait.

639
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,306
No.

640
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,189
It can't be suicide.

641
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,626
That is what the circumstances suggest.

642
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,695
He even left his shoes on the rock.

643
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,997
Someone else could have put them there.

644
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,166
Then you're saying it's a homicide.

645
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,902
Who would kill Father Lee?

646
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,871
What about Hwang Cheol-beom's men?

647
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,206
They could have held a grudge.

648
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,142
They are nothing.

649
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,610
They were just playing around.

650
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,211
Then why would he commit suicide?

651
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,614
He ate well and went to bed happily.

652
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,748
He has no motive.

653
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,550
I'm sorry to say this,

654
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,153
but sometimes no one senses the motives

655
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,387
and it happens out of the blue.

656
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,723
He's lived for God and others
his whole life.

657
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,658
He's stronger than anyone I know.

658
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,094
Suicide is one of the greatest sins
to Catholics.

659
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,663
You think Father Lee would have
committed such a sin?

660
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,799
There might be something
you don't know about.

661
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,433
I told you there isn't!

662
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,736
Why do you keep yelling?

663
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,805
I officially request for an investigation.

664
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,807
Check all the traffic and security cameras

665
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:53,043
along the path Father Lee
would have taken from the cathedral.

666
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,345
I also want an autopsy done.

667
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,181
It needs to satisfy certain requirements

668
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,149
for an investigation.

669
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,385
It isn't easy to look through the CCTVs.

670
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,388
We can't investigate this to comfort you.

671
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,556
Also,

672
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,224
we can't get a warrant for an autopsy.

673
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,099
Look.

674
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,868
The bruises under both armpits

675
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,736
are identical in size and shape.

676
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,239
It doesn't make sense

677
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,174
that he got them as he fell off the cliff.

678
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,242
How would that happen?

679
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,545
I saw this when I studied bruises.

680
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,414
When someone grabs a person
before he dies...

681
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,919
To be exact, this happens

682
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,188
when the blood is flowing
right before a person dies.

683
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,626
That means he was moved
when he was still alive.

684
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,162
Think about the path.

685
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,333
There are rocks of various sizes
to the top.

686
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,268
It would be hard for even
a young man to reach it.

687
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:52,903
Do you think it's possible

688
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,239
for an old man with bad joints
to get there by himself?

689
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,908
There are many reasons
he could have gotten the bruises

690
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,410
and even people with bad knees
can go up that path.

691
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,045
So don't come up with wild ideas.

692
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,348
That's why I'm asking for an autopsy.

693
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:12,222
What do you think you're doing?

694
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,292
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

695
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,398
There are always unexpected accidents.

696
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,135
Don't side with him!

697
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,104
That won't solve this problem.

698
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:30,007
The church wants
an investigation and autopsy.

699
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:32,976
This could blow up bigger than we thought.

700
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,579
If we can't handle this,

701
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,714
we might have to give up on all our plans.

702
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,418
I'll take responsibility

703
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,253
and come up with something.

704
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,688
How would we trust you?

705
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,963
I'll risk my life to solve this.

706
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,232
Do you have a plan?

707
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,433
Yes.

708
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,603
In exchange, I'd like to ask

709
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,371
those of you here
for a bigger slice of the pie.

710
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,974
-Are you sure you can do this?
-Yes.

711
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,645
If you can succeed in this,

712
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,380
you can get whatever you want.

713
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,150
Let's hear your plan first.

714
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:14,985
However,

715
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,387
you need to do a clean job.

716
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,156
Yes, sir.

717
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,992
You, boy, are connected to my soul.

718
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,195
So wherever you go and whatever happens,

719
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,063
we are destined to meet again.

720
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:03,200
This is what a priest is supposed to do.

721
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:07,437
I find precious things people have lost.

722
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,298
Hae-il,

723
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,635
you seem to be getting a drink by yourself

724
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,505
and I didn't want to disturb you,
so I'm writing you a note.

725
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,743
I'm sorry for yelling at you
earlier today.

726
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,580
I know all about your pain.

727
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,849
I've aged,

728
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,486
but I haven't changed.

729
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,757
You're the first to hear this,

730
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,927
but I often get very angry.

731
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,329
It happens several times a day.

732
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,967
The reason I hold it in

733
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,337
is that I don't like it when it lingers.

734
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:17,908
A priest's anger should be

735
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,011
about the world and others,

736
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,948
but your anger

737
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,384
is still about yourself.

738
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,786
Nevertheless,

739
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:34,391
I believe you'll get angry
for the right reason one day

740
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,761
and do something amazing

741
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,496
that no one else can.

742
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:42,132
Anyway,

743
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,836
I can picture your scowl tomorrow
triggered by a hangover.

744
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,806
I'll cook you bean sprout soup.

745
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,409
It'll be refreshing.

746
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,912
I love you, Hae-il.

747
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,175
Read this.

748
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,281
FATHER LEE YEONG-JUN'S DEATH DETAILS

749
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,053
Is this necessary?

750
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,289
Not if it ends quietly.

751
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,258
If it doesn't, we'll go with that plan.

752
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,594
Still, how could you do this?

753
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,097
It's the chief's orders.

754
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,233
-Wait.
-What?

755
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,768
Why do I have to take this case?

756
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,572
I ended up getting involved
without knowing why.

757
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,240
Don't ask questions and just take it.

758
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,643
Don't you want a promotion?

759
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,344
All the others got promoted.

760
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,347
Dae-yeong.

761
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,551
Do a good job with this case

762
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,387
and get yourself promoted two steps up.

763
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,857
I'll trust you with this.

764
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,537
Why we can't do an autopsy?

765
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,506
The prosecutor won't approve of it.

766
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,608
I told you about the trail

767
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,610
and showed you pictures of the body.

768
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:34,711
Did you tell him the same?

769
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,580
That isn't enough.

770
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,184
Who is the prosecutor in charge?

771
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,852
Why would you want to know that?

772
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,054
He won't meet with you anyway.

773
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,122
So, who is it?

774
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:49,259
You should leave.

775
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,861
Being stubborn won't get you anywhere.

776
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:55,165
-Who are you?
-I'm the chief.

777
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:58,535
Then you must have gotten briefed.

778
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,572
What is the reason you aren't
doing an autopsy or investigation?

779
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:04,808
The police isn't here
to fulfill your wishes.

780
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,544
We have to follow the rules.

781
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:11,982
Rules?

782
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,517
Since when did you follow the rules?

783
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,319
Even if you're a priest,

784
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,588
you can't speak to the police like that.

785
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,357
I wouldn't say this if you do your job.

786
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,391
What did you just say?

787
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,193
How dare you!

788
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,394
I'll walk you out, Father.

789
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:27,163
Let go of me.
You never do anything right here.

790
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,898
I have something to tell you.

791
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,303
Stop him from coming here.

792
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,338
Watch it.

793
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,141
The chief won't let you off
this easily if you do this again.

794
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,322
PROSECUTOR IN CHARGE PARK GYEONG-SEON

795
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,896
I'm sorry

796
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,465
about what happened to Father Lee.

797
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:06,703
Don't be sorry about anything
other than not allowing an autopsy.

798
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,539
Have you heard about my analysis?

799
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,041
I heard it all.

800
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,710
You must like TV shows like CSI.

801
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:15,378
Am I right?

802
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,981
If you say it's hard evidence

803
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:20,750
after watching TV shows,
you could go to jail.

804
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:24,220
I'm only saying that because it is.

805
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:25,555
Father Kim.

806
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:28,124
Don't think your hopes are the truth.

807
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,261
You're just as I expected too.

808
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,464
You don't have a soul.

809
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,634
You're as I expected too, Father,

810
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,102
making holy insults.

811
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:42,005
Did you think I'd get excited
and allow an autopsy

812
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,840
if you showed up here?

813
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:45,809
Please allow an autopsy!

814
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,510
I'm so stressed.

815
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,147
You'll get kicked out
if you raise your voice any higher.

816
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,717
Come on, Father.

817
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,186
Take your hands off of me.
I'll walk out by myself.

818
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,455
When I walk out, I'll make it public

819
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,589
to the media and the Vatican.

820
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:00,890
Do as you please.

821
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,693
Post it on social media
and start a one man protest in the cold.

822
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,962
I'm worried you'll come down
with something.

823
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,530
One more thing.

824
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,733
Stop coming to our church.

825
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,702
Why do you come if you won't
live according to God's will?

826
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:15,305
Do priests have the right
to stop believers from going?

827
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,974
I have the right to reject you
like you're rejecting the case.

828
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,245
As of now,
you are disqualified as a Catholic.

829
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:24,981
Says who?

830
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,584
Says I.

831
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,055
Disqualified?

832
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,127
Did you hear that?
I'm disqualified as a believer.

833
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,995
That's unbelievable.

834
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,233
I need something sweet.

835
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:49,839
He isn't there, either?

836
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:51,775
Okay, bye.

837
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:56,746
That's weird.

838
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,348
Why? What is it?

839
00:56:58,548 --> 00:56:59,549
Oh,

840
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:01,818
it's the head of general affairs.

841
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,788
I can't get a hold of him since yesterday.

842
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,157
There's so much to take care of.

843
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:12,896
Father Kim!

844
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,832
-What is it?
-Take a look at this.

845
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,007
It is assumed that Father Lee
of Gudam Cathedral

846
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,810
committed suicide at Mt. Yeongyu

847
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:28,578
from the stress

848
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:31,347
of being investigated by the police.

849
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,483
According to the police,

850
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,285
Father Lee was secretly being investigated

851
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,086
for sexually assaulting a church member

852
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,823
and embezzling and misusing church funds.

853
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,292
It is believed
that he was feeling pressured

854
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,195
and took extreme measures.

855
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,797
-The police stated that evidence
-What?

856
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,599
to back up this theory has been collected.

857
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,402
They're going too far.

858
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,504
If it is proved to be true

859
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,106
that he committed suicide
because of scandalous charges,

860
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,675
including sexual assault and embezzlement,

861
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,544
this will come as a shock

862
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,980
to not only the religious community,
but also everyone else.

863
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:19,529
GUDAM POLICE STATION

864
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,668
This must be my first time
seeing you smiling.

865
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,286
Evidence was fabricated. He was framed.

866
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,487
Don't you know what he was like?

867
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,788
That's total nonsense!

868
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,090
I let my guard down because he's a priest.

869
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,159
How could you not protect yourself?

870
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,428
Be careful. This priest beats people up.

871
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,663
What brings you here?

872
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,698
I'm here to send you to prison, Father.

873
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,266
You have to go somewhere with me.

874
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,901
I heard you quit,

875
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:32,969
but I guess you're back.

876
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,371
