1
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,387
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,688
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,111
Your skull's going to be quite sore today,
Hip Hop Girl.

4
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,824
Stop right there, you sinners!

5
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,693
You should go back.

6
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,097
-Sir.
-Don't you know your place?

7
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,434
You said you would do anything

8
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,902
that I ask you to do perfectly.

9
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,205
You don't know

10
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,373
what I'm going to ask you.

11
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,145
Know your place

12
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,047
and know who you are.

13
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,583
You must do your duty

14
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,852
before you ask for anything.

15
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,588
Don't you think?

16
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,556
I'll correct myself.

17
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,992
I apologize.

18
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,998
I'll go back to Yeongwol.

19
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,511
CHIEF PROSECUTOR
KANG SEOK TAE

20
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,219
CHIEF PROSECUTOR
KANG SEOK TAE

21
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:16,856
Yes, Ms. Jeong.

22
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,126
What?

23
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,995
This just in.

24
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,031
In front of a food service company
that produced bad food,

25
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,567
the CEO is handing over a money envelope.

26
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,670
The chief of the hygiene department
takes the envelope

27
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,639
puts it in his inside pocket
with a smile on his face.

28
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,674
It's the same
with other employees of the department.

29
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,242
DON'T KEEP RECORDS OF PRO-JAPANESE

30
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,344
Furthermore, the food service company

31
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,880
hired gangsters and used force

32
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,316
on police officers
and a priest who helped them.

33
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,452
Collusion between the hygiene department
and the food service company

34
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,121
and loose administration.

35
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,690
Today, I saw the true picture
of Gudam District,

36
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,626
the district chosen as the most
well-governed and clean district.

37
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,929
I'm Reporter Oh Bo-yeong of UBS News.

38
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,637
Hwang Cheol-beom, what's your problem?

39
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,074
I told you many times to change your ways.

40
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,477
The priest already planned it
before he came.

41
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,713
It couldn't be talked over.

42
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,615
Do you still let the goofy thugs

43
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,484
take care of important deals?

44
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,985
It should've been either you or Mr. Kim

45
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,821
who handled the situation!

46
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,357
Fine! I made a mistake.

47
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,092
I made a huge mistake.

48
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,360
No.

49
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,029
I don't want your lame excuses anymore.

50
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,332
You made a mistake with Father Lee
and one mistake is enough.

51
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,468
You know what I mean?

52
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,883
-Oops, I'm sorry.
-It's all over.

53
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,818
-It's finished.
-Okay.

54
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,029
Are you okay?
You seemed to get beaten up badly.

55
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,232
Considering we had fewer people,
this isn't that bad.

56
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,468
Thanks for earlier.

57
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,539
Earlier?

58
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,443
It's the least I can do for you.

59
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,780
By the way, is your head okay?

60
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,015
I guess you didn't know

61
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,819
that my head is twice as thick
as others' heads.

62
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,424
I'm basically wearing
a thin bulletproof helmet.

63
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,926
I could feel that you were my senior

64
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,029
for the first time
since I started working here.

65
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,566
So you haven't felt that way until now.

66
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,401
How can I put it?

67
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,038
You looked spirited
and your eyes were sparkling.

68
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,208
My eyes are always shiny.

69
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,847
I think hanging out with Father Kim
has changed you.

70
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,850
What are you talking about?

71
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,019
You know what he's like.
How could you say that?

72
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,021
I'm a saint for putting up with him.

73
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,358
By the way,
isn't Father Kim like a detective?

74
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,527
He knows everything about our work.

75
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,631
You're right.
He does know more than he should.

76
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,271
Did you get hurt too, Father?

77
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,606
I didn't get hurt at all.

78
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,808
I came to see Detective Seo.

79
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,978
-Detective Seo, are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

80
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,414
Father, your hand...

81
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,449
It's okay.

82
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,152
Are you okay?

83
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,887
Of course. This is nothing.

84
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,160
We're perpetrators.

85
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,928
-Victims.
-We're victims.

86
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,563
We were just walking by

87
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,533
and a man in dark clothes
suddenly showed up,

88
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,802
kicked him,

89
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:23,903
and hit his head.

90
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,605
What kind of a police office does that?

91
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,206
Look at what happened to my face.

92
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,708
Listen to me.

93
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,577
I didn't know it was a bribe
when I received it.

94
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,614
I thought it was a letter.

95
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,949
-How does that make sense to you?
-Why would I--

96
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,651
How is this a bribe?

97
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,621
Detective Gu, we just felt bad
that we troubled him to come.

98
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,522
He's right.

99
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,624
So, we just wanted to make sure
he can have some bibimbap.

100
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,726
-He's right.
-Silence!

101
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,362
Salute.

102
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,231
Why is it so unorderly here?

103
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,600
You can't just blindly bring
all of them here.

104
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,070
Well, they were all caught in the act,

105
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,939
so we had to arrest every one of them.

106
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,073
Nonsense.

107
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,175
Don't waste your time requesting warrants

108
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,578
and let them go on a warning--

109
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,413
Who said you could do that?

110
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,021
What do you mean by who said it?
I said it.

111
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,489
I'm the chief of this police station.

112
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,192
Wait. I think I'm hearing something
from up above.

113
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,328
I'm hearing something from up above.

114
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,930
Wait a second.

115
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,466
I hear something from up above.

116
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,008
God just told me you should shut up.

117
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:37,810
What?

118
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,146
Who do you think you are to shut me up?

119
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,248
It's not what I said.

120
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,650
It's what I heard from up above.
I'm only delivering the message.

121
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,118
You...

122
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,120
-Are you kidding me?
-Hey!

123
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,895
You. You thought it was a letter?

124
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,997
Are you dating each other?

125
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,499
Were you excited to receive
a heartfelt letter?

126
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,834
Is that why you smiled?

127
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,970
Do you want my heartful message too?

128
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,471
Father.

129
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,707
Why did you pick the metal one, of all?

130
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,175
We have plenty of plastic rulers here.

131
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,078
Metal ones make the best whip.

132
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,749
And you.

133
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,553
Does your bibimbap has
truffles and caviar in it?

134
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,822
You'll be hit by the edge.

135
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:23,889
Father.

136
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,891
I'll take care of him.

137
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,760
You deal with the man with bobbed hair.

138
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,131
Bobbed hair?

139
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,934
You punk.

140
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,669
I'm not just a man in dark clothes.

141
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,939
I'm called a priest.

142
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,242
-You're so dead--
-Shut up.

143
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,646
How can they be so shameless

144
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,615
when we have hard evidence here?

145
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,050
See?

146
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,286
Right, Chief Nam?

147
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,728
I'm about to have a stroke. Press here.

148
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:03,796
Yes, sir.

149
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,999
-Where are you going?
-To the district office.

150
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,435
That's where the fire is.
I'm going to go watch the fire.

151
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,238
Are you sure you're not going there
to make things worse?

152
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,939
"The Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah

153
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,474
sulfur and fire."

154
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,910
Genesis, chapter 19, verse 24.

155
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,017
Sulfur and fire?
Gosh. But I have a lot to do inside.

156
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,286
What does he mean by sulfur and fire?

157
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,422
-Avoiding us won't solve anything!
-It indeed won't!

158
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,491
-Let us in!
-You must let us in!

159
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,126
You can't just...

160
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,097
All the evidence they have

161
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,633
is just some cash
and the video clip of the scene.

162
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,836
That's true,
but you must not make any move now.

163
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,838
-Let's see how it goes and--
-No.

164
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,007
Even if we give more time to the press,

165
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,442
they will only exaggerate things.

166
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,443
I will take actions now.

167
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,912
No, don't. You must not.

168
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,780
They might have another card--

169
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,624
I'm putting my foot down on this case.

170
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,259
A transparent investigation.

171
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,029
A fair investigation.
I can promise you that.

172
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,131
Were you not aware
of the organized and chronic crime

173
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,166
that has been committed
by the hygiene department?

174
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,102
The result of the investigation will tell

175
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,537
whether it's an organized
and chronic crime or a one-time crime.

176
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,439
Please refrain from writing
any articles until then.

177
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:25,611
And I was unaware of this incident.

178
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,148
If it turns out to be
an organized and chronic crime,

179
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,683
what will you do?

180
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,985
I will disassemble the hygiene department

181
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,288
and make a more transparent
administrative system.

182
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,656
Goodness.

183
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,693
Is that it?

184
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,165
I mean, you're the director
of the district.

185
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,469
And yet are you putting all the blame
on the employees and the system?

186
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,604
GUDAM CATHEDRAL

187
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,938
Are you sure nothing is on you?

188
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,509
Father, with what right
are you asking that question?

189
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,676
Me?

190
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,213
With the right
of Gudam District's citizen.

191
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,482
Why? I can't?

192
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,117
Good.

193
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,521
What should I do to make you feel better?

194
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,523
That is

195
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,225
what you should decide.

196
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,195
But if I have to tell you something,

197
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,898
I believe what you need
to take responsibility for is

198
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,500
not your intention, but your action.

199
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,340
Well, if you think it's so unfair

200
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,309
that you take the responsibility,

201
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,645
then say it's on the employees.

202
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,614
Just because you managed to avoid
your responsibility today

203
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,583
doesn't mean you can do the same tomorrow.

204
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,022
I will correct myself.

205
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,192
It's happening.

206
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,459
-If it turns out
-It's happening.

207
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,329
to be organized and chronic crime,

208
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:51,964
I, Jeong Dong-ja,

209
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,300
will resign from the position

210
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,069
of the director of the district.

211
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,674
PRESS CONFERENCE:
HYGIENE DEPARTMENT'S BRIBERY

212
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,312
Is it

213
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,281
an unofficial announcement?

214
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,283
Ma'am, you should stop the conference--

215
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,753
This is an official announcement.
It's official.

216
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,524
There she goes.
She's shooting herself in the foot.

217
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,896
Make sure to keep your promise.

218
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm telling you now.

219
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,710
Then be ready
to step down from your position.

220
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,414
PRESS CONFERENCE:
HYGIENE DEPARTMENT'S BRIBERY

221
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,352
This is the evidence of the crime

222
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,586
the hygiene department committed.

223
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,257
This is the copy of the secret ledger

224
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,559
that recorded all the bribes
that Wangmat Food gave

225
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,394
to the hygiene department
for the last three years.

226
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,363
For your information,

227
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,200
this is one-tenth of the original copy.

228
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,204
Why do you have that?

229
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,605
Is it certainly legitimate?

230
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,842
Do you think I, a priest,
would bring a fake document?

231
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,644
And I'm planning

232
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,812
on sending the original copy

233
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,549
to the Audit Committee
of Seoul City Hall myself.

234
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,653
And one more thing.

235
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,024
This is my present

236
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:26,725
for the reporters.

237
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,715
Okay.

238
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,786
This is why you shouldn't act imprudently.

239
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,496
Drinking during the daytime is...

240
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,003
Why is it still in the middle of the day?

241
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,940
So I didn't drink during the daytime then.

242
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,743
I drank in the morning.

243
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,120
I'm drunk.

244
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,592
Those damn thieves.

245
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,927
Where to?

246
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,365
It is said
that even a local priest lent a hand

247
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,968
with the disclosure of the corruption
of Gudam's hygiene department

248
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,104
and played a major role
in arresting the criminals.

249
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,907
-Where are you going?
-Wait.

250
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,711
As Gudam District and its director
was known for their integrity,

251
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,113
it is expected that this incident

252
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,349
will greatly shock the residents.

253
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,651
I'm Reporter Jin Jeong-nam of RBS News.

254
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,819
Thanks for the news.

255
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,454
Have a nice day, sir.

256
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,858
I checked on that person you asked about.

257
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,028
It means he's not just any person.

258
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,264
He could be a North Korean
under protection,

259
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,299
or he could've worked with us.

260
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,700
Or maybe someone

261
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,836
who can't reveal his identity.

262
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,873
This is exactly what I needed.

263
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,643
Chief Kang won't say no to this.

264
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,113
You scored big-time.

265
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,450
You're so good at driving others nuts.

266
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,584
I didn't drive her nuts.

267
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,886
It was the Lord's will
to enlighten her on her arrogance.

268
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,856
By the way, how did you get
the secret ledger

269
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,124
of Wangmat Food?

270
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,862
Then how about we work together?

271
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,265
There's something

272
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,834
you have to listen to.

273
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,704
Then where should we...

274
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,140
What about there?

275
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,909
You know, there is an old door
inside the warehouse.

276
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,178
We should hide the ledger there.

277
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,848
We need to find a door.

278
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,851
An old door.

279
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,057
An old door.

280
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,897
That's it, Songsak. Bring it.

281
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,899
-You go.
-No, you go get it.

282
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,200
-You go.
-Just go get it!

283
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,602
-Go!
-You go!

284
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,504
Come on. Just do it.

285
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,441
Yo-han and Songsak?

286
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,243
Goodness.

287
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,545
-I know you knew about it too.
-I did?

288
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:08,981
No, I didn't.

289
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,350
You seemed to notice it right away
when you saw Yo-han.

290
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,288
You pretended you needed to poop
to tip-off Hwang Cheol-beom.

291
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,827
No, I didn't. Why would I?
Goodness, this is upsetting.

292
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,097
I didn't let you go,
and you were all jittery.

293
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,433
If you really needed to poop,
you would have done it on the rooftop.

294
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,869
I'm very picky about
where I sleep and where I poop.

295
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,504
I don't poop anywhere.

296
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,939
This morning, you pretended

297
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,607
you had to poop so you could tip-off

298
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:36,975
Hwang Cheol-beom, right?

299
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,210
Goodness.

300
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,279
That's...

301
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,748
That's just an unfounded blame.

302
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,617
Gosh, I'm speechless.

303
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,387
If you didn't help Detective Seo today,
I would have killed you.

304
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,690
A moment of good deed saved your life.
Understand?

305
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,526
Why is poop always your excuse though?

306
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,028
But...

307
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,030
He doesn't let me explain.

308
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,298
This is just unfair.

309
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,067
That's not true.

310
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,171
I want you to find out

311
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,840
who took the ledger by the end of the day.

312
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:10,943
Yes, sir.

313
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,283
One after another, it's getting
worse and worse. This is great.

314
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,791
I have important information.

315
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,061
What? The priest is?

316
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,630
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

317
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,298
It's from the NIS.

318
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,536
So you're saying he's someone
who has to keep his identity secret.

319
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,637
Yes, sir.

320
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,273
He might be an undercover trying
to pry into Gudam District's affairs.

321
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,409
Now it adds up.

322
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,312
I knew there must be something fishy
about that priest.

323
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,281
And about the Pope thing.

324
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,317
Unless some sort of power was involved,

325
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,452
you can't deliver your message

326
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,754
all the way to Vatican City.

327
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,589
That's what I'm talking about.

328
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,591
Prosecutor Park, you proved yourself.

329
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,929
Forget about all this
and come back to our office right now.

330
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,998
What are you waiting for? Hurry.

331
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,703
Why do you bug me so much?

332
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,374
There's something I must tell you.

333
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,311
I need to go out now. You have one minute.

334
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,580
About Father Kim Hae-il.

335
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,548
-What about him?
-He...

336
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,820
-He...
-What about him?

337
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,490
I mean...

338
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,061
about what he did today.

339
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,262
That thing about Wangmat Food

340
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,631
and the resignation
of the district director.

341
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,300
What about it?

342
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,236
I can solve it.

343
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,704
You can?

344
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,840
-How?
-Well...

345
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,513
"Wars and paintings must be seen
from a distance."

346
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,148
There's a saying.

347
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,516
So I saw it from a distance and...

348
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,718
You saw it from a distance and?

349
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,758
May I have a glass of water
before I tell you?

350
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,329
I'll give you one last chance.

351
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,399
Push it through as your plan.

352
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,500
Yes, sir.

353
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,337
I guess your time in Yeongwol did help.

354
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,038
You've become a lot more driven.

355
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,373
Thank you, sir.

356
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,908
-Let's talk later.
-Yes, sir.

357
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,142
Bye, sir.

358
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,748
This isn't what I imagined.

359
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,784
Darn it.

360
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,886
You can greet me later.

361
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,489
Bring me everything
on the Wangmat Food case.

362
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,858
-Okay.
-Okay.

363
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,135
Detective Seo. The warrant?

364
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,404
It's expected to be issued
by this evening, sir.

365
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,274
It was really cool
how you finished the district director.

366
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,111
All thanks to Yo-han and Songsak.

367
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,579
Wait a second.

368
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,448
Since when have the two of you
become so close?

369
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,083
Since we arrested those punks.

370
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,685
And of course, we should be close.

371
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,086
He's my teacher.

372
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,422
Teacher? Teacher of what?

373
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,290
Do you want to be a priest too?

374
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,893
Well, he's my teacher in many ways.

375
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,429
Goodness. What about me then?

376
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,499
Am I just a wooden stick to you?

377
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,535
I'll go send the secret ledger
to Seoul City Hall.

378
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,870
Do you want me to come?

379
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,472
-I'll go alone.
-Take care.

380
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:28,640
Bye.

381
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,375
Bye.

382
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,147
What's with the chuckling?

383
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,749
What was that chuckling about?

384
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,422
I chuckled again today

385
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,056
I chuckled

386
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,028
It all started with rotten food.

387
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,229
That's right, ma'am.

388
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,131
One thing led to another,

389
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,766
and the district director is resigning.

390
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,803
Gosh, Father Kim Tsunami is

391
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,338
more persistent than he needs to be.

392
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,874
Whom I feel really bad for
is the girl in the hospital.

393
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,877
Those who play with food

394
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,479
have to be all murdered.

395
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,715
Why don't we just hire a killer
and murder all of them then?

396
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,051
I'm sorry. I was reminded of my daughter.

397
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,655
Bring the head and the employees
of the hygiene department,

398
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,190
the representatives of the sick girl,

399
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,691
the lawyer, and the CEO of Wangmat Food,

400
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,560
to Gudam Police Station.

401
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,496
And bring a reporter
who is good at storytelling too.

402
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,164
-Now.
-Yes, ma'am.

403
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,379
Father!

404
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,790
Where's the ledger?

405
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,592
Right, here.

406
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,694
I couldn't see it. Hand it over.

407
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,795
Wait, Father.

408
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,498
I'll go to the city hall.

409
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,299
You will?

410
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,602
I'll finish this.

411
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,537
I'm the one who took it and copied it.

412
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,340
Are you sure?

413
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,610
I think doing this

414
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,514
makes my heart pound like this.

415
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,549
I feel like I did something brave.

416
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,151
I know it's like that.

417
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,988
You feel scared but very proud.

418
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,223
-Good luck then.
-Yes, Father.

419
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,094
Brother Yo-han.

420
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,684
Why does it take so long
to issue the warrant?

421
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,352
I'm sure it'll be issued soon.

422
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:55,921
What do you want to eat?

423
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,223
Let's wait a bit.

424
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,926
I can't. I'm starving.

425
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,763
Let's have a big proper dinner.
It's on me.

426
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:06,898
Really?

427
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,702
Think about what you want to eat
until then.

428
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,972
"Restaurants nearby."

429
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,875
Let's see what's cheap and good.

430
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,419
I'll be right back.

431
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,454
Make sure to be quick.

432
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,857
If you come late, I won't buy dinner.

433
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,529
THE WARM-HEARTED AND TRUSTWORTHY POLICE IS
ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE

434
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,750
What's with the reaction?

435
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,486
We were wondering

436
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,859
why you were so obsessed
with Wangmat Food.

437
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,862
We know it's about Eun-ji,

438
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,399
but we thought the investigation
on Father Lee had to be done first.

439
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,835
After all, bringing down the Goliath

440
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,037
was your master plan, Father.

441
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,973
The opponent needs to weaken down

442
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,675
for us to get the information we need.

443
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,944
I didn't know
you had such a great purpose.

444
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,948
You did a great job, Father.

445
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,583
It's not great.

446
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,352
You could have been in big trouble.

447
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,922
You should not beat up people too hard

448
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,692
or say curse words.

449
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,594
It will hurt you both physically

450
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,496
and mentally.

451
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,198
I heard you asked something to Father Han.

452
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,734
You asked him if I took a personality test

453
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,302
before I had become a priest.

454
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:54,839
Father.

455
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,843
Father?

456
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,448
I just said it as a joke.

457
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,557
You think it's funny?

458
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,527
Father.

459
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,264
Goodness.

460
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,434
By the way,

461
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:23,902
are we all settled

462
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,671
with Eun-ji's hospital bills now?

463
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,577
Yes. We can have it compensated
through trials.

464
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,313
Everything we have paid ourselves.

465
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,583
Thank you, dear my Lord.

466
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,121
Father Lee would have been
very happy to hear that.

467
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,610
Hang in there.

468
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,812
You'll be able to see your friends soon.

469
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,432
It doesn't hurt.

470
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,802
Take it easy, sir.

471
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,670
What did I tell you?

472
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,540
I told you
the district director and Mr. Hwang

473
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,575
would cause trouble someday.

474
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,210
I didn't expect this.

475
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,446
Why did she have to run
her mouth like that?

476
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,381
What if

477
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,886
someone from the opposite ruling party
gets elected after she resigns?

478
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,320
What will you do then?

479
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,990
Then there will be no more Savings Day.

480
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:55,426
Then we must make every effort
to keep her in her position.

481
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,930
Do we have to though?

482
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,267
-Pardon?
-It won't be bad

483
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,670
to have one of us take that position.

484
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,473
Right.

485
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,376
Let's ask Chief Kang as well.

486
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,647
How about

487
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,050
we keep this secret from Chief Kang?

488
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,052
As a matter of fact,

489
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,222
I think the same.

490
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,005
Why are you doing this?

491
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,443
I hate that look on your face.

492
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,946
But why...

493
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,215
Tell me who took Wangmat Food's ledger.

494
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,517
What?

495
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,153
I haven't been

496
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,524
this furious in a while.

497
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:02,961
Spill it out.

498
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,297
I don't know.

499
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,366
I asked the priest,

500
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,301
but he wouldn't tell me.

501
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,811
Move on to the next step.

502
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,652
I really don't know.

503
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,888
I gave you the information this morning.

504
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,759
I really don't know, sir!

505
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,461
I really don't!

506
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,532
Let me ask you again.

507
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,402
If you lie to me again,
you will become one with the scrap metal.

508
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,337
Like Transformers.

509
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,406
Now, who is it?

510
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,408
Who took the ledger?

511
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,612
I really don't know.

512
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,051
I really don't know.

513
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,193
I really don't know! Help me!

514
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,713
It looks like he really doesn't know.

515
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,683
Let's go.

516
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,584
Well done.

517
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,620
Well done, Gu Dae-yeong.

518
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,325
I have no regrets.

519
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:16,794
I have no regrets.

520
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,340
Hwang Cheol-beom...

521
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,119
Give me the key, will you?

522
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,488
Be quiet.

523
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,056
Or order jjajangmyeon for me.

524
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,657
You know,

525
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,460
we're Hungry Gang
from South Chungcheong Province.

526
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,165
If the district director really resigns,

527
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,833
who's got our back?

528
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,402
We'll be doomed then.

529
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,604
She won't care about us
because she's leaving.

530
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,839
She will only take care of herself.

531
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,608
In the worst case,

532
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,710
let's disclose everything.

533
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:09,847
Let's tell the cops
that we just did what we were told to do.

534
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,184
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

535
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,953
Write the content, edit, and filter

536
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,022
just as I say.

537
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,059
Don't add anything unnecessary.

538
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,262
Just do as I say.

539
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,833
That damn reporter sounds all excited.

540
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,236
It looks like screenwriters are
not writing scenarios

541
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,338
but news articles these days.

542
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,408
Well, aren't we the same?

543
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,982
Why was the warrant denied?

544
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,351
I'm not sure, sir.
That's just how they noticed.

545
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,353
This is ridiculous.

546
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,324
JAIL

547
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,725
Release them.

548
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,494
You can all go home for now.

549
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,632
The hygiene department
and Mr. Ki should wait a bit.

550
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,701
-Why?
-Don't ask.

551
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,369
Hey, Hip Hop Girl.

552
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,307
Why are we releasing them?

553
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,075
Why is the warrant denied?

554
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,077
The prosecutor in charge is changed.

555
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,713
She's the prosecutor you know very well.

556
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,349
-Prosecutor Park Gyeong-seon?
-Yes.

557
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,785
I'll go home now.

558
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,157
But she just went to Yeongwol!
Why did she come back?

559
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,391
This is annoying.

560
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,060
Why are you so angry?

561
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,495
Of course, I am.

562
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,598
Every time I try to do something,
they play petty tricks.

563
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,868
Yes, Sister.

564
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:40,605
I'm not sure why the prosecutor
suddenly wants to meet me.

565
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,241
I think we should meet her
to see what she's up to.

566
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,343
I'm just nervous.

567
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,580
It shouldn't be anything bad, right?

568
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,282
Don't worry.

569
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,251
See you tomorrow at the police station.

570
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,388
What's wrong?

571
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:02,193
I guess Sister Park Gyeong-seon is
planning a counterattack.

572
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,233
Hello, Father.

573
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,103
I see that you've made a big mess.

574
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,805
You're not Kim Hae-il. You're Kim Tsunami.

575
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,309
You made it back.
You must have properly kneeled down.

576
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,945
Come on. Don't be so corny.

577
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,280
Who kneels down these days?

578
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,282
I know there will be very little chance,

579
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,684
but make sure to deal with the case
fair and square.

580
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,353
I swore in front of Lady Justice.

581
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,622
Fair and square. Equality and justice.

582
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,292
"Fair and square"? "Lady Justice"?

583
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,194
Are you sure it wasn't in front of a rock?

584
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,496
Why do you have so little faith in me?

585
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,132
Father, have faith.

586
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,801
-Faith.
- I do respect faith,

587
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,270
but what protects me is suspicions.

588
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,073
Now that I hear you attacking me

589
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,576
in a holy and gracious way,
I feel like I'm back for real.

590
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,613
Won't you say hi to me?
We haven't met in a while.

591
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:57,848
Hello, ma'am.

592
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,987
Mr. Lucky Man.
So your nose always looks like that.

593
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,489
I thought it got swollen
because you got punched on it then.

594
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,860
People from the hygiene department,
follow me.

595
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,904
I hate her.

596
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,006
I know you've been through a lot today,

597
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,374
so I'll make it quick.

598
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,775
-Give me the papers.
-Yes, ma'am.

599
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,546
Take the one with your name on it.

600
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,582
I'm sure you have a lot of complaints

601
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,584
toward the district office
and the director.

602
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,853
But public officers
shouldn't be emotional.

603
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,055
They've been paying your salary after all.

604
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,724
CCTV EVIDENCE

605
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,160
MASSAGE

606
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,129
ASSA KARAOKE

607
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,331
You wanted to just disclose everything
in the end, right?

608
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,467
"Whatever. Die you all!"

609
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,501
But you can't do that.

610
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,304
You must stay cool and responsible
until the end. Don't you think?

611
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,241
If you don't, you'll be charged
for what's written there.

612
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,077
Your wives, children, and parents

613
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,746
will find this pretty shocking.

614
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,547
If they find

615
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,750
you've been paying
for prostitution every month...

616
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,423
Now, we all agreed
that you take responsibility.

617
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,493
You guys are so cool.

618
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,500
If you're not insightful,
you should be informed at least.

619
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:25,169
And if you're not informed,
you should be intuitive at least.

620
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,205
And if you're not intuitive,
you should listen to other people!

621
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:29,974
I apologize, sir.

622
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,310
If you're so terribly sorry,
you should die.

623
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,712
You've been on a fast, so you're weak.

624
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:35,946
Save your energy.

625
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,350
We're dealing
with the district director's matter.

626
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,886
There will be good news soon.

627
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,788
She just announced that she would resign.

628
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,523
How could you smooth that over?

629
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,924
You'll see.

630
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,360
Even if she takes her words back,

631
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,028
there won't be big problems.

632
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,930
Just because of that one damn priest...

633
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,534
The priest! We must do something

634
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,002
about the priest!

635
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:02,306
We're not going to heaven anyway.

636
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,142
Let's just make him like Father Lee.

637
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,783
I think we should fix

638
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,518
our barn first.

639
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,487
We already lost our big cow.

640
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,723
Why would we fix the barn?

641
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,092
We need to fix it to bring another cow in.

642
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,663
Speaking of which, I'd like to suggest
that I become the leader

643
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,100
at least on the surface.

644
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:35,506
It's to make our bond stronger.

645
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,542
From now on, I want you to tell me
all the information you get

646
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,344
and the decisions you make.

647
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,646
Why all of a sudden?

648
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,249
And if we have to choose a leader,

649
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,918
why don't we vote...

650
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,019
Why?

651
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:50,988
Do you not like my idea?

652
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,658
Well, that's not what I mean.

653
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,695
I like the idea.

654
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:58,996
Well,

655
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,600
he is the one who knows
the best about us, after all.

656
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:04,935
Let's do it that way.

657
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,838
What?

658
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,408
Thank you.

659
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,918
Damn it.

660
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,888
Why did you have to make the rotten food?

661
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,991
Chairman Ki Hong-chan,

662
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,261
I want you to pay all the hospital bills
Eun-ji was charged until today

663
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,363
as well as the bills
she will be charged in the future.

664
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,532
But the trial hasn't even begun yet.

665
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,701
If you don't pay the hospital bills,
I will double your sentence for bribery.

666
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,137
Do you want me to triple it?

667
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,206
Fine. I'll pay.

668
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,676
And Sister, drop the suit,
write a memorandum, and get it notarized.

669
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:49,079
Promise that after you receive the payment
you won't bring up this anymore.

670
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,415
No, ma'am. I can't do that.

671
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,584
We will follow the procedure,
get the payment,

672
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,887
and have this company punished.

673
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,089
Sister.

674
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,892
They work with Lee and Park Law Firm.

675
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,060
Do you know it?

676
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,663
Of course. Even I know that.

677
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,398
If you want to follow the procedure,

678
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,533
it'll take at least two years
for you to be paid.

679
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,269
Who will pay
the hospital bills until then?

680
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,439
And even if you win the lawsuit,
you won't get all the money back.

681
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,575
Why? Because Lee and Park Law Firm

682
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,377
will do everything they can do
to cut down even a single penny.

683
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,645
You need to think carefully

684
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,148
what's best for Eun-ji.

685
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,750
What should we do?

686
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,254
I'll give you a couple minutes

687
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,590
so you two can discuss
and think carefully about it.

688
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,394
Hey, Mr. Yu.
You must be back from the Czech Republic.

689
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,131
I want you to look into a person
using your data.

690
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:45,135
Yes. His name is Kim Hae-il.

691
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,138
He's a priest in a catholic church.

692
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:07,892
Father.

693
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,560
Yes?

694
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,695
After everything we did today,

695
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,998
I hope it wasn't for nothing in the end.

696
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:17,368
Not this time. We have hard evidence.

697
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,371
But look at what's happening.

698
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,240
This is frustrating.

699
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,377
Why are you crying?

700
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,512
It's not because I'm sad.

701
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,648
I'm just so angry.

702
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,917
Those assholes.

703
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:35,886
I'm sorry.

704
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,532
I'm sorry. I know this doesn't look nice.

705
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,602
It feels like I have a friend
who sincerely cares for me,

706
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,803
and it cheers me up.

707
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,008
You're embarrassing me.

708
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,413
I must have lost my mind.

709
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,281
Look at them.

710
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,283
Don't be so harsh on yourself.

711
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,619
Father, hold on a second.

712
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,591
Goodness.

713
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,827
Is she flirting with him?

714
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,729
If you're finished using it, give it back.

715
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,030
Let me wash it for you.

716
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,372
-Are you okay, sir?
-I'm okay.

717
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,573
Let me take you to the hospital.

718
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,409
I said I'm okay! Stop fussing about it!

719
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:34,745
I'm sorry, sir.

720
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,147
We found who took

721
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,383
the ledger.

722
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,218
What?

723
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,520
We had no clue because there were
no CCTVs in the factory,

724
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,190
but we found this from a dashcam of a car

725
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:47,758
that was in front of the factory.

726
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,669
Those scumbags.

727
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,305
Get them.

728
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:02,906
Yes, sir.

729
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,115
Kim Hae-il, that bastard.

730
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,050
Today,

731
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:15,953
let's not just use words.

732
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,222
Yes, sir.

733
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,067
Gosh, I feel so much better now.

734
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,604
I can feel my stomach is
now filled with happiness.

735
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,740
Songsak.

736
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,745
Let's have some fun.

737
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,683
Hello.

738
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,729
Let's see if you did the new homework.

739
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,932
Betty Botter bought some butter.

740
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,168
But she said the butter’s bitter.

741
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,903
Ready, go.

742
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,673
Betty Botter...

743
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,277
-Betty what?
-Betty...

744
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,381
You don't know how to apply, do you?

745
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,850
I taught you how to do it.
How could you not do it?

746
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,752
Try again.

747
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,221
Excuse me.

748
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,293
Hey, don't. Why?

749
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,798
Do you want to try what I do?

750
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,834
What are you doing?

751
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,304
Is this a battle?

752
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,506
Is it another tongue-twister?

753
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:43,974
Bring it on.

754
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,777
Let me show you my amazing pronunciation.

755
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,779
Then follow me. It's easy.

756
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,652
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck

757
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,688
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

758
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,356
As much wood

759
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,291
as a woodchuck could chuck,

760
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,894
If a woodchuck could chuck wood.

761
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,534
What are you doing, Yo-han?

762
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:13,670
What?

763
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:15,806
Are you a rapper?

764
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:16,907
Try.

765
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,009
I'll finish it at one go,
so listen carefully.

766
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,012
How much wood would a woodchuck...

767
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,114
-Chuck...
-You failed.

768
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,217
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck...

769
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,086
-Yo-han.
-It's okay.

770
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,287
I was just warming up.

771
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,958
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck...

772
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,428
-a woodchuck... chuck...
-Wrong.

773
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,698
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck...

774
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,500
Swag.

775
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,636
How much wood would...

776
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,304
Woodchuck...

777
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:49,773
Chuck...

778
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:58,115
Wrong!

779
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:02,052
The word I hate the most

780
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,087
is "wrong".

781
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,892
Yo-han!

782
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,395
"Correct" is the word I like.

783
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,631
Let me kill you with my moist karate kick.

784
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,372
Hey, Mr. Kim.

785
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,107
Who?

786
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,009
Who do you want me to get?

787
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,448
I got them.

788
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:36,720
Then did you sign to settle?

789
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:38,622
Yes,

790
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,358
we need to save Eun-ji's life first.

791
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,995
The lawyer said that was a better option.

792
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,464
Then we can't punish them.

793
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,032
It will only reduce...

794
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,135
It will only reduce the sentence.

795
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,738
Then I made a mistake.

796
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,177
Father.

797
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,386
It's turned out
that District Director Jeong Dong-ja

798
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,089
announced her voluntary resignation
two days ago

799
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,858
as a result of a priest's sly mind game
in order to cover the church's faults.

800
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,293
I don't have good feelings about this.

801
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:18,996
Goodness.

802
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,065
Is that it?

803
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,035
A person talks to the district director
in a disrespectful manner.

804
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,237
It's Father Kim of Gudam Cathedral.

805
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,538
That really does sound awful.

806
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,740
Be quiet.

807
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,476
Why did they have to change
his voice like that?

808
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,112
Last month, Father Lee of Gudam Cathedral

809
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,681
committed suicide out of pressure
while being investigated

810
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,917
for sexual assault and embezzlement,

811
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,919
which was much criticized by the society.

812
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,822
And Father Kim attempted
to provoke the police

813
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,557
in order to change the public opinion.

814
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:51,762
Well, if you think it's so unfair

815
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,397
that you take the responsibility,

816
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,033
then say it's on the employees.

817
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,235
Okay! It's official!

818
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,437
Make sure to keep your promise.

819
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,041
Then be ready
to step down from your position.

820
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:06,910
The priest's impure mind game

821
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,612
got him the answer he wanted.

822
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,780
I, Jeong Dong-ja,

823
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,182
will resign from the position

824
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,984
THE PRIEST OF GUDAM CATHEDRAL CRITICIZED

825
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,252
of the director of the district.

826
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,487
Feeling humiliated, the district director

827
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,456
decided to take all the responsibility.

828
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,060
And what Father Kim did afterward
is even more shocking.

829
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,297
He threw the copies of unauthorized papers
in the air and made a scene.

830
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,068
A priest's duty is
to bring peace to our souls.

831
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,137
However, this priest harassed human souls

832
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:35,939
in order to take advantage for himself.

833
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,910
What should a true cleric be like?

834
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,813
It's a question worth thinking about
for all religions.

835
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,682
I'm Reporter Lee Mi-won of QNN News.

836
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:04,368
Father. Take a deep breath first.

837
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,907
This is malicious producing,
not malicious editing.

838
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,844
Hey, everyone knows such news is fake

839
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,679
these days.

840
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,691
HE IS NOT A PRIEST BUT A GANGSTER
HE CAN'T BE TREATED HUMANLY

841
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,708
SEOUL GUDAM POLICE STATION

842
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:45,809
Old Lady!

843
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:52,582
Could you show some respect?

844
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,286
You made the employees take all the blame,
used a sick girl to drop a suit,

845
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:57,521
and made a fool of me.

846
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,523
Well done.

847
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,193
Now are you going to start
increasing your property

848
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,295
and move on
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

849
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,864
You're not just picking a fight.
You're slandering me.

850
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,367
Forget about everything else.
But how could you use the sick girl?

851
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,869
Whatever. You behave yourself.

852
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,547
What do you mean by,
"You behave yourself"?

853
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,283
You know, that Seo Seung something.

854
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,884
The detective who likes you.

855
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:29,853
That girl who smiles at you like this

856
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,255
and removes dust from your jacket.
That girl.

857
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,126
-What?
-You know, fooling around

858
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:40,130
with a young and pretty detective like her
might tarnish your image as a priest.

859
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,199
What kind of impure ideas
do you have in your mind?

860
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,467
How dare you say that to a priest?

861
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,135
Then how could you say all those things

862
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,737
about increasing property and stuff
to a prosecutor of Korea?

863
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:48,872
Fine.

864
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,941
Then I will use a different word.

865
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:54,945
Trash.

866
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,151
The worst kind of trash
that can't even be recycled.

867
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:03,787
You...

868
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,231
What did you just say?

869
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,665
Prosecutor Park. Father Kim.

870
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:18,135
You can't do this at the police station.

871
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:19,903
"Trash"?

872
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,205
That's the word I hate the most.

873
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,807
Well, you deserve it.

874
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:24,908
And...

875
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:28,245
It won't stop bleeding.

876
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,747
That's great. Let me hit you once more.

877
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,616
Sure. Go ahead.

878
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,618
I'd love to get settlement money
from a prosecutor.

879
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,686
-Take it easy, ma'am.
-Get off of me, Mr. Lucky Bag.

880
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,156
Detective Gu is older than you.
How could you talk so rudely?

881
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,891
-Did that offend you?
-Yes. What? No.

882
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,559
-He said he wasn't offended.
-I'm offended.

883
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,561
-How dare you assault a priest?
-Please stop.

884
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,496
I will go to a hospital and sue you.

885
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,664
Hospital?

886
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,902
Blood!

887
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,503
I will sue you back!

888
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,338
How can you sue me
when you're the one who hit me?

889
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:56,773
How could a prosecutor be so stupid?

890
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,409
What? You have never gotten
kicked by me, have you?

891
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,913
-Get off of me!
-Ma'am!

892
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:06,616
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

893
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,753
Ma'am, you have a very strong punch.

894
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,655
Even your punch is sly.

895
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,889
Sly?

896
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:15,792
I just have an extra-long middle finger.
Do you have problems with it?

897
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,861
Father, I'll go get some tissues.

898
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,362
Detective Gu.

899
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,502
Why do you live like this?

900
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,872
You don't have to hurt others
to live a decent life.

901
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,574
I didn't hurt anyone.

902
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,709
Me? What did I do?

903
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,844
Please care about other people, okay?

904
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,646
You're a prosecutor.

905
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,081
Other people?

906
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,518
Don't you know I've been having to
stay low and humiliate myself

907
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:43,086
because of you?

908
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,256
Forget it! You don't understand.

909
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,925
Are you saying it's because of me?
What does that mean?

910
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:52,395
Do you think I'm a sociopath
because I smile all the time?

911
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:55,565
Old Lady, you know
you could make a great sociopath.

912
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,001
There are so many sociopath tests
on the internet,

913
00:53:58,201 --> 00:53:59,135
so try it.

914
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,604
You're unbelievable.

915
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:05,909
If you're a priest,
try to read humans' inner sides!

916
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,619
Gosh, I feel dizzy.

917
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,754
Detective Gu.

918
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:32,636
I failed to wrap up things.

919
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:36,206
And I even got beaten up.
This is embarrassing.

920
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,745
Half-point.

921
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:45,448
Half-point.

922
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:47,117
What are you saying?

923
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,685
You know, from judo.

924
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,687
No point, half-point, and full point.

925
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,291
You won half point this time.

926
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,494
You didn't expect to beat them at once.

927
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,095
Did you?

928
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,031
If you keep going,

929
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,066
there will be one day
you get a full point.

930
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,935
The man of full point, Lee Won-hee.

931
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,537
I mean, Kim Hae-il.

932
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,479
Gosh, you lunatic.

933
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,549
Why? I was just trying to be nice.

934
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:21,384
You're weird.

935
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,754
I should buy Yo-han and Songsak a drink.

936
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,356
They went through a lot because of me.

937
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,191
What about me?

938
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,060
If you want to pay, you can follow me.

939
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,429
I would like to try the holy drink
that a priest buys.

940
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,564
You love free stuff, don't you?

941
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:35,999
Me?

942
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,803
This is so offending.

943
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:42,272
Hello.

944
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:52,882
Where are you going? Where...

945
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,319
Why is he so fast?

946
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,141
Hey!

947
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:58,782
Father.

948
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:00,550
Father.

949
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:02,385
Come on here, all of you.

950
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:34,951
Step aside.

951
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:55,071
-You're slower than I thought.
-Can't you see this?

952
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,408
Do you know how heavy this is?

953
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,178
You are indeed slow.

954
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,557
Let's finish it today, Father.

955
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,618
We don't have to worry
about the priest anymore.

956
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,053
I heard he's nearly dead.

957
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:51,788
Father, your face...

958
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,122
I fought against Hwang Cheol-beom.

959
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:55,491
-If you look like this, he must be--
-He's dead.

960
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,160
Dead, my ass. He's totally fine.

961
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,528
He attacked him first from the back.

962
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,964
HERE COMES THE COUNTERATTACK

963
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,499
Let's check the situation
at Hwang Cheol-beom's vacation home.

964
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:06,736
Special investigation squad.
We're something like that.

965
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,571
How about we go undercover?

966
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,640
"It's something
you've never tasted before."

967
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,275
It's here. My gut is telling me.

968
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:15,311
Let's go. Let's go get them.

969
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,114
