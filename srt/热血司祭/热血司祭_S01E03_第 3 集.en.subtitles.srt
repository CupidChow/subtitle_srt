1
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,186
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,521
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,724
Father Kim, you need to be healed.

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,127
Welcome back.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,296
Stay out of trouble and behave yourself.

6
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,366
-Stop it.
-They're trash that isn't even recyclable.

7
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,469
Do you think people like that
would repent and follow God?

8
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,071
How dare you, in front of the cross!

9
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,406
Get angry when it's necessary.

10
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,708
I didn't lead you to become a priest

11
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,343
to fight against the world stubbornly.

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,511
Right now?

13
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,914
Father Lee missed morning Mass

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,449
and I can't get a hold of him.

15
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,818
FATHER LEE'S SUDDEN DEATH

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,219
It can't be suicide.

17
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,187
No!

18
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:58,024
It is assumed that Father Lee
of Gudam Cathedral committed suicide.

19
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,093
I'm officially requesting
for an investigation.

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,361
I also want an autopsy done.

21
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,564
Father Lee was secretly being investigated
for sexually assaulting a church member

22
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,699
and embezzling and misusing church funds.

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,302
The police stated that evidence

24
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,304
to back up this theory has been collected.

25
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,040
Father Lee was a respected priest
of the local community.

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,842
If it is proved to be true

27
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,578
that he committed suicide
because of scandalous charges,

28
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,513
including sexual assault and embezzlement,

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,815
this will come as a shock...

30
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,516
This must be my first time
seeing you smiling.

31
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,241
Detective Gu.

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,710
Detective Gu, are you all right?

33
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,078
Dae-yeong.

34
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,289
A swan?

35
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,560
Come on.

36
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,699
Dae-yeong.

37
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,102
Father, what are you doing here again?

38
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,141
What's wrong with him?
Who did this to him?

39
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,311
How could you...

40
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,614
You're a priest! What did you do?

41
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,616
What about you lot?

42
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,585
Sexual assault and embezzlement?

43
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,921
Make it believable if you're going to lie.

44
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,389
You can't just make up such a lame lie.

45
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,924
What do you mean?

46
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,893
It's the exact result of an investigation

47
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,194
we've been secretly working on.

48
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,896
You don't know what Monsignor is, do you?

49
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,733
It's a title given to the holiest
and the most honorary member.

50
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,836
And Father Lee Yeong-jun received
the title directly from the pope.

51
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,137
How could you disgrace such a man?

52
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,706
Whatever the Monsignor is,

53
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,642
he should confess to his crimes

54
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,809
and be punished for them.

55
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,178
At least I would like to know

56
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,446
what benefit you get

57
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,550
from doing that to the old weak priest.

58
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,118
Is it because of money?

59
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,687
Or did someone promise you
a big promotion?

60
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,958
Preposterous! How could you?

61
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:13,893
-Detective Heo.
-Yes, sir.

62
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,628
Lock him up and request an arrest warrant.

63
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,430
-Yes, sir.
-For assaulting an officer

64
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,631
and spreading false information.

65
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,333
I haven't spread it yet.

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,769
For planning on spreading then.
And police defamation.

67
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,771
You have no reputation to ruin,
so that doesn't count!

68
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,573
You! Come here!

69
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,709
Do you know who I am?

70
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,613
-Who are you?
-I'm the police chief!

71
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,014
Chief, my ass!

72
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,384
Father!

73
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,555
Salute.

74
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,893
My nose is stuffy.

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,495
Doctor, my nose is stuffy.

76
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,098
Please give me some strong antibiotics.

77
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,900
My nose is stuffy, Doctor.

78
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,769
You!

79
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,071
-Calm down, sir.
-Pull them apart.

80
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,205
Get off of me!

81
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,907
You punk! Bring it on!

82
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,775
Put that bastard in the cell!

83
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,679
Who assaulted whom?

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,248
The detective in charge.

85
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,317
It's because he disagrees
with the investigation result.

86
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,485
Let me get this straight.

87
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,788
A detective was beaten up by a priest

88
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,257
and requested an arrest warrant
for the priest?

89
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,425
Yes.

90
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,361
They say the detective's nose

91
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,265
bled in the shape of a butterfly.

92
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,135
Those guys are jokes.

93
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,671
Tear down the whole ceiling

94
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,806
and install a new air filtration system.

95
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,109
I can't bear to see
our dear children inhale fine dust.

96
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,979
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes, Sister.

97
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,283
Both I and the children

98
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,485
have no idea what is going on.

99
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,721
Father Lee and I made a deal

100
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,590
a long time ago.

101
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,826
We agreed that I take this orphanage
and other welfare organizations

102
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:54,894
when Father Lee passes away.

103
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,698
Well, I have never heard of it.

104
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,134
Of course you haven't. But it's true.

105
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,136
Father Lee kept everything transparent

106
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,805
when it comes to
management of the orphanage--

107
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,273
Hi, guys.

108
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,044
Let me make this place nicer for you.

109
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,746
I will buy you many toys
and school supplies.

110
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,548
Okay?

111
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,387
Maybe I look scary to them.

112
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,625
Ma'am, why don't you buy
some pizza for the children?

113
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,428
Not the lame ones,
but the ones with real beef on them.

114
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,595
What was the name?

115
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,831
Oh, right. "Combi station". Order that.

116
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,132
Take it.

117
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,233
-But--
-Take it.

118
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,502
Enjoy your pizza.

119
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,973
PHARMACY

120
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,310
What if he broke my nose?

121
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,912
It's the signature part of my face.

122
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,785
I let my guard down
because he was a priest.

123
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,255
If he was just a regular man,

124
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,091
I would've weaved
to the other side of his shoulder

125
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,959
and punched him
using the flick of my wrist.

126
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,394
I would have counterattacked.

127
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,895
Like Mayweather.

128
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,131
Let me ask you again.

129
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,234
The investigation on Father Lee
was done correctly, right?

130
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,938
Of course. We have been secretly
working on it for months.

131
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,307
There are some fishy things
about it, though.

132
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,142
We might need to reinvestigate.

133
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,944
Don't be so uptight.

134
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,512
Believe what your seniors say.

135
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,014
If, by any chance,

136
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,050
the investigation result was false,

137
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,186
I will quit the police force

138
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,455
whether it's a promising career or not.

139
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,693
Those who say they will quit
never leave the station.

140
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:49,675
LET US BE YOUR HANDS AND FEET
WITH HEARTWARMING KINDNESS

141
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,716
Are you Prosecutor Park Gyeong-seon?

142
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,284
Yes.

143
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,486
I'm the head of the violent crime squad,
Lee Myeong-su.

144
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,360
Trim your nose hair.

145
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,295
You deal with civil complaints
in that hygiene?

146
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,331
Noted, ma'am.

147
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,238
Where's the priest, the perpetrator?

148
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,442
-Detective Heo.
-Please follow me.

149
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,950
Look at you, Father.

150
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,257
What a dynamic priesthood you have.

151
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,926
What brings you here?

152
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,829
I'm here to send you to prison, Father.

153
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,797
You troubled yourself to come here
just to imprison me?

154
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,467
Of course. Not many prosecutors

155
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,269
get to put an actual priest in a prison.

156
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,738
It's a rare experience.

157
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,841
Thanks to you, I'm up for
something exciting too.

158
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,443
I highly doubt that it'll be exciting.

159
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,345
You apparently don't know

160
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,482
that even ten blankets can't keep you warm
in the penitentiary, Father.

161
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,450
I'll try and then tell you how it is.

162
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,186
Are you like this
because you're spiritually strong

163
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,288
or were you just born brave?

164
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,824
If I have to answer, I'd say both.

165
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,494
Open the gate.

166
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,068
Come on out. Let's have a chat.

167
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,006
SEOUL GUDAM POLICE STATION

168
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,310
You need a new toner cartridge.
It's too faint.

169
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,949
FRIENDLY SERVICE GUDAM POLICE

170
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,121
-What are you doing?
-You saw it.

171
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,390
I just saved you.

172
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,028
You save lost souls

173
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,098
and I save reckless outlaws.

174
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,933
Isn't that nice?

175
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,103
So...

176
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,039
You want to shut me up with this?

177
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,807
You're very good at summarizing.

178
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,944
I'm actually being very nice to you now.

179
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,713
If you let me out,
I might make even a bigger mess.

180
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,248
Can you take it?

181
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,084
Whatever you say,
nothing is going to change.

182
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:13,886
Well, except one.

183
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,588
Your life. That will be a bit messed up.

184
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,992
Those are some mean things
to say to a priest.

185
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,995
Whatever I do, nothing is going to change,

186
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,163
so level with me.

187
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,099
Why Father Lee Yeong-jun?

188
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,669
I don't get the point of the question.

189
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,405
Why Father Lee Yeong-jun?

190
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,907
Because Father Lee Yeong-jun
committed crimes?

191
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,813
Until recently, he listened to your sins,

192
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,481
forgiven them, and embraced you with love.

193
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,918
Seriously, have you no heart at all?

194
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,453
I resent your tone.

195
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,655
I'm a prosecutor.

196
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,924
If he's a criminal, he's out.

197
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,426
You can go now.

198
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,162
I will get the autopsy done first.

199
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,631
Then everything will be over.

200
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,803
Just remember one thing.

201
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,739
If you ever cause trouble again
and show up before my eyes,

202
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,075
I won't let you off the hook
because you're a priest.

203
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,350
How could he just leave
when I wasn't done talking?

204
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,220
INVESTIGATION REPORT
FATHER LEE YEONG-JUN CASE

205
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,257
Your nose is as big as a fortune cookie.

206
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,593
You're a detective
of a violent crime squad.

207
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,328
How could you not protect yourself?

208
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,131
I had no idea a priest would attack--

209
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,834
This is a correct report
on Father Lee's case, right?

210
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,335
Yes, everything on the report is true.

211
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,771
-I want to hear from the one in charge.
-Yes, it's a correct report.

212
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,573
The church member
who were sexually assaulted and

213
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,442
the head of general affairs of the church
who can testify about the embezzlement.

214
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,845
-You have them, right?
-Yes? Yes.

215
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,982
Then all I need to do is
to trust the evidence and wrap it up.

216
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,057
If you agreed to go as the plan,
don't be such cowards!

217
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,159
You act like morons,
and I'll be the one to be fucked up.

218
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,061
This is not some kind of a joke!

219
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,863
I apologize, ma'am.

220
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,635
Why do you have to drive me mad
and ruin this?

221
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,440
Please, I beg you.
No more of this stupidity, okay?

222
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,209
-Especially you, Fortune Cookie.
-Yes, ma'am.

223
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,649
There's one thing to take care of first.

224
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,587
What do you mean?

225
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,989
Why can't we take the body?

226
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,025
The prosecution sent us an official note,
saying that there could be fabrication--

227
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,427
Who would fabricate...

228
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,228
That's bullshit.

229
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,798
You're allowed to take the body

230
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,966
in the morning on the funeral day
under police surveillance.

231
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,070
In that case, you need to submit documents
to prove the location of the burial.

232
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,571
This is unfair!

233
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,741
I don't care.
We will take the priest's body.

234
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,310
Father, this is going to make
a bigger problem.

235
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,645
Father.

236
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,282
Do we really have to stand guard here?

237
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,287
The prosecutor ordered us to.

238
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,090
This is why we shouldn't
have set the priest free.

239
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,392
There was no good reason to keep him.

240
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,294
Of course there was a good reason.

241
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,096
He destroyed my nose...

242
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,636
Oh, no.

243
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,005
Mortuary here. We have a Code Red.

244
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,310
Haven't you heard anything
from the reception?

245
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,379
I have, but I'm planning to not listen.
So step aside!

246
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,950
I really don't want to do this,

247
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,352
but if you keep acting like that,
I have to.

248
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,421
Why don't you turn it on
before you aim at me?

249
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,689
Oh, right.

250
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,692
Father, you're making this harder for us.

251
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,494
Is that any of my concern?

252
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,163
Hurry up!

253
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,899
Detective Bae,

254
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,067
what does Code Red mean?

255
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,201
Code...

256
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,704
Don't you watch any American shows?
Take a guess.

257
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,807
A priest is trying
to run off with the body.

258
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,008
"Run off", you say?

259
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,576
That's it. Come here.

260
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,044
Father.

261
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,018
See? This is why I said, "Code Red".

262
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,019
It means red alert.

263
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,688
Everyone, be careful.
This priest beats people up.

264
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,457
Be especially careful of your nose.

265
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,425
Step aside, brothers.

266
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,361
You step aside, Father.

267
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,630
If you keep doing this,
things are going to get ugly.

268
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,633
Shall we see who gets it uglier, then?

269
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,837
Look at him clenching his fist.

270
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,207
Father, let's just go back for today.

271
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,342
Please listen to him, Father.
Go back for today.

272
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,011
I don't want to.

273
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,015
Don't come any closer,
or I will shoot you.

274
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,384
-I'll shoot you on the count of three.
-Go on.

275
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,519
Do you think you can
knock me down with that?

276
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,620
One.

277
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
Two.

278
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,460
Father!

279
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,217
They set him free?

280
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,186
Yes, sir.
The prosecutor came and set him free.

281
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,722
Why did they set the nutjob free?

282
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,023
Who is the prosecutor?

283
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,292
She's Mr. Kang's direct subordinate.

284
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,461
Mr. Kang's direct subordinate?

285
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,496
Then why...

286
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,298
Hand it over.

287
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,267
Some chemistry we have, don't you think?

288
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,471
Yes, sir.

289
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,673
Why yes, sir.

290
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,409
I'll be there this evening.

291
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,711
Of course, sir.

292
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,913
Yes, sir. See you then. Bye.

293
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,717
Damn it.

294
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,552
Seriously.

295
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,788
I'm telling you, everyone's going crazy.

296
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,924
Father!

297
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,201
Father.

298
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,372
Are you okay, Father?

299
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,774
Gosh, it itches.

300
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,711
I'll shoot you on the count of three.

301
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,413
One.

302
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,515
Two.

303
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,289
He said he would shoot
on the count of three.

304
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,190
Didn't he shoot on two?

305
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,528
Let's go back to the church.

306
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,432
It's okay. You should rest a bit more.

307
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,567
I need to go somewhere.

308
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,803
What if you get tased again?

309
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,004
I'm not going to the mortuary.

310
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,912
ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE OF KOREA

311
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,722
I don't think
we can help you in any way for now.

312
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,991
It's too serious a matter.

313
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,260
Then are you saying
we keep Father Lee's body there?

314
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,197
We need to wait for the Archbishop
to make an official announcement

315
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,899
before we make any move.

316
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,670
Father, this is not
just a simple incident.

317
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,740
Evidence was fabricated. He was framed.

318
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,075
Father Kim.

319
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,143
If you claim his innocence

320
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,813
without any evidence,

321
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,883
you might get criticized
by the press and the public.

322
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,686
Please watch what you say.

323
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,389
I'm watching what I say.

324
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,524
Why won't you believe me?

325
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,594
I want you to check the facts first.

326
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,430
With Father Lee Yeong-jun gone,

327
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,800
don't you think checking the facts
is an ordeal by itself?

328
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,672
We decided to believe
the police announcement for now.

329
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,874
There's nothing more I can say.

330
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,711
-That's total nonsense!
-Please,

331
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,047
keep your voice down.

332
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,516
-Father, let's leave for now.
-Let go of me.

333
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,452
Let go of me!
Don't you know what he was like?

334
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,756
He has devoted and sacrificed himself
for his faith in God.

335
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,057
What you said is just nonsense!

336
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,426
How could you do this to him?

337
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,861
Let go of me!

338
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,630
I will reveal the truth! Let go of me!

339
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,931
Gosh.

340
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,703
They don't want the word
to spread further.

341
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,472
It's a sensitive issue.

342
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,642
Plus, he committed suicide,
which is the biggest sin--

343
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,812
Father Lee wouldn't commit
a sin like that and you know it.

344
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,591
Who are they?

345
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,326
I'm now in front of Gudam Cathedral.

346
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,761
As you can see, only the cold air

347
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,797
is surrounding the cathedral.

348
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,566
A cathedral staff just showed up.

349
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,068
-Over there.
-Hurry up.

350
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,769
Wait.

351
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,173
Shameless acts of crime
such as sexual assault and embezzlement

352
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,641
were committed in the Catholic church.

353
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,043
Weren't you aware of it at all, Fathers?

354
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,379
You can't speak so conclusively yet--

355
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,281
How was the embezzlement done,

356
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,949
and what was the money spent for?

357
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,152
Was it, by any chance,
used for an inappropriate relationship?

358
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,821
"An inappropriate relationship"?

359
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,856
Nonsense. Stop jumping to conclusions.

360
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,125
Would you like to say a word
to the sexually assaulted woman?

361
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,261
How will you apologize
to the betrayed church members?

362
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,763
Hey.

363
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,799
You didn't answer. Are you denying it?

364
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:25,070
Does the Catholic people intend to
whitewash the incident?

365
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,573
-Enough. You should go.
-Please say a few words.

366
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,874
-Go!
-Father, please say--

367
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,242
-Enough! Go away!
-Wait, Father.

368
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,343
-Go! All of you!
-A word.

369
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,312
-Stop shooting. Stop it!
-Please, Father!

370
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,215
The person I met today was not a priest.

371
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,284
It was the dark and ugly side
of the religious community.

372
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,386
I'm Reporter Oh Bo-yeong of UBS News.

373
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,358
His paused video
isn't any better than mine, is it?

374
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,093
He took away his own life...

375
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,428
What kind of goofy face is this?

376
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,031
Could you add more sugar?

377
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,333
Is it bitter?

378
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,136
Well, it's not bitter, but...

379
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,804
Okay. Two cubes?

380
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,906
-Three.
-Three?

381
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,677
My paused video
definitely looks better than that.

382
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,079
Not a priest.

383
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,681
It was the dark and ugly side
of the religious community.

384
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,253
This is just too unfair.

385
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,389
What does "the dark and ugly side
of the religious community" even mean?

386
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,328
You all heard about the orphanage, right?

387
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,897
Yes.

388
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,999
We were talking about it.

389
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,268
Then the news started,
so we were watching it.

390
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,608
Did Mr. Hwang really say that?

391
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,311
Yes, he said he and Father Lee

392
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,446
already made the deal.

393
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,949
What a load of bullshit.

394
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,084
Father.

395
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,121
I understand you're upset,

396
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,356
but please watch your language.

397
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,926
Did he say anything else?

398
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,831
He said he would do anything
that the children wanted.

399
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,301
He even sells bullshit for kids now.

400
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,103
Father, please. Language.

401
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,606
How else should I put it?
"He did such a noble deed"?

402
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,445
Sister.

403
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,748
Should we tell him?

404
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,384
About what Father Lee told us.

405
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,521
What is it?

406
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,725
As you know, Mr. Hwang's men
came to the church and made a scene.

407
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,961
And we told you

408
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,862
that they seemed to have come

409
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,498
to just mess with Father Lee
because they think he was a pushover.

410
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,100
And that wasn't the case?

411
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,670
Tell me.

412
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,672
Fine.

413
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,841
I promise I won't get mad. Tell me.

414
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,244
The thing is,

415
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,247
when Father Lee came...

416
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,950
Oh, right. Never let Father Kim
and Mr. Hwang's men

417
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,919
get in a conflict.

418
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,287
Never.

419
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,956
And you must not tell him
that Mr. Hwang's men come here

420
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,927
to win the management entrustment
agreement of our welfare organization.

421
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,830
If Father Kim finds that out,
there will be a big problem.

422
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,198
Do you understand?

423
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,066
Why didn't you tell me?

424
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,603
We just told you why.

425
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,640
He made sure that we keep it secret.

426
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,142
Then you should have told me
this morning at least.

427
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,777
There was no time--

428
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,380
What do you mean by no time?
Mealtime, breaks, toilet breaks.

429
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,481
There was plenty of time!

430
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,190
Goodness.

431
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,794
Gosh, this is the biggest crisis
I have ever met as a nun.

432
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,062
My goodness.

433
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,433
I'm sorry to give you such a trivial task.

434
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,036
No way.

435
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,772
All the tasks you give me
are equally important.

436
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,874
In that case, thank you very much.

437
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,510
By the way,

438
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,212
why did you let the young priest go?

439
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,349
I thought if I pushed too hard

440
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,217
it might cause trouble
with the religious community.

441
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,853
I'm sure you knew what you were doing.

442
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,189
By the way, sir,

443
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,560
about the evidence
of Father Lee Yeong-jun's crime,

444
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,595
who designed it?

445
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,664
It doesn't seem to be the police.

446
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,034
There's someone in Gudam out of office.

447
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,502
Do you want to meet that person?

448
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,705
No, sir. I was just curious.

449
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,241
Wrap it up nicely and prove yourself.

450
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,411
The Prosecutor General really liked you.

451
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,348
Impress him a couple more times.

452
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,751
Then your life as a prosecutor
is going to be much easier.

453
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,487
-Yes, sir.
-Cheers.

454
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,281
Hello. How have you been?

455
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:06,885
This is Kim Hae-il.

456
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,655
I know you tried hard, I do.

457
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:14,559
but if you did well from the beginning,
this wouldn't have happened, would it?

458
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,897
I apologize, sir.
I will not make the same mistake again.

459
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,733
Still, you designed it nicely.

460
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,369
My subordinates spoke highly of it too.

461
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,038
Anytime, sir.

462
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,507
I'm confident in plotting.

463
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,710
So we can take over the orphanage
and the welfare organization now, right?

464
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,879
Yes, you can take them over right away.

465
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,047
Make sure not to make any more mistakes.

466
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,817
There won't be any more second chances.

467
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,786
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

468
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,321
This wasn't part of the plan, though.

469
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,824
But with Father Lee gone,

470
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,561
I feel so much more comfortable.

471
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,264
Sometimes, accidents can be helpful.

472
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,767
Let's think God helped us.

473
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,935
Amen.

474
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,041
Now what? Do you want to bathe with us?

475
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,276
No, sir.

476
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:05,644
You can go now.

477
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,711
Yes, sir.

478
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,914
Please enjoy the sauna.

479
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,665
Well done. I know it's not easy
to deal with the old jerks.

480
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,866
Damn it.

481
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,803
You must be pretty pissed off.

482
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,773
I'm sorry I can't help you with it.

483
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,644
They're only living off the rice grains
on my spoon.

484
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,314
Who do they think they are to forgive me?
Fucking bastards.

485
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,849
Dong-ja, I swear.

486
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,685
When the right time comes,
I will cut their throats.

487
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,654
You can do whatever you like then.

488
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,090
Until then,

489
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,892
we don't have options.

490
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,260
Dong-ja.

491
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,929
Give me an award from the district.

492
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,931
Whether a good citizen award
or a good deed award.

493
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,833
What for?

494
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,068
To manage welfare organizations,

495
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,103
I need some sort of title.

496
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,443
Okay.

497
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,746
Let me make you a fancy one.

498
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,915
Let's have a big fancy award ceremony too.

499
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,049
Okay?

500
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,661
Long time no see.

501
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,297
We haven't met
since the Uyrkistan Operation, right?

502
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,832
How have you been?

503
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,333
It's always the same.

504
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,402
I struggle with dead bodies every day.

505
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,504
I heard you quit,

506
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,306
but I guess you're back.

507
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,576
What are you disguised as a pastor for?

508
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,314
I'm not under cover.
I'm Priest Michael now.

509
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,684
That's a fun new joke.

510
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,252
Kim Hae-il is a priest?

511
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,322
It's true. My baptismal name is Michael.

512
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,525
Are you going to go undercover
as a Buddhist monk next year?

513
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,993
Then you'll have to shave your head.

514
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,229
I said it's true!

515
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,169
How can you not believe
what a priest says?

516
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,270
Are you really a priest?

517
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,206
Agent Kim Hae-il

518
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,809
who killed 11 terrorists with a sword

519
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,844
has become a pastor?

520
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,113
I'm not a pastor. I'm a priest.

521
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,815
I will tell you the details later.

522
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,785
You have to go somewhere with me.

523
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,220
Of course I'll come for a drink.

524
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,622
We're not drinking.

525
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,657
You got hand tremors from that, remember?

526
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,728
Why have you become a pastor, of all?

527
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,030
I said I'm not a pastor. I'm a priest.

528
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,799
What's the difference?

529
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,901
They're different!

530
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,202
Gosh.

531
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,040
CHAPEL OF REST, OBSERVATION ROOM

532
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,243
That person must have injured badly.

533
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,113
He fell from a motorcycle

534
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,315
and a truck ran over his face.

535
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,859
The dent on the back of his head

536
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,394
indicates that this is blunt trauma.

537
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,995
We have to open the body to know for sure,

538
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,598
there's a high chance that the cause of
his death is subdural hemorrhage.

539
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,867
There are multiple fractures
all over his body,

540
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,802
which is obviously
because he fell from a cliff.

541
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,038
But this is the key.

542
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,976
If you look at the back of his neck,
you can see small scars.

543
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,945
-They're gathered here.
-Yes.

544
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,381
Look. When you look closely,

545
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,784
you'll see they're shaped like
small, regular straight lines.

546
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,387
This happens when one is punctured
by small glass shards.

547
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,025
And also, the bruise on his arm

548
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,761
might have been made
by someone holding his arm tightly

549
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:17,896
right before his death,

550
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,732
but it could just be
a regular senile purpura.

551
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,834
What do you think it is?

552
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,370
The former has a slightly higher chance.

553
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,772
A bruise caused by a grasp.

554
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,141
This should be enough
to get a warrant, right?

555
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,677
Usually, this should be more than enough.

556
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,548
But if they're the kind of people to
set guards near the body for their plot,

557
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,084
it doesn't seem
like a small-scale business.

558
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,254
What's taking him so long?

559
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:44,689
Who?

560
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,559
The staff who moves the body.

561
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,594
It's been 10 minutes
and he hasn't come out yet.

562
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,063
Ten minutes?

563
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,035
What took you so long?

564
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,970
Well...

565
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,740
I was praying for the deceased.

566
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,242
Do the staff do that?

567
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,813
Yes, praying is my hobby.

568
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,449
Why are you taking this body out again?

569
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,651
This is a different body.

570
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,154
It needs to be sent to the rural area.

571
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,989
Well, then.

572
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,059
CHAPEL OF REST, OBSERVATION ROOM

573
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,029
Why is a dead body wearing shoes?

574
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,500
I'm going to the convenience store.
Do you need anything?

575
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:29,768
I'll go, sir.

576
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,703
I want to get some fresh air too.
What do you need?

577
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,038
One hot bar and one cola please.

578
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,740
Right. Hot dog it is.

579
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,276
Dae-yeong, I said 1 hot bar and 1 cola.

580
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,088
Gosh, I knew something was off.

581
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,024
He is one persistent man.

582
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:54,959
What do I do?

583
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,195
I know. I will report it.

584
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,032
You're not going to use the taser gun,
are you?

585
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,901
I won't. I have only one cartridge.

586
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,008
If you want to talk to yourself,
at least be quiet.

587
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,677
I could hear you from down there.

588
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,013
Father, you've just made a big mistake.

589
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,949
Who is the man you came with?

590
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,284
An autopsy expert from the NFS.

591
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,752
NFS?

592
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,720
Then there was an illegal autopsy?

593
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,089
It wasn't an autopsy.
It was an external examination.

594
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,524
That's not allowed either.

595
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,527
Then report it and go to hell.

596
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,363
I'm a priest after all.

597
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,465
I could condemn you, at least.

598
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,437
You don't know what hell is like, do you?

599
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,074
Fire and brimstone?

600
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,009
Limb-cutting stools?

601
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,045
That's not hell.

602
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:52,116
It's to be born again
exactly as you are now.

603
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,687
And to live the exact same life.

604
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,025
Repeatedly.

605
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,999
You know I don't say things for no reason.

606
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,535
I have to go now.

607
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,139
Think about it.

608
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,414
Gosh, why the exact same life?

609
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,090
That sounds horrible.

610
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,293
I'm sure he made that up.

611
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,697
That's like the worst hell possible!

612
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,471
No way.

613
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,981
Your nose looks pretty swollen.

614
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,617
Leave.

615
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,486
Okay.

616
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,023
-Hey, part-timer.
-Yes, Detective.

617
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,491
You go to a Catholic church, right?

618
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,993
Yes, my given name is Yo-han
and my baptismal name is John.

619
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,995
I don't care.

620
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,399
Do you know what hell is like?

621
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:21,706
Hell is not about fire and brimstone
or limb-cutting stools.

622
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,277
It is to live the exact same life
repeatedly and endlessly.

623
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,478
Damn it.

624
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,114
I can give you a simpler explanation.

625
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:34,319
It's like being stuck in an endless loop
of a very painful life--

626
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,020
I get it! Go now!

627
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,456
Go!

628
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,092
I tried my best
to make it easy to understand.

629
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,928
-Go!
-I'm going.

630
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,197
-Go!
-Why are you yelling?

631
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,832
Go!

632
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,705
I heard there are children.

633
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,742
There are no children!
I already checked, you idiot!

634
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,443
Do you want to die? Throw it right now!

635
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,178
Throw the grenade, you idiot!

636
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,791
INFORMATION IS NATIONAL POWER

637
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:46,184
All the records of Agent Kim Hae-il of NIS

638
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:47,452
will be deleted.

639
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,122
You will be a regular young man.

640
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,558
This is all I can do to help you.

641
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,875
Please take a seat.

642
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,850
Are you here to pray?

643
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:54,619
No.

644
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,923
I came because I miss Father Lee.

645
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,628
Was Father Lee nice to you?

646
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,664
To me,

647
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,768
he was like an angel.

648
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,806
I came to this neighborhood
with only five thousand won.

649
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,210
I didn't have food or a place to stay.

650
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,750
But Father Lee gave me food
and let me stay here.

651
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,420
He also got me emproyed...

652
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,454
Emproyed?

653
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,856
Employed.

654
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,525
Right. He got me employed
at the Chinese restaurant.

655
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,462
I see. Where are you from?

656
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,598
I'm from Thailand.

657
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,333
Why did you come here?

658
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,069
I need to make a lot of money.

659
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,838
My mother and siblings are in Thailand.

660
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,782
I have eight siblings.

661
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,553
I see.

662
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,792
What's your name?

663
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,995
Songsak Tekaratanapeuraseoteu.

664
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,297
Songsak Terakara...

665
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,199
Songsak...

666
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,002
Songsak...

667
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,404
Do you have friends in the neighborhood?

668
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,573
Yes. Oh Yo-han.

669
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,377
He ate mocha bread during the Mass.

670
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,280
Gosh.

671
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,683
-All right. Take your time.
-Okay.

672
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,355
And let me know if the bullies
in the neighborhood bother you.

673
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:38,956
Okay.

674
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,992
Thank you.

675
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,661
All right.

676
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,701
Please punish the liars.

677
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,437
And please punish

678
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,608
the person who did
the bad thing to Father Lee.

679
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:02,847
I will.

680
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,400
There are others

681
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,468
that change the world by getting angry.

682
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:28,172
We are to change the world in our way.

683
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,930
Who is calling so early?

684
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,404
Prosecutor Park speaking.

685
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:06,977
Who?

686
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,752
This is annoying.
I didn't want to get up this early.

687
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,190
Why is he standing like that,

688
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,092
Looking all handsome?

689
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,370
What's the urgent thing you had to say?

690
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,273
I'll give you one last chance
to fix everything before sunrise.

691
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,009
Before the sunrise?
Is this The Wailing or what?

692
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,414
You're very creative at pestering others.

693
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:44,849
I admire you.

694
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,552
"Truth is sprung out of the earth
and justice hath looked down from heaven."

695
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,521
Psalm 85:11.

696
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,125
I want you to be faithful
and reinvestigate Father Lee's case

697
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,593
for righteousness and peace.

698
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,263
God knows everything.

699
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,265
What?

700
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,768
What are you saying?

701
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,404
The truth is not far away. It's around us.

702
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,540
I'm concerned about you,
a promising sister's future

703
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,375
so I give you a chance
to reveal the truth.

704
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,644
Don't worry about me, Father.

705
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,348
And the cringy emotional approach

706
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:18,983
won't work on me.

707
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,020
I'm not trying to be sly or anything.
As a follower of God--

708
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,522
Fine!

709
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,991
This is not important at all!

710
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,226
You came all the way here
at this time for that?

711
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,962
When will you head back?
I'm really sleepy.

712
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,166
-I was going to leave.
-Then bye.

713
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,372
Why am I awake?
I have three trials today. Gosh!

714
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,743
A man should stick to his way of living.

715
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,478
This is so not my way.

716
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:02,193
Again, I'm the first to come to work

717
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,828
Nobody is here

718
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,931
Seo Seung-a is diligent

719
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,071
Who is it?

720
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,340
This is Father Kim Hae-il.

721
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,443
Since you helped me once,
please help me once again.

722
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,381
Why are there mosquitoes in winter?

723
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:01,752
I got you now.

724
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,033
Sir.

725
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,270
Don't do this, Father.

726
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,138
Let me ask you one question.

727
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,576
Is it true that Father Lee embezzled
the church funds?

728
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,379
The police revealed it.

729
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,081
Please look into my eyes and tell me.

730
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:32,783
Is it true?

731
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,119
Yes, it is true.

732
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,055
But it doesn't make sense.

733
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,624
Father Lee owns nothing
but just a pair of shoes.

734
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,159
I don't know about that.

735
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,629
I just said what I knew.

736
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,166
Then...

737
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,369
tell me how Father Lee embezzled
the church funds

738
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,772
and for what purpose he used the money.

739
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,541
Well...

740
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,777
He asked me

741
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,446
to spare him some every weekend.

742
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,848
And I don't know
where he used all the money.

743
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,587
Are you going to keep stuttering?

744
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,857
If you're going to lie,
at least do it naturally.

745
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,493
Who is it?

746
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,129
Who asked you to testify such nonsense?

747
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,433
No one asked. I did as my conscience said.

748
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,171
"Conscience"?

749
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,273
Did you just say "conscience"?

750
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,875
Why on earth are you doing this?

751
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:33,877
How much did you receive?

752
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,146
I said I just did as my conscience said.

753
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,681
What do you mean by receive?

754
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,317
I'm also a Catholic.

755
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,030
If you come again,
I'll report to the police.

756
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,198
Don't come back, I mean it.

757
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,313
INVESTIGATION REPORT
FATHER LEE YEONG-JUN CASE

758
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,082
INVESTIGATION RECORDS

759
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,951
The priest is quiet today. It's unusual.

760
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,686
You didn't hear anything, did you?

761
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,855
No, I didn't, sir.

762
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,357
If something happens to him
or you hear something about him,

763
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,492
tell me right away.

764
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:23,761
Yes, of course.

765
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,497
All right, then.

766
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,366
Shall we go have jjajangmyeon?

767
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,002
-Pardon, sir?
-Jjajangmyeon.

768
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,171
Yes, sir.

769
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,042
Where do you work again?

770
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,678
In the investigation team
of the Archdiocese.

771
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,913
We investigate
crimes and corruption of churches.

772
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,049
That sounds tough.

773
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,820
I'm sure you're alarmed and flustered.

774
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,255
Of course.

775
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,757
Who would feel good about the situation?

776
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,194
I understand it's tough,

777
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,329
but could you explain
what happened that day again?

778
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,536
He held my hands,
saying he'd like to pray with me.

779
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,172
And while I was praying,
he suddenly touched my thigh.

780
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,207
That was so creepy.

781
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,576
I ran out of the place straight away.

782
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:19,950
The main hall.

783
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,387
I saw it happened
in the prayer room in the main hall.

784
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,557
There's a big window, where people can
see everything through from outside.

785
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,592
Of course the curtains were closed.

786
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,327
He wouldn't have done it with them open.

787
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,066
A window in the prayer room, you say?

788
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,571
Okay, that's that.

789
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,708
Although Father Lee Yeong-jun was old,

790
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,477
he was over 90kg,

791
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,312
so it must have been hard for you
to push him away.

792
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,747
Well...

793
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,515
In emergencies,

794
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,251
you can be incredibly strong.

795
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,587
Father Lee Yeong-jun, over 90kg?

796
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,823
This woman has never even met him.

797
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,794
Thank you for the interview.

798
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,564
So he met both of them?

799
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,967
Yes, sir.

800
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,437
Well, I'll be damned.

801
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,639
That priest just jumped over the line.

802
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,508
If we don't do anything about him,

803
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,077
he will probably keep visiting them.

804
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,479
Hey, Gojayev.

805
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,715
Stop eating and listen to me.

806
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,450
You have something to do.

807
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,829
He held my hands,
saying he'd like to pray with me.

808
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,298
And while I was praying,
he suddenly touched my thigh.

809
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,067
That was so creepy.

810
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,970
I ran out of the place straight away.

811
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,440
So what?

812
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,943
You know this is a total lie.

813
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,212
Father Lee Yeong-jun weighs over 90kg?

814
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,481
Many people fail to guess
others' weights by eye.

815
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,018
She said there was a window in the room
where there wasn't. What about that?

816
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,587
She was shocked,
so she could have been confused.

817
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,523
That's nonsense.
This woman doesn't even know Father Lee.

818
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,859
You're really persistent.

819
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,261
Then please interrogate the church's
head of general affairs again.

820
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,063
Isn't it strange
that he quit now, of all time?

821
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,266
Whether he quit or not is up to him.

822
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,303
Father, you're one creative man.

823
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,704
"Creative man"?

824
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,941
I have hard evidence here.

825
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,944
Father, this...

826
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,481
doesn't have any value. Do you know that?

827
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,852
To be blunt, this could be
a fabricated testimony made by a threat.

828
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,588
Do you think a priest would do that?

829
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,591
Assaulting a police officer
and attempted corpse theft.

830
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:44,595
Just these two are enough to make me
have zero trust in you.

831
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,196
Who would trust you?

832
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,031
Look, Prosecutor Park.

833
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,132
Goodness.

834
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,835
You're not calling me "old lady"
but "prosecutor".

835
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,604
You must be pretty upset now.

836
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,907
If this is now evidence,
what else is evidence?

837
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,041
Father.

838
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,078
This won't make
what doesn't exist the truth.

839
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,146
I told you before.

840
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,382
Nothing is going to change.

841
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,618
Could you please understand at once?

842
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,119
The game isn't over yet.

843
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,055
So hurry and investigate
the fake witnesses.

844
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,025
Ma'am, you should watch the TV.

845
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,727
Why? What happened?

846
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,430
We feel deeply sorry

847
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:23,200
about the disgraceful incident.

848
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,535
We will retrain the priests

849
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:29,406
so the same incident won't happen again.

850
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,408
We will reflect on ourselves...

851
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,044
It looks like you ended the game
from your side.

852
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,613
We will make sure to confirm

853
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:39,483
whether or not priests' sexual assaults
happened for real...

854
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,586
PROSECUTOR PARK GYEONG-SEON

855
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,913
How...

856
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,083
How is this fair?

857
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,954
They didn't even clarify the testimonies.

858
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,156
I will collect signatures in the diocese.

859
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,390
For the reinvestigation.

860
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,928
Please say something.

861
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:28,131
Or yell, Father!

862
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:31,635
Let's bury Father Lee first.

863
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,236
And then?

864
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,342
Father.

865
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:39,977
And we can't have...

866
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,514
a funeral Mass for Father Lee.

867
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,319
We can't bury him
in the Catholic Priests' Cemetery either.

868
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,221
But why?

869
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,991
After all he's done?

870
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,026
That's what the diocese said.

871
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,465
Poor Father Lee.

872
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,902
Why is this happening to such a saint?

873
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,271
Why?

874
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,910
Oh, dear God.

875
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,747
Let's find a place to lay him first.

876
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,429
GUDAM FUNERAL HALL

877
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,770
And in the Holy Spirit.

878
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,172
-Amen.
-Amen.

879
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:47,544
Brothers and sisters,

880
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,347
let's pray to God, our Father,

881
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:53,250
for Lee Yeong-jun, Gabriel.

882
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:57,721
-Lord, have mercy.
-Lord, have mercy.

883
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,257
Have mercy, Lord.

884
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,261
You are bestowed this award

885
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,330
for your outstanding sense of mission

886
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,100
and great contribution to Gudam District.

887
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,469
Director of Gudam District, Jeong Dong-ja.

888
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:18,308
PRIEST LEE YEONG-JUN, GABRIEL

889
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:14,884
Are you

890
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:17,654
feeling better now?

891
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,762
May I share

892
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,365
your pain, young man?

893
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,470
That's my hobby.

894
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,987
I'm sorry it took so long.

895
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,524
I tried my best,
but I'm not that good of a cook.

896
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,327
I hope they taste good to you.

897
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,697
Now, eat up.

898
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,701
Eat up.

899
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,315
MONSIGNOR GABRIEL LEE YEONG-JUN

900
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:55,652
Please watch over us next to God

901
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,055
and lead us, Father.

902
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,130
Wait there, Father.

903
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,200
I will take you to where you belong to.

904
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:11,835
I will.

905
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,639
Do we have to be around him
on a day like today?

906
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,509
We were told to keep an eye on him
until he leaves the grave.

907
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,078
We should rather be
praying for the deceased.

908
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,321
A wedding center in Gudam District

909
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,289
had an opening ceremony last month.

910
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,458
For low-income couples...

911
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,094
The funeral is over.
Now let's go to the award ceremony.

912
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,363
-It's receiving good responses.
-Why?

913
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,734
We can eat food and celebrate him there.

914
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,736
Gudam Group's entrepreneur...

915
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,972
Did your boss tell you to go? Are we--

916
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,241
It takes place in a hotel,
so it must be a buffet.

917
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,243
The winner of Best Entrepreneur Award

918
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:54,978
-is the CEO of Daebeom Trading,
-Let's go.

919
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,980
Hwang Cheol-beom.

920
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,749
The CEO of Daebeom Trading,
Hwang Cheol-beom,

921
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,985
is known for an entrepreneur
who has been greatly contributing

922
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,487
-Stop the car over there.
-to Gudam District.

923
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:06,589
-Pardon?
-He received credit

924
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,425
-Over there.
-for the contribution

925
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,026
and was chosen
as the winner of this award.

926
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:19,969
Where are you going?

927
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,772
Go ahead. I need to stop by somewhere.

928
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,176
You're not going to do something secretly,
are you?

929
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,412
No. I'll be right back.

930
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:48,665
HONORABLE ENTREPRENEUR
HWANG CHEOL-BEOM

931
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,534
HONORABLE ENTREPRENEURS
OF GUDAM-GU AWARDS CEREMONY

932
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,785
-You see, I do a little palm-reading.
-Oh, really, now?

933
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,253
This guy, really...

934
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,096
What brings you here?

935
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,866
-To congratulate your boss--
-We don't need it. Get lost.

936
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,640
You're one annoying religious man.

937
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,544
-Brother.
-Why?

938
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,246
If you hit a priest, you'll go to hell.

939
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,381
Is that so? Shall I go to hell then?

940
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,683
How do you want to get beat up, Father?

941
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,219
Hapkido? Tae kwon do?

942
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:45,421
Karate?

943
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,589
Karate looks cool, maybe that.

944
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,391
Have you ever heard

945
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:50,894
of capoeira?

946
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,729
You're not supposed to attack
while I get ready.

947
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:55,732
Now be amazed...

948
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,038
at my elegant moves.

949
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,089
What was that?

950
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,478
I can feel

951
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:43,613
the strong energy of Satan.

952
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,715
Listen, all ye devils.

953
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,652
You killed Father Lee Yeong-jun
and threw him off a cliff.

954
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,322
Anyway, if you want to mess with me,
you'd better be prepared.

955
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:56,559
Our church won't turn into
a historical site at this rate, will it?

956
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,094
I told you not to come here, old lady.

957
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,697
If you want spiritual healing,
go to a spa or have a good meal.

958
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,432
You probably all have heard from the news

959
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:05,468
about how a Catholic priest
committed those shameless crimes.

960
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:06,803
What?

961
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:09,205
You want me to cooperate with the priest?

962
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,274
