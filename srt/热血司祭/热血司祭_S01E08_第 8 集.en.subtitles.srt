1
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,320
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,688
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,292
I'm going to turn this place
into Maegakkyo's chapel.

4
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,398
He is a priest who hits people.

5
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,539
He's a devil!

6
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,809
A priest hit a man!

7
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,346
Father!

8
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,625
You're causing trouble again.

9
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,294
-Are you okay?
-Of course I am.

10
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,401
Who is that man with a scythe?

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,806
No one has a scythe.
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,187
CT scan results.

13
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,589
External force on the temporal region

14
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,391
caused him to lose consciousness.

15
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,026
It seems to be due to

16
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,628
a temporary brain dysfunction.

17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,668
What is the exact diagnosis?

18
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,470
Cerebral concussion.

19
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:48,141
So, what is that "cerebral", exactly?

20
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,076
It's a concussion of the brain.

21
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,278
A concussion of the brain?

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,215
Do you mean the concussion

23
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,118
where you feel dizzy and nauseous?

24
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,121
Yes, sir.
The results show that it's nothing major,

25
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,856
and he may leave right away
once he wakes up.

26
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,090
Then why...

27
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,825
EMERGENCY WARD

28
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,662
Why did you have to lower your voice
and make it sound so serious?

29
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,797
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,400
My voice is rather on the low side.

31
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,603
I don't want to go, Grandpa.

32
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,377
Does he usually sleep with his eyes open?

33
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,645
Grandpa.

34
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,413
I'm not going.

35
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,888
I should have been the one knocked over
by that baseball bat.

36
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,789
That would've finished everything off.

37
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,759
I was so worried you would get hurt, sir.

38
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,931
Those who are full of enlightenment

39
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,333
have high bone density, you see.

40
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,673
Nothing can hurt me.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,375
Woo-ta!

42
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,379
Still, that video I took

43
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,481
should be more than enough to report him.

44
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,250
How dare a priest go around
swinging baseball bats at people?

45
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,386
That's practically giving up
being a priest.

46
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,054
If he doesn't want to be a priest,

47
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,523
-he can be a nun.
-"Nun"?

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,791
Tell him he can be a "nun."

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,261
-A "nun," instead?
-He can be a "nun."

50
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,598
-Give me that phone.
-Oh yes, the phone.

51
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,967
I took it from a great angle.

52
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,970
That priest lacks self-discipline.
He's practically Satan!

53
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,039
Satan!

54
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,881
My phone's not in here.

55
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,050
This is no time to joke.

56
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,351
I'm not joking.

57
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,086
My phone's gone. What do I do?

58
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,727
-Go find it.
-Yes, sir.

59
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,696
I'll find it, sir.

60
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,131
Oh, no!

61
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,435
Damn it!

62
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,807
As you already know,

63
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,309
Father Kim has quite the temper.

64
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,478
He has anger issues.

65
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,881
He couldn't keep it in

66
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,984
and held up that baseball bat.

67
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,653
At that moment,
I realized something was wrong.

68
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,990
I ran right over
and rammed my head into it.

69
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,157
Bam!

70
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,860
You sacrificed your own self!

71
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,297
It's such a relief that it ended well.

72
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,099
Thank you so much, Detective Gu.

73
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,268
Lord, thank you so much!

74
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,302
Yes, you're right.

75
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,472
I also think it was so wise of him.

76
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,841
It could've turned into a nightmare.

77
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,676
I'm outraged with Prophet Ki,

78
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,878
but I support your decision as well.

79
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,713
Wisdom and wits

80
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,350
always show their power
at the most dangerous moment.

81
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,319
Oh, that's right.

82
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,188
That sidekick of Ki

83
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,191
who looks like that witch from Snow White
took a video on her phone.

84
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,628
I'm sorry, sir.

85
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,697
MAEGAKKYO CHOSEN AS STATE RELIGION
IN REPUBLIC OF UMBAGA

86
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,769
-Quiet.
-Yes, sir.

87
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,270
Is it really gone?

88
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,007
I looked everywhere, sir.
Please just kill me!

89
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,909
I'm sorry!

90
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:11,978
You!

91
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,449
My gosh.

92
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,384
Woo-ta!

93
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,652
My gosh.

94
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,691
Quiet!

95
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,193
Who cares about that video?
Why are you so worried?

96
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,161
That's not it, Father.

97
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,697
This could turn into a serious dispute.

98
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,598
What do we do?

99
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,035
All those cult members
will rush to the Catholic church.

100
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,906
Excuse me...

101
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,549
Isn't that the witch's phone?

102
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,517
Oh my goodness!

103
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,786
Wait a minute, did you...

104
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,823
Did you steal it?

105
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:01,127
Well, I didn't mean to...

106
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,429
But I guess I did...

107
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,499
I couldn't just stand there and watch.

108
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,670
She was recording everything, so...

109
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,017
If you didn't return it to her then
and there,

110
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,653
then it's considered stealing.

111
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,055
Oh, Lord.

112
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,423
What do I do?

113
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,426
Am I a sinner now?

114
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,528
Lord...

115
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,630
This is a complete mess.

116
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,399
You didn't steal it.

117
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,671
You only picked up a lost phone
at the orphanage

118
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,574
and turned it in

119
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,211
to the police. Am I correct?

120
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,914
Yes, sir.

121
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,384
This is it! What a smooth process!

122
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,987
Yes, no doubt.

123
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,323
Thank you so much, Detective Gu.

124
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,925
Thank you, Lord!

125
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,761
It's the least I can do
as a police officer.

126
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,730
Police officer, my ass.

127
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,605
Gosh...

128
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,643
Why would he act like that
when everyone's being so supportive?

129
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,611
It's not like it's anything new.

130
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,114
We need to excuse him.

131
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,449
-Yes, sir.
-Sure.

132
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,657
-Hello?
-Detective Gu, have you heard?

133
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,226
-What?
-About Prosecutor Park.

134
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,328
She was assigned to the Yeongwol office.

135
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,831
-Do you know why?
-No, sir.

136
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,200
I just overheard it from a team leader.

137
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,569
Okay. Thanks for the news.

138
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,577
Please, I beg you.
No more of this stupidity, okay?

139
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,345
Especially you, Fortune Cookie.

140
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,183
That's what she gets for playing smart.

141
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,357
Was the accident that bad?

142
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,893
Yes, the bat knocked him out on the head.

143
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,531
I think he should get another checkup.

144
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,002
THE DAUGHTER OF YEONGWOL,
PARK GYEONG-SEON'S GLORIOUS COMEBACK

145
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,440
What's with all those papers?

146
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,475
I have two more boxes.

147
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,314
My gosh! It is her.

148
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,116
It really is his daughter.

149
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,485
You're Gyeong-seon, aren't you?

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,154
Don't you recognize me?

151
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,057
I'm Sun-nam's dad. We were neighbors
when you were in middle school.

152
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,193
This is great.

153
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,662
No wonder he's been boasting around
these days.

154
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,796
I know.

155
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,766
You should've given us a call beforehand.

156
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,435
Everything turned out so great for you!

157
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,970
Hey!

158
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,805
Don't be so rude to the prosecutor.

159
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,608
Excuse me. I'm working right now.

160
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,744
-So could you--
-I'm so happy to see you, too.

161
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,079
Hey. Doesn't this call for a feast?

162
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,849
Of course. We have to call the whole town.

163
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,219
Have you tried the beef here?

164
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,688
It's the best ever, ma'am.

165
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:16,856
-Prepare the beef.
-Gosh.

166
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,828
Do you know how fighting dog owners

167
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,366
used to tame the wildest dogs?

168
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,772
They stuff a hot boiled radish
into the dog's mouth

169
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,742
and force it shut so it can't let go.

170
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,145
It hurts like hell.

171
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,849
They cry in agony
and burn their whole mouths.

172
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,484
And have all their teeth fall out?

173
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,921
But the funny thing is,

174
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,758
once the radish is removed,

175
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,162
they become as tame as ever.

176
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,564
So,

177
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,469
are you saying you stuffed a hot radish
into Prosecutor Park's mouth?

178
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,705
Gosh, it must've burned.

179
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:10,142
It wasn't that hot. Just a slight sting.

180
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,715
You didn't tell Mr. Hwang

181
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,950
about recruiting Prosecutor Park, did you?

182
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,486
Of course, not. I didn't tell him.

183
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,587
Good job.

184
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,157
Fighting dogs can get quite attached

185
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,693
to their territory.

186
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,533
If only she hadn't lost that phone...

187
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,437
-I'm sorry, Mr. Hwang.
-Shut the fuck up, you fool.

188
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,908
You stay out of everything from now on.

189
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,881
I hope nothing happens

190
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,150
to Wangmat Food.

191
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,854
How are they running it

192
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,922
for it to be in trouble all the time?

193
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,094
I heard that priest guy
is going to show up again tomorrow.

194
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,363
That pretty boy.

195
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,800
He's practically Satan in disguise.

196
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,339
Hey,

197
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,143
I heard that Prosecutor Park
was sent to the Yeongwol office.

198
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,278
Why?

199
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,081
It's just that tough
at the Central district office.

200
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,016
Of course, she was kicked out.

201
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,851
I mean, why are you telling me this?

202
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,354
She goes to church here.

203
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,724
Aren't you interested in your people?

204
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,793
I'm not.

205
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,697
Where are we headed to now?

206
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,965
We're free. Go home.

207
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,969
The others are worried sick about you,

208
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,404
so please spare yourself.

209
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,075
Do you think I can spare myself
for this job?

210
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,445
And who told you to give me a lecture?

211
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,747
I'm not giving you a lecture.
I'm just worried for you--

212
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:55,881
Worried?

213
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,817
You? For me?

214
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,786
How ridiculous.

215
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,457
Gosh, how could you be so insensitive?

216
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,662
You're not the type of person to protect
or worry about others.

217
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,133
Fine. I'm not.

218
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,571
But I at least have the smallest amount
of consideration for others.

219
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,073
Do you think I'm some kind of psychopath?

220
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,716
Damn it. Why's he the one getting pissed?

221
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,257
Most of them are about development.

222
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,725
That's right, ma'am.

223
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,360
They said the hot spring exists.

224
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,028
Then they said it doesn't,

225
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,563
and then they said it does again.

226
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,832
So everyone purchased the land,

227
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,634
but then they said it doesn't again!

228
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,369
Everyone's fighting over each other,

229
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,772
saying it's a fraud
and blaming whoever they can--

230
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:53,939
Enough!

231
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,208
Just let me get some rest until today.

232
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,578
-Where's the housing?
-The housing...

233
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,882
We do have company housing,

234
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,684
but the boiler broke down,
so it's under renovation.

235
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,986
The rooms are freezing cold.

236
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,187
So...

237
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,122
You may have to

238
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,858
spend a few days somewhere else.

239
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,927
Somewhere elsewhere?

240
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,964
SEJONG MOTEL

241
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,602
Fine. It may be a bit run-down,
but as long as it's quiet.

242
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,576
You two are dead meat today.

243
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,311
How dare you, in broad daylight?

244
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,079
You're dead meat.

245
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,514
-Please, ma'am!
-Come here!

246
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,682
Please!

247
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,319
Bullshit.

248
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,135
I heard that Prosecutor Park
was sent to the Yeongwol office.

249
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,771
What if the pope suddenly comes

250
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,539
and checks the progress?

251
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,075
What if he says,
"What have you done until now?"

252
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,110
Father.

253
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:09,648
Please help this ignorant child of God
get to his senses.

254
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,296
Damn it, it burst.

255
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,502
That's disgusting.

256
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,805
Gross, damn it.

257
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,476
Why are these roaches
the size of squirrels?

258
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,046
Gosh.

259
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,822
Ma'am.

260
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,690
Ma'am.

261
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,525
Who is it?

262
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,694
It's us, again.

263
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,663
Your father's friends.

264
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,300
I told you, I don't need a welcome party.

265
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,168
We can't let that happen, though.

266
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,471
We made reservations, so let's go.

267
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,106
Forget it.

268
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,040
Besides,

269
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,342
I'm a vegetarian.

270
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:11,977
What did she say?

271
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,613
She said her stomach's going to explode.

272
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,415
Her stomach's going to explode?

273
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,051
We can't let that happen.

274
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,253
Will you just leave, already?

275
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,022
Hurry up and go back home!

276
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,624
What did she say now?

277
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,593
Her back hurts.

278
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,194
We can't let her back hurt.

279
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,065
All right, then. We'll get going.

280
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,101
She can't be too different
from her father.

281
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,569
I'm sure she has quite a temper.

282
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,238
I guess she isn't feeling well.

283
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,508
The food is amazing today.

284
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,345
I have to fast again starting tomorrow.

285
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,148
What is it this time?

286
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,450
Something about recording
the Pro-Japanese's whereabouts.

287
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,152
We have to go against that as well.

288
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,620
Those crazy fools.

289
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,121
Why would they do that?

290
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,289
We can't let that happen!

291
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,525
Record, my ass! It's all in the past.

292
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,893
What a waste of taxes.

293
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:06,098
By the way, about that food distributor
that was on the news.

294
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,099
Yes, sir.

295
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,368
I heard the owner is the nephew
of Maegakkyo's leader.

296
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,769
Yes, sir. That is correct.

297
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,272
Make sure they don't cause us any trouble

298
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,008
with their problems. All right?

299
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,643
Yes, sir. I'll keep that in mind.

300
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,211
Oh, that's right.

301
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,415
What happened about that prosecutor
joining us?

302
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:24,984
What?

303
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,290
What are you talking about?

304
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,158
You know, that colleague of yours.

305
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,794
Didn't you say you were going to
bring her in?

306
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,129
Mr. Nam.

307
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,998
Enjoy your meal, sir.

308
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,072
I guess I was mistaken.

309
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,841
Not as a member,

310
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,477
but as a consultant.

311
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,911
Yes, that is correct.

312
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,283
Enjoy your dinner, everyone.

313
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,503
Brother Yo-han?

314
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,708
Brother Yo-han?

315
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,513
Hello, Father.

316
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,049
When do you get your sleep
if you work around the clock?

317
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,583
I get my naps now and then.

318
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,685
I'm not much of a sleeper, you see.

319
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,554
That's going to kill you one day.

320
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,256
Go out and get some exercise,

321
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,524
and get some good sleep, too.

322
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:39,992
God can't help you out

323
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,395
if you're lacking exercise and sleep.

324
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,664
All right, Father. Thank you.

325
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,574
Do you...

326
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,445
really hear better

327
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,847
when you eat well?

328
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,483
Yes. It might be hard to believe,
but it's true.

329
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:07,786
Then how about

330
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,923
we work together?

331
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,059
I feel like I'm Lee Jung-jae in New World.

332
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,064
What is it, Father?

333
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,866
Going to Wangmat Food tomorrow?

334
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,701
Yes. I'm going to quit tomorrow.

335
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,071
Now that I think of it,
it really is a shitty company.

336
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,307
No, don't quit. Keep working for now.

337
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,882
Listen to me carefully.

338
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,888
Don't look at me like that. It's creepy.

339
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,061
There's something

340
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,596
you have to listen to.

341
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,998
Something I must listen to?

342
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,305
Finish eating after I tell you.

343
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,857
There you go.

344
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,293
Get it!

345
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,301
Get it! Come on!

346
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,441
Oh, yeah!

347
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,514
Thank you for the lecture
in the middle of the night.

348
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,449
I will give you this
instead of an offering today.

349
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,486
But his life is much normal
than I expected.

350
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,656
I'm sure there must be something.

351
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,926
But how did he manage to track them down?

352
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,328
He doesn't work for the government.

353
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,466
How have you been?

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,469
You're still over at the NIS, right?

355
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,406
I still have a long way to go
before I can return to the prosecution.

356
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,640
Why?

357
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,210
Can I ask you a favor, then?

358
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,680
You want to ask me a favor?

359
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,248
What is it?

360
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,484
I need you to do
a full background check on someone.

361
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,420
With your data.

362
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,172
All right.

363
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,747
This is amazing, Father Han.

364
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,450
What in the world have you done
to the ramyeon?

365
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,118
For the first time in my life,

366
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,587
I followed the recipe
on the back of the package.

367
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,422
That's why you need to follow the rules.

368
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,590
Tell me about it.

369
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,560
I shouldn't just follow the ways
of the Lord,

370
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,329
but also the ways of the ramyeon company.

371
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,430
Amen.

372
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,066
This

373
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,636
will go great with soju.

374
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,237
Would you like a shot?

375
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,572
No, thank you.

376
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,242
Father.

377
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,178
About Detective Gu...

378
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,783
Yes? What about him?

379
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,919
I have a rough idea about why the police

380
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,454
put Detective Gu as your partner.

381
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,357
And I also know that he's not on our side.

382
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,192
Then why would you act like that?

383
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,362
You took his side all-day
and even fed him.

384
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,698
Damn it...

385
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,267
Don't get mad, sir.

386
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,202
What I wanted to say is

387
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,471
after spending these few days with him,

388
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,141
Detective Gu just seems to be
someone dependent, not evil.

389
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,043
Dependant on drugs, you mean.

390
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,244
His eyes get bleary

391
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,046
and then they suddenly go like this.

392
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,948
He's the type who only tries to get smart.

393
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,484
His eyes do go like this all of a sudden.

394
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,585
That's right. Like this.

395
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,586
Yes, sir.

396
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,355
But if you can bless him

397
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,123
and slowly warm his heart up,

398
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,193
don't you think he could
end up on our side?

399
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,630
We're well off on our own
without that jerk.

400
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,865
And what do you think I am, a furnace?

401
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,041
Blessing isn't something
you give out like candy.

402
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,511
It's the medicine that will warm
their cold hearts.

403
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,779
We should wait.

404
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,218
So please don't say anything

405
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,487
that might be too harsh on him.

406
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:50,635
You're not the type of person to protect
or worry about others.

407
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,172
Fine. I'm not.

408
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,543
But I at least have the smallest amount
of consideration for others.

409
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,580
Gosh.

410
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,016
Damn it.

411
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,487
Gosh!

412
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,589
Why is this so uncomfortable?

413
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,792
The weather must've gone mad.

414
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,861
Why is it so cold when it's almost spring?

415
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,230
Shit!

416
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,564
Would you like some eggs, sir?

417
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,135
You could've at least made some noise.

418
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,404
It seemed like you were lost
in your thoughts,

419
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,738
so we didn't want to bother you.

420
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,274
Eat up, sir.
It's one minute past the expiration date.

421
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,279
Working as a detective,

422
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,915
I see so many ugly things in this world

423
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,784
that put me in distress.

424
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,388
I'm not sure what that means,
but you really are cool.

425
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,258
Can you cut that out, already?

426
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,694
There are so many people
who are much greater than I am.

427
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,829
You know what, sir?

428
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,231
The bigger the star,
the sooner it burns out.

429
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,435
It's because bigger stars have
a wider range of hydrogen fusion,

430
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,069
so it wears out quickly.

431
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,305
It's my brain that's about to wear out.

432
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,373
What are you talking about?

433
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,008
I mean,
you're going to burn strong and long,

434
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,143
just like a small star.

435
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,346
Even if you may not shine as bright
or stick out.

436
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,217
At least tell me the reason.

437
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,754
Why do you think I'm so great?

438
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:18,957
You're not scary,

439
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,326
and you seem like a good guy.

440
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,163
Even when you're a strong
violent crime detective

441
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,364
I agree.

442
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,433
How would you know
if I'm a good guy or not?

443
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,771
I've seen more bad guys than good guys,

444
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,840
so I can tell who's bad.

445
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,077
You're a good guy. A great guy.

446
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,714
What was I expecting?

447
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,817
-Our regular's here.
-What?

448
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,987
In exactly five seconds,
a lady will arrive.

449
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,088
To buy a lunch box.

450
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,364
She's really here.

451
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,366
See you. See you, sir.

452
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:05,370
Hey, how did you know that?
Do you have some kind of superpower?

453
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,405
I heard her shoes in my ears.

454
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,643
That pig.

455
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,812
He was stuffing his face earlier.

456
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,349
-You get lost, too.
-Yes, sir.

457
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,185
See you, sir.

458
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,423
What's wrong with those fools?

459
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,762
PUNK-ASS PRIEST

460
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,030
We need to talk.

461
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,600
What would he have to say at this hour?

462
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,271
Hun-seok.

463
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,741
I think a tough match will come
rolling in, soon.

464
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,276
Is it

465
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,646
a new member, by any chance?

466
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,449
If we're stronger,

467
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,120
it won't be as tough.

468
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,723
If not, then we will be the ones to go.

469
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:05,397
By the way,
Dong-ja's a complete player now.

470
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,771
Did you see this?

471
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,007
Take a look at this.

472
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,411
One of our henchmen took this
on the streets.

473
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,513
Is he really a detective?

474
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,014
He seems like an idiot.

475
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,483
In my hometown Russia,
we tie idiots like these to cows

476
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,485
and send them to--

477
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,023
Damn it, that fool.

478
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,059
You can't trust him with anything.

479
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,273
I said something

480
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,443
that wasn't like me, earlier.

481
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,713
I would like to express my regret.

482
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,782
What was it you said?

483
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,084
Oh, that's right.

484
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,087
"You're not the type of person to protect
or worry about others."

485
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:03,822
That's for a fact.

486
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,757
You are absolutely correct.
That's who I am.

487
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,460
Like I said,

488
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,363
I would like to express my regret.

489
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,565
You were only telling me

490
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,100
the cold and plain truth.

491
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,434
Why would you express your regret?

492
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,204
And why are you saying it
like some spokesperson?

493
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:27,646
I'm sorry.

494
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,516
-What?
-I said I'm sorry.

495
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:33,718
What was that?

496
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,521
Fine, I made a mistake! I'm sorry!

497
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,425
You crushed my sincere thoughts.

498
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,560
Regret, my ass.

499
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,463
Stop whining and just take the apology,
will you?

500
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,798
Stop taking advantage of me.

501
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,401
Are you getting mad at me right now?

502
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,169
No, I'm not.

503
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,570
And also,

504
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,473
stop trying to take care of me
or help me out.

505
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,176
I can help you out
in an emergency like today, can't I?

506
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,779
Just don't!
Why do you keep talking back these days?

507
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,714
You may be "Father",
but I'm a year older than you!

508
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,115
How dare you treat me like that?

509
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,717
Stop tagging along if it annoys you, then.

510
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,985
Send out Detective Seo.

511
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,153
No way.

512
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,555
I won't let you tempt a newbie
into getting in trouble.

513
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,357
"Tempt"?

514
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,793
Forget about the apology and regret.
Just get out of here!

515
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,695
My butt was getting cold, anyway!

516
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,596
I don't want your apology, either.

517
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,098
You're so cheap.

518
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,368
Did you just call me cheap?
Is that what you said?

519
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,770
Yes, why? Are you going to hit me?

520
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,805
Go ahead, then.

521
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,440
Hit someone who just had a concussion.

522
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,708
Just not on the nose.

523
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,977
-Why, you little...
-Go ahead!

524
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,045
Father.

525
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,849
You two should get along.

526
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,486
"It's something
you've never tasted before.

527
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,987
Is it fried chicken or galbi?"

528
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:44,889
Chicken and beer?

529
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,639
Who would call that an apology?

530
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,541
He can't even bear to swallow his pride.

531
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,778
Who's calling me at this hour?
Doesn't he know--

532
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,686
Yes?

533
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,768
That was a perfect score.

534
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,772
Are you having fun these days?

535
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,443
You get excused from work
for being that priest's minion,

536
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,914
and you loaf around
and crack your head open while drinking.

537
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,716
Yet, you're still enjoying yourself.

538
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:49,120
Even when that priest raided Maegakkyo
and Wangmat Food,

539
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,156
you just stood there watching everything.

540
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,058
-No, sir, that's not it--
-Shut the hell up.

541
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,796
Didn't I make it clear for you?

542
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,999
I told you to keep a good eye
on him and mess it all up.

543
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:04,402
You've only been making
a fool of yourself.

544
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,874
Hey. Am I a joke to you?

545
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,312
That must've hurt.

546
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,513
Get up.

547
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,050
Gu Dae-yeong.

548
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,020
I'll tell you one last time,
so you'd better listen.

549
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,357
Hurry up and make that priest flee.
Understand?

550
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,592
Yes, sir.

551
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,261
Make sure to throw the bait properly

552
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,063
so he can't get to Wangmat Food.

553
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,431
Yes, sir.

554
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:34,966
Take a look.

555
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,869
If you don't listen and act out again,

556
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,305
your dead friend's wife

557
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,174
and the kid

558
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,612
will both be buried away somewhere
no one can find.

559
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,815
Got it?

560
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,355
I've seen that look before.

561
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,962
It's that same look from back then.
The one that makes me want to kill you.

562
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:15,006
Get it right this time.

563
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,198
Hurry up!

564
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,966
Hurry!

565
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,074
There are Russians watching us.

566
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,242
Just keep going!

567
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,477
Why are they so fast?

568
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,814
Gosh.

569
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,151
Come here.

570
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,455
What's this?

571
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,824
Why are these bastards blocking the way?

572
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,227
Hey, we're not here for you.

573
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,461
Get out of the way.

574
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,031
Get out, you jerks.
Before we kill you all.

575
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,565
He said he's going to kill you.

576
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,402
Damn it.

577
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,446
That...

578
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:31,716
Back off!

579
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,285
Yeong-cheon, go and get him.
I'll take care of here.

580
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,254
How are you going to take them all?

581
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,022
Don't you see me?

582
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,658
Damn it.

583
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,271
Come and get me, you jerks!
I'm going to kill you all!

584
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,584
Yeong-cheon!

585
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:11,856
Yeong-cheon!

586
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,662
Yeong-cheon!

587
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,900
Stop!

588
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,575
Yeong-cheon. Hey!

589
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,276
Yeong-cheon!

590
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,580
Yeong-cheon! What...

591
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,781
Yeong-cheon...

592
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,518
You bastards!
I'm going to throw you all in!

593
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,221
Are you an officer, sir?

594
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,892
Those bastards.
How dare they screw with the police.

595
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,327
Who did this?

596
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,396
Yeong-cheon.

597
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,664
Yeong-cheon, wake up!

598
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,234
Why don't you throw them in later

599
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,302
and take this guy to the hospital first?

600
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:02,507
Stay put, you bastards.
I'm going to kill you all!

601
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,842
Yeong-cheon. Get up, Yeong-cheon.

602
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,813
Yeong-cheon, it's okay.

603
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,848
Just hang in there, all right?

604
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,453
What is it?

605
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,322
Don't die.

606
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,124
What?

607
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,429
Don't die.

608
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,066
You fool.

609
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,270
All right, you fool.
I won't die, so hang in there.

610
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,307
Hang in there, Yeong-cheon.

611
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,729
What do you think you're doing?

612
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,965
-Sir!
-I said be careful with the Russians.

613
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,400
I told you to report to me first!

614
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,836
How am I supposed to report everything
when I'm chasing the suspect?

615
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:05,736
Shut up.

616
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:09,006
You're the one that killed Yeong-cheon.

617
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,843
-How can you even call yourself
-What?

618
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:12,910
a chief?

619
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,279
-You punk!
-How could you?

620
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,581
What's all this noise?

621
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:30,928
That son of a...

622
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,897
-Please, sir.
-Let go of me.

623
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,533
That bastard's gang killed Yeong-cheon.

624
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,434
All right, just wait!

625
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,036
That bastard's gang killed Yeong-cheon.

626
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,471
All right, I get it!

627
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,362
Okay.

628
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,865
I won't die, as you said.

629
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,170
I won't let those around me die, either.

630
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,148
What the heck?

631
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,551
Am I the only one here again?

632
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,055
I'm the first one to check in again

633
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,857
No one is here

634
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,861
What? Dae-yeong.

635
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,130
Did you spend the night here?

636
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,932
Why didn't you go home?

637
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,935
My chest is still throbbing.

638
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,370
-Are you hurting somewhere?
-Yes, I am.

639
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,408
Both my body and heart are hurting.

640
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,911
What time is it?

641
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,080
It's 8:40 a.m.

642
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,615
I should hurry up.

643
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,717
Aren't you going to wait for Father?

644
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,652
I'm boycotting him today.

645
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,021
What now?

646
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,924
If he wants to go somewhere,
you go with him. Okay?

647
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,493
But we might raid Wangmat Food today.

648
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,196
-Whatever.
-Dae-yeong!

649
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,297
Whatever!

650
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,068
This is why it's impossible to like him.

651
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,304
If I'm gone, then he'll miss me.

652
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,607
Let's see how messy things can get.

653
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,443
That will be 1,000 won.

654
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,346
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Enjoy.

655
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,351
Hello?

656
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,920
I checked on that person you asked about.

657
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,855
-Who is this guy?
-Why?

658
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,758
The initial information
matches what you told me,

659
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,360
but when I tried to take a closer look,

660
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,695
it says I don't have the authority
to view it.

661
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,330
What does that mean?

662
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,667
It means he's not just any person.

663
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,736
He could be a North Korean
under protection,

664
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,571
or he could've worked with us.

665
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,841
Or maybe someone
who can't reveal his identity.

666
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,494
Yes, Sister?

667
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,663
Yes.

668
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:25,002
I just got a call from Eun-ji's hospital.

669
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,972
They said they're going to kick her out

670
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,974
if the bills aren't paid by today.

671
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,843
What do we do, Father?

672
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,348
Damn it.
I came out so I wouldn't have to see him.

673
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,817
Where is he going
with that scowl on his face?

674
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,123
ACCOUNT BALANCE CHECK

675
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,906
Certainly not, Father.

676
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,474
Please do me a favor, sir.

677
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,209
I'll pay you two million won now.

678
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,011
Please give me three days
to pay for the rest.

679
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,647
It has to be paid in full
in order for it to go through the system.

680
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,650
If you can't get it paid by today,
we're going to discharge her.

681
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:15,619
Please excuse us this one time.
Please help us out.

682
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,322
This isn't anything new to me.

683
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,659
If I help you out,
I know it won't be the last time you ask.

684
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,627
Take care of this for me.

685
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,162
Don't be like that, sir.

686
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,431
Please, it's just this one time.

687
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,134
We can't let anything slide
because of personal reasons, sir.

688
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,069
Don't you see that I'm begging here?

689
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,839
It's not like I'm saying I won't pay.
She's just a kid!

690
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:35,940
Please, sir.

691
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,842
Come on...

692
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,878
Hello, Detective Gu.

693
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,882
Why are you being so hard on him?

694
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,518
Have you ever seen a swindling priest?

695
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,719
Because I haven't.

696
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,690
Don't act like that
and just spare him a week.

697
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,926
This isn't up to me, sir.

698
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,095
If something goes wrong,
they're going to censure me.

699
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,433
When you got caught
for calling those ladies at the karaoke,

700
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,934
someone let you out the back door.

701
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,237
Who was that?

702
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,772
PATIENT AFFAIR TEAM

703
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,275
Gosh, why would you bring that up here?

704
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,744
“Thou shalt not commit adultery.”

705
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:14,945
Goodness...

706
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,447
One week. Okay?

707
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,616
Sir, they're going to cut my salary.

708
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,384
I'll be censured.

709
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,754
"That's a perfect score!"

710
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,393
No need to thank me.

711
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,328
Let's not embarrass each other.

712
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,297
Sure.

713
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,500
But how are you going to keep managing
all those bills?

714
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,869
The person responsible
will have to manage.

715
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,272
Who would do that?

716
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,140
Do me a favor.

717
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:46,110
It won't make much of a difference
no matter what you do,

718
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,114
but just stay out of this problem.

719
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,584
When did I ever do anything?

720
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,152
She's just a kid.

721
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,056
If something goes wrong,
what about her life?

722
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,794
She's an orphan
and the world is being so harsh on her.

723
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,864
She needs to be healthy, at the least.

724
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:15,906
I don't care what you do
with any of my problems.

725
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,808
Just do it after I settle her situation.

726
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,011
I'll gladly accept anything then.

727
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,449
What did I even do to you?

728
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,785
You're going to do something, aren't you?

729
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,388
Anyway,

730
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,693
I'm on my way to raid Wangmat Food.

731
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,198
What's he going to do
if I actually help him out?

732
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,316
Where did that

733
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,919
Father Kim come from?

734
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,654
Where?

735
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,762
Prosecutor, someone's here to see you.

736
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,098
Who?

737
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,170
Gyeong-seon.

738
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,350
Are you kidding me?

739
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,953
Did you hear that I'm here
and come looking for me?

740
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,054
Yes.

741
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,257
You came back to your hometown.

742
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,359
How could I not know?

743
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,228
I have nothing to say to you.

744
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,729
Gyeong-seon.

745
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:46,864
Well, I...

746
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,401
Just one last time.

747
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,436
Please help

748
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,738
your old man out.

749
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,340
My old man?

750
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,542
You're just some old man to me.

751
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,179
Gyeong-seon, I just...

752
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,983
Can't you hurry up on that lawsuit

753
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,852
our neighbors filed?

754
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,854
Did someone send you here?

755
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,557
Are they going to buy you drinks
and give you pocket money again?

756
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,393
What are you talking about?
It's nothing like that.

757
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,296
Gyeong-seon.

758
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:23,500
Those folks have known you
ever since you were a small child.

759
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,703
You ruined your life
boasting about something

760
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,172
you don't even have.
Wasn't that enough for you?

761
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,574
You even went to jail. Wasn't that enough?

762
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:31,742
Should I put you in again?

763
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,012
Aren't you tired of people
taking advantage of you

764
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,181
your whole life?

765
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,251
You even abandoned your family
and lived a shitty life.

766
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,587
You know what?

767
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,424
I'm sick and tired of it.

768
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:56,400
I'm so glad I don't take after you.

769
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,105
Gyeong-seon.

770
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:03,641
The thing is...

771
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:05,943
Do you perhaps

772
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,846
have any money saved up?

773
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,344
-Father. You're back.
-Yes.

774
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,681
Are you still on bad terms
with Detective Gu?

775
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,382
We were never close to begin with.

776
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,352
Could you accompany me just for today?

777
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,220
I'd love that!

778
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,061
I mean, I'm feeling great today.

779
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,696
Do you know that drugstore, Alive Young?

780
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,598
I got a discount coupon today.

781
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,600
Dae-yeong!

782
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,673
You were talking like
you weren't going to come back.

783
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,308
No, I didn't.

784
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,810
I just went to get a hotdog.

785
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,282
Prepare a high magnification camcorder
and some riot gear.

786
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,250
-Yes, sir.
-Riot gear? What for?

787
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,586
For handling riots, what else?

788
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,288
That place isn't a gang office.

789
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:25,989
It's just a private food company. So, why?

790
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,424
What if we run into guys like Choco?

791
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,159
We have to get them all this time.

792
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,494
"Choco"?

793
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,669
Then I'll go and get the camcorder ready.

794
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,638
We can just use our phones.

795
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,511
My stomach!
My stomach hurts all of a sudden.

796
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:48,879
I'll be right back.

797
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,214
No, you won't.

798
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,016
I'm going to poop in my pants!

799
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:00,958
Every single time.

800
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,671
Make sure to throw the bait properly

801
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,607
so he can't get to Wangmat Food.

802
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,684
Sir, Father Kim and I

803
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,720
are about to head to Wangmat Food.

804
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,889
I think he's going to turn
the whole place over.

805
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,557
I think you should be prepared.

806
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,760
Damn it, everything's a mess.

807
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,529
-Jang Ryong.
-Yes, sir?

808
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,697
Take our best boys
and just take care of that priest

809
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,032
if he tries to get rough. Got it?

810
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:43,700
Yes, sir!

811
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,603
Sir, I think you should handle it
quietly this time.

812
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,671
If the chief finds out--

813
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,839
Then what?

814
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,010
How are we going to stop that priest
if we don't act like this?

815
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,179
Should I offer tea and chat with him?

816
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,149
You seem to be sparing yourself
a lot these days, Mr. Kim.

817
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,585
You weren't like this before.

818
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,221
Are you having second thoughts?

819
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,125
I'll make sure to get rid of him, sir.

820
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,660
Do it properly, all right?

821
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,061
-Yes, sir.
-Get out.

822
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,180
Yes?

823
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:35,752
What brings you here?

824
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,387
Shouldn't you be working?

825
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,864
Please send me back to my place.

826
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,067
I'll do everything

827
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:51,969
you tell me to do.

828
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,004
No.

829
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,940
I'll do everything flawlessly.

830
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,680
-Put in the bean sprouts!
-Yes, ma'am.

831
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,618
-What about this?
-Put it in.

832
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,291
That's right.

833
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:18,161
-I'll go fetch the salt from the storage.
-Okay, go get it.

834
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,953
Why isn't he back from the storage?

835
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,127
-Come back here!
-Honey, where are my socks?

836
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,261
I can't find them!

837
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,563
Please leave it at the door!

838
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,300
Are we only going to keep kissing?

839
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,401
Okay.

840
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,204
What do we do?

841
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:02,839
Should we just hide it at home?

842
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,174
That's a bit too much.

843
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,676
Then where?

844
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,078
We're going to be in deep trouble
if we get caught.

845
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,414
Why are you being such a coward today?

846
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,049
What did you just say?

847
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,085
Sir, why don't we just hide it
in the safe?

848
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:18,255
They can get in there
with a search warrant, you idiot.

849
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,125
-My goodness.
-Then where should we...

850
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,663
What about there?

851
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,167
PRESIDENTS OFFICE
WANGMAT FOOD

852
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,043
Darn it, you should've at least brought
something that works.

853
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,778
This is practically useless.

854
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:44,181
Stop moving, will you?
You're shaking the camera.

855
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,817
Be quiet! We're out on site.

856
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,419
Make sure to film it at a bird's-eye view

857
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,288
when counting
or if there's a lot going on.

858
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,690
If you shoot at eye-level,
there's a high chance of missing it.

859
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,891
Yes, sir.

860
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,394
You're acting like some instructor today.

861
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,268
GUDAM DISTRICT OFFICE

862
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,637
Why, hello, Chief!

863
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,140
-To the left.
-Chief!

864
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,142
WANGMAT FOOD

865
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,144
Damn it.

866
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,647
Why didn't you think of that earlier?

867
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,384
Zoom in as much as you can.

868
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,494
Man, look at them with those envelopes.

869
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,195
Enjoying yourselves, boys?

870
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,331
It is nice to get free money, isn't it?

871
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:38,068
You like free money, don't you, Father?

872
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,770
That's a bribe, not free money.

873
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,338
What's wrong with you?

874
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,173
To the right.

875
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,680
These bastards are all in it together.

876
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,717
Stop it, already.

877
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,552
Why are you all so clueless?

878
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,828
That bobbed-hair bastard is here again!

879
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,663
-I can always count on you.
-Hurry up!

880
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:15,939
They can't hear us up here!

881
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,541
What are they, dolphins?

882
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,444
Isn't this a bit too much?

883
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,164
Gosh, my stomach.

884
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,166
I guess I put too much ketchup
on my hotdog.

885
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,534
I need to use the toilet.

886
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,669
Just hold it in!

887
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:46,903
I can't hold it any longer.

888
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,872
It's practically at the exit.

889
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,509
Haven't you seen the movies?

890
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,479
Everything happens when the detective
takes a potty break! No way!

891
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,215
Do you want to see a disaster happen?
I won't take long.

892
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,951
Forget it. It'll go back up in a minute,

893
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:04,221
so just hold it in. Come back here.

894
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,388
Come on.

895
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:08,692
Songsak!

896
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,560
Songsak!

897
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:13,697
Damn it!

898
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,432
Come on!

899
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,268
What should I do?

900
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,638
Lift me up.

901
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,874
Are you trying to kill me?

902
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,010
Songsak, we don't have much time. Please!

903
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,212
All right.

904
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,953
What are you doing?

905
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,689
Do it properly. One, two, three!

906
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:45,061
Are you sure the priest asked you this?

907
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,396
Yes, he did.

908
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:55,372
I'm sure he gave orders to Yo-han.

909
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:58,175
Are you feeling better?
I told you it would go back in.

910
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,277
Yes, I guess it did.

911
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:04,114
Father, did you know this would happen?

912
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,448
Yes.

913
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,486
Is that why you caused a fuss here
the other day?

914
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,154
So that we can know
who's guarding this place

915
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,923
and how.

916
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,592
That's right. Gosh.

917
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,594
You're amazing.

918
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,533
What's this? What the hell are they doing?

919
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,634
That's it.

920
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,535
There.

921
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,739
It's just a mere formality.

922
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,174
Sure, of course.

923
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,376
They're putting up
a suspension of business.

924
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,011
Do you think someone reported them?

925
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,446
No one reported them.

926
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,181
They're just putting it up on their own.

927
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,550
-What?
-They'll be suspended for a month,

928
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:41,818
pay the fine,

929
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,221
and re-open when things simmer down
a month later.

930
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:46,556
Those bastards.

931
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,825
So that's how they've been doing it.

932
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,926
That's right.

933
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,563
No one's been stopping them,
so they've been getting their own way.

934
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,966
This is it, so let's go.

935
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,168
Aren't we done?

936
00:53:58,535 --> 00:53:59,970
We got the proof.

937
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:03,039
We got the proof,
so now we go and get them.

938
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,174
Come on!

939
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:10,480
Hold on. Wait!

940
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,354
Yo-han?

941
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,990
That fatty!

942
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,002
How could you leave me there?

943
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,279
Hey!

944
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,286
WANGMAT FOOD

945
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,458
What's with those long faces?

946
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,427
You look like you've lost a war.

947
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,130
You won't be dancing again this time,
will you?

948
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,335
This?
That was supposed to be a performance.

949
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:42,439
It's foul play if you attack me like that.

950
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,808
Can't you fix that haircut of yours?

951
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,910
It's a complete eyesore.

952
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,846
You're an eyesore to me too, Hip Hop Girl.

953
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,915
Why do you keep getting in my way?

954
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,383
You fucking--

955
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,617
Hey!

956
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,656
Hey, let's do this properly.

957
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:00,957
We'll take those we need to arrest,

958
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,359
and the rest can stay.

959
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:06,129
Stay out of this, Detective Gu.
You're getting in the way.

960
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,465
Unless you want a broken limb.

961
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,402
Fine.

962
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,105
But I warned you.

963
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,981
Damn it.

964
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,485
Let's see.

965
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,221
We'll need a headcount
for the bus to hell.

966
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,490
Two, four, six, eight, ten...

967
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:36,893
I think two vans will be enough.

968
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,162
What did he just say? "Vans"?

969
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,400
Fine. Start the vans!

970
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,066
WANGMAT FOOD

971
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:24,467
Your skull's going to be quite sore today,
Hip Hop Girl.

972
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,250
Gudam-gu's corruption has been revealed.

973
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,451
What the hell are you're doing?

974
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:17,020
I told you many times to change your ways.

975
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,288
THE EVIL FORCES ARE BREAKING APART

976
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:19,622
The opponent needs to weaken down

977
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,391
for us to get the information we need.

978
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,560
Are you okay?
You seemed to get beaten up badly.

979
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:24,694
Thanks for earlier.

980
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:27,330
It's the least I can do for you.

981
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,365
Tell me who took Wangmat Food's ledger.

982
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,267
-Spill it out.
-I don't know.

983
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,435
Help me!

984
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,703
THE DANGEROUS COUNTERATTACK BEGINS

985
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,638
-Return immediately.
-Yes, sir!

986
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,307
Should we wipe them out?

987
