1
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,120
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,454
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,267
Wait!

4
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:46,046
Are you the one who beat up my friend?

5
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,006
Seung-a!

6
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,442
Wake up! Seung-a!

7
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,355
You bastard!

8
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,358
Who do you think you are?

9
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,373
Old lady, are you all right?

10
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,641
I'm fine.

11
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,778
Bastards.

12
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,847
Seung-a...

13
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,249
Detective Seo!

14
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,138
What is it?

15
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,374
Jung-gwon, you bastard!

16
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,111
I told you I wouldn't let it slide.

17
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,546
What's with the swearing?

18
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,781
I told you not to touch my people.

19
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,750
How could you--

20
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,486
What did I do? No one died.

21
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,190
I told my men to kill them only halfway

22
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,126
and that's exactly what they did.

23
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,895
They were just beaten, right?

24
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,800
Also, one of my men...
Wait, you're a catholic, right?

25
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,803
He's a catholic, so he just showed himself

26
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,139
and helped himself to some apples.

27
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,911
I'm...

28
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,682
coming for you.

29
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,284
Whatever.

30
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,452
I'm enjoying whelks right now,

31
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,620
so bye.

32
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,405
I'm back.

33
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,176
I...

34
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,218
Sister?

35
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,063
Thankfully, her injuries aren't severe.

36
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,099
She just has a major concussion.

37
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,105
What about the other detectives?

38
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,008
Their injuries are minor,
so they moved to another room.

39
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,613
Father, can we talk?

40
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,851
Which bastards did this?

41
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,153
You know, right?

42
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,990
Mercenaries hired by Lee Jung-gwon.

43
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,292
Mercenaries?

44
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,160
We used to serve together in the NIS

45
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,629
and now they pick up contracts overseas.

46
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,467
They're veteran soldiers
who are expert killers.

47
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,868
He's right.

48
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,339
The man I fought was fighting
in a way that would kill you.

49
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,308
He's no joke.

50
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,377
Who the hell is Lee Jung-gwon?

51
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,145
My boss at the NIS.

52
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,115
The one who ordered
the grenade bombing on kids?

53
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,690
Bastard.

54
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,562
He's just as cruel as he used to be.

55
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,664
Where are they right now?

56
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,434
I'll arrest them all!

57
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,140
Well, I don't know where they are myself.

58
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,841
Detective Seo...

59
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,412
Look what they did to her pretty face.

60
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,450
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

61
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,985
It's because you sided with me.

62
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,620
Why are you to blame?

63
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,688
This is how they've always been.

64
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,826
Anyway, I'm heading back to the church.

65
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,963
You had better not
be going somewhere alone.

66
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,400
Of course not.

67
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,382
I said I was coming for you.

68
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,072
Get up.

69
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,277
Jeez, Hae-il, you haven't changed a bit.

70
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,213
You're just as brutal as you used to be.

71
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:12,184
Can't you just kill me
in one strike though?

72
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,888
Hold on.

73
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,792
There's something you must know.

74
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,460
If you kill me,

75
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,496
you'll be losing a key witness.

76
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,432
Witness to what?

77
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,235
The murder of Father Lee Yeong-jun.

78
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,575
Aren't you going to kill me? You should.

79
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:37,910
Go ahead.

80
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,212
Explain.

81
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,548
Just kill me. Do it!

82
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,683
Kill me!

83
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,418
Tell me what you know.

84
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,921
Now.

85
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,257
I'd love to lay out all the details,

86
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,125
but now's not the time.

87
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:05,471
Are you looking into my eyes
to see if I'm lying or not?

88
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,573
It's true.

89
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,342
Then when will you tell me?

90
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,479
About ten days after
I finish some important business.

91
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,518
You have one week.

92
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,388
If you don't speak by then or lie,

93
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,958
you'll regret not telling me today.

94
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,261
Sure, do as you please.

95
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,900
Hae-il,

96
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,406
why is it that it's never easy between us?

97
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,025
I called to tell him you were all right,

98
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,426
so don't worry.

99
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,404
Father.

100
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,651
Where on earth were you
and what have you been doing?

101
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,689
Nothing much.

102
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

103
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,495
Please do not say that.

104
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,398
No one's blaming you.

105
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,800
At times like this,

106
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,036
we must stand our ground and fight back.

107
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,672
You must not waver, Father.

108
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,764
You didn't have to come.

109
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,334
Have you been eating well?

110
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,469
I guess I have.

111
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,340
You're the only one
who has come to see me though.

112
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,043
If only you had trusted me fully...

113
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,245
Damn it.

114
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,116
I heard that your attorneys severed ties.

115
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,717
They know what seems hopeless.

116
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,953
I'm the tail that's being cut off.

117
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,456
Chief Nam and I will take the fall,

118
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,558
so who would ever represent me?

119
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,560
Dong-ja.

120
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,598
I don't know about the others,
but fucking Kang Seok-tae...

121
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,069
I'll be grateful.

122
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,907
No matter how much
you kick me to the curb,

123
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,611
you're still my friend.

124
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,046
I was a nobody from a small town

125
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,682
and you helped me own an enterprise.

126
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,585
So...

127
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:09,889
let me take care of you now.

128
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,393
I'm touched, Cheol-beom.

129
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,414
Seung-a?

130
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,249
Seung-a, wake up.

131
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,656
I can't let them be.

132
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,492
They should have never gone after Seung-a.

133
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,605
Are you Hwang Cheol-beom, the dog?

134
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,807
What?

135
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,460
I got this.

136
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,297
Cheap bastard.
You'll play dirty, is that it?

137
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,366
Who the fuck are you?

138
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,235
Get back here. Come on.

139
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:33,072
I give you a score of A plus.

140
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,974
No, just A.

141
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,409
I'll see you around.

142
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,920
You contributed in the investigation
by retrieving quality information,

143
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,622
so I prepared a gift for you.

144
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,096
A golden arm warmer?

145
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,599
Thank you, ma'am.

146
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,201
This isn't store-bought, you know.

147
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,037
I went to the fabric market myself

148
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,440
and made sure that each stitch
was placed with love

149
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,143
at a local tailor shop.

150
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,746
It's a rare handmade item.

151
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,147
Thank you so much.

152
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,984
-Golden arm warmers!
-Golden arm warmers!

153
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,120
Sir, you look hilarious,

154
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,321
but they look cool.

155
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,891
You can take some wild ginseng.

156
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,126
Is it for me?

157
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,062
My goodness. Thank you, ma'am.

158
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,732
Gosh.

159
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,236
-Ma'am, please have one.
-Me too? Thanks.

160
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,080
The gifts give you energy, right?

161
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,283
We'll use that energy
to scratch another dirtbag off the street.

162
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,185
Just tell us who it is.

163
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,388
Just like waste collectors,
we'll clear up the streets.

164
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,389
Who is it?

165
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,825
It's no one of great caliber this time.

166
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,295
It's Kang Seok-tae.

167
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,498
What?

168
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,802
Are you talking about
Chief Prosecutor Kang?

169
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,041
So they swept all members
of the violent crime squad?

170
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,645
Yes. By the looks of it,
they seem to be quite good.

171
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,680
The one you met earlier

172
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,582
is probably one of them.

173
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,852
Lee Jung-gwon that bastard
must've hired killers.

174
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,156
He's after both Father Kim and me.

175
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,195
Poor Father Kim.

176
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,897
There's no need to feel guilty, Father.

177
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,734
This is for the best.

178
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,470
The war is now justified.

179
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,338
We'll arrest the scumbags

180
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,241
that hurt our youngest detective
and are still roaming the streets.

181
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,777
We'll even help you rob Hwang Cheol-beom.

182
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,316
That's supposed to be secret.
How did you...

183
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,422
We needed to share information
for our mission.

184
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,057
It wasn't that I blabbered about it.

185
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,227
We're not exactly robbing him.
We're giving back what he stole.

186
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:09,962
That's something we should do.

187
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,598
Then we'll get back to work tomorrow.

188
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,601
I'll have myself discharged
tomorrow as well.

189
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,178
What they have isn't just money.

190
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,281
For seven years, they gave up being human

191
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,283
and accumulated their greed.

192
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,620
I will burn it down
right before their eyes.

193
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,524
Also those who look up
to that tower of greed

194
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,526
will be taken down too.

195
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:52,004
Old lady,
what do you know about the vault?

196
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,840
The locks require a fingerprint

197
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,975
and the vault manufacturer
is Munchenbraum.

198
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,310
It sounded German.

199
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,631
Why is he crawling out again?

200
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,605
What happened?

201
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,042
I can't go any further.

202
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,413
It will cave in before I reach the vault.

203
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,615
But you said the drillers
are experts from Russia.

204
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,018
The foundation is too weak
and the experts all left.

205
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:42,988
We can't do this by ourselves.

206
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,823
But I spent millions on this!

207
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,626
Let's just finish this.
You're almost at the vault anyway.

208
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:48,894
I'm done.

209
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,964
You go ahead
since you're the enlightened one.

210
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,134
Gojayev, wait!

211
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,936
You can't just leave. Hold on.

212
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,338
Gojayev!

213
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,740
Hold on. You can't leave.

214
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,643
You go ahead.

215
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,880
Shit!

216
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,416
Damn.

217
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,822
The vault was built to resist
vibration, explosives, and water.

218
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,658
The floor and walls have
double-layered 100-ton steel plates.

219
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,959
That means,

220
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,195
it's impenetrable.

221
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,630
Then let's not break into it.

222
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,100
You're discouraging us from the beginning.

223
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,069
What's to keep in mind is that
oxygen level drops

224
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,804
once the vault is closed.

225
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,674
After 15 minutes,
the vault will have no oxygen at all.

226
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,476
Is it to prevent robbers?

227
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:41,113
Yes, there was a thief
who spent days in a vault before escaping,

228
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,215
so such a feature was put into place.

229
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,553
The building it's located at
has only one entrance at the center.

230
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,921
It won't be easy to infiltrate.

231
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,424
Exactly. How on earth
are we supposed to approach it?

232
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,259
I'm still thinking of a way.

233
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,507
This is it.

234
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,577
What? You want to trade it for a coin?

235
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,612
Why is everyone clueless today?

236
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,180
Okay, now focus.

237
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,952
It's hard to take the coin
from a fist that's holding it tight.

238
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,488
However, it gets easier
if the coin is on the move.

239
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,560
We'll force them into moving the money?

240
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,963
Nice.

241
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,131
How?

242
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,033
It won't be difficult.

243
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,269
All we need to do is talk.

244
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,524
PARK WON-MU

245
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,871
The police investigation

246
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,074
revealed that Congressman Park
who was murdered last night

247
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,279
was the final co-owner of Rising Moon.

248
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,447
The police assume

249
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,183
that he was murdered
to cover up Park's connection.

250
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,254
At least this was executed cleanly.

251
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,224
I was worried Park would wake up.

252
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,459
Why the glum face?

253
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,330
Well...

254
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,166
It's nothing, sir.

255
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,602
What is it? You can tell me.

256
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,470
Congressman Park is dead.

257
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,739
Chief Nam and Director Jeong

258
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,374
are stuck in prison now.

259
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,044
The last man standing...

260
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,279
is you, sir.

261
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,948
-What are you getting at?
-What if...

262
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,651
someone thinks about you,

263
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,219
"If only that bastard is gone,

264
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,188
all the money will be mine"?

265
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,656
I don't appreciate the swearing.

266
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,024
I apologize, sir.

267
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,260
Anyway, with you gone,

268
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,797
the money will be up for grabs
to just about anyone.

269
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,865
Especially the owner of the vault.

270
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,801
You mean, Hwang Cheol-beom.

271
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,870
What were you going to do with Mr. Nam

272
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,305
and Ms. Jeong's share?

273
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,841
It's already mine.

274
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,844
I'm sure that Hwang Cheol-beom
has already predicted this.

275
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:31,316
"That bastard Kang Seok-tae
will take all the money himself."

276
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,818
"That bastard"?

277
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,688
Sorry, sir.
I was trying to make it sound real.

278
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,625
You're right. He is quite quick-witted.

279
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,696
The vault is no longer safe
for your money anymore.

280
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,498
It's like

281
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,402
you're leaving your meat
in the hands of a hungry mutt.

282
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,980
Goodness. I'm honored
that you came to my shabby office.

283
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,049
You're right about it being shabby.

284
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,818
Still, I imagined a tiger-skin rug

285
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,354
and a slogan that reads "Be Loyal,"

286
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,922
but you've kept it simple.

287
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:14,793
That was the decor
preferred by thugs in the old days.

288
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,328
So let me cut to the chase.

289
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,830
I thought about your offer.

290
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,666
Is it still 50-50?

291
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,872
Why would I bother
making a promise I can't keep?

292
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,776
So...

293
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,411
when will you get rid of

294
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,478
Mr. Kang and Lee Jung-gwon?

295
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,046
I'm waiting for the right window.

296
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,948
Then make sure you don't miss it.

297
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,285
Making the first move
is what Kang Seok-tae does best.

298
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,221
If he actually decided to do so,

299
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,258
it means that he has his mind fully set.

300
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,361
I'll keep that in mind.

301
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,731
Also, don't trust anything he says.

302
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,833
"I'm hungry. I'm tired."

303
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,969
Those are the only words
he truly speaks his mind about.

304
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,738
Got it.

305
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,375
Who knew I'd voluntarily
join hands with a thug?

306
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,951
I hope that Prosecutor Park
is able to bait Kang Seok-tae.

307
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,521
Our old lady may not have many talents,
but this we can count on.

308
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,989
When did she become "our" old lady?

309
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,929
Hwang Cheol-beom will strike when

310
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,330
Kang Seok-tae moves the money.

311
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,965
He probably knows that Kang Seok-tae

312
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,333
is trying to take all the money.

313
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,701
Then

314
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,938
Hwang Cheol-beom will round up
all of his men.

315
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,105
Yes, that's the issue.

316
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,641
Lee Jung-gwon may have hired
the best mercenaries,

317
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,777
-but they'll be--
-Outnumbered.

318
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,346
We both know how many goons
Hwang commands.

319
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,215
We should first help Kang Seok-tae

320
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,883
move the money without a hitch.

321
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,820
How can we incapacitate
Hwang Cheol-beom's men?

322
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,129
Jeez, my stomach. I'm off to the restroom.

323
00:24:58,964 --> 00:24:59,898
Seriously?

324
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,300
Who goes to poop
while eating something this good?

325
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,802
I'm still a little hungover.

326
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,871
The alcohol hasn't left my stomach yet.

327
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,906
Your pooping will one day ruin you.
Now eat up first.

328
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,241
I will once I get back.

329
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,212
That's it.

330
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,148
This is how we can incapacitate them.

331
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,621
This is an absurd idea!

332
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,155
It's far from it.

333
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,491
You don't always have
to face your enemies straightforward.

334
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,993
There are other ways.

335
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,861
Even so, this isn't right.

336
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,563
It's crazy!

337
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,566
But we're almost here. Come on.

338
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,736
-Are you sure about this?
-Yes.

339
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:43,675
JULJUL HERBAL CLINIC

340
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,614
What a waste of time.

341
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,217
It's not found in Korea
and importing it is illegal,

342
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,852
so where can we obtain it?

343
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,322
Just think that
you learned something today.

344
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,491
Let's go.

345
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,094
You, get back here.

346
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,863
You made me waste my time.

347
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,433
You're taking your money?

348
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,870
Yes, it's not like
the rules stand anymore.

349
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,040
There can't be a unanimous vote anymore.

350
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,875
Do what you wish then.

351
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,044
How much will you be taking?

352
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,212
My share and Chief Nam's.

353
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,782
That's half of the money.

354
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,918
You can deal with
Ms. Jeong's share as you prefer.

355
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,821
I'll be there tomorrow
and I'll text you when.

356
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,224
Sure. I'll get things ready for you.

357
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,200
If he actually decided to do so,

358
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,203
it means that he has his mind fully set.

359
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,572
Also, don't trust anything he says.

360
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,708
"I'm hungry. I'm tired."

361
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,844
Those are the only words
he truly speaks his mind about.

362
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,716
Tomorrow's the day.

363
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,651
Gather the boys and our tools.

364
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,086
-Yes, Boss.
-Yes, Boss.

365
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,054
Every penny will stay inside the vault

366
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,824
and no one will be allowed to leave alive.

367
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,205
OH JEONG-GUK, DIRECTOR OF
THE NIS COUNTERTERRORISM DEPARTMENT

368
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,173
You seem better than I imagined.

369
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,442
The robes suit you well too.

370
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,282
I guess you're not the type
to live a quiet life though.

371
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,287
I'm sorry, sir. It wasn't my intention.

372
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,390
Why did you suddenly want to see me?

373
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,760
You don't need someone like me anymore.

374
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm about to go to war
with those I've been after.

375
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,436
There's something I need
for the operation.

376
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,272
Is it big?

377
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,341
No.

378
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,250
I'll make just one request.

379
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,352
Make sure

380
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,555
you put down Lee Jung-gwon too.

381
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,793
The agency has been investigating him
for leaking information,

382
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,495
but the rat never left
any evidence behind.

383
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,098
He then quit the agency altogether.

384
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,834
It's up to you now.

385
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,470
Make him pay back the old debt.

386
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,008
Yes, sir.

387
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,843
Hae-il.

388
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,279
Well...

389
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,614
I don't think you'll say yes,
but I'll ask anyway.

390
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,051
Would you like to come back?

391
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,624
I've heard a rumor
you haven't changed that much.

392
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,163
We'll discuss it some other time.

393
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,000
Sure.

394
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,002
So what is it that you need?

395
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,462
Bring it on!

396
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,435
Come on!

397
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,772
I will beat you!

398
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,612
Next time,

399
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,449
I will avenge you,

400
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,051
my Seung-a.

401
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,720
NEXT TIME, I WILL AVENGE YOU, MY SEUNG-A

402
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,726
Construction work is being done
outside Daebeom Trading,

403
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,761
so we'll approach from the back.

404
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,397
The idea of stealing 150 billion won

405
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,431
has me shaking like a tree.

406
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,302
Imagine it being all mine.

407
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,572
Happiness can't be bought, you know.

408
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,942
That's because
you've never had enough money

409
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,477
to buy happiness.

410
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,415
Happiness can't be bought,
but it can prevent misfortune.

411
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,250
Money is the best.

412
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,418
Stop it!

413
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,221
Is capitalism all you care about?

414
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,089
How dare you say so in this sacred place!

415
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,659
It's been a while
since you got pissed with us.

416
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:28,760
Anyway, carry on.

417
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,197
The operation is simple.

418
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,166
We'll first attach a tracking device
on the car that's moving the money,

419
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,101
follow the vehicle,

420
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,737
and take the money. The end!

421
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:40,939
-Easy, right?
-Just in case,

422
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,241
Captain Lee and the others

423
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,843
will also track the truck.

424
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,913
What about me?
Am I supposed to be there all alone?

425
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,048
Old lady,

426
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,550
we'll be waiting close by

427
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,918
until you exit the building.

428
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,820
Also, we'll be listening in

429
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,889
to the conversation
between you and the others.

430
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,593
It still makes me nervous though.

431
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,495
Just be yourself and act naturally.

432
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,399
Have you thought about
what you'll do with the money?

433
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,837
Not yet.

434
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,172
You should though.

435
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,373
You can't hold onto it for long.

436
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,975
We might change our minds.

437
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:21,212
All right, I'll decide soon.
Anyway, we'll get it done tomorrow.

438
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,256
I'll come up with something else tomorrow.

439
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,858
Take that.

440
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,861
Daebeom Trading, just you wait.
150 billion is mine--

441
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,097
Darn you. What did you just spit out?

442
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,619
Is everyone here?

443
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,022
Yes, they're all here.

444
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,658
Good. Keep them in line

445
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,161
and have them fed first.

446
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,130
They'll only draw attention outside,

447
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,831
so I'm having food delivered here.

448
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,338
FIERY PACKED MEALS

449
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,482
Your meals are here!

450
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,819
Kid, go and get our food.

451
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,222
Please enjoy.

452
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,124
-Enjoy.
-Sure.

453
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,360
Please enjoy.

454
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,665
Here. Take your water.

455
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,269
DAEBEOM TRADING

456
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:31,843
THE DIRTY

457
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,516
THE SLY

458
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,290
THE EVIL

459
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:02,473
THE BITCH WHO WAS JUST ENLIGHTENED

460
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:10,181
KIND BUT INSANE

461
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:21,826
THE COOL ONE WITH AN ANGER ISSUE

462
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,862
DAEBEOM TRADING

463
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,298
We meet again,

464
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,134
Hwang Cheol-beom, the dog.

465
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,339
I finally made up my mind.

466
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,775
It's your funeral today.

467
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,412
Let's go.

468
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,750
Old lady,

469
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,518
if you can hear me clearly,

470
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,554
adjust your shades with your left hand.

471
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,631
That one in the black jacket.
He's the bastard who attacked me.

472
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:05,136
What? That little fucker.
Consider yourself marked.

473
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,372
Wait, is that a scar?

474
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,707
Is he Lee Jung-gwon?

475
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,512
Yes, doesn't he look like a sleazeball?

476
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:22,220
Whatever.
Our alliance is only momentary anyway.

477
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,031
What is it?

478
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,000
Damn it.

479
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,970
The trackers won't do any good.

480
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,205
There's a signal jammer on the truck.

481
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,574
-That black thing right there?
-What?

482
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,076
Shit.

483
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,612
Captain Lee, are you in position?

484
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,082
Yes, Father. We're at the location.

485
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,284
The tracker won't be of much help though.

486
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,586
A signal jammer is on the truck.

487
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,723
Don't worry.
We won't let it out of our sight.

488
00:35:58,789 --> 00:35:59,824
Lager.

489
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,293
What's a lager? You want to drink beer?

490
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,295
You see that in Hollywood movies.

491
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:05,963
The ones about the FBI and stuff.

492
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,432
It's not "lager."

493
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,268
It's "roger."

494
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,037
Shut it.

495
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,572
DAEBEOM TRADING

496
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,509
Why is the building empty on a weekday?

497
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,811
Many have work outside the building.

498
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,682
You have to be diligent
to get things done.

499
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,997
We'll sprint out once we get the signal.

500
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,132
-Right.
-Got it.

501
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,300
One, two...

502
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,002
Do that and you're dead.

503
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,404
Move on the count of three.

504
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,839
Let's do a rehearsal. One, two...

505
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,375
-Three!
-Charge!

506
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,844
Shut up, you morons!

507
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:20,104
Now that I'm actually in the building,
I feel so nervous.

508
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,644
One, two, three.

509
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,348
The fingerprints are a match.

510
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,227
Have you reached the vault?

511
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,497
Don't be nervous, old lady.

512
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:47,932
Sure.

513
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:55,906
Don't answer me.

514
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,009
Sure.

515
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,181
Damn.

516
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,683
I thought she'd do well.

517
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,519
Old lady.

518
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,289
Yes, sure...

519
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,858
Yes, yes

520
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:19,463
I've been practicing a song
for the team dinner next week,

521
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,899
and it's been constantly in my head.

522
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,100
What the...

523
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,636
Don't be so silly.

524
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,643
This is killing me.

525
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,578
Count me out for the next operation.

526
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,147
I don't want to die young.

527
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,348
Time to get them to fight.

528
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,482
Hold on.

529
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,454
Seriously?

530
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,534
Did you seriously swallow that?

531
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,768
Do you have any snacks?

532
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,403
Darn it.

533
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,538
Hurry on out.

534
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,475
-One more sip--
-Don't you dare.

535
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,016
I wrapped them
so that they'll be easier to transport.

536
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,821
You're only taking half, right?

537
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,756
No.

538
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:21,959
I'm taking it all.

539
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,734
What the hell...

540
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,604
Why are you always so predictable?

541
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,506
Did you honestly believe

542
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:39,176
that you'd be able to leave
this place safely with all this money?

543
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,545
Of course. Why not?

544
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,481
Do you think

545
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,884
I didn't predict this move of yours?

546
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,726
Bring me Mr. Hwang. Bring him to me now!

547
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,161
Get out here!

548
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,064
-Hwang, come on out.
-Out!

549
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,298
Shit.

550
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,537
I want Hwang out here right now.

551
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,105
Get out here!

552
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,241
Isn't anyone home?

553
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,376
If you don't come out,
we'll keep saying bad stuff

554
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,577
about Hwang Cheol-beom's name.

555
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,845
Hwang!

556
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,114
Hwang Cheol-beom,
you're worse than a mutt.

557
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,382
Cheol.

558
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,385
Grow up and pray often.

559
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,753
Beom.

560
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,455
Be grateful for all things.

561
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:27,892
I'm a priest!

562
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,027
What the hell is going on?

563
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:34,832
Shit.

564
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,935
Why does that voice sound familiar?

565
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,140
What the hell?

566
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,544
DAEBEOM TRADING

567
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,481
Greetings, Father Kim, the menace.

568
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,017
Seriously? Step aside, Jang Ryong

569
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,685
and bring me Mr. Hwang!

570
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,921
It's best if you just leave today.

571
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,590
We're very busy at the moment.

572
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,759
Busy how? Busily grinding?

573
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,563
I've been fond of you lately,

574
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,666
but now you're getting on my nerves again.

575
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,268
Just get lost.

576
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,572
Wait. You're bringing out tools?

577
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,475
I'm so scared that I might wet myself.

578
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,810
-Did you just?
-I did.

579
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,183
Why the fuck am I sweating?

580
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,120
-Are you seeing this?
-We're almost at the finish line.

581
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,323
Things are about to get dangerous though.

582
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,358
-We should get going.
-Let's hurry and go.

583
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,294
Get back to your post.

584
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,629
Why did you crawl out here?

585
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,397
Head back inside and stop frowning.

586
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,807
Moonwalking, are you?

587
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,409
Right, just go to the end of the Earth.

588
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,979
Drink at home
if you're going to during the day.

589
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,017
Jeez, why am I sweating?

590
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,419
My stomach's rumbling too, shit.

591
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,054
What's going on?

592
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,066
A whole group of them
are on standby upstairs.

593
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,436
-Myeong-cheol.
-Yes?

594
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,272
-Check upstairs.
-Sure.

595
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,741
You prick.

596
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,544
This is when you choose to get smart?

597
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,950
These days, predictions of misfortune
never seem to go wrong,

598
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,652
you son of a bitch.

599
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:36,420
What?

600
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,322
You've gone insane, haven't you?

601
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,762
Sure. Kill me. Do it!

602
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:46,931
If I die,

603
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,134
everyone else here will too.

604
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,839
Sir, just stick to what you came here for.

605
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,741
There's no need for violence.

606
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,044
Why are you doing this?

607
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,912
I was going to deal with this peacefully,

608
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,950
but Mr. Kang doesn't seem
to want to do the same.

609
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,852
So what will you do?

610
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,656
Will you kill me right here
and meet your doom as well

611
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,526
or will you choose to leave this place
in one piece?

612
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,963
In two minutes,

613
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,365
my men will be here.

614
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,478
Hurry. Father, get in!

615
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,349
Things are about to explode.

616
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,418
Things need to explode outside
for the money to get moving.

617
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,087
This operation will go well, right?

618
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,456
Damn, I'm nervous.

619
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:49,226
How can we incapacitate
Hwang Cheol-beom's men?

620
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,129
Jeez, my stomach. I'm off to the restroom.

621
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,298
That's it.

622
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,167
This is how we can incapacitate them.

623
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,236
There's a secret weapon

624
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,907
that was used in ancient China
to incapacitate their enemies during wars.

625
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:05,609
A poisonous flower.

626
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,611
A flower that has poison.

627
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,648
Just a drop of the juice of this flower

628
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,984
will turn one's stomach upside down
and work as a laxative.

629
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,520
Their bowels will turn numb

630
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,857
and they'll have to rest on their backs
for about an hour.

631
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,626
Before they explode though,

632
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:26,096
they'll start sweating like crazy.

633
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,731
What's the name...

634
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:29,800
of that flower?

635
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,003
A flower that lets out stools
and increase bowel movements.

636
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,505
It's a laxative flower.

637
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,975
Just hearing about it
makes me wet my pants.

638
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,512
You can't find it in Korea though,
only in China.

639
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,682
Because it's poisonous,
it's illegal to import.

640
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,618
Sure. So what is it that you need?

641
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,855
I need what's called a laxative flower.

642
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:54,625
What?

643
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,027
A laxative flower.

644
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,202
LAXATIVE FLOWER TONIC

645
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,038
FIERY PACKED MEALS

646
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,514
LAXATIVE FLOWER TONIC

647
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,423
Let's quickly finish our lunch.

648
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,891
-Yes, sir.
-Got it.

649
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:40,971
Hey, there, you foul-looking fella.
This isn't nice, is it?

650
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,439
It's not your front yard.

651
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:43,807
Consider yourself dead.

652
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:46,910
Kill him.

653
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,255
Well, it went as planned.

654
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,191
Look at the effect of the laxative flower!

655
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:37,227
Do you see them on the floor?
They can barely move.

656
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,531
The poison should never
be administered to humans.

657
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:43,000
I can't watch this.
Was this really necessary?

658
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,140
You fucking thug.

659
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,243
Seen a lot of movies, have you?

660
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,149
Things are a little weird upstairs.

661
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:05,722
Boss.

662
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:09,993
The men...

663
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,874
Damn.

664
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,047
What the fuck is this?

665
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,116
We're all leaking upstairs.

666
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,586
It's as if someone left the faucet on.

667
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,658
My stomach... I'm numb all over.

668
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,760
Hurry up and move the money.

669
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,132
GUDAM EXPRESS

670
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,068
GUDAM EXPRESS

671
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,610
My stomach is numb.

672
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,580
It's like being given an anesthesia
at the dentist.

673
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:05,649
I can't feel a thing.

674
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,285
I want to stand up,

675
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,023
but...

676
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:16,793
What's wrong with me?

677
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,930
Can you please shut up?
You're making me sick...

678
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,467
Damn it.

679
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,975
It's going as planned.

680
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,115
You still expect to survive this?

681
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:40,317
You moron.

682
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:43,620
Do you really believe
you're in a position to say that?

683
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,424
You two, get inside the vault.

684
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,127
Why? So that we can suffocate to death?

685
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,329
Yes. Why ask what you know the answer to?

686
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,565
If someone dies,

687
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:56,833
that'll create more problems.

688
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,636
-Mr. Hwang should--
-Shut it. You can join him.

689
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:02,072
Me? Why me?

690
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,374
Get in there.

691
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,643
What the hell?

692
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,413
Didn't I already warn you?

693
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,848
I told you not to go against

694
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:12,983
my word again.

695
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,787
I know that you're with him,
so get in there.

696
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,589
Who? What? Why? When?

697
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,558
That is absurd.

698
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,827
I am no in league with her.

699
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,095
He said we aren't.

700
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:28,298
We heard you two talking.

701
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:33,036
Also, don't trust anything he says.

702
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,672
"I'm hungry. I'm tired."

703
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,975
Those are the only words
he truly speaks his mind about.

704
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,410
Such bullshit.

705
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:41,878
What was it that you said?

706
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:44,414
"I'm hungry. I'm tired."

707
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,782
Everything else I say is lies?

708
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,752
You fucking assholes.

709
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,856
I guess I forgot about
the possibility of a bug.

710
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:54,257
Get inside.

711
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:58,261
Don't be absurd.
I didn't say anything particularly bad.

712
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:05,502
Go in.

713
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,441
Didn't you say that
one will run out of air in there?

714
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,443
You're right. What now?

715
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,612
-Keep an eye on the situation.
-Where are you going?

716
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,147
The old lady is in trouble.

717
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,888
Look at him taking action at a crisis.

718
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,089
What's so cool about that?

719
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:29,092
He's heading in there with no plan.

720
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:32,829
DAEBEOM TRADING

721
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,229
Father?

722
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,598
Get him.

723
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:20,744
Hun-seok,

724
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,946
don't get involved in the fight this time.

725
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,348
Sorry?

726
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,361
You bastard. Now it's an even fight.

727
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:39,763
Why are you butting in?

728
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,965
I always pay back my debts.

729
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,646
Don't just stand there. Shoot them.

730
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,515
Should I kill them?

731
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,443
Go.

732
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,946
Don't you think you should've
formed a plan?

733
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,648
Tell me about it.

734
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,017
I'll go inside the vault

735
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,319
in Prosecutor Park's place.

736
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,323
Is that why you came here?
Are you her boyfriend?

737
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,692
I'll take her place, so let her leave.

738
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,128
It's fine. I'll just head inside.

739
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,998
You're embarrassing me
by giving them the wrong idea.

740
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,734
What the hell?

741
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,569
Are you all on one side then?

742
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,104
Damn it.

743
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,706
That's right. I'm working with the priest.

744
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,476
So we have a bitch and a bastard.

745
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,346
So you lied about being on my side.

746
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,585
Kill them.

747
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,719
You...

748
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,889
Welcome to the party.

749
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,258
What the hell is that smell?

750
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,096
Is this the local bank?
So much for security.

751
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,198
I told you to stay outside.

752
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,632
How could we?

753
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:25,368
You're carrying blanks, right?

754
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,770
As if!

755
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,038
Then shoot.

756
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,740
-They're not blanks.
-Shoot me then.

757
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:32,976
Damn, he caught on.

758
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,047
Kang Seok-tae.

759
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,683
-What?
-If I'm still alive tomorrow,

760
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,585
you'll get into huge trouble.

761
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,520
Are you perhaps bipolar?

762
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,255
Get down on your knees and beg,
why don't you?

763
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:49,192
You just have to look all tough,
don't you?

764
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,660
Get rid of them.

765
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,662
Jung-gwon,

766
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,265
your life will be much easier without me.

767
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,666
No one will come after you.

768
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:01,004
I'm offering to head inside,
so how's that not a good deal?

769
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,174
-Father!
-No, Father.

770
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,677
Be wise for once
and stop picking on children and women.

771
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:09,946
As a former NIS agent,

772
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,348
you should be ashamed of yourself.

773
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,557
Try being a man this time.

774
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:50,353
GUDAM EXPRESS

775
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:58,995
Even the rain feels refreshing.

776
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,031
If you're done, let's get going.

777
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,605
Can you be any less stupid?

778
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,408
Why do you think

779
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,144
I've been wiping your sorry ass
all this time?

780
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,012
Have you never thought about that?

781
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:17,914
You bastard.

782
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,084
I'll be taking the money
you worked hard to save.

783
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:22,118
Thanks.

784
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,486
Bring me the bag.

785
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,558
I still have some affection left for you,

786
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,026
so enjoy my gift.

787
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,462
If I truly were a psychopath,

788
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:36,132
I would've locked you up in the vault too.

789
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:39,669
You won't be able to do
anything with the money.

790
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:40,970
Right.

791
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,341
Well, I can almost make a bed with it,
so no worries.

792
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,242
Also, don't come after me.

793
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,244
I know a lot of your weaknesses,

794
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,779
ones you don't want as public knowledge.

795
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,348
Got it?

796
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:53,450
Let's roll.

797
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,588
Let's go!

798
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,940
That dirty bastard.

799
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,142
Once an asshole, always an asshole.

800
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,111
Why did you have to provoke him?

801
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,414
Exactly.
We could've persuaded him, you know.

802
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:26,049
You make me speechless.

803
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,618
Just kill me already.

804
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,955
It's not as suffocating
as I thought it would be.

805
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,268
What the hell?

806
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,936
That revving sound...

807
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,975
Isn't that the device
that sucks all the oxygen out?

808
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,777
Wait, what's this?

809
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,979
It's a 50,000 won bill.

810
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,885
We now have...

811
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,654
only 15 minutes to live.

812
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:06,923
That's if there were only one of us here.

813
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,258
Two, four, six.

814
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:12,762
No way. That means we only have
a couple of minutes left.

815
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,168
Are we all going to die?

816
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,481
Lee Jung-gwon betrayed Kang Seok-tae

817
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,649
and ran off with all the money.
The 150 billion won.

818
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,084
I'm coming for the money.

819
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,519
How did they get out?

820
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,521
We need something bigger.

821
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:13,990
Why do I keep smelling poop though?

822
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,925
Can you really make sure
that my son stays safe?

823
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:16,860
Yes.

824
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,730
I will repay you
for what you did this time.

825
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,337
