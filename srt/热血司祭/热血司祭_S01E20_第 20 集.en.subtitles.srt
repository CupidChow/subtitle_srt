1
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,186
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,521
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,323
You came.

4
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,008
Hey, I had to bring her here myself.

5
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,677
This was the best option we had,
if we were going to deal with you.

6
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,151
Did you bring the passport?

7
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,558
Here.

8
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,560
Your passport to hell.

9
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,129
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
PASSPORT

10
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,664
Take it if you can.

11
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,466
Did you bring yours too?

12
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,460
Tell me the reason
you're doing this to me.

13
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,462
"Reason"?

14
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,365
You're just so annoying.

15
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,368
Hey.

16
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,672
Do you know who killed the most people
in our counterterrorism team?

17
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:21,808
It was you.

18
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,178
Even without the 11 children,
it was still you.

19
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,348
Do you know how many awards you got
for killing people?

20
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,450
You used to be so merciless,

21
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,919
but you're suddenly acting like a saint,

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,555
picking on me and bruising my face.

23
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,558
Don't you think you'd be annoyed as well?

24
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,232
The children weren't our enemies.

25
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,867
No, they weren't.

26
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,571
You killed dozens of people
without batting an eye,

27
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,507
so why are you crying
over those 11 children?

28
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,943
It looks so fake to me.

29
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,147
Gosh, you're so fucking chatty.

30
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,316
Make it short.

31
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,484
Hey.

32
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,421
Let's end this bad relationship here.

33
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,623
From this moment on,

34
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,326
don't expect any kind of mercy.

35
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,364
I'm no longer a priest.

36
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,339
Hey.

37
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,940
What are you waiting for?

38
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,985
Hae-il!

39
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:25,958
Why, that...

40
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,637
Father!

41
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,839
Even if these guys kill us,

42
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,076
we will never blame you, Father!

43
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,313
So please stay focused and fight it out!

44
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,016
Hey, one moment.

45
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,238
Hey.

46
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,842
I did expect it,
but I'm still dumbfounded.

47
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,331
Nothing's simple between us, is it?

48
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,932
So let's end it in a simple way.

49
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,346
I put in just one bullet.

50
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,428
Hurry up!

51
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,596
If it's just one shot,

52
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,366
you'd better not miss.

53
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,175
Father Michael. Please don't.

54
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,845
Don't do it.

55
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,086
-Father!
-Father!

56
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,258
Sister!

57
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,062
Father, don't.

58
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,097
Sister.

59
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,937
Father. You don't have to do this.

60
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,638
You already got him.

61
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,875
Hey, hurry up.

62
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,944
It's what you do best.

63
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,212
Shut up, you bastard!

64
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,116
Even if you kill me, it's self-defense,

65
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,751
so you won't go to jail.

66
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,187
If you kill me,

67
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,257
you can go on living
like a killing machine again.

68
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,959
You'll make good money, too.

69
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,365
Father, look at me.

70
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,400
I'm a prosecutor. You need to trust me.

71
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,705
I'll make sure he rots in jail forever,
okay?

72
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,808
Father. I'll be the one to shoot, then.

73
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,611
I'm the detective.

74
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,780
Hey, Hae-il.

75
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,352
You and I aren't that different.

76
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,225
Why are you making things so hard?

77
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,628
Just shoot me.

78
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,663
Let's end this, already.

79
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,469
Father.

80
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,205
He's not worth it.

81
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,875
Why do you have to withdraw
your priestship because of him?

82
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:07,280
That's right, Father.
You need to remain at the cathedral.

83
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,949
You can tell me off all you want, okay?

84
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,886
Let's keep working together
like we used to, Father.

85
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,356
They are all your people, Father.

86
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,192
They will gladly take your side

87
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,462
and they found salvation through you.

88
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,100
You only need to save yourself now,
Father.

89
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,808
There's no such thing as salvation.

90
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,378
Just shoot. Kill me.

91
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,048
Kill me, you bastard.

92
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,686
Go on. I said, kill me!

93
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,677
"I...

94
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,948
tell you...

95
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,152
to forgive...

96
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,191
not just seven times...

97
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,729
but even up to 77 times."

98
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,562
Thank you, Lord.

99
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,073
Call for backup and 911,
and tie them all up.

100
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,374
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

101
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,817
Good job, Father.

102
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,301
-Blood pressure?
-It's 109 over 71.

103
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,072
Keep the respirator on,

104
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,107
and check his blood pressure
every two hours.

105
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,475
Yes, sir.

106
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,727
Gosh, Father. You're a complete mess.

107
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,628
Goodness.

108
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,163
I'm fine.

109
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,534
Father,
why don't you just change your name?

110
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,336
Instead of Kim Tsunami,

111
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,140
what about Kim Pond or Kim Reservoir?

112
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,675
Oh, gosh.

113
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,978
It's nice to see you smile for a change.

114
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,582
Is that true, though?

115
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,283
What do you mean?

116
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,753
That the evil in this world
doesn't see nor listen.

117
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,588
So you got my message?

118
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,327
Do you really think
everything is just a coincidence?

119
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,595
Of course.

120
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,997
It's not that the evil targeted you.

121
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,533
You just happened to be in its path.

122
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,840
I always thought the Lord was testing me.

123
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,744
But I didn't have that feeling today.

124
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,449
He wasn't testing me,

125
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,087
but watching over me anxiously,
hoping I overcome it on my own.

126
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,555
I realized that today.

127
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,759
I don't think the Lord
will be anxious anymore.

128
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,602
What about Sister Kim?

129
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,604
I took her to the car so she could rest.

130
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,807
She was just about to pass out.

131
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,509
Of course she would be.

132
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,045
Of course, after all that drama.

133
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,119
Hey.

134
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,193
Why is that jerk snickering like that
when he's being arrested?

135
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,564
Just look at him glaring at us.

136
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,920
It's all right.
It was the right way to handle it.

137
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,223
Damn it.

138
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,078
My Lord.

139
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,515
Please shine your light unto this soul.

140
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:22,187
Do not regard his sins,
but show mercy instead.

141
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,960
I shall teach the sinners your paths

142
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,431
and the sinners shall return to you.

143
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,569
Amen.

144
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,549
What happened?

145
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,017
There was an accident,

146
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,053
so the passport dealers all shut down.

147
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,755
Damn it.

148
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,724
What great timing.

149
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,927
Should I look into China or Japan, sir?

150
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,496
No, forget it.

151
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,733
A stowaway is too disgraceful.

152
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,839
Since we're at it,
let's finish it off with Lee Jung-gwon.

153
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,141
Are you getting the gang ready?

154
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,443
Yes, sir.

155
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,145
If he can't get away,

156
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,748
we should at least pay him
what he deserves.

157
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,185
Seong-gyu.

158
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,420
You'll be fine, won't you?

159
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,392
You will wake up, right?

160
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,034
I won't go anywhere until you do.

161
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,183
Let me hear you call my name
one last time,

162
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,819
and then I'll leave.

163
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,461
So, wake up.

164
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,706
Yo-han, what are you doing?

165
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,109
Oh, I was just feeling the gravity.

166
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:25,878
The what?

167
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:30,049
This is the first time
I'm telling you this,

168
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,385
but I had some changes in my body
after that day.

169
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,254
"That day"?

170
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,591
Oh, no. Yo-han.

171
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,163
The moment they struck my spine,
I felt a twinge.

172
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,298
And a few days later,

173
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,270
I started seeing astral illusions

174
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,638
and started sweating like crazy.

175
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,940
Are you sure it's not an illness?

176
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,275
I'm healthy.

177
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,445
And once the sweating stopped,
I started feeling things.

178
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:03,916
Whenever the moon is up, I feel this pull,

179
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:08,087
and whenever an apple falls,
I can feel the flow of air.

180
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,389
Should I really be listening to this?

181
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,524
Yes, ma'am. That's not it.

182
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,426
When I look up at the sky,

183
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,662
I can see the remnants
of planet rotations.

184
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,164
To be exact,

185
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:23,035
I can see the remnants of the planets
rotating around the Earth

186
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,437
as if it were computer graphics.

187
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,342
Last week, I noticed a new movement,

188
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,278
so I sent an email to NASA.

189
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,482
"NASA"? The National Aeronautics
and Space Administration?

190
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,583
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,552
Am I just not getting it
when you're trying to say

192
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,122
you want compensation
for getting hurt because of me?

193
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,290
No, ma'am. Of course, not.

194
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,894
It's just such a mysterious planet.

195
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,297
All right.
You were quite mysterious, to begin with.

196
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,900
Feel all you want.

197
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,536
Go ahead and feel, okay? I'll get going.

198
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,770
See you, ma'am.

199
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,375
It's moving, ma'am! Amazing!

200
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,181
He's not normal, either.

201
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,318
I should send this to NASA. Okay!

202
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,688
The suicide case of a priest

203
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,590
at a church in Gudam-gu, Seoul,

204
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,958
was revealed to be a murder case

205
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,528
led by corrupt forces of the area
and a chief prosecutor

206
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,029
of the central district office,

207
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,298
not suicide due to pressure
from the investigation

208
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,267
of embezzlement of church funds
and sexual harassment.

209
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,737
-Yes!
-The witnesses who testified earlier

210
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,572
-We did it!
-were revealed to have been bribed.

211
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,607
According to the police,

212
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,410
the said corrupt forces
and chief prosecutor

213
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,246
attempted to set up a foundation
to launder secret funds,

214
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,849
and committed the crime
in the process of pressuring the priest,

215
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,553
who had been running
the district orphanage.

216
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,355
The police are currently investigating
the culprit

217
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,591
directly involved in the murder.

218
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,763
Father.

219
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,201
It's all over.

220
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,575
You can rest now.

221
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:31,997
No, Father.

222
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,702
How can you say you're leaving?

223
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,005
While reinvestigating Father Lee's case,

224
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,275
I did too many things
I should never have done as a priest.

225
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,578
I'm no longer worthy.

226
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:51,883
That...

227
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:53,986
You had no choice

228
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,721
-in order to fight Satan's evil--
-Sister Kim.

229
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,324
I had been using that as an excuse,

230
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,561
when I had become Satan myself.

231
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:04,997
Father.

232
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll continue my duties as a priest
only until Father Han wakes up.

233
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,570
Once he comes back,

234
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,206
I'm going to withdraw my priestship.

235
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,513
Please don't tell the others.

236
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,937
PROSECUTOR PARK GYEONG-SEON

237
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,642
The arrest warrant lacks evidence.

238
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,346
And there is no possibility
of evidence destruction, is there?

239
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,782
And there is also the question

240
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,383
of your credibility, ma'am.

241
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,419
Hey, Gyeong-seon.

242
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,789
If you contact the press like that
before getting the facts straight,

243
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,058
did you think I would get scared and say,

244
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,293
"My goodness, I'm so sorry"?

245
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,062
You idiot.

246
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,998
Why are you so naive, Gyeong-seon?

247
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,867
Is that all you learned from me?

248
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,339
Good luck trying to win against lawyers
from the best law firms in the country.

249
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,241
You think you can get away with anything

250
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,177
with these lawyers from Hanju Group,
don't you?

251
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,646
But too bad for you.

252
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,183
How much longer do you think
you'll be able to get help

253
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,885
from these mighty lawyers
you trust so much?

254
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,160
We have obtained the voice recording of
Kim Geon-yong, the son of Kim Jung-cheol,

255
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,363
who is the CEO of Hanju Group,

256
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,099
hiring a killer at Rising Moon.

257
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,570
That was the best timing!

258
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,406
Take care of someone for me.
It's a female prosecutor.

259
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,775
Her name is Park Gyeong-seon.

260
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,744
She lives here in Gudam-gu.

261
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,079
Make it seem like it was just a robbery.

262
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,181
How much do you charge these days?

263
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,417
You... Where did you get...

264
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,052
Next is the interview of the prosecutor

265
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,720
who escaped the dangers of being murdered.

266
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,956
It just creeps me out.

267
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,859
How could they even imagine
killing a prosecutor like that?

268
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,527
What am I, a cockroach?

269
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,828
INTERVIEW WITH PROSECUTOR PARK

270
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,564
I can't even fall asleep these days

271
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,099
due to the trauma.

272
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,103
It's coming!

273
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,073
Shock!

274
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,647
It's coming!

275
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,183
Shock!

276
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,654
Would you like to continue?

277
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,391
-Attorney Baek?
-It's me, sir.

278
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,826
-Attorney Lee!
-Yes.

279
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,728
-Yes, I got it, sir.
-Attorney Jeong!

280
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,630
That's too bad.

281
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,967
We don't have anyone left to help out
our former chief.

282
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,470
What will you do now?

283
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,705
It's only just the beginning.

284
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,242
You are arrested without a warrant
on suspicion of murder

285
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,777
of Father Lee Yeong-jun.

286
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,380
-What?
-Come in, everyone!

287
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,618
Why do you look so well
when you're on the run?

288
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,824
I'll cuff you up beautifully.

289
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,069
Go on and tell us.

290
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,506
You shoved Father Lee
and killed him, didn't you?

291
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,175
Hey, go and get me some coffee.

292
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,644
I'll speak when my lawyer gets here.

293
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,281
They all came and left.

294
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,584
I know you don't have anyone else.

295
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,854
You rude little brat.

296
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,856
I have another lawyer coming.

297
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,993
Gosh, you're in trouble.

298
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:58,864
You...

299
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,534
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

300
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,374
I told you it's almost over, didn't I?

301
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,610
There's still more left.

302
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,714
Don't talk if you don't want to.

303
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,618
We'll make sure to get back at you
twice as much.

304
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,689
Too bad I don't know anything.

305
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,059
You should try harder.

306
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,800
Well, we can't fight back
if he sticks to that strategy.

307
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,702
Even if we put Chief Kang
and Mr. Hwang together,

308
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,137
they're only going to blame each other.

309
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,273
"You're the culprit."

310
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,042
"No, I'm not!" Like that.

311
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,746
It might be useless
even if we get Hwang Cheol-beom.

312
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,014
We still need to get him.

313
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,849
We'll see what happens from there.

314
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,819
Where in the world is that jerk?

315
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,723
We didn't announce
Lee Jung-gwon death yet, did we?

316
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,927
No, sir.
We haven't notified the press yet.

317
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,268
Are you sure
that's where Lee Jung-gwon is?

318
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,439
Yes, sir. I checked with
the Night Mole of Mullae-dong.

319
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,076
Be fully prepared.

320
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,645
Are you sure you don't need me?

321
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,149
Yes, we'll get him on our own today,
no matter what.

322
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,818
We need to bring justice, don't we?

323
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,753
All right.

324
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,656
Call me if anything goes wrong.
I'll go right away.

325
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,224
Be careful.

326
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,062
Father, take a look at this.

327
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,231
The forensics found this
under the passenger seat

328
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,100
of Lee Jung-gwon's car.

329
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,706
Aren't these spy cameras?

330
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,975
Yes, sir. There are all kinds of them.

331
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,177
There was even a button-type
with a microscopic lens.

332
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,014
I think there are backup files
in the flash drive.

333
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,254
Lee Jung-gwon, you fool.

334
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,795
What's this? Why isn't anyone here?

335
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,797
We're here.

336
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,404
Gosh.

337
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,208
I guess sad forebodings are never wrong.

338
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,176
How stupid of me to fall for this trap.

339
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,213
You seem friendly
with the Night Mole of Mullae-dong.

340
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,016
Why don't you come with us, Mr. Hwang?

341
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,419
You don't even have the priest,

342
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,455
and there are one,
two, three, four, five...

343
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,724
You think the five of you can manage?

344
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,459
We're going to make it up
to Yeong-cheon today.

345
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,696
And for living like a wuss all these years
because of you.

346
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,264
Let's clear all the debts today.

347
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,703
Gosh, look at you.

348
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,672
All right.

349
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,940
Come on. Bring it on!

350
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,327
Move it!

351
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,197
Why, you!

352
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,719
I wasn't going to get involved at first,

353
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,788
but I couldn't help but come.

354
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:20,892
I had to see what kind of shit
you've been doing.

355
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:25,597
Mr. Kang Seok-tae,
take a look with your own two eyes.

356
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,141
This...

357
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,076
How dare you...

358
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,846
Lee Jung-gwon has no trust for people,

359
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,516
so he always keeps a spy camera on him
whenever he meets people like you.

360
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,585
Things that look like glasses,
watches, buttons, and more.

361
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,821
They make perfect insurance.

362
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,525
But that day,
he had it hidden in his button.

363
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,165
Don't laugh.

364
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,901
You're just as guilty for moving the body.

365
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,803
And I will gladly accept the punishment.

366
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:10,708
But it's time that you also payed
for Father Lee's case, isn't it?

367
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,611
Of course. Did you think I'd sneak away?

368
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,149
Are you serious?

369
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,119
Sure. I already summed up my offenses

370
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,954
and sentence into a document.

371
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,423
Once we sort everything out,

372
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,693
I'm going to hand it over
to the Supreme Office myself.

373
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,529
I get that you want to repent, but...

374
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,265
Are you really going to go to jail?

375
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,433
Yes.

376
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,504
I summed it up,
and there's just no other way.

377
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,408
I thought you would just quit
and become a lawyer,

378
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,710
or something like that.

379
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,445
No way.

380
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,148
That's not repenting.
It's just changing jobs.

381
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,784
That's true, but...

382
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,754
You used to tell me
that I'm going to have to pay, didn't you?

383
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,793
Have you forgotten how persistent I am?

384
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,299
I'll get going, then.

385
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,286
I wanted to ask you something.

386
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:29,754
Go ahead, sir.

387
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,656
About the case files

388
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,491
and ledger of Rising Moon,

389
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:37,095
and the investigation records
on the corrupt forces of Gudam-gu.

390
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:41,332
Did Prosecutor Kim really root it out
all on his own?

391
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,803
-Yes, sir.
-I'm not trying to scold you.

392
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,840
Someone's doing a good job,

393
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,575
and I just want to acknowledge it.

394
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,377
Go on and tell me.

395
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,380
Stop pretending not to know.

396
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,783
There's another senior who was in it.

397
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:00,985
Prosecutor Park Gyeong-seon

398
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,754
of the Central District Office.

399
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,091
"Park Gyeong-seon
of the Central District Office"?

400
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,862
It was our fault,

401
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,097
so let's admit it and cooperate.

402
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,999
What are you talking about, you fool?

403
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,701
There's nothing to admit
or cooperate with.

404
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,671
You were the ones who fooled me!

405
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,707
You're the one who asked for help,
you psycho.

406
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,576
I'm not even from around here.

407
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,579
It's a hard fact that you walked in
out of nowhere

408
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,181
and tried to take over our place.

409
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,016
Hard facts, my ass.

410
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,384
Anyways, I didn't do anything.

411
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:34,752
I'm the real victim here.

412
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,921
Why am I the only one wearing
hospital clothes?

413
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,823
I'm the one...

414
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,261
who is being wronged here.

415
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:46,164
I only live for enlightenment,

416
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,232
and this man demanded money from me.

417
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,201
How could a high official do such a thing?

418
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,736
What?

419
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,072
You're the one who offered
that golden toad!

420
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,173
How dare you hit me?

421
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,442
Do you know how old I am?

422
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,877
-What?
-Take a guess!

423
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,946
-Go on!
-Enough!

424
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,516
Gosh, can't I have a conversation here?

425
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,318
Sit down.

426
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,621
Shouldn't you also be stepping down
and joining us here?

427
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,591
Exactly. You think you're safe, don't you?

428
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,093
Don't worry.

429
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,796
As soon as I take care of you all,
I'm going to step down as well.

430
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,301
Anyway, Chief Kang ordered the murder
on Congressman Park,

431
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,137
and Hwang Cheol-beom
and his sidekicks implemented it, right?

432
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,773
Don't even try to lie,
since I was there with you.

433
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,508
On that note,

434
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,811
this is all Congressman Park's work.

435
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,114
We were only dragged around,

436
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,249
and he planned everything.

437
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,352
That's right.
Congressman Park did everything.

438
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,122
Gosh, that's enough.

439
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,724
How dare you talk like that
just because he's not here?

440
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,994
Mr. Park!

441
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,834
Are you kidding me?

442
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,673
Chief Kang. Chief Nam.

443
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:07,278
Why, you little son of bitches!

444
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,814
I did what?

445
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,282
How did you...

446
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,552
You died. You're supposed to be dead!

447
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,205
PARK WON-MU

448
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,880
Are you trying to kill me?

449
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,616
-Gosh, sir.
-Act! Come on and act!

450
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:48,986
Are you actually out of breath?

451
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,055
He was killed by an assailant.

452
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,391
But the nurse on TV was a witness...

453
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,262
Those who lie will be lied to.

454
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,232
I'm going to expose you all...

455
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,633
Gosh.

456
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,836
I'm going to expose you all.

457
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,939
Even the ones
the director doesn't know about.

458
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,675
Take your time, sir.

459
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,244
Calm down. Relax.

460
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:15,813
You...

461
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,984
won't be able to get me that easily.

462
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,786
My goodness. That was unexpected.

463
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:26,724
My enlightened devotees
won't leave you alone.

464
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,660
What will those enlightened devotees do?

465
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,630
I'm going to use their faith in me
as my weapons

466
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,798
to destroy you

467
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,400
for good.

468
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,471
Woo-ta.

469
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,073
Me?

470
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:45,109
Then shall we see how it goes?

471
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:51,282
The truth about Maegakkyo was revealed,
bringing shock to the society.

472
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,783
A video from an anonymous source

473
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,853
revealed the speech and behavior
of Ki Yong-mun,

474
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,989
the leader of Maegakkyo.

475
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,626
Woo-ta.

476
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,061
Make sure the ugly ones don't join us.
It's annoying.

477
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,830
They'll never figure out
what enlightenment is.

478
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,498
There's no enlightenment for those things.

479
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,600
Why do we have so little money this month?

480
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,470
Is it so hard for you
to convince those airheads?

481
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,941
Enlightenment!

482
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,644
Enlightenment, my ass.

483
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,347
Let's take every last bit from them
and make them penniless.

484
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,418
Oh, my gosh! That was in my phone!

485
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,519
Oh, no!

486
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,734
Isn't that the witch's phone?

487
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,478
Shall we pay that team a visit?

488
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,614
Your pronunciation is amazing.

489
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,024
We always succeed

490
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,894
We do

491
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,268
We can't get caught.

492
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,470
Hang in there a bit longer.

493
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:23,040
If we stay hidden,
they're bound to give up.

494
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,743
How long do we have to wait?

495
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,746
It's already been two weeks.

496
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,582
We can still keep going.

497
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,918
Take it easy on the food!

498
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,222
I'm sure the police have started
to give up looking.

499
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,025
Those stupid cops.

500
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,495
They can't find us when we're right here.

501
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,767
-Damn it!
-What?

502
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,507
What's this? Were you still here?

503
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,809
It's damp in here, isn't it?

504
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,812
Did you know we were in here?

505
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,215
Sure. We found out last week.

506
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,984
Then why didn't you get us then?

507
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:10,521
I'm sorry. We had something
more important than you guys.

508
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,989
Damn it.

509
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,792
Then should we return another time?

510
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,460
Do you want me to cover you up again?

511
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,663
No, we're coming.

512
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,066
Order us some food!

513
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,701
Order something!

514
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,937
Hurry up and get something delivered!

515
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,572
WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY

516
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,377
Why did you have to come here?
This is embarrassing.

517
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,846
How long do you have to stay here?

518
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,148
I don't know!

519
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,117
Are you trying to tease me?

520
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,720
I don't know how long it may take,

521
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,757
but if I'm still in Korea until then,

522
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,827
I'll save up a lot of money,

523
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,530
so you can come to me

524
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,832
if you don't have anywhere to go.

525
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,205
Forget it, punk.
You just take care of yourself.

526
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:02,973
I'll...

527
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:06,177
I'll be fine, so you go on with your life.

528
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,112
Take care.

529
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,216
My friend, Long-D.

530
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,820
All right, you too.

531
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,723
Be careful with that scooter.
I saw how much

532
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,825
you speed up on that thing.

533
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,460
You're going to get yourself killed.

534
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,163
See you.

535
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,667
Songsak.

536
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,406
Thanks for coming, my friend.

537
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,691
Don't try to say anything.
Just blink, okay?

538
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,065
Thank you, Lord.

539
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,835
-Thank you so much, Lord.
-Thank you, Lord.

540
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,281
What?

541
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,616
Hae-il.

542
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,696
You did well. You really did.

543
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,410
We're really finished, right?

544
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,080
Yes, ma'am! It's finally over.

545
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,051
You sent over all the case files
to the prosecutor's office, right?

546
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,354
Of course. I sent every last detail.

547
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:36,160
Good job, everyone. You did well.

548
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,064
I wish Father Han was with us.

549
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,333
He'll be back soon, won't he?

550
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,535
I heard he's recovering quickly.

551
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,539
I think this will be
the last week for me, too.

552
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,441
As a police officer, I mean.

553
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,011
All right. This is a true ending.

554
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,650
When Father Han returns,

555
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,786
I'm also withdrawing my priestship.

556
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,691
What do you mean,
you're withdrawing your priestship?

557
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,594
I've made too many mistakes,

558
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,596
so I don't think I can remain a priest.

559
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,933
No, Father. You should stay.

560
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,869
Yes. We can't let you do that.

561
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,805
I agree, Father.

562
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,074
My decision will remain the same.

563
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,710
So please just accept it.

564
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,290
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

565
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,928
VIOLENT CRIME SQUAD 1

566
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,098
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

567
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,706
You punks.

568
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,442
I said I'll take full responsibility.

569
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:01,946
No way, sir! We're all in this together.

570
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,914
Just like how we began.

571
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,488
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

572
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,409
MY SINS

573
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,813
Good job. Very good.

574
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,115
You're so cool, Park Gyeong-seon.

575
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,829
What are you accompanying me for?

576
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,932
At least you won't feel lonely.

577
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,534
I guess it does make me less anxious,

578
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,503
having you come with me.

579
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,606
That's not why you're less anxious.

580
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,308
It's because you have nothing to hide.

581
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,576
Do you think so?

582
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,813
Old lady.

583
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,752
It's not too late yet.
Try to find another way.

584
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,886
No.

585
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,922
It's the only way I can apologize.

586
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,592
Like you said,

587
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,528
you need to apologize to the person
you wronged first

588
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,799
if you want to confess
and become the Lord's child.

589
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:34,872
But it turns out my job makes it hard
for me to apologize each time.

590
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,041
So that's why I chose to do this.

591
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:39,309
And...

592
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,613
Also because of what happened
to Father Lee.

593
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,455
The flowers are so pretty, aren't they?

594
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,131
Come and take a look, Father. Hurry.

595
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,605
We're almost here, already.

596
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,781
Old lady.

597
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,686
Thank you for following the words

598
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:24,955
of the Lord.

599
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:30,427
Thank you for leading me to that path.

600
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:36,100
May the Lord's blessings
be upon you, always.

601
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,212
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

602
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:02,059
Where did that screw go?
Why am I so dazed?

603
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,186
Thank you, Lord.

604
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,688
Thank you!

605
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,990
Let's go to NASA!

606
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:11,128
Lord, thank you!

607
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,798
SEOUL EASTERN DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

608
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,369
So you're Park Gyeong-seon?

609
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,271
Yes, sir.

610
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,841
I heard you handed in
your charges and sentence

611
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,909
to the Supreme Court yourself?

612
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,511
Yes, sir.

613
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:31,415
Did you really do that to get punished?

614
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:33,417
Yes, sir.

615
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:37,521
I believe I should get a punishment,
since I did something wrong.

616
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:38,989
If you know that,

617
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,992
why did you join the corrupt forces
and take action with them?

618
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:47,497
Even if you confess your crimes,
you won't be able to go to prison.

619
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,733
If we take judicial action on you,

620
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,802
things will get difficult for some of us.

621
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:58,976
I'm sure you'll only be sent away
to a provincial office at most.

622
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,314
But punishment is supposed to be

623
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:06,950
agonizing

624
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,786
and strenuous, don't you agree?

625
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,389
Yes, sir.

626
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,991
In that sense,

627
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,761
would you consider working for me?

628
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,266
-Sorry?
-You'll be chasing

629
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,802
all those corrupt forces you like so much.

630
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:31,775
And we need to get back
on the Rising Moon investigation, too.

631
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,176
Will that be

632
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,179
punishment enough for me, sir?

633
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,254
You'll get death threats every day,

634
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,625
the press will be attacking you
all the time,

635
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,895
and your whole family
will be subject to tax investigations.

636
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,065
Even the footsteps on the streets
will startle you.

637
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,308
I wouldn't exactly call that heavenly.

638
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,981
-I'll do it, sir.
-Great.

639
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:14,151
I have a condition, though, sir.

640
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,452
What is it?

641
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,621
There's this great team I know.

642
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,356
Please let me work with them.

643
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,600
I'll make you a good shot, sir. Enjoy!

644
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,437
-Enjoy, sir.
-Okay.

645
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,238
Enjoy, sir. It's my honor.

646
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,607
Come on, cheers!

647
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,176
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

648
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,844
-There you go.
-Thank you, sir.

649
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,686
What are you going to do
about Congressman Shin, sir?

650
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,321
We'll see how he goes.

651
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,825
That rude jerk.
He keeps ordering me around.

652
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,489
We were only looking out
for each other's kids.

653
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,457
How dare they call it an abuse of power?

654
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,593
Just let some time pass, sir.

655
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,363
The people in this country
will get over it in no time.

656
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,400
That's how it's always been.

657
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,636
Ma'am, the recording is going well though.

658
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,027
It is time you kept your promise.

659
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,631
I shouldn't have made that bet.

660
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,733
What if I solve this case?

661
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:13,703
Beef, special cuts.

662
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,140
It's a deal.

663
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,043
I helped you sort everything out,
didn't I?

664
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,312
I don't really think you did much.

665
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,680
What do you mean?

666
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,316
I can practically see every moment
flash before my eyes.

667
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,620
Do you really have to eat this now?

668
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,856
Don't go crazy. I don't have much money.

669
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:36,493
We'll see.

670
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,338
Bring all the beef! The beef!

671
00:51:55,412 --> 00:52:00,016
The Lord never abandons the brave.

672
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,288
The kind of bravery the Lord expects

673
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,358
is overcoming your fears to fight.

674
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,127
How dare you make excuses?

675
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,863
Hey! You're driving me nuts!

676
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,564
Hurry up and spill it out.

677
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,500
And putting yourself

678
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,569
at the very last.

679
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,838
That way!

680
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,513
The justice brought with this bravery

681
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,982
shall be strong and fair,

682
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,352
and make a world where justice
overcomes power.

683
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:39,623
A world where the power is used
with the right intentions.

684
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,093
Now that I think of it,

685
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:48,231
the kingdom of God I had been dreaming of
wasn't so far away.

686
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,170
A world where scarred people
embrace each other,

687
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,573
living in harmony without walls or lines,

688
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,577
and are willing to sacrifice themselves
to make a better world.

689
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,480
That was it.

690
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:16,493
Even when in the Lord's kingdom,
I will be in fury.

691
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:22,566
I shall lead the sinners in the right way
with the right intentions,

692
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,138
and no matter where my assistance may be,

693
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:33,376
it shall be my fate and calling.

694
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:41,851
HOUSE OF GUDAM

695
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,588
Why did you all follow me out?

696
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,223
Two years will fly by.

697
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,959
Stay out of trouble while you're abroad.

698
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:52,095
You won't be able to explain yourself
because of the language barrier,

699
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,364
so be careful, all right?

700
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,402
Make sure to check your email
and texts often.

701
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,870
I'll do that.

702
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:04,741
Make sure to lead the people there
to the Lord.

703
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,243
I'll do that.

704
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:08,078
Take care, Father.

705
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,814
Don't forget to take your medications.

706
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,858
Goodbye, Father.

707
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:25,829
Have a safe trip.

708
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,298
We won't be going anywhere.

709
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,367
All right. Take care, everyone.

710
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:35,005
These goodbyes are taking so long.
Go on, you'll be late.

711
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:36,406
All right.

712
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,300
Did you do something wrong again, Father?

713
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,001
No, of course not.

714
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,935
Unbelievable!

715
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,137
That's him, isn't it?

716
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:48,945
Michael.

717
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,881
Papa.

718
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:53,483
-Papa.
-Papa.

719
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,253
-Unbelievable.
-Papa.

720
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:01,224
Thank you for protecting the honor
of the Catholic church

721
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,093
and my friend, Father Gabriel.

722
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:16,039
-Papa.
-Papa.

723
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,980
-Papa!
-Papa!

724
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,154
Michael, you are a true priest.

725
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,123
You should remain at the cathedral.

726
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:35,725
-Papa!
-Take pictures.

727
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:36,960
Selfies!

728
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,295
Me, first! I want selfies, too!

729
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,564
-Me, too!
-Me, first!

730
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,968
One, two, three! Oh, Papa.

731
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,722
What's taking them so long?
Why are they so slow?

732
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,030
Buddha mantra, my ass!

733
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,965
May the Lord bless you.

734
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,768
You don't live more than a hundred years,

735
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,970
so why have the worries worth a thousand?

736
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,439
Why, you...

737
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,207
Hey, there.

738
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,346
Goodness, what's this? Why are you a monk?

739
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,117
You're supposed to be a priest!
You won't match each other!

740
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,889
It's the great union of religions.

741
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,025
Where is Detective Seo, anyway?
What's keeping her?

742
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:49,632
Watch carefully.
It's a very graceful move.

743
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,502
What's wrong with her?

744
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,738
Just look at us. My goodness.

745
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,907
Gosh, I never get my way.

746
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,176
Oh, no.

747
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,351
I guess we should let them take
the shuttle bus to hell.

748
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:12,689
Let's go!

749
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,457
Shall we go, then?

750
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,089
