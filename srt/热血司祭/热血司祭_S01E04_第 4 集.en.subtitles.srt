1
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,487
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:21,821
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:42,108
You're one annoying religious man.

4
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,211
How do you want to get beat up, Father?

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,314
Have you ever heard

6
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,683
of capoeira?

7
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,620
You're not supposed to attack
while I get ready.

8
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,389
Now be amazed.

9
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,879
Guys, today we get that priest
and go to hell.

10
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,081
You hear me? Kill him.

11
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,182
Cut it out!

12
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,018
What are you doing?

13
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,289
Don't you know what day it is?

14
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,125
Hun-seok, he kicked me out of nowhere.

15
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,426
I can't let him get away with it--

16
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,396
Get up immediately!
Don't cause a fuss here.

17
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,272
Please go back for the day.

18
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,841
Get your hand off me.

19
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,676
If you promise to leave,

20
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,412
I'll get it off.

21
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,848
I'm not going anywhere, just get it off.

22
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,886
I'll make you go if you don't leave now.

23
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,057
Go ahead.

24
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,528
I got everything I need from the inside.
Let's do your closing remarks out here.

25
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,497
We're going to roll the camera now.

26
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,806
Are you going to let him go in?

27
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,909
Do you want to beat up a priest
on the news?

28
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,278
You're right.

29
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,881
I was fully aware of that.
Now, where are my socks?

30
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,586
HONORABLE ENTREPRENEURS
OF GUDAM-GU AWARDS CEREMONY

31
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,897
Unbelievable.

32
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,832
Is he omnipresent or what?

33
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,268
Yes, I think so too.

34
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,270
Mic test.

35
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,772
Mic test, one, two.

36
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,407
Mic test.

37
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,543
I heard brother Hwang Cheol-beom

38
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,314
is receiving a big award
and am here to congratulate him.

39
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,349
Let us pray.

40
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,853
Father of grace and blessings,

41
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,523
I thank you for letting us
gather here together

42
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,992
to give our prayer of celebration.

43
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,761
And I thank you

44
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,198
for this buffet meal.

45
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,766
However,

46
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,735
I can feel

47
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,974
the strong energy of Satan.

48
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,618
I'm only here part-time, Father.

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,561
St. Michael the Archangel,

50
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,198
defend us in the battle against
principalities and powers,

51
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,132
Stop that.

52
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,802
against the rulers
of the world of darkness

53
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,172
and the spirit of wickedness

54
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,807
in high places.

55
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,509
Listen, all ye devils.

56
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,944
-What are you doing?
-Stop it.

57
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,194
This music suits you well.

58
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,230
Stop playing!

59
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,600
How many times
are you repeating that song?

60
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,702
You have the money.

61
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,306
You should've ordered better catering.

62
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,074
This looks like it's still frozen.

63
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,176
I've heard a lot about you.

64
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,411
You're the priest

65
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,414
who causes a lot of trouble.

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,351
And who are you, missus?

67
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,089
I'm Gudam district director Jeong Dong-ja.

68
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,493
Seeing that you're close
to brother Hwang Cheol-beom,

69
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,030
you must already be helpless.

70
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,431
Helpless as in what?

71
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,804
Father, why are you laughing?

72
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,242
Brother Hwang Cheol-beom.

73
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,046
It's you, isn't it?

74
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,015
It's you, right?

75
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,084
What do you mean?

76
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,386
You killed Father Lee Yeong-jun

77
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,691
and threw him off a cliff.

78
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,097
Father,

79
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,199
please stop already.

80
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,601
How could you make such false accusations?

81
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,236
Why were you after
the cathedral's orphanage

82
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,504
and welfare organizations?

83
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,307
Does stealing please you?

84
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,643
Or do you have something hidden there?

85
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,547
Gosh.

86
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,517
I'm trying to do something good.
What's wrong with that?

87
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,726
Do you even know
what "something good" means?

88
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,895
That's enough. Where do you think you are?

89
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,230
I know exactly where I am.

90
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,432
This is an award ceremony
for encouraging criminals.

91
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,935
-Father.
-I won't take any more of this.

92
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,003
Didn't I tell you to stay put?

93
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,272
When was I not staying put?

94
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,241
I'm here to give
a congratulatory prayer and eat.

95
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,576
Congratulatory?

96
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,678
You're here to cause a scene!

97
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,680
What are you waiting for?

98
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,185
-Take him out now!
-Sir?

99
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,422
We have no reason to.

100
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,957
-Right, Detective Gu?
-What?

101
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,426
-I guess.
-Why not?

102
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,429
-Gosh.
-Look.

103
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,299
Why do you have to come
and ruin such a great day like this?

104
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,703
That's just wrong.

105
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,645
"A great day"?

106
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,214
"A great day"?

107
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,222
We'll see

108
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,259
how long your great day lasts.

109
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,533
Also,

110
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,569
don't you have party favors
like umbrellas or towels?

111
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,671
Go find one
at someone's 70th birthday party.

112
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,310
You must be frustrated.

113
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,313
You want to bring me down,
but have no way to.

114
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,781
You can't do anything about me.

115
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,418
Is it your plan to cause trouble
by insulting me?

116
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,787
What difference does this make?

117
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,857
Will this bring the priest back
from the dead?

118
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,659
Will it change the tables?

119
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,630
Don't you dare bring him up now.

120
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,700
I didn't want to in the first place.

121
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,068
You brought him up first, Father.

122
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,239
Anyway, if you want to mess with me,
you'd better be prepared.

123
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,576
I'll be waiting for you. Let's eat.

124
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,153
HONORABLE ENTREPRENEURS
OF GUDAM-GU AWARDS CEREMONY

125
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,133
Seriously, why did you have to come here?

126
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,836
That was two outs for you.

127
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,205
One more and you're getting arrested.

128
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,773
No more chances, I mean it.

129
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,644
Are you worried about me
or annoyed with me?

130
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,114
Why would I worry about you?
I'm worried about my job.

131
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,983
Watch your back, Father Kim.

132
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,318
It feels like I'm walking
on thin ice every day.

133
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,387
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

134
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,489
What about me? Aren't you sorry for me?

135
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,458
Father Kim.

136
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,593
I don't even get annoyed with him anymore.

137
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,299
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

138
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:54,967
Close the case.

139
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,071
Okay.

140
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,307
What's with that look on your face?

141
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,677
-It's nothing.
-I can see it's something.

142
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,080
My experience tells me something is wrong.

143
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,782
I can't put my finger on it,

144
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,350
but it's like...

145
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,922
not wiping my butt after taking a dump.

146
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,225
Look, I feel like I was having
gimbap wrapped in tin foil

147
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,594
and just got a mouthful of tin foil
stuck between my teeth.

148
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,229
You're so annoying.

149
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,765
I told you to close the case!

150
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,233
All right!

151
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,208
Oh, the stress.

152
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,212
DAEBEOM TRADING

153
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,517
Move it.

154
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,956
Open that.

155
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,091
Open it!

156
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,261
Honorable entrepreneur award?

157
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,631
Bullshit, that's what it is.

158
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,635
Shit!

159
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,705
It's not like I can shank his ass, too.

160
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,673
Just give me the orders
and I'll handle him.

161
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,041
Are you serious?

162
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,377
Shanking a priest? Get real!

163
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,980
Do you want to tell the world

164
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,681
that I took care of him?

165
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,618
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

166
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,419
Gosh.

167
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,456
I should've gotten rid of him
if I saw this coming.

168
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,992
Who in the world is he?

169
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,393
Hey.

170
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,297
Find out where and when he was born,

171
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,232
and what he did his whole life. Got it?

172
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,433
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:37,703
Get going.

174
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,081
SUGAR CREAM COFFEE

175
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,994
You want to bring me down,
but have no way to.

176
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,496
You can't do anything about me.

177
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,033
Is it your plan to cause trouble
by insulting me?

178
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,679
-Father Kim.
-Let go of me!

179
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,747
-Let go of me!
-Calm down!

180
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,616
Let go!

181
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,388
Don't do that no matter how angry
you are. You'll hurt yourself.

182
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,324
I can't let Father Lee die twice.

183
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,394
Excuse me?

184
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,963
Letting this go
without finding out the truth.

185
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,734
That's killing him a second time.

186
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,240
But I feel like I'm fumbling around
without doing anything.

187
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,944
That isn't true. You're doing your best.

188
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:53,979
No,

189
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,649
I won't be able
to reveal the truth like this.

190
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,452
I have to be more aggressive.

191
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,054
Don't fight alone.

192
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,057
Sister Kim and I are on your side.

193
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm sure the diocese will also help.

194
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,629
Father Kim.

195
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,434
-Father Kim?
-Yes.

196
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,403
You have a visitor.

197
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,138
A visitor?

198
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,641
I'm sorry I can't be of much help.

199
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,444
I wasn't expecting much,
so don't feel too sorry.

200
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,215
I hope you don't misunderstand.

201
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,118
After much consideration, the Archbishop--

202
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,153
I'll believe he put in much consideration.

203
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,490
But why are you here?

204
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,559
We can't leave the position
of provost vacant for a long time.

205
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,228
According to church regulations,

206
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,896
Father Han Seung-gyu

207
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,565
has become the head priest
of Gudam Cathedral.

208
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,367
I see.

209
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,268
Wait, what?

210
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,338
I did? Why me?

211
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,675
It was according to church regulations.

212
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,579
I don't know anything yet.

213
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,581
Father Kim Hae-il knows better
than I do and--

214
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,950
I'm from a different diocese,
so I can't be made provost here.

215
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,118
That's right.

216
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,954
The church is going through tough times,

217
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,656
but please be a lead it well.

218
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,568
This is great news.

219
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,137
I feel so relieved.

220
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,705
I really know nothing

221
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,140
and am not cut out to do this.

222
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,843
That isn't true. It's okay,
you can do this.

223
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,944
You'll do a good job.

224
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,879
Only then can I leave with a light heart.

225
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,749
No, you have to stay for now.

226
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,820
Father Kim has to return
to his diocese soon, you know.

227
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,655
I know,

228
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,224
but not right now.

229
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,561
The congregation will like it

230
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:52,598
if Father Han presides over Mass, right?

231
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,734
I have to fill in the shoes
of Father Lee out of all people.

232
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,204
It weighs down on my heart.

233
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,639
Could you hold Mass

234
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,342
until the end of this month?

235
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:06,912
All right.

236
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,915
You should do it, Father Han.

237
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,750
Why? I said I'd do it.

238
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:16,055
Yes, of course. Do as you please.

239
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,258
Hallelujah, hallelujah

240
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,793
I know it's a big responsibility,

241
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,695
but you should man up.

242
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:27,900
Hallelujah, hallelujah

243
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,803
You should've just taken over.

244
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,439
What? Again?

245
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,075
But he didn't cause too much trouble

246
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,644
and left after eating quietly.

247
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,216
Everyone I know in Gudam
are breathing down my neck,

248
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,086
saying we should've put him behind bars
when we had the opportunity.

249
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,787
Seriously, you have no idea.

250
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,391
I'm not blaming you for your decision,

251
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,562
but I don't think it was
the best choice you could've made.

252
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:58,898
You agree, don't you?

253
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,667
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

254
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:03,702
Fine.

255
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,438
Next time, just lock him up

256
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,907
if you get anything on him.

257
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,909
Yes, sir.

258
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,655
CHIEF PROSECUTOR
KANG SEOK-TAE

259
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,061
He really doesn't listen.

260
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,297
He does everything I tell him not to.

261
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,865
Why would he...

262
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,235
Seriously.

263
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,551
Songsak.

264
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,987
Sit down.

265
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,359
It's a minute past the expiration date,
so you can have it now.

266
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,760
EXPIRED FOOD IS TO BE THROWN OUT

267
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:02,928
BUT EMPLOYEES SOMETIMES EAT IT

268
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:07,333
I only eat Burger King. You can have it.

269
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,468
I hate you, you picky prick.

270
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,536
Just eat it.

271
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,182
I...

272
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,285
went to the cathedral this morning.

273
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,656
I miss Father Lee Yeong-jun.

274
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,958
Why do you keep going
when he isn't even there?

275
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,460
I go because I miss him.

276
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,663
I feel him when I'm there.

277
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,133
I remember his face,

278
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,237
voice and cookies.

279
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,540
Geez.

280
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,914
You're making me miss him.

281
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,820
Father Lee is like an angel.

282
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,924
He probably became a star in the sky.

283
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,397
There, that star.

284
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,767
That isn't Father Lee's star.

285
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,536
It's Capella, the brightest star
in the constellation of Auriga.

286
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,339
It's the sixth brightest star in the sky

287
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,875
and the star closest to the North star.

288
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,544
I know it isn't Father Lee's star.

289
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,049
Why don't you understand how I feel?

290
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,753
I'm just telling you the facts
as someone who studies stars.

291
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,221
I was conveying knowledge.

292
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,625
Yo-han,

293
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
even if we become rich,

294
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,665
let's always go to church on Sundays.

295
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,201
Of course, I'm a firm believer.

296
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,269
Don't worry.

297
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,607
Stop eating bread during Mass.
You embarrass me.

298
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,876
I can't hear straight if I'm hungry.
That's why I ate it.

299
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:58,977
Give me a break.

300
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,380
If you eat a lot,

301
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,882
can you hear things from far away?

302
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,284
Yes. How did you know that?

303
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:06,985
I think...

304
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,221
I have a superpower.

305
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,558
Stop being ridiculous.

306
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,461
It's true. Stay here and say something.

307
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,697
Say something, Songsak. Anything.

308
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,832
Go on.

309
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:21,934
Go on.

310
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,003
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck...

311
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,772
Say something.

312
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,740
I did, you fatso.

313
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,478
Where did you learn
to say things like that?

314
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,679
I didn't mean it.

315
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,615
You have the worst teachers ever.

316
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,174
Here you are.

317
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,109
Yes. What's that?

318
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,879
I brought you a new robe.

319
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,681
I can wear my old one.

320
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,450
It looked small at Mass last week.

321
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,019
Thank you.

322
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,488
-Father Kim.
-Yes?

323
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,391
If not many people come to Mass,

324
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,994
I'm prepared for it.

325
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,798
The size of the congregation
doesn't mean anything important, but...

326
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,167
Let's go ahead with it.

327
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,804
Even if we have one person left
after losing Father Lee,

328
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,474
that person deserves
a proper Mass from us.

329
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:11,610
Yes, Father Kim.

330
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,379
Let's protect the church,

331
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,951
recover Father Lee's reputation...

332
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,422
and make things right.

333
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,691
Okay.

334
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,167
I didn't expect this few people to come.

335
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,604
I'm sure it'll get better as time passes.

336
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,773
Our church

337
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,944
won't turn into a historical site
at this rate, will it?

338
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,647
That won't happen.

339
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,483
I see a couple of people coming.

340
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,852
-Hello.
-Hello.

341
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,488
-Hello, Father Kim.
-Hello.

342
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,889
Did you have bread?

343
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,791
Yes, I had some outside.

344
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,360
Wipe the crumbs off your mouth.

345
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,165
Hello.

346
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,236
-Hello, Father Kim.
-Welcome.

347
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,752
Are you coming in or not?

348
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,090
Go home and watch TV
if you're going to stand here.

349
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,426
We were being thoughtful and came.

350
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,495
You shouldn't say that to us.

351
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,231
We just don't feel very comfortable.

352
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,666
Standing here like this means

353
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,134
you think Father Lee did something bad.

354
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,703
I don't want to preach to people
who think that.

355
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,039
You should apologize at the least,

356
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,373
not blame us.

357
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,975
What would I apologize for?

358
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,143
Father Kim.

359
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,911
People like you that easily trust others,

360
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,746
get swayed and jump to conclusions

361
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,348
don't deserve to believe in God.

362
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,849
You're not welcome here, so leave.

363
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,318
This is unbelievable.

364
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,020
Are you blaming the believers?

365
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,022
Catharina,

366
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,559
Father Kim has been sensitive lately.

367
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,860
Forget it!

368
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,295
Come on.

369
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,563
-Let's go.
-Wait.

370
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,532
Catharina!

371
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,966
Cecilia! Wait.

372
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:19,805
How...

373
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,241
How could you do this?

374
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,244
There are so few people already.

375
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,979
What?

376
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,183
Father Kim!

377
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,985
Father Kim!

378
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,960
It's a hassle to go to a different church,

379
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,298
but it will be embarrassing
to just walk in.

380
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,115
I told you not to come here, old lady.

381
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,691
Whether I come or not is my decision.

382
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,160
I told you you're disqualified
as a believer.

383
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,129
Did you think I'd take it seriously

384
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,563
and not show up?

385
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,032
I don't like you
listening to me give homily.

386
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,667
I'm not here to listen to you,

387
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,369
but for spiritual healing.

388
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,838
If you want spiritual healing,
go to a spa or have a good meal.

389
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,840
I'll kick you out
if you show up next week.

390
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,475
You're the one who'll be in trouble

391
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,144
-if I get you one more time.
-What?

392
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,613
You should know when to stop.

393
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,682
Does staying put give you
allergies or something?

394
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,584
Does it drive the Holy Spirit out of you?

395
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,587
You must have heard
about the awards ceremony.

396
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,390
Yes, that's right.
So please stay out of trouble.

397
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,292
How many times do I have to tell you?

398
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:51,396
I'm losing right now, but I'll catch up
and win pretty soon.

399
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,031
Unbelievable.

400
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,635
Why do you think I leave you alone

401
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,903
instead of putting you in jail?

402
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,073
This is my last way of showing respect
to Father Lee Yeong-jun.

403
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,777
It's my respect for him

404
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,180
regardless of his incident.

405
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,981
However,

406
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,950
I'm running out of patience,

407
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,652
so please wake up and look around.

408
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,321
I'm going to push until I can,

409
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,957
-so be ready.
-As you please.

410
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,526
Push it all the way
to the Blue House if you want to.

411
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,664
Wait, why don't you go tell the pope
and see if that doesn't work?

412
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,866
Come on. Go tell him.

413
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,668
Even if you're joking,

414
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,471
don't mention the pope.
It's disrespectful.

415
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,572
I'm so scared.

416
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,074
Pope, pope, pope,

417
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,542
help me, pope!

418
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,815
Pope!

419
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,985
SEONGWONGAK

420
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,154
Songsak!

421
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,292
-Hello.
-Did you practice?

422
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,496
-Excuse me?
-Do the Peter Piper picked a peck thing.

423
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:04,503
Peter Piper picked... Pack...

424
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,239
A pack of pickles.

425
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,208
Pack of pickles, my ass.
I told you to practice, didn't I?

426
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,310
-Do it again.
-I'm sorry.

427
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,346
Try it again. Go on.

428
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,748
Peter Piper...

429
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,685
-Did you just laugh?
-I'm sorry.

430
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,355
What the priest said
at the awards ceremony

431
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,524
has started rumors at congress.

432
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,060
Members of the ruling party
are making an issue out of it.

433
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,762
You know who they are.

434
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,998
The little nitpickers behind our backs.

435
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,066
I told you I'd take care of them

436
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,801
since a few years ago, haven't I?

437
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,603
It's a bit sensitive

438
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,705
because it concerns welfare organizations.

439
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,276
They won't be happy
if you take charge of it.

440
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:49,014
I should do something
to shut that priest up.

441
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,749
Don't get upset.

442
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,152
Find someone to step in,

443
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,722
some kind of religious group
like a church or a temple.

444
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,959
Internally, you'll be handling it.

445
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,698
Do you know anyone?

446
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,734
Prophet Ki!

447
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,269
-Prophet Ki!
-Prophet Ki!

448
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,205
-Prophet Ki!
-Prophet Ki!

449
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,208
-Prophet Ki!
-Prophet Ki!

450
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,449
DAEGAKKYO

451
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,729
-Prophet Ki!
-Prophet Ki!

452
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,966
-Prophet Ki!
-Prophet Ki!

453
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,141
You probably all have heard from the news

454
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,545
about how a Catholic priest
committed those shameless crimes.

455
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,314
I'm ashamed to even speak of it.

456
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,749
My gosh.

457
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,218
What do despicable people like that

458
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,853
say about Daegakkyo?

459
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,789
That we deceive people and are a cult.

460
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,859
Who is calling whom a cult?

461
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,495
They are committing all kinds of sins.

462
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,596
That's right.

463
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,099
-That's right.
-That's right!

464
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,233
We

465
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,670
do not need Buddha or Jehovah.

466
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,940
Our enlightenment is our god and code.

467
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,476
That enlightenment will bring us

468
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,112
riches, honor and eternal life.

469
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,880
The source of that enlightenment...

470
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,017
is me.

471
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,921
I'm Ki Yong-mun, the leader of Maegakkyo.

472
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:41,426
Did I say I'd enlighten you
or didn't I say so?

473
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,761
You did.

474
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,296
-You did!
-You did!

475
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,465
Are you followers?

476
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,834
We will follow you.

477
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,904
-We will follow you!
-We will follow you!

478
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,873
-We will follow you!
-Yes, we will!

479
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,075
-We will follow you!
-We will follow you!

480
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,878
Let us pray.

481
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,186
Was someone leaving in a hurry

482
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,121
and left an iron on this morning?

483
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,726
Yes.

484
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,062
I did!

485
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,964
I say...

486
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:25,270
let there be a blackout
at her house until this afternoon!

487
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:35,613
Prophet Ki,

488
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,684
I've never had acupressure prayer
and am nervous about it.

489
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,591
Be afraid of nothing,
you who seek enlightenment.

490
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:51,096
As you are enlightened,
your face will become smaller.

491
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,999
Woo-ta, woo-ta, woot.

492
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,535
Woo-ta, woo-ta, woot!

493
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,804
Let's pray.

494
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,573
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

495
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,808
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

496
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,909
I'm sorry.

497
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,177
What's this?

498
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,616
Who dares to interrupt
my acupressure prayer...

499
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,718
Woo-ta, Prophet Ki.

500
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,254
Can you make my face smaller too?

501
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,059
KI YONG-MUN

502
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,800
I wonder what brought you here, Mr. Hwang.

503
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,503
Stop speaking in a fake deep voice.

504
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,015
What brings you here?

505
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,220
Prophet Ki,

506
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,222
how about you do me a favor?

507
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,727
Why aren't you answering me?

508
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,664
I'll answer after I hear what it is.

509
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,199
After you hear what it is?

510
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,040
Do you want to die

511
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,409
as you are enlightened?

512
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,845
You were scamming old ladies

513
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,581
at a coffee shop in a rural town
of Suncheon

514
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,583
when I helped you make a decent living.

515
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,685
Now you want to decide
after hearing me out?

516
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,587
I didn't mean that.

517
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,390
-Don't get angry, Mr. Hwang.
-Hey.

518
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:26,758
I need you

519
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,993
to manage the welfare organizations
of Gudam District.

520
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,830
I'll get them ready for you.

521
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,799
Welfare organizations?

522
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,403
I heard a child from Gudam Orphanage
was hospitalized

523
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,438
after getting sick from meal service.

524
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,275
I heard she is in a very bad condition.

525
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,010
Did... Did she die?

526
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,178
No,

527
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,013
but the abbess at the orphanage

528
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,849
submitted a petition to my office

529
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,483
to reinvestigate the corruption

530
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,618
of food distributors.

531
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,653
She must not have gotten anywhere
with everyone else

532
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,955
then chose to go to you instead.

533
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,591
I can ignore it,

534
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,127
but the problem is
she might take it elsewhere.

535
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,364
She might go to the press,

536
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,367
so please take care of it, Mr. Kang.

537
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,873
Useless things like this
keep causing problems.

538
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,608
Hasn't Mr. Hwang

539
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,543
finished talking
to the construction company

540
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,711
about the museum yet?

541
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,146
He is wrapping things up as we speak.

542
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,481
Soon,

543
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,583
you'll get your shares.

544
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,820
He should hurry up. He's so slow.

545
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,321
Cheers.

546
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,233
PERSONAL INFORMATION

547
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,736
He studied Korean literature at university

548
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,939
then grad school in the same major,
before joining the order.

549
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:48,940
Is this it?

550
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,844
Yes, I was surprised
there wasn't anything more.

551
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,780
His crazy eyes and balls

552
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,416
seem like that of someone
who had a rollercoaster of a life.

553
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,121
Was he born like that?

554
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,157
I'm done dividing it.

555
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,358
Deliver it all at once.

556
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,627
Bring me a cloth.

557
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:22,140
Why does he look so handsome
even in his ID photo?

558
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,708
PERSONAL INFORMATION

559
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,976
KIM HAE-IL

560
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:28,046
But his life is much normal
than I expected.

561
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,451
I'm sure there must be something.

562
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,235
Are you going to clean everything today?

563
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,238
Yes, I plan to clean it within the day.

564
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,074
I'll help.

565
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,544
Leave it and get some rest.
I'll take care of it.

566
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,513
Okay.

567

EVIDENCE

578
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,616
Lord, there are so many things
I have to fight for.

579
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,419
A small group of people

580
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,423
are bringing many others great pain.

581
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,259
How many times do I have to tell you?

582
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,928
A child is on the verge of death

583
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,763
after eating something wrong
in the meal service.

584
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,298
She's dying!

585
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,767
The greed of adults

586
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,436
may take the life of a child.

587
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,971
The district office is in charge of this,

588
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,639
so the city hall cannot interfere.

589
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,608
I'll come back again.

590
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,345
They don't admit their faults.

591
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,880
A little child's life depends on it.

592
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,616
They don't listen to the weak.

593
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,153
Rather, they use their power
to rule over the weak.

594
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,621
-It's about
-I'll read through it.

595
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:24,722
food services for children.

596
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,124
Go home, Father Lee.

597
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,559
-Stop the car.
-Gosh.

598
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:32,930
They turn a blind eye
to the truth and justice.

599
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,399
They make wrong judgements.

600
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,572
I plan to go against your will
just this once in my life, Lord.

601
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,076
I will not forgive them,

602
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,879
but tell the world about their sins.

603
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,315
Only you know

604
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,751
how long I have to live,

605
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,556
but I will fight them until the day I die.

606
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,994
This is not just for Your believers,

607
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,130
but all those living in this world.

608
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:18,709
He must have suffered all alone.

609
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,147
Even though he suffered,

610
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,716
he loved people enough
to go against God's will.

611
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,254
He not only loved the believers,
but everyone living in this world.

612
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:40,331
However, I complained
when things didn't go my way

613
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,732
and blamed others.

614
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,837
He must have thought I was
a disappointment these past few days.

615
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:52,543
He would have been
very disappointed in you, Father Kim.

616
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,014
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

617
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,151
No, it's understandable.

618
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,454
I'll continue the fight

619
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,357
Father Lee was fighting alone.

620
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,261
Yes, you should. I'll help this time.

621
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,063
Thank you, Father Han.

622
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,898
What will you do?

623
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,000
There are dead ends everywhere.

624
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,438
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.

625
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,744
Why did I say that?

626
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,550
Push it all the way
to the Blue House if you want to.

627
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,753
Wait, why don't you go tell the pope
and see if that doesn't work?

628
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,688
Come on. Go tell him.

629
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:41,692
I'm so scared.

630
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,528
Pope, pope, pope,

631
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,063
help me, pope!

632
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,905
No, the pope wouldn't...

633
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:57,842
What do you mean?

634
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,344
Never mind.

635
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,714
Why did you suddenly bring up the pope?

636
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,052
Well...

637
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,090
It's nothing.
I shouldn't have brought it up.

638
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,930
KOREAN

639
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,565
Dear Holy Father,

640
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,035
TRANSLATING

641
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,072
I am Michael, a priest in South Korea.

642
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,375
Do you really plan on writing to the pope?

643
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,344
Father Kim,

644
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,914
we have an ambassador
to the Holy See in Korea,

645
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,783
and also the Archdiocese.

646
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,085
If you ignore procedures

647
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,788
and send a letter to the pope like this...

648
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,057
Father Kim!

649
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,392
Seriously!

650
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,094
Leave me alone. Get out.

651
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,762
-Can I help with anything?
-No, you can't.

652
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,398
-Get out! Right now!
-Gosh.

653
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,736
Do you remember Father Gabriel,
whom you honorably have addressed

654
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,571
as Monsignor?

655
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,146
Father Gabriel loved everyone
on this world through God

656
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,981
and served them his whole life.

657
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,925
Recently, Father Gabriel was framed
for all kinds of crimes

658
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,727
and wrongfully murdered.

659
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:41,479
In the name of the Father and of the son
and of the Holy Spirit.

660
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:43,914
Amen.

661
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,856
I rarely ask for you to answer my prayers,

662
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,359
but I pray you answer this one.

663
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,562
If you do,

664
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,099
I'll do my best as a priest
for the rest of my life and...

665
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,307
I will never lose my temper my whole life.

666
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,477
I'll have mercy and be at peace.

667
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:18,149
In the name of the Father and of the son
and of the Holy Spirit.

668
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,418
Amen.

669
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:30,795
Damn it.

670
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,266
Why are there still mosquitoes
in the winter?

671
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,170
Gosh.

672
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,172
I knew this was going to happen,

673
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,708
so I came prepared.

674
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,793
There we go.

675
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,707
Wait here for five minutes.

676
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,976
I'll just go say hi to someone I know
and be back soon.

677
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,478
Are you going to collect a bribe?

678
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,780
You must not know yet,

679
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,982
but I'm the only one
that doesn't take bribes.

680
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,719
He's giving me an invitation
to his daughter's wedding.

681
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,654
All right.

682
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,259
KARAOKE

683
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,261
Thief!

684
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,931
He's a thief!

685
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,674
Don't ever go there alone.

686
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,710
It's very dangerous.

687
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,245
They don't go easy on cops.

688
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,187
Where did she go?

689
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,156
Seo Seung-a, Detective Seo!

690
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,759
-The female detective?
-Yes.

691
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,629
She ran into the Russians' turf,
chasing a thief.

692
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,063
-What?
-Really.

693
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,732
Damn it.

694
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,904
-This is good.
-What the...

695
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,505
It stinks like hell.

696
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,674
Why does it taste like this?

697
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,309
Give me some cola.

698
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,278
-Okay.
-What is this?

699
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,580
It's Russian fish soup,

700
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,683
but Russians rarely eat it.

701
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:33,817
It's ukha.

702
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,586
Tell me.

703
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,555
Why are you paying up less every month?

704
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:38,789
I'm sorry. You're right.

705
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,725
Business has been very bad in this area.

706
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,294
It's a recession.

707
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,129
A bad one.

708
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:48,232
I don't care about your recession.
You still owe me money.

709
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,001
You Russians

710
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,904
know who to thank
for living in comfort in this area, right?

711
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,207
-Yes.
-And you know I keep the cops away, too.

712
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:58,108
Yes.

713
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,777
Remember that.

714
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,946
-Yes, I got it.
-Also,

715
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,480
if you ever take shit from me,

716
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,950
I'll talk to your boss. Got it?

717
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,285
I'd never take shit from you.

718
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,289
Are you kidding me?

719
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,958
How do you understand everything I say?

720
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,093
What?

721
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,196
Move it when I'm being nice, you idiots!

722
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,998
-What is all this fuss?
-Get out of my way.

723
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,066
Geez.

724
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,535
-I told you to move.
-Get out of my way.

725
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,237
-Move it!
-Move it.

726
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,472
These guys

727
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,408
don't understand a word you're saying.

728
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:33,877
Put that bottle down.

729
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,548
I'm leaving.

730
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,249
Bye.

731
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,686
Who...

732
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:44,855
are you?

733
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,057
I'm a detective at Gudam Police Station,
violent crime squad.

734
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,760
He stole from someone
and ran away this way.

735
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,195
So I was trying to arrest him

736
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,099
when they showed up
and started to obstruct justice.

737
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,438
What the heck are you saying?

738
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,710
Calm down.

739
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,880
Stop me if you can.
I'll mess up your faces.

740
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:10,948
Wait!

741
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,783
Wait a minute.

742
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:14,918
Give that to me.

743
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,355
It's been a while, Gojayev.

744
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,391
Do you know her, Detective Gu?

745
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:21,492
Yes, she's a newbie.

746
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,494
It's her first time here
and made a mistake.

747
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,662
I'll talk to her.

748
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,664
You talk to the one
on the ground, Gojayev.

749
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,966
Talk to me about what?
I caught him in the act.

750
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,269
Just leave before I run out of generosity.

751
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,104
Generosity, my ass.

752
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,339
Let's go, Detective Seo.

753
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,474
We can't just leave.

754
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,243
-Come on, let's go.
-Okay, damn it.

755
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,078
You behave yourself, okay?

756
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,480
Be good, I said.

757
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,817
Let go of this.

758
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,852
Let them take care of it.

759
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,821
They have their own rules.

760
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,356
That isn't a different country.

761
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,757
Do they have extraterritoriality?

762
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,260
Your life will be exhausting
if you try to catch everyone.

763
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,662
Turn a blind eye when needed,
take advantage of what you can

764
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,764
and maintain this symbiotic relationship.
I told you that.

765
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,733
That Gojayev or Gogo-yuppy guy.

766
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,835
does he have something on you?

767
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:06,837
Something on me?

768
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,506
Please worry about yourself.

769
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,775
You can't be a detective if you're dead.

770
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,677
Why would you worry I'll die?

771
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,212
It's not like it's a war zone in there.

772
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,848
You don't know what they're capable of.

773
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,551
Who cares? I just have to
catch the bad guys.

774
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,686
Seriously.

775
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,888
Gosh.

776
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,524
You said the only thing
they're afraid of is you.

777
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,893
You said I should sign up
for funeral service

778
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:33,097
before I think of fighting you.

779
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,970
Don't you ever say that to me again.

780
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,506
I might beat you up first.

781
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,353
Seo Seung-a, that idiot.

782
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,989
She knows nothing.

783
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:17,775
Leave.

784
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,713
-Hey, part-timer.
-Yes, Detective Gu?

785
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,751
Why do you always come sit with me
when I'm drinking?

786
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,787
You're cool and I'm curious.

787
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,390
What?

788
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,693
You're really cool

789
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,796
and I have a lot of questions

790
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,631
I want to ask you.

791
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,107
Gosh.

792
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:51,875
Are you teasing me?

793
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,660
-Hello, Father Kim.
-Hello.

794
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,030
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

795
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,431
-Bye.
-Bye.

796
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,272
Father Kim, did it come?

797
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:35,152
I don't think the pope got your letter.

798
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,721
But I used the translating app.

799
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,757
I think you'll have to
come up with a different idea.

800
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,461
I'm sure the app was working fine.

801
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:47,764
VATICAN CITY

802
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:06,450
Holy Father, this is a letter
from Michael in Korea.

803
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,860
Dear Mr. President,

804
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:22,065
I received a letter
from Father Michael in Korea.

805
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:27,704
It was regarding
the death of Father Gabriel

806
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,540
of Gudam Cathedral in Seoul.

807
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,713
I'd like to ask you to help

808
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,949
with the re-investigation
of my friend Gabriel's death.

809
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,519
This is not only about
the honor of Gabriel,

810
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,989
but the entire Catholic Church.

811
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:47,491
Please help us.

812
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,161
Pope Francesco.

813
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,400
-Secretary Lee.
-Yes?

814
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,871
Make sure they put extra effort
into investigating this case.

815
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,240
Yes, sir.

816
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,518
CHIEF PROSECUTOR
KANG SEOK-TAE

817
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,919
Hello.

818
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,555
Yes.

819
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,325
What?

820
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:27,864
Wow.

821
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,169
Wow, this is unbelievable.

822
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,072
He actually did as I said?

823
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,541
This is a global situation.

824
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,843
So, the pope gave direct orders?

825
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:43,080
It's the pope I know of, right?

826
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,349
Yes, it's him all right.

827
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:54,491
The tarot reader must have been right.
Maybe I am kicking the bucket this year.

828
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,694
If I make any mistakes,

829
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,963
I could be humiliated globally, right?

830
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,266
-Papa!
-Papa!

831
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,537
-Papa!
-Papa!

832
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:09,172
-Papa!
-Papa!

833
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,014
Let's do it right this time.

834
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,549
Okay, we have someone powerful behind us.

835
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,552
-Papa!
-Papa!

836
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,089
Unbelievable.

837
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,491
This is good news,

838
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,261
but how will you save the church?

839
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,904
Reviving the church

840
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,173
is also an important task for us.

841
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,675
Not even you, Father Han.

842
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,645
I'm sorry for being angry, Lord.

843
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,017
We'd forgotten something important.

844
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,653
We only had seven people
at Mass yesterday.

845
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,588
Still,

846
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,457
this is a moment of joy.

847
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,960
She killed the vibe.
We really can't get along.

848
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:07,664
Still...

849
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,734
-Papa!
-Papa!

850
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,604
The President gave me direct orders,

851
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,540
so I have no other choice.

852
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,378
The Vatican must know

853
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,713
the case is already closed in Korea.

854
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:24,948
Of course they do.

855
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,018
What can I do when they still ask
for a reinvestigation?

856
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,854
How the hell did it come to this?

857
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:33,056
That isn't it.

858
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,725
They added an annoying condition.

859
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,596
We have to let that priest

860
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,264
participate in the investigation

861
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:42,999
as an observer.

862
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,970
This is insane.

863
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,706
That's ridiculous.

864
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,843
He'll pick on every single detail.

865
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:54,978
That's why

866
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,647
I came up with a good idea.

867
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,618
We'll have the most perfect person

868
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,754
take charge of the investigation.

869
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:06,656
Who is this perfect person

870
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,025
that you speak of?

871
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,929
The most incompetent

872
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,032
and pathetic person

873
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:20,337
who is full of flaws.

874
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:24,908
Not bad.

875
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,277
Definitely above average.

876
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,046
-Detective Gu.
-Gosh.

877
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,849
-Go see the chief.
-Why?

878
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,518
Just go see him.

879
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,190
What?

880
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,460
You want me to cooperate with the priest?

881
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,363
Yes, until you solve the case.

882
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,898
Why me?

883
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:52,169
You're the best at our station.
Of course you should take the case.

884
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,571
-But I'm not the best.
-What?

885
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,006
Nothing.

886
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,175
However,

887
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,744
while you work with him,

888
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,313
you have a different role.

889
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:05,649
What do you mean?

890
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,119
Pretend to investigate the case,

891
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,488
but stall the investigation.

892
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,723
-I want you to mess it up.
-What?

893
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,626
You know nothing good will come of it.

894
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,696
If things go wrong,

895
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,932
you, violent crime squad and I

896
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,667
will all lose our jobs.

897
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,803
Obstruct the investigation

898
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,672
without letting the priest find out.

899
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,708
Also, fill me in on every detail.

900
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,476
You hear me?

901
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,479
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, sir.

902
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:39,816
If this ends well,

903
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,518
I'll give you a special promotion

904
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,887
and make you deputy chiefs.
How's that sound?

905
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,589
Okay?

906
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,057
This

907
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:53,363
is a case people way up high
are interested in.

908
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,266
The pope.

909
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,173
This is an opportunity
that will never come again.

910
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,475
All right?

911
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,912
Yes.

912
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,480
CHIEF'S OFFICE

913
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,629
I should have visited
my grandpa's grave at Chuseok.

914
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,698
Why do I keep having bad luck?

915
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,909
Is the pope that powerful?

916
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,847
Papa is very powerful.

917
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:47,183
-The world leaders--
-I don't care.

918
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,420
Where are the fake witnesses?

919
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:55,158
I hid them well

920
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,193
where no one will find them.

921
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:01,564
Tell them not to cause trouble
and keep their heads down.

922
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,502
Also, have some
of your smarter guys ready.

923
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,271
I might need them.

924
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:10,974
All right.

925
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,646
How did this blow up all over the country?

926
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,988
Guys. Where are we going?

927
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:28,224
We're going to Paris, France, right?

928
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,928
It'd be nice if we could fly business.

929
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,596
I don't feel well on coach.

930
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,365
It's our first time flying.

931
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,401
Why won't he answer?

932
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,505
-Maybe he doesn't speak Korean.
-They're Russian.

933
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:43,707
He is?

934
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,346
Who is the detective in charge again?

935
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,781
It's Detective Gu Dae-yeong.

936
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:59,155
You aren't willing to reinvestigate.

937
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:00,757
No. What?

938
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,893
Weren't you supposed to appoint
the most competent detective?

939
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,262
Yes, that's Detective Gu.

940
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:12,068
Look at that face. What should I do?

941
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,571
I think I might end up killing him.

942
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,273
I'll help.

943
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,143
No, let them get going

944
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,911
and back them up from the station.

945
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,314
-I should be on the field.
-Quiet.

946
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,550
I'd like someone else to do it.

947
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,219
Anyone but this loser.

948
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:30,920
Loser?

949
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,391
You're being rude.

950
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:37,560
I'm the hidden ace
of the violent crime squad.

951
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,162
Don't speak to me like that.

952
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,431
Ace my ass.

953
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,734
You can sit here
and stuff your face with those snacks.

954
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,937
You're making me feel competitive.

955
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,561
What if I solve this case?

956
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,997
Solve it? I'll buy you lamb skewers.

957
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,499
That isn't enough.

958
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,638
Beef, special cuts.

959
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:24,607
It's a deal.

960
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:26,943
Okay.

961
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,380
Let the joint investigation
officially begin.

962
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,514
You can't lose your temper
and break things during the investigation.

963
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,615
All right.

964
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:39,983
Call the police!

965
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,519
I can't help if you keep causing trouble.

966
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,653
Look here.

967
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,590
No security cameras
work so poorly these days, okay?

968
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,592
I'm sending an invoice for that
to the cathedral.

969
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:55,765
See if you can come up
with a way to get rid of that priest.

970
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,234
He has the pope watching his back,
so I need a legitimate reason.

971
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,436
Do you have any good ideas?
Anything that could stop him?

972
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,306
Are priests allowed to be this drunk?

973
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,942
