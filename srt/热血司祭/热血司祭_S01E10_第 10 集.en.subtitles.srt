1
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,919
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,254
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,961
Hold him.

4
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,410
Let's finish it today, Father.

5
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,451
Goodness.

6
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,188
I thought I landed that one good,
but you're still conscious.

7
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,859
You're a strong one, aren't you?

8
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,628
Stay down.

9
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,576
You should've left
when I gave you the chance.

10
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,649
Then you wouldn't have to die
and I wouldn't have to break a sweat.

11
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,286
Wouldn't that have been nice?

12
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,524
Look at what you made me do!

13
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,198
Hold on.

14
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,300
Are you laughing?

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,001
Seriously?

16
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,439
That'll probably be your last laugh,

17
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,308
so laugh away.

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,348
Let's end this now.

19
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,816
You can

20
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,420
give Father Lee Yeong-jun my regards.

21
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,996
Can we help you?

22
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,431
Well, sir.

23
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,665
We received a report

24
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,868
about a wild boar
trespassing in this storehouse.

25
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,970
-What?
-So...

26
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,138
I'm afraid

27
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,673
we'll have to do a sweep.

28
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,674
-Right?
-What the...

29
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,611
I don't think that's necessary.

30
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,515
Careful there, you're breaking my foot.

31
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,383
Let's go.

32
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,659
Where are you people going?

33
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,727
Stop right there.

34
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,535
Call the police

35
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,069
and request two ambulances.

36
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,137
-Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

37
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,907
He'll be out of our hair for a while.

38
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,542
Sure. Got it.

39
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,076
I'm hanging up.

40
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,114
The Grim Reaper for priests

41
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,950
must be off-duty today.

42
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,252
Let's head back.

43
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,023
DO NOT URINATE

44
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,499
Father?

45
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,667
Father!

46
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,304
Father!

47
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,073
-Hurry up and call an ambulance.
-Sure.

48
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,209
Gosh.

49
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,380
Father, stay with me.

50
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,217
What the hell? Father!

51
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,852
I'm not dying, it's okay.

52
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,758
Gyeong-seon, I'm impressed.

53
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,362
The public now thinks
differently of Ms. Jeong.

54
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,100
How the younger generation
utilizes the public and online resources

55
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,235
never cease to amaze me.

56
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,869
Old people like me have no chance.

57
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,471
It's easier these days

58
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,440
to sway public opinion.

59
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,774
Fascinating, isn't it?

60
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,011
The development of media and the Internet

61
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,913
should've made people smarter.

62
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,314
But they're more vulnerable than ever.

63
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,883
Even when they're informed
of the truth later on,

64
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,852
they never admit that they were fooled.

65
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,021
Why? It's humiliating, that's why.

66
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,123
They go even further than that

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,626
and attack the truth instead.

68
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,793
Exactly.

69
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,929
We'll just use it
to our advantage, I guess.

70
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:26,799
That reminds me.

71
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,102
We don't have to worry
about the priest anymore.

72
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,204
I told you before, right?

73
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,740
The guy who took care
of Father Lee Yeong-jun?

74
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,109
Apparently, he got the job done.

75
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,611
What job?

76
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,614
He was beaten to a pulp.
I heard he's nearly dead.

77
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,285
Anyway, that's that.

78
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,088
I called you here
to discuss something important.

79
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,292
Gyeong-seon.

80
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,193
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,074
What the... Damn it.

82
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,944
It's you, Yo-han and Songsak.

83
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,648
-Are you all right?
-Yes, my injuries aren't severe.

84
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,686
I had the back of my head twitched...

85
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,422
I mean, stitched up.

86
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:23,990
I'm fine though.

87
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,026
I'm more worried about you, you know.

88
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,761
Your injured hand is now broken,

89
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,563
your third and fourth ribs are broken,

90
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,798
and you have bruises all over.

91
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,634
Thankfully, that's as worse as it gets.

92
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,737
Father,

93
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,839
I need to stock up the convenience store,

94
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:40,807
so I'll get going.

95
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,176
I also need to move the groceries

96
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,444
and clean up.

97
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,180
I'm sorry, guys.

98
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,882
Gosh, no. Please don't say that.

99
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,151
We did it because we wanted to.

100
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,353
Right?

101
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,256
-Watch it, you pig.
-Sorry.

102
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,859
You guys should get going then.

103
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,561
Don't forget your pain medication.

104
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,995
-Sure.
-Let's go.

105
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,075
It may hurt physically, but I feel great.

106
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,010
We did something huge.

107
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,346
Don't let Jang Ryong walk over you again.

108
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,215
You can get in his face now.

109
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,384
I'm...

110
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:29,055
I'm done getting hit,
and I'm done hitting people.

111
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,926
I have to make money
to send to my daughter.

112
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,695
That means no injuries.

113
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,029
Still, you should when you can.

114
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,798
You can't be a pushover your whole life.

115
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,901
Those who don't know that
they should raise their voices are idiots.

116
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,972
But those who still choose not to
are the smart ones.

117
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,742
Then I acted like a fool today.

118
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,346
Exactly, so don't ever
come to my defense again.

119
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,883
You'll only get hurt!

120
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,821
Okay, fine. Call me a moron.

121
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,758
Just live your life as you wish then!

122
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,262
-Yo-han...
-Let go of me.

123
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,265
Yo-han?

124
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,138
Yo-han!

125
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,316
Gyeong-seon, how about you join us?

126
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,085
If you officially become one of us,

127
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,855
you'll be free to thrive.
Getting an office in the Assembly,

128
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,657
even at the Blue House won't be a problem.

129
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,726
Not to mention unlimited cash.

130
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,562
What do you say?

131
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,231
I'm honored by the offer,

132
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,934
but I'd like some time to think it over.

133
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,071
This must not be some sort of game.

134
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,840
Of course not, sir.

135
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,876
I just have some personal issues
to resolve.

136
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,778
Then you should take care of it.

137
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,147
But I won't wait too long.

138
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,296
FATHER KIM TSUNAMI

139
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,566
Calling him would make it seem like
I care too much.

140
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,836
Just how severely was he injured?

141
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,338
Damn it.

142
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:36,649
What's with you today?

143
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,285
What?

144
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,154
You went out of your way
to save Detective Seo,

145
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,890
reported the wild boar,

146
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,591
and are now feeding me my porridge.

147
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,160
What is this, Black Friday
at your Good Deeds Market?

148
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,128
Yes.

149
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,397
It's "Good Deeds Market
is going out of business,

150
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,165
stock clearance sale" day.

151
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,739
Tell me what's going on.

152
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,542
Well...

153
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,411
You see...

154
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,982
Others would've gotten hurt
had I been a coward.

155
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,718
That's why.

156
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,462
-So what now?
-What do you mean?

157
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,864
Will you

158
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,134
keep on doing good things

159
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,103
or will you be Hwang Cheol-beom's lapdog?

160
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,241
Can you not bring him up?

161
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,676
Whatever.

162
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,446
Detective Gu, please.

163
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,684
Atonement isn't always asked
in front of a cross.

164
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,754
Going back the wrong path you took

165
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,724
and starting over again

166
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,528
from where it all went wrong
is atonement too.

167
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,403
You should eat the rest.

168
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,105
I'd rather not.

169
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,408
Can you get my wheelchair
so I can head downstairs?

170
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,081
I'm glad.

171
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,750
Her fever has subsided
and she has regained consciousness.

172
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,953
If only they had given her
proper medicine from the start.

173
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,857
I'll make sure that

174
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,126
Wangmat Food's owner
pays the rest of his bills too.

175
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,228
Now that I've seen Eun-ji,

176
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,631
what you said is sinking in.

177
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,066
What?

178
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,035
That you still won half a point?

179
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,047
WANGMAT FOOD LEDGER

180
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,729
Do a thorough background check
on the people and companies in the ledger.

181
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,965
It could reveal information

182
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,867
on Hwang Cheol-beom and his connections.

183
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,505
How can one be so heavenly 24 hours a day?

184
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,715
FEBRUARY 5, 19:00
TRIP TO HWANG CHEOL-BEOM'S VACATION HOME

185
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,622
FATHER LEE YEONG-JUN CASE
PRESS RELEASE MATERIAL

186
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,027
FEBRUARY 5, 19:00

187
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,999
DATE OF INCIDENT: FEBRUARY 5, 2019

188
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,472
SEONU MEDICAL CENTER

189
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,008
Why do you never listen?

190
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,345
I told you to always be careful.

191
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,481
I told you time and time again

192
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,750
that you were going to
get in trouble, but you never listened.

193
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,418
Now, just look at the state you're in.

194
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,987
Okay, fine. I've committed a mortal sin.

195
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,123
My ears are hurting worse than my body.

196
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,393
Goodness. Look at the scars and bruises
on your handsome face.

197
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,627
It must hurt so much.

198
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,964
Weren't you with him, Detective?

199
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,002
It would've been great if I were there,
but--

200
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,437
He was busy catching a mugger.

201
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,074
Still, it would've been worse
if he hadn't shown up.

202
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,577
He saved you once again.

203
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,879
We're truly grateful, Detective.

204
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,615
You didn't seem much at first,

205
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,350
but the more we get to know you--

206
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,251
What?

207
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,023
Father, look at you.

208
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,029
You're injured more than I imagined.

209
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,032
Well, this... Token...

210
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,771
This is a token of my boss's condolences.

211
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,140
A big one. It costs 100,000 won.

212
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,875
This visit wasn't necessary.

213
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,309
You should just leave.

214
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,814
We're not here to pick a fight.

215
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,950
Our boss was too busy to come,

216
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,353
so we're here to deliver his message

217
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,555
just like you deliver words
at your cathedral.

218
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,123
I'm not interested. Get lost.

219
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,325
"Listen up, Father.

220
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,761
Get in the way again,

221
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,531
and you, the convenience store part-timer,

222
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,100
and the Thai Chinese food guy will pay.

223
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,134
Why you little...

224
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,705
What is this? New combo attack?

225
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,108
Check this one out. Leave Combo.

226
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,279
Damn it.

227
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,914
We're worried, that's all.

228
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,153
Those demons!

229
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,924
Father Han,

230
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,492
Please get my release forms ready.

231
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,561
Father, you should stay.

232
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,628
No, I'm fine.

233
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,331
I'll get changed at the cathedral
and meet you at the precinct.

234
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,533
You'd better not complain
about being sore again.

235
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,701
I won't.

236
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,139
Hold on.

237
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,877
There's someplace I must stop by first.

238
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,192
What is it?

239
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,909
YOU ARE A BACKBITING PUSSY

240
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,479
That prick.

241
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,282
Is that true?

242
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,117
Chief Nam and Congressman Park?

243
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,120
It seems like they met with
Congressman Sung Dong-cheol to discuss

244
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,289
his potential position
as the head of the district office.

245
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,292
That's quite unbelievable.

246
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,527
I guess it has finally begun.

247
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,532
It's about time
we put the new guy up for a test.

248
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,008
The pope sent this message himself
early this morning.

249
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,648
"I heard some upsetting news.

250
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,983
The measures taken by Father Michael

251
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,787
while helping Father Gabriel's case
have grown into a problem.

252
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,390
I hear even the public isn't on your side.

253
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,560
The nation's laws take priority.

254
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,730
If legal issues surface
regarding this matter,

255
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,033
the Vatican won't be able to help.

256
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,070
Please refrain from
extreme speech and actions.

257
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,607
Father Michael,
if you cause any more trouble,

258
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,644
I'll have no choice
but to lose my faith in you.

259
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,147
There will be no more

260
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,683
measures taken to help
Father Gabriel's case."

261
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,051
But Father,

262
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,020
what you saw on the news yesterday
wasn't his fault--

263
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,956
Consider the pope's words

264
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,558
noted.

265
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,732
Park Gyeong-seon!

266
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,108
What are these?

267
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,476
Those are the case files

268
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,678
we have on Nam Seok-gu and Park Won-mu.

269
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,716
Aren't they members

270
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,317
of your Gudam-gu Clan?

271
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,485
That's right.

272
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,854
I want to perform
a midway inspection to see

273
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,923
if they're worthy
of being a part of the clan.

274
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,358
Dig deep for me.

275
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,560
Yes, sir.

276
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,261
Weird, isn't it?

277
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,797
Feels like pointing
your gun at an ally, too.

278
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,232
Of course not.

279
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,967
You see,

280
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,404
I'm fond of betrayals
but not of the traitors.

281
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,705
Get it?

282
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:47,773
Yes, sir.

283
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,641
I'll do a detailed research.

284
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,183
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KANG SEOK-TAE

285
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,988
It seems like I won't need
to dig into their closets for skeletons.

286
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,491
The closets are made of skeletons.

287
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,827
If I could,

288
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,996
I'd take full responsibility

289
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,499
and step down as district director.

290
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,635
However, I understand
what the people of Gudam-gu

291
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,004
and those online want.

292
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,040
I will

293
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,075
reconsider my resignation

294
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,345
and stay on as the district director

295
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:27,946
of Gudam-gu.

296
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,785
My, you're one fucking hell
of a sweet talker, aren't you?

297
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,154
Damn it.

298
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,633
THE PROSECUTION DENIES ANY UNLAWFULNESS
"A PROPER INVESTIGATION IS BEING HELD"

299
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,235
What?

300
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,504
You want to add a new member?

301
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,373
There's no need to be sensitive about it.

302
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,675
She's not fully a member yet.

303
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,744
Consider her as an intern.

304
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,148
-Who is she?
-You know,

305
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,652
the one who works for Mr. Kang
who has helped us from time to time.

306
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,388
She wrapped up my recent issue
quite nicely too.

307
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,091
Also, she taught the priest a lesson.

308
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,359
Don't forget to greet her later.

309
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,498
Dong-ja.

310
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,734
don't tell me it's because
you lack trust in me now.

311
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,404
Must you put it that way?

312
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,140
She just deals with
different fields than what you do.

313
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,477
Right, of course.

314
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,745
Fine, whatever.

315
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,915
Try to find a way to fill in the hole
left by Wangmat Food

316
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,451
or you'll get an earful on Savings Day.

317
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,853
Sure.

318
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,155
I'll fill it up all right.

319
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,824
Filling holes is my job, isn't it?

320
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,864
GUDAM, A LIVABLE CITY,
A CITY FREE OF CRIME

321
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,201
GUDAM-GU DISTRICT COUNCIL

322
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,637
Hun-seok.

323
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,273
All we do is fill holes,

324
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,674
but then get yelled at.

325
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,343
Haven't you had enough?

326
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,479
Serving you is the only job I have, sir.

327
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,780
Is that so?

328
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,417
Then what would you do
if I say we're off to our deaths?

329
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,855
Then I'll lead the way.

330
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,093
That came out of nowhere.

331
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,795
You'll lead the way, you say?

332
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,564
Got it.

333
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,239
-Woo-ta!
-Wait.

334
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,607
I can see it.

335
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,209
I can see it!

336
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,879
Who's the bitch my husband is with?

337
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,349
Long hair, burgundy lips,

338
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,786
leopard patterned skirt, long boots...

339
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,355
Prophet Ki,

340
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,891
the Yin energy of the temptress
is way too much to take.

341
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,961
The two entered a motel.

342
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,964
The name of the motel

343
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,668
is Flow... Flower...

344
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,770
Flower Wagon.

345
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,771
Flower Wagon?

346
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,106
Now I'm getting a number.

347
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,411
I'm afraid I've used up
all the energy I've got.

348
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,886
In the name of enlightenment,
let me try once more.

349
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,256
Woo-ta...

350
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,592
I can see it.

351
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,193
The room number...

352
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,762
-What bullshit is this?
-is bullshit...

353
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,435
Damn it.

354
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,871
We were almost there.
Maybe next time, ma'am.

355
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,774
Woo-ta!

356
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,610
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

357
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,479
You're a dead man!

358
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:51,650
Seriously?

359
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,386
Your nephew is causing havoc,

360
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,722
but here you are selling bullshit.

361
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,323
She had an appointment.

362
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,459
Also, I thought you'd take care of--

363
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,960
Shut that trap.

364
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,597
I want that foundation applied for
in two weeks.

365
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,865
The earlier, the better.

366
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,700
But we're still waiting on the orphanage.

367
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,602
Did the elders approve?

368
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,107
That was me giving you an order.

369
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,009
No can do then.

370
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,544
What if things go south
while following your orders?

371
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,579
Just do as you're told.

372
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,348
Sir!

373
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,717
Did I ask you

374
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,220
to think about what makes sense?

375
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,357
Please don't hit him. Hit me instead.

376
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,160
Do you mean that?

377
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,065
I'll show our leader
how much he has enlightened me.

378
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,134
Woo-ta!

379
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,636
Woo-ta.

380
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,838
Gaknyeo?

381
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,474
-What are you doing? Gaknyeo!
-Woo-ta...

382
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,913
Gaknyeo, I'm dying over here.

383
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,515
How could you?

384
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,817
Woo-ta!

385
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,936
Come on. It's not like
this will bring you wealth or honor.

386
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,039
Detective Seo, get up.

387
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,876
Get this off your face.

388
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,082
Head to the break room
and get a proper nap.

389
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,350
I'm good.

390
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:37,189
Isn't this a copy of
Wangmat Food's secret ledger?

391
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,257
Why are you reading this?

392
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,960
Father Kim asked me to look into it.

393
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,464
Is all this trouble really necessary?

394
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,367
Must you put it that way?

395
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,668
There's no harm in keeping a list.

396
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:50,936
Father.

397
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,105
Your face...

398
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,074
I fought against Hwang Cheol-beom.

399
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,876
If you look like this, he must be

400
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,478
in the ICU or something, isn't he?

401
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,947
-He's dead.
-Right?

402
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,315
Dead, my ass.

403
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,549
He's totally fine.

404
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,985
He attacked him first from the back.

405
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,687
That coward.

406
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,889
How dare he scratch your sacred face.

407
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,225
I'll get a hold of that bastard
immediately.

408
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,861
There's no need to get riled up.
Maybe next time.

409
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,463
-Do you have anything new?
-That's not what's important!

410
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,732
It is, actually.

411
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,235
Then, I found something.

412
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,771
There was something peculiar.

413
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,139
Check this out.

414
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,209
FEBRUARY 5, 19:00

415
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,712
"February 5, trip to Hwang Cheol-beom's

416
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,547
vacation home."

417
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,450
February 5?

418
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,454
That's the day Father Lee died.

419
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,857
-Where's this vacation home?
-I checked the registration,

420
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,693
and it's at 37 Yuwoe-dong,
in the outskirts of Gudam-gu.

421
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,563
How far is it
from where Father Lee was found?

422
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,632
About 1.2km.

423
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,333
Wait, that's a stone's throw away.

424
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,449
It's here. My gut is telling me.

425
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,050
Let's go. Let's go get them.

426
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,218
Let's go!

427
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,386
What's going on?

428
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,021
What is it?
You're making me nervous again.

429
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,923
What happened?

430
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,293
We found a killer duck barbecue place

431
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,594
and just confirmed its location.

432
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,065
I see you like duck meat.

433
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,401
Goodness.

434
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,403
What's with all the cuts and bruises?

435
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,004
I know you heard the paramedic's call,

436
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,539
so why are you playing dumb?

437
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,643
So you knew.

438
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,281
Well, let me know
if the restaurant is any good.

439
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,552
VIOLENT CRIME SQUAD 2

440
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,521
I can see he's embarrassed.

441
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,123
-Detective Seo.
-Yes?

442
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,759
First, locate Ki Hong-chan
of Wangmat Food.

443
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,797
I'll go by myself today.

444
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,600
Why?

445
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,237
Only join me when
you're certain that you're on my side.

446
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,205
I don't work with people on the fence.

447
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,409
Also, look back on yourself
and think of your actions.

448
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,078
I'll see you around.

449
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,648
-Father.
-What?

450
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,384
Call me if anything's off.

451
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,288
There are too many eyes in the precinct,
so I'll wait at the cathedral.

452
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,859
Good.

453
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,604
Does this mean you have nothing now?

454
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,141
Damn it. What now?

455
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,976
You promised me a trip to Guam.

456
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,379
-Don't you remember that?
-Don't worry.

457
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,414
I have money stashed away here and there.

458
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,483
Really?

459
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,952
What should we do in Guam?

460
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,222
Why don't we just live there?

461
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,157
Hold on. Why not?

462
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,793
Oh my gosh, that'll be amazing.

463
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,728
Let's say

464
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,665
we went off the grid in Guam.

465
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,166
-Then?
-Then...

466
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,536
Then would we be
in the "Guamuda Triangle"?

467
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,538
-Nice!
-Right?

468
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:16,841
Silly you.

469
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,782
Guamuda my ass.
Tell another joke and I'll punch you.

470
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,618
Right.
I paid one-third of the hospital bills,

471
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,920
and I'll take out a loan to pay the rest.

472
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,590
Have a seat.
I'm here for a different reason today.

473
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,625
Right.

474
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,696
Can I get a cup of ssanghwa tea?

475
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,863
Sure.

476
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,835
Why did you deliver food
to Hwang Cheol-beom's vacation home

477
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,537
on February 5?

478
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,038
Sorry?

479
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,407
February 5,
Hwang Cheol-beom's vacation home.

480
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,776
Come on, how could I remember
every delivery I made?

481
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,447
You should, since it involves
Hwang Cheol-beom.

482
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,685
Well, I probably delivered the food
because someone ordered it.

483
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,530
Yes, of course that's why
you delivered the food.

484
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,501
But that's not the point of my question.

485
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,170
Who delivered the food?

486
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,473
I don't remember.

487
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,810
Here's your ssanghwa tea.

488
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,079
Be careful, it's hot.

489
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,280
Thank you.

490
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,593
Damn, that's hot.

491
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,638
Want to try and drink this in two seconds?

492
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,208
I bet that will jog your memory.

493
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,781
Was it just the two of you?

494
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,784
Yes, it wasn't a big delivery,

495
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,586
so we were fine on our own.

496
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,422
How many portions did you deliver?

497
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,691
There was food
for about three to four people

498
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,393
and some snacks to enjoy with wine.

499
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,429
What's best to eat with wine?

500
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,297
-Sorry?
-Hey.

501
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,967
Okay, I'll stick to soju.

502
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,239
Describe the scene for us.

503
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,710
That way.

504
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,512
-Many were on guard.
-Hurry up, will you?

505
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,283
It was easy to tell
that the high-ups were there.

506
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,718
Whom did you see?

507
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,253
We were in the living room

508
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,023
-and all we saw were Mr. Hwang
-Get him here.

509
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,024
and his employees.

510
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,225
Don't be late.

511
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:52,163
There's something I saw
when Mr. Hwang entered the room.

512
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,899
Two people were already in there.

513
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,634
A man or a woman?

514
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,069
Two men.

515
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,938
You didn't see who they were?

516
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,741
No, we were told to leave
while they had dinner.

517
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,776
No one else joined in?

518
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,879
I almost forgot. Before we left

519
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,215
one more person joined.

520
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,620
I didn't see who it was.
I only saw him from behind.

521
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,723
Is there anything else you remember?

522
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,593
It looked like a man.

523
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,828
His hair was long in the back.

524
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,464
He had gray hair, right?

525
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,532
Yes.

526
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,635
Also,

527
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:34,606
he walked like an old man.

528
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,917
I think they're describing
Father Lee Yeong-jun.

529
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,853
If that's where he was killed,

530
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,289
there would be blood or
other definitive evidence.

531
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,558
What the employees
of Wangmat Food said is enough

532
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,493
to barge in there with a warrant.

533
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,894
Who'd issue one?

534
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,229
Park Gyeong-seon will be like

535
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,598
"No I won't. No will do."
and get in our way.

536
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,067
That's why we need definitive evidence

537
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,036
and a way to secure it.

538
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,271
We must get in and out

539
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,573
without getting noticed.

540
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,075
How about we go undercover?

541
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,277
"It's something
you've never tasted before.

542
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,147
Am I eating short ribs or fried chicken?"

543
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,316
Don't ever mention that to my face.

544
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,151
I'd rather plan an infiltration.

545
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,722
You really have to make sure
that no one knows about it, though.

546
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,357
If you get into trouble again,

547
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,193
the pope won't help you
as he stated earlier.

548
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:03,695
Really?

549
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:06,197
Yes, we received a letter
from the Vatican.

550
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,667
Just like Father Kim said,
an infiltration seems like the best idea.

551
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,871
Let's check the situation
at Hwang Cheol-beom's vacation home.

552
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,643
Hold on. There's something
I've been meaning to ask.

553
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,845
Why are you

554
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,648
gathered here
instead of at the police station?

555
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:31,155
Well, there are just too many
eavesdropping bastards at the station,

556
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,957
-so...
-Oh, right.

557
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:35,994
Then this is like

558
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,831
a special investigation squad.
We're something like that.

559
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,333
Goodness, I'm fascinated.

560
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,303
Think of this place as your base camp.
Regroup here as often as you want.

561
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,508
Detective Seo, Detective Gu,

562
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,112
-prepare for dedenjji.
-Dedenjji?

563
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,082
You mean this?
Up or Down, Up or Down

564
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,185
We used to sing it like this.
Flip whichever way you want

565
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,354
Woo-ra, woo-ra, pull down your socks

566
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,723
Up or down, keep quiet, poop in the basket

567
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,192
-That's not it.
-Here's how it goes.

568
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,961
Can I kill them all?

569
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,362
That's enough.

570
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,398
-Flip, flip
-Up or down

571
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,499
Enough!

572
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,569
Dedenjji it is.

573
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,439
Must you always annoy me like this?

574
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,840
What is this for?

575
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,209
Just do it.
I'll tell you after we're done.

576
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,845
Play or you're out, dedenjji.

577
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,573
Damn, it's cold!

578
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,176
I'm never playing that game ever again.

579
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,344
It'll be rock-paper-scissors.

580
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,047
You flip over this way like this.

581
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,851
And then...

582
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,288
What the fuck are they doing?

583
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,396
Yes, Father.

584
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,498
His guys are likely to stay here.

585
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,900
They're not really doing anything anyway.

586
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,404
-And the cameras?
-There are two by the entrance.

587
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,339
Can I come back now?

588
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,476
What? Of course not.
Wait until after sundown.

589
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,344
Without the sun,
this place is as cold as Siberia.

590
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,213
My lips will freeze
on the side of my face.

591
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,081
As if.

592
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,684
You can come back after sundown.

593
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,985
I'll be waiting with some buns.

594
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,420
Hold on a second.

595
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,989
Two with red beans
and two with vegetables.

596
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,926
Greedy jerk.

597
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,830
You should wait and see
what she's capable of.

598
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:56,034
She wields a knife sharper
than what you'd imagine.

599
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,237
You saved my political career.

600
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,371
Thank you, Ms. Park.

601
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,673
Goodness, please don't mention it.

602
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,875
That reminds me.

603
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,412
Remember the guy out of office
that planned the Father Lee case?

604
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:08,846
Yes, sir.

605
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,815
This is the guy, Mr. Hwang.

606
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,285
He's the one who took care
of the other priest too.

607
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,789
I see.

608
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,124
You are truly a man of action.

609
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,494
It was nothing,
but thank you for the compliment.

610
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,730
-How about a glass?
-Cheers.

611
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:27,932
Cheers.

612
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,241
Ms. Park, is there anything you need?

613
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,177
Whatever you want is yours.

614
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,711
I'm good, ma'am.

615
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,648
Will you excuse me? I have a call to make.

616
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,396
Yes, Ms. Park.

617
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,032
What?

618
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,000
You need to question Father Kim?

619
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,469
Mr. Hwang wants to press charges

620
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,437
regarding the assault that took place
at Wangmat Food.

621
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,073
But he already got his revenge.

622
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,575
Father Kim was beaten too.

623
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,078
Is that so? Why? Is he badly hurt?

624
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,114
Hwang Cheol-beom made his move.

625
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,249
I see.

626
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,053
Father Kim packs a punch
so I doubt he was badly injured.

627
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,621
As if.

628
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:24,522
He broke his arms,

629
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,691
his ribs, and has bruises all over.

630
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,327
I see.

631
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,297
Then tell him that
I wish his quick recovery.

632
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,970
"I see. Tell him that
I wish his quick recovery."

633
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,140
Could she be more heartless?

634
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,514
His bones were broken? Shit.

635
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,384
Why does a priest keep
getting himself in harm's way?

636
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,257
Gosh, my stomach.
It's as if the stress wasn't enough.

637
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,260
Are you done with your phone call?

638
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,800
Anyway, aren't you a member
of Gudam Cathedral?

639
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,136
I knew I recognized you.

640
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,071
What a surprise.

641
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,974
So?

642
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,976
What did you do with Father Lee Yeong-jun?

643
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,945
What about that case?

644
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,848
Why are you bringing this up?

645
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:27,118
Just tell me already.
From the cathedral to Mount Yeongyu.

646
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,688
You see, Ms. Prosecutor,

647
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:35,059
I'm afraid we are obliged
to keep trade secrets,

648
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:36,694
so I hope you understand.

649
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,898
Also, while we're on the subject,

650
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,634
why did you let Father Kim go back then?

651
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,203
If you had dealt with him then,

652
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,071
I'm sure we wouldn't have
gone through this trouble.

653
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,706
Cut the tough guy act.

654
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,343
Did I upset you in any way?

655
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,479
-You're crossing the line--
-You expect a prosecutor

656
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,216
to treat some common thug with respect?

657
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,821
Then treat me as you wish then.

658
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,024
Eating a meal together
doesn't mean you can cross the line.

659
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,259
It's tacky.

660
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,795
I'm also one who hates crossing lines.

661
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,196
But

662
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,432
I'm more than someone
who brushes by your collar, aren't I?

663
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,700
You, Hwang.

664
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,636
Do you even know what a collar is?

665
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:20,871
No, I don't.

666
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,108
It's this part right here.

667
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,445
If you want to brush by someone's collar,
you'd at least have to hug them.

668
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,947
It indicates a very close relationship.

669
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,950
Goodness.

670
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,387
Thank you for enlightening me.

671
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,389
Do not do these two things in front of me.

672
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,358
Acting friendly,

673
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:41,692
and acting tough.

674
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,574
Feisty, isn't she?

675
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,609
Goodness.

676
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,013
The district director
came back after a day

677
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,582
and we got nothing out of
meeting Congressman Sung.

678
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,783
That's not true.

679
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,853
We must keep him by our side.

680
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,755
But Director Jeong is back in office.

681
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,391
I believe we should
have someone new in her seat.

682
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,093
Wangmat Food was bust once.

683
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,029
You could never be sure
it won't happen again.

684
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,999
-We must be prepared.
-Why don't I

685
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,305
show some action for a change?

686
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,576
Sir, you can't.

687
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,911
Don't do this!

688
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,314
You can't come in here.

689
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:38,883
Hey...

690
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:40,618
What is this?

691
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,987
Internal Affairs
from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

692
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,689
So?

693
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,791
We are here to conduct
a search and seizure

694
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,527
for lobbying and illegal recruitment.
Please cooperate.

695
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,996
-What?
-Start collecting evidence.

696
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,164
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

697
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,036
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

698
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,771
Why would they?

699
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,708
What? That's absurd.

700
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,611
Okay. I'll be there in an hour.

701
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,487
Wait. What's this?

702
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,159
Extra kelp?

703
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,042
-Let's go.
-Sure.

704
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,745
They're moving out.

705
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,718
Was it something I ate?

706
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,691
It didn't leak, did it?

707
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,570
Is teleportation your superpower?

708
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,640
Why are you at my house?

709
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,575
Isn't it obvious?

710
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,444
I'm here to drop this off.

711
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,447
Save it. I don't need it.

712
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,215
It's not from me,

713
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,084
but Ms. Jeong.

714
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,385
My job is just to deliver it.

715
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,020
Then I refuse it. Send it back.

716
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,388
You see,

717
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,157
if you don't accept this car,

718
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,993
Ms. Jeong will send me here every day.

719
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,267
I can't say it's all that bad.

720
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,735
I'll get to see you every day.

721
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,370
What sin did I commit in my previous life

722
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,138
to have to see you every day?

723
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:44,074
So you can either accept this car

724
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,776
or see me every day.

725
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,518
You must truly be sick and tired of me.

726
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,921
Leave if you're done here.

727
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,056
All things aside,

728
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,193
this is a sweet ride.

729
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,029
So let it roar as much as you want.

730
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,518
Unbelievable.

731
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,125
It sure is sweet.

732
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,497
I love the grip of the wheel

733
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,298
and how comfortable the seat is.

734
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,368
Even the headrest is good.

735
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,373
If only I felt comfortable inside as well.

736
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,481
How do you close the roof though?

737
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,985
Isn't she the one
who threw a fit at my accusation?

738
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,254
But here she is receiving a car as a gift.

739
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,724
Why are my doubts never wrong?
What a piece of trash.

740
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,430
I'm heading back with the buns as I speak.

741
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,566
Most of them left.

742
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,141
Even the last groundskeeper just left.

743
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:25,776
The complex is empty.

744
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,446
Got it. Keep watching them.

745
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,541
My Lord,

746
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,711
being here was the last thing I wanted.

747
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,547
Please let this be the last time.

748
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,460
Shit, it's freezing out here.
What's taking him so long?

749
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,864
Wait, I hear a motorcycle.

750
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,065
What?

751
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,437
What's that?

752
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,002
-Father?
-Father!

753
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,271
It's me.

754
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,039
Bigfoot!

755
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,407
Damn it.

756
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,710
Gosh, look at you.

757
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,579
No way. This has a 2,000cc engine.

758
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,680
It's actually 600cc.

759
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,383
Where did you get it though?

760
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,384
God sent it my way.

761
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,954
So God gives priests motorcycles?

762
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,055
Can I take it for a spin?

763
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,824
No. Was there any movement?

764
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,625
The complex is still empty, Father.

765
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,461
Let me know
if you see anything suspicious.

766
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,362
Put these in your ears.

767
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,765
I've never used this before.

768
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,900
Were you late
because you were buying these?

769
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,168
Just put it on.

770
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,872
What are you going to do
if there's a camera,

771
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:43,907
an electric door lock,
and a security alarm?

772
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,642
I'll take care of them, so follow me.

773
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,644
But our faces will be caught on camera.

774
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,180
Unbelievable.

775
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,560
Right, we can disguise ourselves
as burglars.

776
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:06,830
A priest and a detective
pretending to be burglars?

777
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,632
It doesn't sound too bad.

778
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,368
Anyone would consider you a burglar.

779
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:12,703
Hold on a second.

780
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,338
What now?

781
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,142
It's a lucky charm.
You should hold onto it.

782
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:21,912
What is this?

783
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,615
Only one piece of kelp is packed
in a bag of instant noodles.

784
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,084
But once every ten years or so,
you get two in one bag.

785
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,720
And that day turns out to be my lucky day.

786
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,324
-Watch out for any movements.
-Yes, Father.

787
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,760
-Keep it. I'll bring you luck.
-Forget it.

788
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,530
What's this smell? It stinks.

789
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,265
Sorry about that.

790
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,467
-Good luck.
-It's making me sick.

791
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,535
-Good luck!
-Whatever.

792
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,649
It's still not too late
for you to change your mind.

793
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,117
I'm fine now that I have a mask on.

794
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,553
Also, I've been a detective
in Violent Crimes for a while.

795
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,500
-What's this?
-A scrambler for the cameras.

796
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,268
The one that interferes
with the camera feed?

797
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,970
So you did stop to buy electronic devices.

798
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,149
Wear these.

799
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,620
Shoe covers to hide shoe prints.

800
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,888
Forensics use these.

801
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,733
UNLOCKING

802
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,509
He gets cooler by the day.

803
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,447
Is there a second when he's not cool?

804
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,377
I'm only asking because I'm curious.

805
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,812
Is this what they teach you
at Catholic colleges?

806
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:36,813
Yes.

807
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,049
You must know how to pick locks
in order to enter Heaven.

808
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,350
I see.

809
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,853
So Heaven has a lock on its gates.

810
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,621
What a liar.

811
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,491
I guess Hwang Cheol-beom
isn't the type to decorate

812
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,059
around the house.

813
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,872
There's not much furniture.

814
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,281
What's this smell?

815
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:14,318
Bleach.

816
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,787
You're right. It's bleach.

817
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,289
This much smell

818
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,358
indicates that it was used in a clean-up.

819
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:26,697
Look at these dents.

820
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,198
A table used to be here.

821
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,034
Here, here and here.

822
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,570
You're right judging by these couches.

823
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:46,550
What if...

824
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,822
What are you doing? Move.

825
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,027
Not that way. Move.

826
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,397
No, get behind me!

827
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,272
What if there was a table here

828
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,476
and the top was made out of glass.

829
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,951
If you look at the back of his neck,
you can see small scars.

830
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,686
They're gathered here.

831
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,889
This happens when one is punctured
by small glass shards.

832
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,392
Nothing at the cliff could've caused that.

833
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,594
Then these lacerations

834
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,397
must've been caused
by glass that was shattered elsewhere.

835
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,685
You're estimating that
a glass table was here.

836
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,954
It's not here though.

837
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,356
That means

838
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,891
the weapon used in the murder

839
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,426
isn't at the scene anymore.

840
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,928
Exactly.

841
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,101
Isn't that luminol used to detect blood?

842
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,235
It is.

843
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,338
What is this, Doraemon?
What don't you have in that bag?

844
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,573
You carry everything in there.

845
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,347
If they cleaned up the blood with bleach,

846
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,750
the blood evidence would be of no use.

847
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,386
It'll be too contaminated
for a DNA sample.

848
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,289
Blood cells are unstable
and have short lifespans,

849
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,825
but DNA structures are stable
and last longer.

850
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,661
Really? I didn't know that until just now.

851
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,497
The things they teach you
in Catholic colleges.

852
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:46,670
Here.

853
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,089
I don't know if it's a viable sample.

854
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,759
We won't know until we try.

855
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,963
One thing I'm sure of
is that this is a crime scene.

856
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,501
Three cars are approaching!

857
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:19,970
Evacuate the building.

858
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,641
Damn it, just when
we were getting somewhere!

859
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:27,377
They're all exiting their cars.

860
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,212
Who's there?

861
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,015
Prosecutor Park, Hwang Cheol-beom,

862
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,851
Director Jeong, and Hwang's guys.

863
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,889
I don't recognize whom
Ms. Park rode with though.

864
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:46,763
Damn it.

865
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,573
This is the best place to talk in private.

866
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,208
-Please have a seat.
-Sure.

867
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,384
Please tell me you know someone
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

868
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,219
I do, but we're not close.

869
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:10,987
What about you?

870
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,691
There are two prosecutors from my class
and one in the year above,

871
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:15,992
but we aren't close.

872
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,328
We don't seem to have any connections.

873
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,465
What we need to do first
is find out who planned--

874
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,940
Have you not eaten dinner?

875
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,975
I did. Please carry on.

876
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,744
What we need to do first

877
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,713
is find out who planned this.

878
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:39,482
It must be someone

879
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,286
who know that you have no connections
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

880
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,354
WHO'S THE GUY IN GLASSES?

881
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:45,388
I DON'T KNOW

882
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,389
Then we have our answer.

883
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:47,324
LET'S BAIL

884
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,525
Chief Nam and Congressman Park.

885
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,459
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME!

886
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,328
LET'S LEAVE. I WANT TO LEAVE RIGHT AWAY!

887
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,107
What is it?

888
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,743
It's nothing.
I'll just turn the lights on upstairs.

889
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,985
-We're leaving through the window.
-Don't.

890
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,987
Hwang's goons are right outside.

891
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:20,724
Is there another exit?

892
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:24,327
I don't see one from my angle.

893
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,152
THAT'S MY BAG GIVE IT BACK

894
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,087
YOU SHOULD'VE KEPT IT CLOSE TO YOU!

895
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,456
CAREFUL CAREFUL

896
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,059
I'LL GO FIRST, SO FOLLOW MY LEAD

897
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,405
Do you really think it was
Chief Nam and Congressman Park?

898
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,175
Only they would have the audacity to--

899
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,082
I'm truly sorry,

900
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,384
but I need to go to the bathroom.

901
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,253
Hurry on back.

902
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:04,294
The ladies' room is right at the top
of the staircase.

903
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:05,628
Right on.

904
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,936
The guys just entered the other building.

905
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,238
You're clear to exit through the window.

906
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,820
What did I eat, seriously?

907
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,927
Where's the stupid toilet paper?

908
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,133
I'm sure it'll be here somewhere.

909
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:45,301
Here it is.

910
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,005
Seriously? Just one?

911
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,280
LUCKY CHARM!

912
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:58,715
YOU CRAZY BASTARD!

913
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,417
THROW IT!

914
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:01,484
NO!

915
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:05,054
No matter how hard I try,
one won't be enough.

916
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:09,726
Come on.

917
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,806
Why on earth is this here?

918
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:30,113
Where did the toilet paper come from?

919
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,252
Gosh.

920
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:39,289
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

921
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,160
This can't be happening. Shit.

922
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,832
Oh, no.

923
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,080
I can't believe
I suddenly don't want to go.

924
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,408
SPECIAL THANKS TO JUNG SI-A

925
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,898
The priest and cop
running away from thugs?

926
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,032
What is this madness?

927
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,168
Two masked burglars
broke in and stole a flask.

928
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,204
This is a common burglary,
not special larceny.

929
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,273
Why are you getting mad?
You're not the one who did it.

930
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,241
My, I thought I was for a second.

931
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,044
-You like Father Kim, don't you?
-What?

932
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,547
Go to a Buddhist temple instead.
They serve great food, you know.

933
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,384
I hated his guts anyway.
If we mess this up,

934
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,485
everything goes to shit.

935
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,021
Just eat it, you pig.

936
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,255
What's your problem? You're--

937
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:20,390
HERE COMES THE PRIEST

938
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,461
