1
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,387
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,688
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,793
You, boy, are connected to my soul.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,361
I love you, Hae-il.

5
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:32,499
Father Lee was secretly being investigated
for sexually assaulting a church member

6
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,435
and embezzling and misusing church funds.

7
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,903
this will come as a shock

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,140
to not only the religious community,
but also everyone else.

9
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,509
Don't you know what he was like?
That's total nonsense!

10
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,911
Check all the traffic
and security cameras.

11
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,112
I also want an autopsy done.

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,181
Did you think I'd get excited
and allow an autopsy

13
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,916
if you showed up here?

14
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,553
He asked me
to spare him some every weekend.

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,021
HE MEETS THE FALSE WITNESSES

16
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,956
And while I was praying,
he suddenly touched my thigh.

17
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:57,857
So step aside!

18
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,659
Do you think you can
knock me down with that?

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,263
HE TRIES HIS BEST TO NO AVAIL

20
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,532
Stop shooting. Stop it!

21
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,568
We're going to Paris, France, right?

22
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,905
Wait, why don't you go tell the pope
and see if that doesn't work?

23
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,741
Pope, pope, pope,

24
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,342
help me, pope!

25
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,677
Dear Holy Father.

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:20,814
VATICAN CITY

27
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,617
THE POPE FORMALLY REQUESTS
A REINVESTIGATION

28
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:27,487
He actually did as I said?

29
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,993
What?
You want me to cooperate with the priest?

30
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,433
Who is the detective in charge again?

31
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,103
It's Detective Gu Dae-yeong.

32
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,710
You aren't willing to reinvestigate.

33
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,112
No. What?

34
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,713
Weren't you supposed to appoint

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,381
the most competent detective?

36
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,617
Yes, that's Detective Gu.

37
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,456
Look at that face. What should I do?

38
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,825
I think I might end up killing him.

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,461
I'll help.

40
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,331
No, let them get going

41
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,199
and back them up from the station.

42
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,601
I should be on the field.

43
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,002
Quiet.

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,938
I'd like someone else to do it.

45
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,507
Anyone but this loser.

46
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,275
Loser?

47
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,778
You're being rude.

48
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,015
I'm the hidden ace
of the violent crime squad.

49
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,550
Don't speak to me like that.

50
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,852
Ace my ass.

51
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,022
You can sit here
and stuff your face with those snacks.

52
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,425
You're making me feel competitive.

53
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,916
What if I solve this case?

54
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,251
Solve it? I'll buy you lamb skewers.

55
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,720
That isn't enough.

56
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,026
Beef, special cuts.

57
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:15,929
It's a deal.

58
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,331
Okay.

59
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,768
Let the joint investigation
officially begin.

60
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,037
I read your records.
It turns out I am a year older than you.

61
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,104
So what?

62
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,207
So you should talk to me more politely.

63
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,408
What's my job called in English?

64
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,145
You are wrong. It's "Father."

65
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,414
-Do you know what "Father" means?
-Of course I do.

66
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,416
Now, should your father
talk to you politely?

67
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,419
-You are ridiculous.
-I'm glad that's settled.

68
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,689
-Where are we going?
-We will eat first.

69
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,398
Where are we going after the meal, man?

70
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,402
Sir?

71
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,073
The woman who claims to be a victim
of sexual harassment

72
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,741
and the general manager of the church.

73
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,010
You met them a few days ago.

74
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,278
I'll really press them this time.

75
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,681
Pressing them won't change the truth.

76
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,083
-Detective Gu.
-Yes?

77
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,821
Have you ever gotten stabbed
in your head with a beef rib?

78
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,790
Come on, don't be like that.

79
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,859
Every time you open your mouth,
you talk about maiming.

80
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,327
So remember,

81
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,566
no more throwing around
big words like "truth" or "fact."

82
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,970
Words like "truth" and "fact"
are the closest to a detective.

83
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,572
How could I avoid using them?

84
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,078
All right! All right!

85
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,447
Damn this lousy temper of yours.

86
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,883
Everything around you is a weapon!

87
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,351
Let me tell you once again.

88
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,655
If you rain on my parade

89
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,758
or try to mess things up,
I will send you on a field trip to hell.

90
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,959
Father.

91
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,629
I am the detective here.
I'm in charge of this case.

92
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,832
You are only an observer,
a person who observes. Okay?

93
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,737
You can observe all you want.
Just don't get in my hair, okay?

94
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,110
What does he think I am, chewing gum?
Why would I get in his hair?

95
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,378
I'm no chewing gum.

96
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,547
I can hear you.

97
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,751
There isn't even much hair to get into.

98
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,087
That balding, grumpy priest.
Who does he think he is?

99
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,388
Excuse me?

100
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,724
It was just a chewing sound. Nom nom, see?

101
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,826
Eat quietly. Have you no manners?

102
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,561
Don't chew so loudly.

103
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,796
It's a habit, okay?

104
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,531
Where did I put that rib?

105
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,333
All right!

106
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,269
Why are you so sensitive
about the chewing sound?

107
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,704
Please put this away, ma'am.

108
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,107
I guess they're busy.

109
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,283
The pope? For goodness' sake.

110
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,452
This is ridiculous.

111
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,124
Someone must have coached him
when he planned this out.

112
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,461
There is no other explanation
for how it suddenly blew up like this.

113
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,863
Which bastard is it?

114
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,633
Push it all the way
to the Blue House if you want to.

115
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,803
Wait, why don't you go tell the pope
and see if that doesn't work?

116
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,739
Come on. Go tell him.

117
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,542
Pope, pope, pope,

118
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,077
help me, pope!

119
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,215
If you find the person behind this scheme,

120
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,784
arrest that bastard as well.

121
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,687
Yes, sir.

122
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,726
Didn't the police get someone
who will disrupt the reinvestigation?

123
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,628
I don't trust them.

124
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,264
That priest...

125
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,767
He's bound to cause headaches.

126
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:41,968
You can tell, right?

127
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,772
See if you can come up
with a way to get rid of that priest.

128
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,754
-How much is the total?
-It's 26,000 won.

129
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:02,955
Thank you for the food.

130
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,560
-What?
-We are paying separately.

131
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,995
Put it on expenses.

132
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,997
I can only do that with my meal.

133
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,665
You take yours to the Catholic community.

134
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,467
How much should I charge?

135
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,768
-26,000 won.
-Okay.

136
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,072
You jerk!

137
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,309
-Did you charge the total to this card?
-Yes.

138
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,379
My card... Your Catholic, aren't you?

139
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,781
26,000 won...

140
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,219
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

141
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,189
Do you have any good ideas?
Anything that could stop him?

142
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,258
For goodness' sake.

143
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,961
He has the pope watching his back,
so I need a legitimate reason.

144
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,598
I have an idea.

145
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,200
What is it? Hurry up and tell me.

146
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,336
Let's disguise one of our guys as a monk.

147
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,004
-A Buddhist monk?
-Yes.

148
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,474
Then we can make him run into that priest,

149
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,076
pick a fight, and get a severe beating.

150
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,846
It will bring about
an inter-religious conflict

151
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,349
and that priest will be put
under the spotlight.

152
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:04,951
Then--

153
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,786
You actually want to do this?

154
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,454
-Yes.
-Make him go "Avalokiteshvara."

155
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,889
Then bump into the priest, is that it?

156
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,123
That's it!

157
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,661
He could shoot a dirty look, like this!

158
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,298
A dirty look. A dirty look? A dirty look!

159
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,515
No?

160
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,218
It's a good idea.

161
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,456
Would you get rid of those arm warmers?
This isn't the 80s!

162
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,258
Are you living in the 80s?

163
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,495
This is the Prosecutors' Office.

164
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,432
Ms. Park.

165
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,134
Yes?

166
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,370
Mr. Kim, the idol singer
from the Nonhyeon-dong meth case,

167
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,538
requests for an interview.

168
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:00,940
Really?

169
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,244
Tell him to drop by later today.

170
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,881

171
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,154
-Welcome, Boss.
-Welcome, Boss.

172
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,492
What are you, flip phones?

173
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,362
I told you to keep the bow
within the 30-degree angle.

174
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,164
-I am sorry, sir.
-I am sorry, sir.

175
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,733
Do you want the world to know
that you are a gangster?

176
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,036
The cleanup for the reconstruction site
will begin today.

177
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,671
Shouldn't you overlook the process?

178
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,839
-I can't go. Go instead.
-Yes, sir.

179
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,509
I told you the last time.
Did you forget again?

180
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,277
I am sorry.

181
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,083
Bye, sir.

182

DAEBEOM TRADING

183
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,859
Do the Peter Piper picked a peck thing.

184
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,230
Peter Piper picked--

185
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,335
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

186
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,803
Peter Piper...

187
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,907
Peter Piper picked...

188
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,509
Peter Piper picked...

189
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,911
I give up. Come here.

190
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,616
-Is this where that woman lives?
-Right, dude. It's that way.

191
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,186
-"Dude"?
-It's that way.

192
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,490
Let me remind you just in case.

193
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,126
You can't lose your temper
and break things during the investigation.

194
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,028
-All right.
-Promise me.

195
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,197
I told you I won't do it!
Don't you trust me?

196
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,301
Quit it. That's too loud.

197
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,036
She is inside but refusing to come out.

198
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,306
Maybe she isn't home.

199
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,709
Don't you hear the sound
of pork belly sizzling?

200
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,480
Maybe the sound is echoing
from another house.

201
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,949
Why would the sound
of pork belly sizzling echo?

202
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,755
A hairpin? Seriously?

203
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,357
Like that's going to work.

204
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,326
Does he think he is in a movie?

205
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,499
What? Hey!

206
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,501
For goodness' sake.

207
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,024
Who the hell are you
to open the door of my house?

208
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,325
Well, it wasn't me...

209
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,528
We had no choice
since you refused to come out.

210
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,630
If I refuse to come out,
that means I'm not coming out.

211
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,800
-Who do you think you are?
-I am a detective!

212
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,435
I am a detective! A detective!

213
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,969
Gosh, those perilla leaves sting.

214
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,740
Are you a priest?

215
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,709
What,

216
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,545
are you upset about
my daughter's testimony?

217
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,913
Where is your daughter?

218
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,682
-Why do you ask?
-I have some questions for her.

219
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,384
She went on a trip to Europe.

220
00:11:58,784 --> 00:11:59,952
-A trip to Europe?
-Yes.

221
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,487
-Where in Europe?
-Europe.

222
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,255
Where in Europe? I can't reach her.

223
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,357
I can't reach her either.
She will call me when she wants.

224
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,829
-When is she coming back?
-I don't know.

225
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,164
She's your daughter.
Isn't it absurd that you don't know that?

226
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,632
It isn't absurd at all!

227
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,568
Perhaps my daughter and I don't get along!

228
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,303
I have nothing to say, so leave.

229
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,005
-That's preposterous.
-Let's go.

230
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,273
-Let's go.
-For goodness' sake!

231
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,942
Her eyes were shooting daggers.

232
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,111
-We came all the way here.
-She is on another level.

233
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,546
I don't care if she is on another level!
It's nonsense.

234
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,981
-She is different.
-If you come again,

235
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:29,982
I will call the police!

236
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,218
-Understood?
-Call the police! Go ahead and do it!

237
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,753
-Excuse me?
-Let's go!

238
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,855
She said she doesn't know!

239
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,890
Do you think she really doesn't know?

240
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,492
My gut feeling tells me that's the case.

241
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,228
Don't use your gut feeling.
I might end up beating you up.

242
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,830
Everyone in this neighborhood is a thug!

243
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,867
I am going crazy on the first day
of cooperative investigation.

244
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,569
-Hey!
-Ma'am!

245
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,637
Ma'am!

246
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,206
-He moved out?
-Yes.

247
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,575
It wasn't much of moving out

248
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,311
since he only had enough belongings
to fit in a bag.

249
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,513
Where did he say he was going?

250
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,615
He said he was going abroad.

251
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,784
-Where abroad?
-I don't know.

252
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,452
He said he won't be back for a while.

253
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,988
I wondered if he was running away.

254
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,624
Running away?
Was he in some kind of trouble?

255
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,560
Didn't you know about his gambling habits?

256
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,399
Until a few days ago,
creditors and gangsters came

257
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,301
to hound him.

258
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,137
I couldn't believe the church's decision

259
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,907
to let someone like him
do the bookkeeping.

260
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,408
How about his family?

261
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,345
His wife left with a child
a few years ago.

262
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,914
Who would stay with him?

263
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,049
Thank you.

264
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,359
Aren't you getting the picture now?

265
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,829
-What do you mean?
-Gamblers

266
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,964
do anything to have their debts cleared.

267
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,368
Don't disparage the gamblers.

268
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,604
There are many gamblers who are pure...

269
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,573
Well, yes, pure.

270
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,308
Pure?

271
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,644
Did you just say that gamblers are pure?

272
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,249
Do you want to go meet
the purest person in the neighborhood?

273
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,987
Who is that? Who is pure?

274
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,190
Gaozi said that human nature

275
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,659
can't be divided into good and evil

276
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,629
just like a body of water that hasn't been
decided whether to flow eastward or west.

277
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,032
Thus, human nature is
neither good nor evil.

278
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,868
That was Gaozi's belief.

279
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:34,139
Gosh, the lecture is difficult
from the first day.

280
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,310
Come to think of it, it's true.

281
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,314
You can't know whether you'll be
a good son or an utter bastard

282
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:43,983
from the moment you're born.

283
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,751
Isn't that right?

284
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:47,953
You are right, sir.

285
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,761
Have some noodles before you go.

286
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,168
I am not right, you punk.

287
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,772
Bastards are born bastards

288
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,240
like me.

289
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,376
By the way,

290
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,645
are you keeping an eye
on that insufferable priest?

291
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,813
Yes. Detective Gu is doing the task.

292
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,218
Even an idiot has his use.

293
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,122
-Mr. Hwang.
-What is it?

294
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,758
You should come on out.

295
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,626
What is it this time?

296
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,996
What a hassle.

297
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,431
Move. I just need a minute.

298
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,667
We don't care if you need a minute or 100.

299
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,770
Let's go. What would Mr. Hwang know?

300
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,239
I wouldn't use much of his time.
I am a busy man myself.

301
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,407
-My goodness.
-Come on.

302
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,875
What's going on?

303
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,115
Father, what brings you here
all the way to my company?

304
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,217
Detective Gu, you came as well.

305
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,686
Let me ask you something.

306
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,422
Here?

307
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,591
Why don't you come in
for a cup of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe?

308
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,161
I got it from a famous cafe in Gangneung.

309
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,430
You can enjoy Ethiopian Yirgacheffe
all you want.

310
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,032
-Where are the two of them?
-The two of them?

311
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,335
Who do you mean?

312
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,238
You have the best acting skills.

313
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,840
With you, it's not as obvious.

314
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,910
You could at least tell me
what this is about.

315
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,778
You gave me no context.

316
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,047
I am talking about the woman
and general manager of the church

317
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,282
who gave false testimony.

318
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,319
Oh, those two. What about them?

319
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,988
Are they having an affair?

320
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,323
Seriously,

321
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,160
why would you ask Mr. Hwang about them?

322
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,429
Keep your mouth shut, Detective Gu.

323
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,797
Don't tell me to keep my mouth shut.

324
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,533
You can't go around creating a ruckus
everywhere you go.

325
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,070
I can't help if you keep causing trouble.

326
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,706
That's it.

327
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,209
He is a fine example of those
who protect and serve.

328
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,711
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

329
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,115
My goodness.

330
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,518
I am a violent crime detective.

331
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,652
And I'm a busy priest.

332
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,655
Where are you keeping them?

333
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:07,192
Why are you asking me?
This is so frustrating.

334
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,828
Who could have bribed people into lying
and forced them into hiding?

335
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,464
Not the police or the Prosecutors' Office.

336
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,533
It's obviously the work of the thugs here.

337
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,339
I feel so victimized.

338
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,009
I am a businessman
who complies with the law and order.

339
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,745
What will you do if I find the two of them

340
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,580
and prove that
you forced them into hiding?

341
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,016
Let's have a bet.
What should the winner get?

342
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,453
Eels? Lobsters? A wrist?

343
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,021
I have a better idea.

344
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,590
Put your hands behind your back
and take a punch.

345
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,691
Father!

346
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,327
Watch what you say.

347
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,497
A youngster like you shouldn't interrupt
the adults' conversation.

348
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,332
Stay out of it.

349
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:49,768
Fine.

350
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,806
I will put my hands behind me
and take a mean punch from you.

351
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,076
If you lose,
you will put your hands behind you.

352
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,343
Sure.

353
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,113
I will put my feet shoulder-width apart
and put my hands behind me.

354
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,024
Gosh, where'd he get those balls from,
the Holy Spirit?

355
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,461
Get the two witnesses' departure records.

356
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,896
Both of them went away.

357
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,232
Do as I say.
Why are you so talkative today?

358
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,001
You are driving me crazy.
Why are you dragging Mr. Hwang into this?

359
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,236
You don't even have proof.

360
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,872
How much did you get
from Hwang Cheol-beom?

361
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,507
You are unbelievable.

362
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,209
Watch what you say.

363
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,877
Then why are you so determined
to protect him?

364
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,911
Protect him, my foot!

365
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,680
We don't have anything on him.

366
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,915
We should mind our manners
as we investigate.

367
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,651
If you mind your manners more,
you would be Hwang Cheol-beom's slave.

368
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,920
You need to stop attacking me.

369
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,690
For goodness' sake.

370
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,758
-Hey.
-What?

371
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,594
Get security camera footages from that day

372
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,262
in the vicinities
of Gudam Cathedral as well.

373
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,463
But there are so many...

374
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,565
Gosh!

375
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,201
For goodness' sake.

376
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,641
Stop being angry
and do it slowly and gently.

377
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,109
See? It works.

378
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,213
Go already.

379
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,785
This isn't right.

380
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,188
I only tried it because CEO Kim's son

381
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,090
made an offer.

382
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,292
Why is my crime the gravest?

383
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,861
Didn't you say you confessed
that you are the provider?

384
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,596
They said they will arrest

385
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,699
the CEO of my agency and my bandmates
if I don't confess.

386
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,867
Hey.

387
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,404
I see hundreds of suspects in a month
that change their stories like you.

388
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,574
Let's wrap this up cleanly, okay?

389
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,710
I am begging you.

390
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,245
My mother...

391
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,648
She is suffering so much.

392
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,217
Gosh.

393
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,520
You have incredible acting skills.

394
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,290
After you serve your sentence,
you should go into acting.

395
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,825
You will make it big, I'm sure.

396
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,861
I am not a meth provider!

397
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,129
Mr. Kim.

398
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,366
That's the thing with the law.
It's inorganic.

399
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,835
No matter how much you shout and cry,

400
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,337
you won't get a reaction.

401
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,905
That's the law.

402
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,443
Use this chance to learn about the world
and become an adult, okay?

403
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,222
Ms. Park. Mr. Kang wants to see you
in his office.

404
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,795
What did I tell you?

405
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,699
I told you that priest
is bound to cause headaches.

406
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,435
Can't we ignore his request
for the security camera footage?

407
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,203
Wake up. Did you forget?

408
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,073
He has the pope behind his back!

409
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,045
Contact this person and
take care of the security camera footage.

410
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,280
Who is this person?

411
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,450
Do you have to ask?
He is in charge of data at the center.

412
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,586
He works for the Prosecutor General.

413
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,958
What are you waiting for? Go get it done.

414
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,293
Yes, sir.

415
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,803
How many times do I have to tell you?

416
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,539
Going through security camera footage
is a lot of work.

417
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,707
We still need to do it.

418
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,676
Knowing where Father Lee went
will give us a lead.

419
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,412
We don't have enough manpower for that.

420
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,580
I will do it.

421
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,916
I will go to the situation room
and bring the footage.

422
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,085
I can do that, right?

423
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,021
You are a newbie with a lot of work.

424
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,455
I could go a few days without sleep.

425
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,925
You need to sleep.

426
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,596
Lack of sleep is the root of all diseases!

427
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,431
She said she will do it!

428
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,900
Why are you complaining
when it isn't your job anymore?

429
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,269
-Listen.
-Yes, sir.

430
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,139
I went over
the two witnesses' departure records.

431
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,240
They did leave the country.

432
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,941
Where did they go?

433
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,680
The woman went to Dubai.

434
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,749
-Dubai?
-Yes.

435
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,918
Dubai is in the Middle East.

436
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,120
I thought she went to Europe.

437
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,189
Europe...

438
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,893
-Well...
-She must have had a layover.

439
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,463
She must have had a layover in Dubai
before she arrived in the French Republic.

440
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,368
How about the general manager?

441
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,237
Well...

442
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,840
He went to France.

443
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,010
THE FRENCH REPUBLIC AND FRANCE ARE
THE SAME COUNTRY

444
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,913
One went to the French Republic

445
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,514
and the other went to France.

446
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:32,751
That's right.

447
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:34,920
Yes.

448
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,231
Fix it before you leave!

449
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,666
SEOUL GUDAM POLICE STATION

450
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,536
Hold on, Father.

451
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,271
Hold on.

452
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,676
Do you think the police station is
a middle school classroom?

453
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,113
Whenever you are angry,
you kick things and shout.

454
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,215
There is a limit to our patience.

455
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,651
Even when you are upset,
you should mind your manners.

456
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,020
How would you feel if we kick things

457
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,555
at the church?

458
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,524
You deserve it.

459
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,493
For goodness' sake.

460
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,328
Isn't it your duty

461
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,397
to forgive the world and people?

462
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,400
Why are you so out to get us all the time?

463
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,671
Half-baked forgiveness

464
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,541
is the root of evil and evil itself.

465
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,676
That's why I don't forgive easily.

466
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,283
"Your problem solver,
Gudam Police Station"? What a joke!

467
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,385
I should destroy it.

468
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,388
No. You can't destroy it.

469
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,623
Kick me instead.

470
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,025
Kick it. Go ahead and kick it.

471
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,461
It would be better to have you kick
an inanimate object.

472
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,530
For goodness' sake.

473
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:57,369
YOUR PROBLEM SOLVER, GUDAM POLICE STATION

474
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:21,059
Ma'am, I want stir-fried cartilage
and another bottle of soju, please.

475
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,195
-The one with a red cap.
-Sure.

476
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,399
Who told you to sit down?

477
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,502
I will treat you. Let's drink together.

478
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,171
Go away already.

479
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,374
Thank you.

480
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,612
Are you getting smart with me?

481
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,747
I just want to drink with you.

482
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,483
I am not getting smart with you.

483
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,451
I know you won't pour me a shot,

484
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,786
so I will drink on my own.

485
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,924
Let's forget about our differences.

486
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,961
Let's sit here as a man to a man
and become drinking buddies.

487
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,163
I don't trust my drinking buddies.

488
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,768
Fine. Keep pouring your own drink.

489
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,027
Please give me another bottle of soju.

490
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,537
He is the leader of Maegakkyo,
Ki Yong-mun.

491
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,138
Say hello.

492
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,441
I am eternally honored to meet you.

493
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:47,078
I am Ki Yong-mun.

494
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,413
I heard a lot about you.

495
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,051
You work hard
materially and spiritually for Gudam.

496
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,621
I try my best to offer help.

497
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:03,728
Mr. Hwang brought
Prophet Ki Yong-mun to Gudam.

498
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:08,233
Mr. Hwang picked up a competent man.

499
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,402
Thank you.

500
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,874
Starting next month,
he will manage the welfare facilities.

501
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:18,843
He will also start working on
setting up a foundation.

502
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,079
I would like to remind you

503
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,215
that you must do well
without creating any noises.

504
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,552
We hate noises.

505
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,556
I am sure you will do well.

506
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,660
I will do my best.

507
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,402
Woo-ta.

508
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,504
What is this?

509
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,109
To thank you for accepting me,

510
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,346
my followers and I prepared a small gift.

511
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:00,952
Woo-ta!

512
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,326
I have always

513
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,830
found toads to be cuter than frogs.

514
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,311
I am Detective Seo Seung-a
from Gudam Police Station.

515
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,247
I am here to retrieve the original copy
of the security camera footage.

516
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,483
Okay. Please wait.

517
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:34,552
Father.

518
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,823
May I give you a word of advice?

519
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,028
Sure. I won't listen anyway.
See? I can't hear.

520
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,264
I will compare it to a baseball match.

521
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,167
The score is nine to zero.

522
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,502
-Nine to zero.
-Nine to zero.

523
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,503
Nine to zero.

524
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,206
Two outs, bottom of the ninth.
No runners on base.

525
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,108
The last batter is up.

526
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:02,280
The ball hits the ground
right in front of the pitcher.

527
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,517
At that moment...

528
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,155
At that moment,
changing the coach and players

529
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,092
and calling the owner of the club
won't change a thing.

530
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,862
Play a game you can win.

531
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,331
I don't know anything about baseball.

532
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,035
Do you have no grasp on reality
because you are a priest?

533
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,471
Are you doing this on purpose?

534
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,309
You stirred up troubles everywhere
including Vatican City.

535
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:35,580
Why on earth did you do that?

536
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,950
I thought I told you
to shut your mouth when I'm around.

537
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,220
Are you looking down on me
because I am drunk?

538
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,925
Are you doing this because of
your sense of justice as a priest?

539
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,061
These days, justice is like

540
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:55,934
the underwear
Superman wears outside his pants.

541
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,236
It's a joke.

542
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,040
Gu Dae-yeong. These days, even Superman

543
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,210
doesn't wear underwear outside his pants.
Watch the movie.

544
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,584
It doesn't matter how hard you work.

545
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,587
It doesn't matter
if you come back from the dead.

546
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,991
There are things
you can't penetrate or dig up.

547
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:24,696
Even if the pope's grandpa comes--

548
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,801
What? Are you going to punch me again?

549
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,569
Go ahead!

550
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,605
Just don't punch me in the nose.

551
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,941
You little...

552
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,577
You aren't normal, Father.

553
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,647
You are the only one
who doesn't know that.

554
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,589
Forget it.

555
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,463
Where are you going?

556
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,665
You said you will pay, right?

557
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,969
He had to remember that
despite being wasted.

558
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,451
Captain, I am at work and all is clear.

559
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,821
Detective Gu. I got a call.

560
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,290
The security camera footage
has been taken care of.

561
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,093
Already? Yes, sir. Salute!

562
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,063
But keep your eyes on
Detective Seo just in case.

563
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,732
Yes, sir. I will do that. Salute!

564
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,267
He is wasted.

565
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,702
Salute...

566
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,741
He always hangs up
in the middle of my sentence.

567
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,015
VIOLENT CRIME SQUAD 2

568
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,195
This is harder than I expected.

569
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,251
Don't work so hard.

570
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,853
Even if you sacrifice
your health for work,

571
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,523
no one will thank you.

572
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,393
Did you drink?

573
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,661
Yes, I did.

574
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,399
Then go to sleep.
I still have a few things to look over.

575
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,041
Stop dozing off

576
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,811
and take a 30-minute nap.

577
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,128
Here, have this.

578
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,565
Hey, don't you have a chicken sandwich?

579
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,535
I am sick and tired of triangular gimbap.

580
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,338
Chicken sandwiches get sold out
as soon as I display them.

581
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,808
Just say "Kop khun kap" and eat,

582
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,009
stop complaining.

583
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,512
Make sure you put one aside the next time.

584
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,380
It's my wish.

585
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,650
What happened to your lips?
Did Jang Ryong beat you up again?

586
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,988
Hey.

587
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,224
You should fight back.
Why do you always get beaten up?

588
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,161
I will punch him someday.

589
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,530
I will punch him many times.

590
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,833
Peter Piper picked...

591
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,102
Just you wait, Jang Ryong!

592
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,503
Hey, hey.

593
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,673
When you get beaten up and feel depressed,

594
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,942
go to your happy place.

595
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:58,843
Happy place?

596
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,046
Happy place, happy place...

597
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,649
Thailand...

598
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,784
Jang Ryong, that son of a bitch!

599
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,990
There are thoughts that make you happy.

600
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,559
For example, imagine
the smell of chicken in the elevator

601
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,562
that is getting delivered
to another house.

602
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,933
That's right. I love that smell.

603
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,804
I love the smell of instant jajangmyeon

604
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,673
in the internet cafe.

605
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,641
Gosh, my mouth is watering.

606
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,143
I have another one.

607
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,946
-Inside an apartment building, doors open,
-Yes?

608
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,482
smell of grilled pork belly
filling up the corridor.

609
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,785
That's right. The smell of pork belly.

610
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,555
Yo-han, did you hear that?

611
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,557
I'm so hungry, I can't hear a thing.

612
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,726
It's a customer, you pig.

613
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,296
How could you call me a pig?
It's no wonder Jang Ryong beats you up!

614
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,937
Jang Ryong. Jang Ryong...

615
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,015
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

616
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,452
I am telling you this
because you are a regular customer.

617
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,487
You are beautiful.

618
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,625
I have wanted to tell you
since last month.

619
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,727
-Hey, Mr. Part-timer.
-Yes?

620
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,330
It's rude to make a comment
about other people's looks.

621
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,433
And who are you to make a judgment
about my looks?

622
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,836
It wasn't a judgment.
It was a comment of sincere praise.

623
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,906
Let's say someone said to you,
"Gosh, you look like baozi."

624
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:35,973
Would you be happy?

625
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,208
What's baozi?

626
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,276
A type of Chinese dumpling.

627
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,647
KING-SIZED DUMPLINGS

628
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,315
I am not done yet.

629
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,417
It's buy one get one free
for king-sized dumplings, right?

630
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,219
Yes, it is.

631
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,788
Apparently, I look like
a Chinese dumpling.

632
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,423
Even if such thought occurs to you,

633
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,959
keep it to yourself. Understood?

634
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,561
Okay.

635
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,163
Why are you threatening him like that?

636
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,400
I am only admonishing him
because his comment was inappropriate.

637
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,901
I am not threatening him, okay?

638
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,537
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

639
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,408
Even if he was in the wrong,
talking down to him and using harsh words

640
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,276
make you a bully. Isn't that right?

641
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,212
A bully?

642
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,180
As his elder...

643
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,382
In which year were you born?

644
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,284
I was born in 1993.

645
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,953
What? 1993?

646
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:24,755
Unbelievable.

647
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,459
Father. He was born in 1993.

648
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,828
Born in 1993?

649
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,332
What happened in the galaxy in 1993?

650
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,336
In 1993, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
was discovered.

651
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,604
It collided with Jupiter--

652
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,073
See? I am your elder.

653
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,911
Elder, my ass. Boomer is more like it.

654
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,113
Bye, Ms. Boomer. Bye.

655
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,114
Bye.

656
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:54,919
I can't believe he was born in 1993.

657
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,623
Gosh, what's with the floor...

658
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,159
For goodness' sake.

659
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:08,232
-Ouch.
-What are you, an acrobat?

660
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,334
Father.

661
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,503
Gosh.

662
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,674
Why did you drink like
there is no tomorrow?

663
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,608
Are you okay?

664
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,776
Who are you? What?

665
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,645
It's me.

666
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,247
Old lady.

667
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,951
Hold on.

668
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:30,721
You can't grope a priest like that.

669
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,424
Touching your body won't do me any good.

670
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,092
Why would I do that? For goodness' sake.

671
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,728
If you touch...

672
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,331
If you touch my body again...

673
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,733
I can't believe it.

674
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,937
Oh, hey.

675
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,774
What...

676
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,109
Are priests allowed to be this drunk?

677
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,912
I don't care. I don't care.

678
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,951
How much more corrupt do you need to be

679
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,053
to be satisfied, old lady?

680
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,890
The things that come out of his mouth...

681
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,227
Father.

682
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,197
It's impossible for me to be corrupt
since I have no power.

683
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,102
For someone smart,
you are incredibly dense.

684
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,638
It's not the powerful people
who become corrupt.

685
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,808
It's the corrupt people who rise to power.

686
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,479
Old lady, you fit the description
perfectly.

687
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,981
Perfectly.

688
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,585
I understood perfectly.

689
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,954
Go home, wash up, and sleep.

690
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,194
All right.

691
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,433
Thank you as always
for your service to the country.

692
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,771
Gosh, he always admonishes me
with his holiness.

693
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,753
For someone smart,
you are incredibly dense.

694
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,689
It's not the powerful people
who become corrupt.

695
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,725
It's the corrupt people who rise to power.

696
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:19,430
Old lady, you fit the description
perfectly.

697
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,198
Perfectly.

698
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,276
Yes, Ms. Park.

699
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,178
I am sorry for calling so late, Mr. Park.

700
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:38,983
What was the sentence for Mr. Kim,
the idol singer?

701
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,920
Let's see.

702
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,556
Four years and three months.

703
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,293
He won't be out of prison
until the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

704
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,263
Is there anything you want to say?

705
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,333
Let's cut the sentence in half
and let him watch the World Cup.

706
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,468
Fix the documents tomorrow.

707
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,803
Yes, Ms. Park.

708
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,562
Stop peeing, you punk!

709
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,964
It stinks.

710
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,534
It stinks so badly that I can't sleep.

711
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,871
Did you drink beer?

712
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,808
That happens when you drink beer.

713
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,614
There isn't much to life.

714
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,984
It's like that.

715
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,491
That's what it is.

716
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,664
Beep.

717
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:02,032
Beep.

718
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,534
Beep!

719
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,307
My goodness.

720
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,081
Have some. It's really tasty.

721
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:21,051
Did you wake us up
so that we could eat this?

722
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,586
It's too early to sleep.

723
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,355
Have a late-night snack first.
It's really tasty.

724
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,056
Here. Have one each.

725
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,959
-We should thank the Lord for food...
-Sister.

726
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,697
Gosh, it's hot. My lips.

727
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,833
Blow on it and eat slowly.

728
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,802
Did something happen?

729
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,938
No, nothing happened. Why?

730
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,010
Would you like soju?

731
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,512
No. I will just eat this.

732
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,116
I feel like something is missing.

733
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,986
Soy sauce! I will bring soy sauce.
Please wait.

734
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,026
Soy sauce. Soy sauce.

735
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,894
Eat it with soy sauce.

736
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,530
I will mix the two.

737
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,199
Here.

738
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,367
My goodness. My goodness.

739
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,937
-Leave it, Father.
-I am sorry.

740
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,072
It's okay. Please just leave it.

741
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,841
I am sorry.

742
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,076
Go to bed.
We will eat before we go to bed.

743
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,879
-Will you do that?
-Yes.

744
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,248
Then I will retire to my room.

745
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,885
I feel the happiest

746
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,988
when people enjoy the dumplings I bought.

747
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:34,692
So please blow on it and eat slowly.

748
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,166
Father.

749
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,401
Blow on it, okay?

750
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,804
I will dip it in soy sauce for you.

751
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,639
It shouldn't be hot.

752
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,274
There you go.

753
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,009
It has cooled down.

754
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,744
Here.

755
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,350
I will retire to my room now.

756
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,252
-Good night.
-All right.

757
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:08,292
Gosh, this is the biggest crisis
I have ever met as a nun.

758
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,462
What is his problem today?

759
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:15,666
Seeing him smile like that
makes me feel so sad.

760
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,369
It makes you feel sad?

761
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,104
I feel terrified.

762
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:24,308
Instead of showing anger,
he is showing craziness now.

763
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,177
You will be late today as well, right?

764
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,050
You are always late.

765
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,709
What are you doing? We're moving out.

766
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,144
Move out.

767
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,881
You said there were no children.

768
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,549
There were no children. Let go.

769
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,251
Don't lie, you son of a bitch.

770
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,619
What did you say, you lunatic?

771
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,021
There were children inside.

772
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,556
I told you that everyone
except for Korean citizens

773
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:22,126
are enemies who can be eliminated.

774
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,994
Those children were innocent!

775
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,863
They are enemies!

776
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,799
Children aren't an exception.

777
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,769
-Get it?
-Those children were innocent.

778
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,438
Prepare to leave the organization
when you go back.

779
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,140
Understood?

780
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,314
Those children were innocent!

781
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,938
My goodness.

782
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,631
In the end,

783
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,469
I couldn't protect even you, Father Lee.

784
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:02,059
You were the person I wanted to protect
until the end of my time.

785
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,730
I don't know if I would be able
to protect anything

786
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,565
from now on.

787
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,330
Enjoy your meal!

788
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,332
Why aren't you eating?

789
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,968
I ate already.

790
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,403
Don't lie.

791
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,338
I can tell you drank yesterday.

792
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,240
Eat some food to cure your hangover.

793
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,209
It's okay.

794
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,479
Don't you like Russian food?

795
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,381
It's a taste of home.

796
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,386
I hear you haven't been able to keep
that nuisance of a priest in check.

797
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,621
You shouldn't work so sloppily.

798
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,256
You should be smart.

799
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,859
What will you do
if things get out of hand?

800
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,197
Things won't get out of hand.
You don't need to worry.

801
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,601
I have my trust in you, Detective Gu.

802
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,603
Look at my eyes.

803
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,439
Look at my eyes filled with trust.

804
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,444
If the current situation
gets wrapped up nicely,

805
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:31,281
I will lead you
to the land of milk and honey.

806
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,218
May I leave?

807
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:35,986
Finish the food before you go.

808
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,689
It's okay. You should go if you have work.

809
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,123
You may leave.

810
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,598
Isn't your late partner's
death anniversary around this time?

811
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,473
Gosh, look at your pupils.

812
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:57,941
Stop glaring, okay?

813
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:05,182
Don't forget the lesson you learned
from your late partner,

814
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:06,984
Detective Gu.

815
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,830
Please! Help!

816
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:24,534
Somebody help me!

817
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,137
Somebody!

818
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:36,847
Yeong-cheon.

819
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,118
Yeong-cheon, why...

820
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,055
Yeong-cheon. Yeong-cheon, wake up.

821
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,796
Somebody help!

822
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:56,333
Please! Help!

823
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,736
Somebody help!

824
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,510
Hey.

825
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,446
Really? Okay.

826
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,116
What?

827
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,452
Watch the footage from here.

828
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,188
This footage was taken
near the entrance of the cathedral.

829
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,925
If you watch the footage from 11:20 p.m.,
which is the estimated time

830
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,027
of Father Lee Yeong-jun's departure...

831
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,765
It jumps to two minutes later.

832
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:32,336
Yes. It looks like a freeze-frame
since there are no cars on the road,

833
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,604
but two minutes of the footage is missing.

834
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:36,807
There could've been an error.
It happens sometimes.

835
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:40,177
This isn't a videotape from the 80s.
Why would there be an error?

836
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,913
That's not all.

837
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,617
The security cameras that are installed
down the road are missing

838
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,553
a minute of footage each.

839
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,095
Is this the original copy?

840
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,531
That's what they said
at the situation room.

841
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,100
What did they say about the missing time?

842
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,769
They said the errors are frequent
because the equipment is old.

843
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,271
They said they are planning an upgrade
or whatever.

844
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,140
Digital devices aren't problem-free.

845
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,376
Even cellphones lag sometimes.

846
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:18,015
Again? How could you destroy
the police property?

847
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,516
Are you joking?

848
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,952
How could you edit an evidential material
as if it's a movie?

849
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,988
Who are you accusing of editing?
It's the fault of the device, not us.

850
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,024
Look here.

851
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,558
No security cameras

852
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,260
work so poorly these days, okay?

853
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:33,563
Why are you causing a stir again?
You even destroyed police property.

854
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,441
Pay for what you broke.

855
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,209
I'm sending an invoice for that
to the cathedral.

856
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,285
What a lunatic!

857
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,321
I will really send an invoice this time!

858
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,825
THE WARM-HEARTED AND TRUSTWORTHY POLICE
IS ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE

859
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:10,133
YOUR PROBLEM SOLVER, GUDAM POLICE STATION

860
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:32,556
Where will we take the group photo now?

861
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,224
Well...

862
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:40,130
Isn't that man a priest?

863
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,566
He can't be.

864
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,469
No priests are like him.

865
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,321
Good work.

866
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,356
The original footage
has been destroyed, right?

867
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:10,260
Okay. I will report to Mr. Kang.

868
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:11,995
Okay.

869
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:15,832
What is it?

870
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,269
Ms. Park.

871
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:22,672
Do you still think
the scheme with a monk is

872
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:23,874
a bad idea?

873
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,314
You are quite tenacious, Mr. Park.

874
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,583
Why can't you be this tenacious
about work?

875
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,854
How could you think
that kind of a scheme would work?

876
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,027
This is
the Special Team Prosecutor's Office.

877
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,464
What?

878
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,566
Okay.

879
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,836
Ms. Park. Mr. Kim, the idol singer,

880
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,838
tried to hang himself
in the detention center.

881
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,109
He has been moved to the hospital,
but he is in critical condition.

882
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,514
Ms. Park!

883
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,019
Exactly what have you done

884
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:11,054
to make Mr. Kim hang himself
in the detention center?

885
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,656
You said you were confident.

886
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,592
How could you mess up
the situation so badly?

887
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,429
The reporters will swarm
to this place and the hospital!

888
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,232
I will take care of the reporters.

889
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,968
Forget it. Go home
before the reporters come.

890
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:26,503
Understood?

891
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,610
Yes, Prosecutor General.

892
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:35,912
I am sorry.

893
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,116
Please don't worry.

894
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,353
Well, that's... Yes.

895
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,422
Okay.

896
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:55,098
A lot of police officers suffer

897
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:57,934
from work-related traumatic events.

898
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:01,504
As the National Police Agency implemented
a new kind of treatment program,

899
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,908
my hospital became responsible
for Gudam Police Station's therapy.

900
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,180
Give her a round of applause!

901
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,424
If you are suffering mentally,
book a therapy any time.

902
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,859
Please don't hesitate to do so.

903
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,429
Isn't she really pretty?

904
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:27,964
Whatever.

905
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:44,314
The contents of therapy
will remain confidential.

906
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,451
Thank you.

907
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,255
Thank you.

908
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,592
There are no secrets
in this tiny neighborhood.

909
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,060
The words are bound to get out.

910
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,395
Don't worry.

911
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,598
I won't.

912
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:17,247
DON'T BUY FROM TOUTING STORES

913
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:25,989
What are you looking for?

914
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,791
You.

915
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,063
Sit down.
You don't need to greet me so warmly.

916
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:36,900
Sit down.

917
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:39,903
You haven't changed at all.

918
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,038
Hey, Hae-il.

919
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,675
I never expected to see Won Do-u,
the genius hacker who hacked NIS,

920
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,310
at a place like this.

921
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,679
It's all in the past.

922
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,715
What brings you here?

923
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:54,184
What do you think, you punk?

924
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,853
I am here to ask you a favor.

925
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,522
I guess you didn't know.

926
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,493
I don't work as a hacker any more.
I can't help you.

927
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,229
-Really?
-Yes.

928
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,233
The statute of limitations hasn't expired,
so I will report your past crime

929
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,468
-and receive a reward.
-What?

930
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,902
How many charges would there be?

931
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,605
Finance, press,
national security, and porn.

932
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,907
That porn wasn't my doing.

933
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,111
You didn't mind before.
Why are you doing this now?

934
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,481
Now, do you want to listen to me?

935
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,252
What's the job?

936
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:30,587
It's simple.

937
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:32,922
The whereabouts of two people.

938
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,427
It's simple indeed.

939
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,830
So how much can you pay me?

940
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,768
Priests don't have money. I am a priest.

941
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:47,003
What?

942
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,447
Go to this location
and secure the witnesses.

943
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,014
What will you do when you receive
the remaining payment?

944
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,615
Other than paying off your gambling debts.

945
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:34,350
I will leave this country

946
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,086
and lay low for a while.

947
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,721
How about you?

948
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,791
After I pay off my debt,

949
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,526
I will party.

950
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,994
I will party until I get sick and tired.

951
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,397
You make me laugh.

952
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:53,703
I see that you are in France indeed.

953
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:55,972
But

954
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,241
instead of the Seine,

955
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,577
I see Bukhan River.

956
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,279
Russian misters!

957
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,885
Gosh.

958
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,523
As I expected, there are tails.

959
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:46,122
Come here.

960
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,592
Stop right there.

961
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,135
You'll go to hell
for hitting women, brothers.

962
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,928
I don't care if you crush him or kill him.
Stop him.

963
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,064
THE INVESTIGATION FACES HARDSHIPS

964
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,066
Who were taken away?

965
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,601
What are you doing?

966
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,237
Grabbing the opportunity from God

967
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,005
is the only way
to live as a decent human being.

968
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,574
Yesterday, you were drunk.

969
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,709
Today, you are a seasoned priest.

970
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:40,610
THE CULT TARGETS CHILDREN

971
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:43,646
Starting a month later,
this lady will look after you.

972
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,848
A priest came! He deserted his God

973
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,317
and came to Prophet Ki!

974
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,052
