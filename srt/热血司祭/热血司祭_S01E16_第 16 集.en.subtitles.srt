1
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,186
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,488
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,530
Now, this is the document file

4
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,232
you've all been desperately looking for.

5
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,171
The one who wins three rounds first
will get it.

6
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,439
Oh, and...

7
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,976
What will you give me if you lose?

8
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,512
I guess we do need to bet something,
don't we?

9
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,681
I'll bet my hands on it, okay?

10
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,850
No way, Father. How will you pray?

11
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,321
What would I do with your hands, anyway?

12
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,657
It looks like there's something you want.

13
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,426
If I win,

14
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,496
quit being a nun and come work for me.

15
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,599
Hey, cut that crap.

16
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:14,767
Let's do it, then.

17
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,408
Alright, then. Let's begin.

18
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,813
Okay, then...

19
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,615
Let's begin.

20
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,053
Here, now...

21
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,956
Stop right there, Brother.

22
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,393
Don't try to play any tricks.

23
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,228
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,663
Do you think

25
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,399
I'm a fool, Brother?

26
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,468
Who are you trying to accuse?

27
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,404
These two cards were for me,

28
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,173
these two for him,

29
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,709
and these two for you,

30
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,078
so you saved the best for yourself.

31
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,615
Hey, Horsehead. Check his cards.

32
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,321
What's this?

33
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,531
What the hell? Come here, you.

34
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,966
Why are you getting so sensitive?

35
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,035
It's just a practice game! Let go!

36
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,903
Let go of me!

37
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,142
I see your eyes are still sharp as before?

38
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,280
Shall we begin the game, then?

39
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,915
I fold.

40
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,850
What? Already?

41
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,352
One to zero.

42
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,686
I'm sure that's part of the plan.

43
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,122
She must have a plan.

44
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,772
I fold.

45
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,908
Are you kidding me?

46
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,678
Are you trying to lose?

47
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,179
Gosh.

48
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,681
Two to zero.

49
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,018
-Get yourself ready.
-We'll be fine, Father.

50
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,186
We still have one round left.

51
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,321
This is driving me nuts.

52
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,789
Why?

53
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,293
Why...

54
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,496
That's it if you lose one more round.

55
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,367
What if I win the next three rounds
in a row?

56
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,070
Three rounds in a row?

57
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,240
So you want to continue on?

58
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,342
Tell me what you want.

59
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,979
If I win the next three rounds,

60
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,914
along with that USB drive,

61
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,517
let this man hit you three times.

62
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,320
Three times.

63
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,257
What the hell?

64
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,194
Whatever.

65
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,996
Then,

66
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,498
you start this time.

67
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,788
Let's end this.

68
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,592
A pair of sevens.

69
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,495
A pair of nines.

70
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,131
-Nice.
-Nine beats seven.

71
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,016
A pair of sevens.

72
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:25,952
A pair of twos.

73
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,220
-Yes!
-Okay!

74
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,861
Nice!

75
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,699
I know this is silly, but I need to pee.

76
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,701
You silly boy. Keep it in.

77
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,369
-All right, Father.
-We might lose our luck.

78
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,483
Why are you doing this?

79
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,719
My heart tells me to trust you,

80
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,321
but my head just won't do the same.

81
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,158
But I'm going to follow my heart.

82
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,593
I'm going to trust you.

83
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,128
However,

84
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,198
if you fail to meet my expectations
one more time,

85
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,867
the trigger will be pulled.

86
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,702
Understand?

87
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,175
Yes, sir.

88
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,044
Let's not make things complicated.

89
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,450
Now, let's make things straight.

90
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,952
We are now a team.

91
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,423
Of course, you two

92
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,525
will become our potent weapon.

93
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,228
And the shares of Congressman Park

94
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,664
will be divided amongst you three.

95
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,236
Now then,

96
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,138
I hope we can keep trusting each other.

97
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,073
Isn't that right, Mr. Hwang?

98
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,382
This is the last round.

99
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,051
You go ahead.

100
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,220
You want me to start?

101
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,955
All right, then.

102
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,858
Fine.

103
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,700
One. Two. Three.

104
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,268
Five.

105
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,504
Four.

106
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,873
Hold it.

107
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,744
It's our last round.

108
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,314
Don't you think we should mix
the cards together?

109
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,449
Of course.

110
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,817
DIVIDING THE MIXED CARDS ONCE MORE

111
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,619
What does that mean?

112
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,153
I'm not sure.

113
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,550
I can't bear to watch it.

114
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,060
TEN

115
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,198
You're no match against me,
no matter what tricks you play.

116
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,604
A PAIR OF TENS

117
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:36,776
Go on.

118
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,713
Please give me justice.

119
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,020
I shall praise the Lord for it.

120
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,670
A pair of light three and light eight.

121
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,240
I think I won.

122
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,277
-We won!
-We won!

123
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,784
What the hell?

124
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,486
But you didn't play any tricks.

125
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,055
That's right. I didn't play any tricks.

126
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,470
Then, I guess I take that finger.

127
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,804
No, you won't.

128
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,826
I thought you played it professionally?

129
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,902
Oh Gwang-du, Daegwallyeong Horsehead,

130
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,971
you are under arrest
for the suspicions of murder,

131
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,240
illegal gambling, and more.

132
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,741
-Take him away!
-Yes, sir!

133
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,788
-One moment, Captain.
-Yes?

134
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,656
He promised

135
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,325
one more thing.

136
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,977
Gosh, that must've hurt.

137
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,814
He promised three times.

138
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,315
How could he faint after two blows?

139
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,850
You still have one left, all right?

140
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,555
You two go ahead.

141
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,636
You will be punished, of course.

142
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,110
However,

143
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,379
you will be punished only if you lose.

144
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,550
Go and win.

145
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,902
About earlier...

146
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,571
I'm not trying to gamble.
I was just curious.

147
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:53,939
How do you do that trick?

148
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,842
Oh, it's not a trick, Father.

149
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,478
It's just the Lord's will.

150
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,180
You big fat liar!

151
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,916
How could you use his name like that?

152
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,284
Come on and tell me.

153
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,086
Please tell us, just this once.

154
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,089
There's really no such thing as a trick!

155
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,325
Gosh, what's this lint here?

156
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,599
It's all just a game.

157
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,206
Oh my... I shouldn't say "God", should I?

158
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,742
I'll bring out some fruit, then.

159
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,678
-Lots of oranges, please.
-All right.

160
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,547
I think this is how you do it.

161
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,149
Like this. She picked it from your ear.

162
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,618
Sister, this is how you do it, right?

163
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,487
Are you supposed to hide it
behind your palm?

164
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,289
And then flip it?

165
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,324
It's too hard for me.
I'll just go like this.

166
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,396
Thank you, Father Kim.

167
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,066
Thanks to you,
I was able to get a load off of my chest.

168
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,037
Today, you were like

169
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,407
Father Lee to me.

170
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,747
We got a call from the house, sir.

171
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,516
That the nun won?

172
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,319
Yes, sir. And the police raided the place,

173
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,620
so the syndicates were arrested.

174
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,022
So things turned out well.

175
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,426
Did you get everything
related to Rising Moon cleared?

176
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,761
Yes, sir. We made it easy to escape,
to begin with,

177
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,096
so it wasn't too difficult.

178
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,002
Take care, Chief Nam.

179
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,206
I can't believe it.

180
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,110
He had a gun right against my head
and it felt like shit...

181
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,179
I'm so pissed.

182
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,915
It feels like shit
to have a gun against your head.

183
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:43,983
Tell me about it.

184
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,951
Is it so hard for him to understand?

185
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,455
Doesn't he get why
I'm trying to go after Kim Geon-yong?

186
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,291
It's because he tried to kill me!

187
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,661
Was that what you were up to?

188
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,529
Trying to get within the cartel?

189
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,265
Yes.

190
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,567
I guess you could put it that way.

191
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:02,935
See?

192
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,071
It's great to see you
put your skills to use.

193
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,073
You go, girl!

194
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,143
Did you let Kim Geon-yong go on purpose?

195
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,046
Yes. Since we got him to admit it on tape,

196
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,648
I can throw him at any time I want.

197
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,850
Amazing! I just got the chills.

198
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,185
Where did you find the voice recording?

199
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,655
In a hard drive that we confiscated
at the hideout in Rising Moon.

200
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,391
Detective Seo and I
already backed them up.

201
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,760
Detective Seo is leaving me out now?

202
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,528
You two seem to be getting along.

203
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,497
She's such a smart girl.

204
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,265
She may be young, but she's a proper cop.

205
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,303
How much was inside that vault, anyway?

206
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,376
You're saying we can't find
Rising Moon's accounting records?

207
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,713
No, sir.
They're known to be all over the place,

208
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,815
so there's no way to get hold of them
once they disappear.

209
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,185
Does that mean someone else
could've already gotten hold of it?

210
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,286
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:59,792
So you should get prepared.

212
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,261
But Chief Nam sent his shares
on Rising Moon

213
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,596
to our borrowed-name bank accounts.

214
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,499
Yes. And they can track it down.

215
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,868
I'm sure that's why he sent it there.

216
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,811
We need to eat some pork belly
to wash all this dust down.

217
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,412
Give me a drink.

218
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,616
You seem busy lately.

219
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,419
I'm kind of tied up these days.

220
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,189
Just look at you.

221
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,057
You're covered in dirt
and you have a pickax.

222
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,294
I took a fall while planting some trees

223
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,795
in the mountains.

224
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,432
That imbecile.

225
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,537
Are you sure it's 150 billion won,
and not 15 billion?

226
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:52,277
And my share is 12.5 billion won.

227
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,183
Old lady,
you should just stay in the cartel.

228
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,420
And why don't you donate 2.5 billion won
to the church?

229
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,757
What are you talking about?

230
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,060
Well, it is more than you need.

231
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,231
So, that's why those jerks
needed a foundation.

232
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,067
Oh, that's right.

233
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,603
Here.

234
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,439
Gross! What's this?

235
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,841
It's Rising Moon's accounting records.

236
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,245
Choose someone you can trust
and finish it off.

237
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,113
By someone I can trust, you mean...

238
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,248
Someone righteous,

239
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,284
disobedient, stubborn,

240
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,519
and firm.

241
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,320
Other than me?

242
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,257
Gosh, how will you manage?
You'll be busy guarding the vault.

243
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,893
Was that it?

244
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,596
I thought it was because
you didn't trust me.

245
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,100
Well, that's one of the reasons.

246
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,036
Forget it, then!
You take care of it yourself.

247
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:55,207
Don't get so grumpy.
Come on and take it back.

248
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,878
Do you know what I went through,
waving that huge sword around?

249
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,513
What a waste of my time.

250
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,215
Why would you call it a waste?

251
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,585
I'll heat up some dumplings for you.

252
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,694
The Daegal Gang is a nationwide scale
gambling gang

253
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,263
with records of four cases of murder,

254
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,933
three cases of attempted murder,

255
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,634
blackmail, extortion, and kidnap,

256
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,737
and they have been on the run
for the past three years.

257
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,141
However,
with our team's resources and patience,

258
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,076
we have been able to raid them,

259
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,512
and we are now currently investigating.

260
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,583
We, the violent crime squad
of Gudam Police Station, will make sure--

261
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,285
What the hell?

262
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,589
Why is that bastard--

263
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,193
This is the Metro Detective Division.

264
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,695
Mr. Nam Seok-gu,

265
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,430
you are under arrest for
suspicions on violating

266
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,099
the real-name transaction law,
tax evasion, and manipulating accounts.

267
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,501
Arrest him.

268
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,635
What?

269
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,438
What the...

270
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,012
I'll be back!

271
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,819
You can't do this to me!

272
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,420
I'm the chief!

273
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,559
Gather around, everyone.

274
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,394
You, too, Seung-a.

275
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,738
Just because Chief Nam got arrested
doesn't end it.

276
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,439
We're part of the corruption.

277
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,208
We're the ones who should be punished.

278
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,610
We accepted the bribes and slacked off.

279
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,579
That's why

280
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,149
I'm going to carry the ball
and face punishment myself.

281
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,151
No, you won't.

282
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,388
I'm single, so I'll take it.

283
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,423
I'm the one who took the most money.

284
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,824
For my kid's hospital bills.

285
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,259
I'll be the one to step down.

286
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,762
I'm the one who has been sparing myself
and slacking away.

287
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,130
I'll make up for it this time.

288
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,332
-Sir--
-Forget it. The discussion's over.

289
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,900
Let me have it my way this time.

290
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,535
I'll take full responsibility.

291
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,603
However,

292
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,006
I'm going to get rid of
all the scumbags in Gudam-gu first,

293
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,309
and then I'm going to step down.

294
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,743
Do you all understand?

295
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,679
Yes?

296
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,414
Lord.

297
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,284
I have always been able to wake
those who are sleeping,

298
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,087
but never those pretending to sleep.

299
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,627
Forcing others into doing things
they don't want to do

300
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,596
is too agonizing.

301
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,701
But those people

302
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,103
have started

303
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,807
to open their eyes on their own.

304
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,513
They will no longer pretend to be asleep.

305
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,692
-Hi, Gyeong-seon.
-Yes, hello.

306
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,467
Has he gone mad?

307
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,370
I should've just whacked him on the head.

308
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,806
-Who are you talking about, ma'am?
-Prosecutor Nam.

309
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,276
I ran into him just now and he said, "Hi."

310
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,877
What is he, American?

311
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,413
What's making him so happy?

312
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,116
-Don't you know, ma'am?
-I don't.

313
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,351
This is an open secret,

314
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,454
but Prosecutor Nam got a constructor
to sponsor him.

315
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,256
A sponsor?

316
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,692
Gosh, how pathetic.

317
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,028
Is that why he's grinning so stupidly?

318
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:39,131
But there's something fishy
about that constructor.

319
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,366
He's a complete skunk.

320
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,202
But that Prosecutor Nam has no clue,

321
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,538
and he got a new car
and moved to a bigger house.

322
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,374
That fool has no shame at all.

323
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,344
I guess there's no way

324
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,212
to bail Chief Nam out.

325
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,517
Well, since Superintendent Lee
has taken the case, it's over.

326
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,753
Are you sure there's no way to clear out
Chief Nam's borrowed accounts?

327
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,257
I'm sure we can clear the records
if we pull a few strings here and there,

328
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,493
but it won't be cheap.

329
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,329
Clear it, no matter how much it costs.

330
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,698
Make sure not to leave any trace.

331
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,934
Then what should I do with the shares
under Director Jeong's borrowed name?

332
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,703
Oh, that?

333
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,739
Just leave it.

334
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,617
You got off early.

335
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,256
-You're that priest, aren't you?
-Yes, I am.

336
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:42,594
And you're the old twine who pulls strings
here and there, aren't you?

337
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,364
Why you--

338
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,337
Shut up and listen carefully.

339
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:53,772
You're next.

340
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,041
What are you going to do?

341
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,010
It won't be as easy as you think.

342
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,913
Handling scumbags like you
is what I do best.

343
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,583
The Lord gave me the skills to do so,
but not the skills to forgive.

344
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,253
Fine.

345
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,989
If you want to live,
you'll have to kill me first.

346
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,058
If not, you'll be the one to die.

347
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,293
Do you really think Lee Jung-gwon
has got your back?

348
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,063
I used to beat him up all the time.

349
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:19,898
And one more thing.

350
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,467
About Father Lee's death.

351
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,104
I could just kill you right now.

352
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,475
But I'm going to make you pay.

353
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,645
And it will happen soon.

354
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,963
A hundred...

355
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,498
A hundred and fifty billion won?

356
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,802
I can't even imagine that number.

357
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,540
Now, let's say your monthly pay
is two million won.

358
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,175
But I don't even get two million won.

359
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:05,911
Let's just say it is.

360
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,050
You'll have to save up for 6,250 years.

361
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,152
No way!

362
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,289
By then, we'll die, decompose,
turn into petroleum,

363
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,858
and end up in someone else's gas tank.

364
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,159
I'm sure they'll be using

365
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,061
some other source of transportation
by then.

366
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,830
They'll have alternative energy, too.

367
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,065
Do you mind if I speak now?

368
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,133
Go ahead.

369
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,269
I've been thinking over and over

370
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,872
about that money in the vault.

371
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,740
We should steal it.

372
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,275
What? "Steal it"?

373
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,214
Be quiet.

374
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,818
I can manage to steal
a gourd-shaped bottle,

375
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,887
but 150 billion won...

376
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,389
Without that money, the Gudam-gu cartel

377
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,291
is nothing. They'll crumble away.

378
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,393
I know it's black money,

379
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,928
but it's still stealing.

380
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,499
We can return it to where it belongs.

381
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,000
Or maybe give it to the country.

382
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,702
No, forget about that.

383
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,137
They're all the bastards as well,
so let's just put it back.

384
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,508
I agree with Detective Seo.
It's too risky.

385
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:10,876
You think so?

386
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,779
All right, then.
I was going to start planning,

387
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,181
but I guess this is it for you two.

388
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,084
I'll just have to find other candidates.

389
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,720
Get some rest.

390
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:22,888
Go on and finish up.

391
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,689
All right, then.

392
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,026
Father Kim, that's not what we meant.

393
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,494
-Father!
-We were just worried...

394
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,796
Let's continue discussing after the meal.

395
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,867
Their jajangmyeon is so addictive.

396
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:40,405
No matter how hard I try to keep away,
it practically tugs at my tongue.

397
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,508
I'm back, sir!

398
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,185
Songsak. Give us some more pickled radish.

399
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,390
Go get it yourself. I'm busy.

400
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,162
Why you little...

401
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,737
I guess you really are busy.

402
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,373
Where do you keep the pickled radish?

403
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,342
-Is it over--
-Hold it.

404
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,314
Here's your homework.

405
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,848
What homework.

406
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,951
Make sure to have it memorized next time.

407
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,087
Listen close. I'm not repeating it.

408
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,924
Betty bought a better butter
to make the bitter butter better

409
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,059
Say it.

410
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,394
What's that?

411
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,230
It's a Thai tongue twister, you bastard.

412
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,500
Betty bought a better butter
to make the bitter butter better

413
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,705
Betty caught a bitter butter...

414
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,872
Wrong.

415
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,643
Betty bought a better butter
to make the bitter butter better

416
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,182
Bitty thought a bitter batter...

417
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,116
Wrong.

418
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,219
Again.

419
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,288
-Bitty caught a batter bitter--
-Wrong.

420
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:08,593
Betty bought a better butter
to make the bitter butter better

421
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,829
Batty drought a butter batter. Wrong.

422
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,131
-Batty bought. Again.
-Yes.

423
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,800
Batty sought a batter better--

424
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,936
Come here, you just deserve a beating.

425
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,907
Yes. Turn it over to the press.

426
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,880
Moving on.

427
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,516
A picture and story posted
by an anonymous user

428
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,551
have become a hot topic online.

429
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,754
Catholics and non-Catholics

430
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,823
all throughout the country
are in a state of shock.

431
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,326
There has been controversy

432
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,927
as criticism on a Catholic priest
was posted

433
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,096
through an online petition board.

434
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,566
The Catholic wrote that the priest

435
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,003
was a former special team member
of the National Intelligence Service

436
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,407
and that he mercilessly slaughtered
children in Uyrkistan,

437
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,242
and yet he was continuing on with his life

438
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,477
disguised as a priest.

439
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,579
Although he made an inquiry
to the archdiocese,

440
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,014
he was only told to contact

441
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,718
the priest's monastery
and Yeosu Diocese directly.

442
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,053
According to the petition,

443
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,288
the priest is a former agent,

444
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,725
who was sent to many countries
in the 2000s, including Syria, Pakistan,

445
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,826
and Uyrkistan,

446
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,630
and was known as a brutal killer
even within his team.

447
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,032
In the 2007 Uyrkistan operation,

448
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,634
he was said to have thrown an explosive

449
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,903
at dozens of local children

450
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,005
in order to target the rebel forces

451
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,074
who had been hiding within.

452
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,010
There has been even more controversy
due to the pictures

453
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,578
proving his assertions.

454
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,980
The Catholics who had attended his masses

455
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,249
and listened to his sermons,

456
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,052
as well as other Catholics
around the nation--

457
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,257
Gosh.

458
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:50,695
His life is a complete tsunami,
just like his name.

459
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,534
Why do you think we're here?

460
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,104
We are here to keep justice.

461
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,774
We need to drive out the fake priest
from Gudam-gu.

462
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,143
We need to drive out the fake church.

463
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,347
These people right here
are the actual devils,

464
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,983
deluding the world and deceiving people!

465
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,284
-Woo-ta!
-Woo-ta!

466
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,385
Woo-ta!

467
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,355
-Woo-ta! Woo-ta!
-Woo-ta! Woo-ta!

468
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,157
-Woo-ta!
-Woo-ta!

469
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,792
Over there,

470
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,195
we see the fake priest
who killed 11 children coming out.

471
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,599
MURDERER PRIEST LEAVE THE EARTH!

472
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,634
What do you think you're doing?

473
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,169
Put that away immediately!

474
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,771
How dare you shout at us?

475
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,506
You devils!

476
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,709
He killed those children without mercy,

477
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,079
yet he still became a priest
and deceived everyone!

478
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,914
Who are you calling a killer?

479
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,483
It was an inevitable incident
while he was serving the country!

480
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,318
Yes, and when did he deceive anyone?

481
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,120
Father has never deceived anyone!

482
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,523
"Serving the country"?

483
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,425
More like committing homicide.

484
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:58,029
He's a monster who kills for fun!

485
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,400
Father. Tell them it isn't so.

486
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,572
See? He can't say anything back.

487
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,509
This man is a total fake, everyone!

488
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,046
You devils! How dare you?

489
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,555
You're a murderer!

490
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:24,956
Die!

491
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,726
-How could you?
-You murderer!

492
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,330
-You!
-Please stop!

493
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:33,998
-Stop that!
-How could you?

494
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,541
Father.

495
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,911
Yes?

496
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,249
About today...

497
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,420
There's no need to seek comfort
in the Lord.

498
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,226
You have many others to seek comfort from.

499
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,796
I may not be that comforting,
but I'm here, as well.

500
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,532
I don't want to burden you...

501
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,636
With my pains.

502
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,706
Pain may make you cry,

503
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,711
but they can also help you find a new way.

504
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,015
You also helped me

505
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,718
find a new way

506
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,520
with my pains.

507
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,224
And you even accompanied me.

508
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,931
But I still have

509
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,469
11 children to deal with.

510
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,674
I'm sure those children

511
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,379
have already forgiven you in heaven.

512
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,215
Even then,

513
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,952
it doesn't change the fact
that I killed them.

514
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,821
Why don't you try putting your beliefs

515
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,595
in something else that won't change?

516
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,935
You may be hot-tempered,

517
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,038
but you're the most warm-hearted person.

518
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,107
You like slightly burnt fried eggs,

519
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:27,045
steaming hot king-sized dumplings,
and oranges.

520
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,382
You also enjoy sitting
on top of the kimchi fridge, like a cat.

521
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,720
You know how to take in
other people's pains,

522
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,289
stand up for those who are weak,

523
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,394
and do everything you can
to fight injustice.

524
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:48,433
You are the handsome and righteous leader

525
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,301
of Gudam Cathedral.

526
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,238
Those facts won't change for us, either.

527
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,049
Your pains may hurt you,

528
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,354
but there's no need

529
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,689
to pick at old scars

530
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,725
and keep making yourself hurt

531
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,828
because of it.

532
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,964
Not anymore, at least.

533
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,251
It's all right.

534
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,422
We will tell you

535
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,091
our final decision.

536
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:52,130
Father Kim,
you are hereby ordered to missionary work

537
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,066
in Argentina for two years.

538
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,736
What?

539
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:01,205
I'm sure I told you
when you were admitted.

540
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,409
I warned you that you will have to be
more than careful.

541
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,211
I still have a lot left to do in Gudam-gu.

542
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,814
And Father Lee's case
is being reinvestigated

543
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,915
under the pope's commands.

544
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,583
That will also come to an end.

545
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,751
"An end"?

546
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,356
I am going to reinvestigate the case
and reveal the truth.

547
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,659
Please reconsider it.

548
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,228
Don't forget about the pledge you took
when you were admitted.

549
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:25,930
This has to do

550
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,332
with the honor of our order.

551
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,467
I'm sure

552
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,270
you will obey my words.

553
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,648
Is it difficult to overturn the decision?

554
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,716
It's the church's decision,

555
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,320
so we must follow.

556
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,657
But how can you just let him leave?

557
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,159
Every encounter ends with a farewell.

558
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,397
But this is a bit

559
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,366
too much.

560
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,128
How did you know?

561
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,830
What other place would you have to go?

562
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,405
I heard you're leaving.

563
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,209
Are you happy, now that no one will be

564
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,879
pestering you?

565
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,648
Yes, I am.

566
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,783
I'm incredibly happy.

567
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,822
You know,

568
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,393
I grew up in a messed up family.

569
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,697
My dad was penniless,

570
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,434
but he stood surety for others
and got ripped off.

571
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,706
I studied my ass off.

572
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,409
So I can live a better life.

573
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,613
I don't care about other people.

574
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,017
I only care about myself.

575
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,352
Why would I care about others?

576
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,326
But...

577
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:40,364
I had this sudden feeling

578
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,068
that my past has ruined my future.

579
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,909
It's not something
I was ever concerned about,

580
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,579
but you showed up in my life

581
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,215
and messed everything up.

582
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,254
Anyways,

583
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,424
what I want to say is

584
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:08,926
for you,

585
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,497
your past never ruined your future.

586
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,069
You could've had it bad, like me,

587
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,240
but you were brave enough

588
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,176
and did such a good job so far.

589
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,949
So, wherever you go,

590
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,819
don't be so hard on yourself.

591
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,024
There's no need to feel so guilty.

592
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,226
Stand up straight.

593
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,497
And I'm sure we'll meet again

594
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,568
if we go on with our lives.

595
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,211
Thank you.

596
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,246
Thank you to you, too.

597
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,426
GUDAM DISTRICT DIRECTOR
JEONG DONG-JA

598
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,631
What's going on?

599
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,034
This is the Metro Detective Division.

600
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,002
Ms. Jeong Dong-ja,

601
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,204
you are under arrest
for suspicions on violating

602
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,606
the real-name transaction law,

603
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,608
manipulating accounts,
and raising illegal funds.

604
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,281
This is practically Chief Kang's doing.

605
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,319
He neglected the bank on purpose
to get rid of her.

606
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,387
From the looks of it,

607
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,791
I think they're trying to end it
with Chief Nam and Director Jeong.

608
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,695
So the higher-ups were able
to get out of it?

609
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:54,999
Since we got rid of Congressman Park,
Chief Nam, and Director Jeong,

610
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,035
it's time to go into war with Chief Kang.

611
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,870
Let's get ready.

612
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,139
Yes, sir.

613
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,515
Sir,
Father Kim is being sent to Argentina.

614
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,319
From what I heard,
the higher-ups kicked him out.

615
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,759
Goodness, so this is how it ends.

616
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,262
I was starting to grow fond of him, too.

617
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,999
You sure know how to make a deal.

618
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,268
How did you get him kicked out?

619
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,438
That story is his kryptonite.

620
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,942
Does that mean we only have
Hwang Cheol-beom to deal with?

621
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,243
Yes, sir.

622
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,979
I'm afraid
that the dog will keep fighting.

623
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,848
We don't have to be afraid.

624
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,917
Feed him some meat and coax him in.

625
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,255
It's so stuffy in here!

626
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,768
I love the color.

627
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,839
What should I do?

628
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,309
Gosh, my head hurts.

629
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,714
That's it. The forehead.

630
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,350
That's it.

631
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,721
I got it! The game's over.

632
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:30,928
DEPARTURES

633
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,106
It says your departure
has been prohibited, sir.

634
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,010
-What?
-Could you please check once more?

635
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:49,980
That's what it says, sir.

636
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,384
We need assistance at Gate B.

637
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,353
We will assist him.

638
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,699
This is the Gudam Police Station
violent crimes squad.

639
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,668
We will assist the suspect.

640
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,608
What's going on?

641
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,411
We're on a mission, Saving the Father.

642
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,080
-What are you talking about?
-Why are you taking that off?

643
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,715
It's embarrassing.

644
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,750
-Can't you let me go?
-No way. You're going like this.

645
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,019
-Detective Seo.
-No way, sir.

646
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,956
Just wait until I get out of this.

647
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,427
Okay. Good job.

648
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,832
We saved Father Kim.

649
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:50,174
Think of all the illegal acts
Father carried out

650
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,943
while he was at the station
and issue a warrant.

651
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,712
Write them down now.

652
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:58,349
Anything that comes to mind.
Every single one of it.

653
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,686
Name of crime,
"Damage to the Station's Property."

654
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,625
"Threat Against Police
Using a Sharp Rib Bone."

655
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,528
"Police Assault."

656
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,265
"Scarring a Prosecutor's Forehead
Using a Sharp Tooth."

657
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,969
Blood!

658
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,337
"Prosecutor Assault."

659
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,173
Why?

660
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,110
Why in the world
did you prohibit his departure?

661
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,980
Especially when you have nothing to do
with Father Kim!

662
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,984
You do as I say.

663
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:37,755
Or else, I'm going to tell the press
about you and your sponsor.

664
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,791
I'm going to spit it all out. Got it?

665
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,229
The priest attacked the police

666
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,731
and even left a scar
on Prosecutor Park's forehead.

667
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:50,434
So what does that have to do with you?

668
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:52,903
I...

669
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,340
I'm in love

670
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,410
with Prosecutor Park!

671
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,479
What?

672
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,782
How could he leave a scar
on that pretty forehead?

673
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:07,818
You idiot...

674
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,486
My gosh.

675
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,725
You'd better not say anything,
no matter what. All right?

676
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,493
No matter what.

677
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,763
Take your love somewhere else

678
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,465
and lift the prohibition immediately.

679
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,200
No, sir.

680
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,937
I can't let the priest get away with it.

681
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:29,707
I'm sorry, sir.

682
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,209
Hey!

683
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,446
Why, that idiot... My gosh!

684
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,549
Have they all gone mad?

685
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,051
Yes, sir. We should just end it.

686
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,855
By the way, their pay is a bit higher.

687
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,992
All right, I'll call them in.

688
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,727
Yes, sir.

689
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,032
Gosh, Hae-il.

690
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,301
You're dead, now.

691
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,337
Cheers!

692
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:08,479
Do we finally get to break into
Mr. Hwang's vault now?

693
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,450
You're breaking into a vault?

694
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,154
You're breaking in?

695
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,456
You never mentioned that to me.

696
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,193
Detective Seo?

697
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,730
Yes, well,
he said he's still planning things out.

698
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,432
And I just agreed to go along.

699
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,669
Detective Seo, I think he fooled us again.

700
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:33,570
Again!

701
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,173
What in the world were you thinking?

702
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,708
You're driving me crazy.

703
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,110
I wasn't actually suggesting
we break into the vault.

704
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,781
I meant it's the last resort
to completely finish the cartel.

705
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,215
Oh, then...

706
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:49,053
That's also the Lord's way
of bringing justice, right?

707
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,288
Of course!

708
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,956
Then, I'm in as well.

709
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,792
I don't know how much is in that vault,

710
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,360
but I could even win it all, anyway.

711
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,028
No more gambling, Sister.

712
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,296
Oh, right.

713
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:00,964
Count me in as well.

714
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,334
Even though you always fool us,
we're in as well.

715
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:05,536
I'm in, for sure.

716
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,074
This is driving me crazy.
I shouldn't have brought you back.

717
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:13,010
All right, then.
Let's break into that vault!

718
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,546
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

719
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,448
Bottoms up.

720
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,550
This feels so wrong.

721
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,092
How far did you get?

722
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,593
I'm so exhausted.

723
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,631
It's never-ending.
The vault is too deep in!

724
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,834
No, way. You're almost there,
according to the calculations.

725
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,435
We calculated the whole thing.

726
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,973
Can't we just kill them all
and then collect the money?

727
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,242
It's not that easy.
That's why we chose this method.

728
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,343
Let's just try a bit more.

729
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,679
You can do it, Gojayev.

730
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,815
You crazy old fool!

731
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,033
Thanks for coming.

732
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:30,707
Let's just

733
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,745
end it here, Hae-il.

734
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,730
I need to see you.

735
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:56,033
I thought I told you
I won't be seeing you again?

736
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,601
Get out here!

737
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,904
Gosh, do you miss me that much?

738
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,409
Yes. What is it?

739
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,412
There's something I need to tell you.

740
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:12,182
Could you please visit my office?

741
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,351
-Is it important?
-Yes, ma'am.

742
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,220
It's very important.

743
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,428
-Sister!
-What?

744
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,064
Hello. Where are you going?

745
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,566
I was on my way to a gathering.

746
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,701
Did you go grocery shopping?

747
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,369
I almost forgot.

748
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,204
It's Father Kim's birthday tomorrow.

749
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:37,174
Really? Thank you!

750
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,542
For what?

751
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,510
Never mind. See you.

752
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:41,812
-All right. See you.
-Goodbye.

753
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:46,249
Gosh, I forgot the dumplings!

754
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,186
This is so good.

755
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,487
It's so sweet.

756
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,223
Why are you so late?

757
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,226
I'm sorry. I'll be right back, though.

758
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,161
But you just got here.

759
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,529
It will only take 30 minutes.

760
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,432
I'll bring back some hangover drinks, too.

761
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,268
So, just hang in there.

762
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,408
-Just hang in there
-Just hang in there

763
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,610
Come on!

764
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,712
-And once again,
-And once again,

765
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,715
-I'm drinking. Cheers!
-I'm drinking. Cheers!

766
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,155
I'm a busy woman, you know.

767
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,258
It was something urgent, ma'am.

768
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,493
Make it short.

769
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:33,597
Soon,

770
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,100
all this will be mine.

771
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,302
What?

772
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,771
I don't want all of it, though.

773
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,473
I want to split it half and half

774
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,609
with you, ma'am.

775
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,011
Are you crazy?

776
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,648
No, I'm not. And I'm dead serious.

777
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,785
What if I rat on you?

778
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,188
Ma'am.

779
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,659
Weren't you completely put off

780
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:06,730
the moment he held that gun at you?

781
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,133
This is getting more interesting.

782
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,069
In that case...

783
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,336
Was it that obvious?

784
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,272
It wasn't just obvious.

785
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,874
You were practically cussing
with your face.

786
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,412
Why are you suggesting this to me?

787
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,482
If I want to take care of myself,

788
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,051
I'll need your help, for sure.

789
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,320
I'm sure Mr. Yu and Mr. Lee

790
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,755
have more authority than I do.

791
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,156
They do,

792
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:39,029
but those bastards
will try to kill me soon.

793
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:41,731
And you think I won't?

794
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,201
That's why I'm telling you this.

795
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,771
If you don't team up with me now,

796
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,040
you're going to be in danger as well.

797
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,776
They'll kill me as well?

798
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:53,944
So,

799
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,613
forget about those bastards

800
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,816
and think of me as a comrade.

801
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,120
Then I'll make sure to protect you

802
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,956
and ensure a happy ending.

803
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,627
"A happy ending"?

804
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,234
And you have a plan?

805
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,635
Yes, ma'am.

806
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,937
Will you join me?

807
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,573
Let me hear it first.

808
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,047
That guy you sent over

809
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,049
seemed to know me.

810
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,417
Yes.

811
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:37,787
He came to see you, didn't he?
Did you go over the plans?

812
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:42,025
We may have been in the same team,
but we're different.

813
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,928
He's a killer.

814
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:45,896
He is, isn't he?

815
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,165
They tend to be a bit rough,
like those Americans.

816
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,100
"They"?

817
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,702
I gathered up a lot, just for you.

818
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,709
What are you trying to do
with those killers?

819
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:03,580
If you hurt anyone else--

820
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:04,814
Hey.

821
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,185
You don't have a choice.

822
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,156
Please do me a favor.

823
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,426
Don't hurt anyone else.

824
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,629
Gosh, but too bad.

825
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,231
But you've done

826
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,034
so many things wrong.

827
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,969
I can't just let that slide.

828
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,105
Just take it out on me.

829
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,708
I'll accept it all.

830
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,779
I saw this movie and the main character
was such a know-it-all

831
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,847
that all the other characters died
because of him.

832
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,317
Go.

833
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,333
My goodness!

834
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:11,147
Gosh, how scary.

835
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:14,718
Why is he sitting there like that?

836
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:19,322
Where in the world is Father?

837
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,266
That's why you end up eating a lot.

838
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:30,667
It's just really good.

839
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:33,503
-It's not your fault.
-Come one.

840
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,706
Father Kim.

841
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,008
Where are you, Father?

842
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,543
Where are you, Detective Gu?

843
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:43,113
Stop drinking
and make sure to keep focused.

844
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,782
I said, stop drinking!

845
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,285
I can't hear you. It's too loud in here.

846
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,954
-Just hurry up, will you?
-Tell him to come.

847
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,423
We need to share the meat.

848
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,725
What is he saying?
I can't hear a thing he's saying.

849
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,663
Don't drink my shot.

850
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,098
-I need to use the restroom.
-All right.

851
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,034
Don't throw up. It's a waste of alcohol.

852
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,168
-It's a waste.
-Yes.

853
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,304
Gosh, this is so good.

854
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,957
FATHER KIM

855
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,633
Damn it!

856
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,805
Yes, Father?

857
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,941
I guess they're not picking up
because they're busy drinking.

858
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,576
-Where are you right now?
-What?

859
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,046
-I'm alone outside.
-I said, where?

860
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,781
I'm by the eatery alley at Samdoo--

861
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:53,783
Excuse me, sir.

862
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,904
Detective Seo?

863
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,943
Who the hell is this?

864
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,445
Why don't you hurry up and come, Hae-il?

865
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,821
Hey, wait up.

866
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,859
What's taking Detective Heo so long?

867
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:36,993
Maybe he's taking a dump.

868
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,335
Ik-gu!

869
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,037
Are you taking a dump, Detective Heo?

870
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,340
Captain!

871
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,113
What do you think you're doing?

872
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:17,734
Wait!

873
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:30,680
Are you the one who beat up my friend?

874
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,279
No...

875
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,883
No!

876
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,430
Seung-a! Wake up!

877
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,831
Seung-a!

878
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:37,780
You bastard!

879
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,150
Who do you think you are?

880
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,539
