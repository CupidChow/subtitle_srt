1
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,620
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,955
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,857
This situation makes me a bit angry.

4
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,492
You agreed to take a punch from me, right?

5
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,560
It's time for you to take it.

6
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:30,430
This is wild.

7
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,501
It was the funniest thing I heard
in the past 10 years.

8
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,970
Mr. Hwang. Father!

9
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,972
You can't do this here.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,040
Stay out of it.

11
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,208
No, no. You can be the referee.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,844
My goodness.

13
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,948
I wouldn't be able to sleep well
after I beat up a priest.

14
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,317
I will make sure you sleep well.

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,388
You are better than this.

16
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,291
Now that you removed the Roman collar,
my guilt went away a bit.

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,061
Let's begin, referee.

18
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,730
Fight.

19
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,199
What? You come.

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,848
Did you use to throw punches for a living?

21
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,049
What do you take me for?

22
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,584
I'm not some rascal like you.

23
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,954
I haven't been punched liked that
in a while. I feel refreshed.

24
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,390
Here we go again.

25
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,660
-What took you so long?
-Oh, my.

26
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,695
Stop.

27
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,063
Stop the game.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,334
-Goodness, thanks.
-Oh, yes.

29
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,335
Father.

30
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,571
Don't give me some lame excuse

31
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,339
like I was saved by the people.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,974
When's the rematch?

33
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,576
Whenever you want to die.

34
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,284
-Let's hurry.
-This way.

35
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,154
-Let's go.
-Look at this.

36
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,422
-That's not true.
-Goodness.

37
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,656
-Oh, my.
-Isn't this great?

38
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,358
-I'm so jealous.
-Yes.

39
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,197
Did you get in fights a lot
when you were little?

40
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,433
You were pretty good back there.

41
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,735
I could feel you were experienced.

42
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,237
I was just blindly punching.

43
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,406
Then you wouldn't have
been able to hit him even once.

44
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,609
That guy used to be a professional boxer.

45
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,612
I heard he had never been beaten
when it comes to one-on-one fights.

46
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,814
You're a cop and you believe the stories
told by thugs?

47
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,158
Damn it.

48
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,592
It's this way. Where are you going?

49
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,361
Why are you going back there again?

50
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,997
You are an unenlightened being

51
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:48,168
and your ignorance turned into cellulite
and settled in your abdomen.

52
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,504
-Woo-ta.
-The enlightened being's touch

53
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,275
will remove the cellulite
tissue by tissue.

54
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,413
-It hurts.
-Enlightenment!

55
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,482
Woo-ta!

56
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,652
I'm so sorry.

57
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,057
Father, have some manners.

58
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,059
For goodness' sake.

59
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,562
Sister, could you please
wait outside for a bit?

60
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,398
Sister. Come this way
for the meridian massage donation.

61
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,033
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

62
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,975
You don't seem to be
seeking enlightenment.

63
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,743
-What brings you here--
-Hey, cult leader.

64
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,111
What?

65
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,348
These frauds haven't improved one bit.
At least try to make it believable.

66
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,817
Fraud? How could you be
so rude to our leader--

67
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,918
Oh, my!

68
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,889
-Father.
-Why that little...

69
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,927
You're being rude
to the head of a religious group.

70
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,729
I don't behave myself
when I'm with cult people.

71
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,931
You guys on the same level as Satan.

72
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:52,999
Satan?

73
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,871
How does my face look like
that of a cult leader or Satan?

74
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,975
I don't believe in faces.
I believe in impressions. And you...

75
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,678
are just what I think you are.

76
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,181
Father, about what you just said,

77
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,852
I will officially file a complaint
at the diocese.

78
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,055
Suit yourself.

79
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,295
Here's my warning.

80
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,464
Don't even dare dream
about running the orphanage.

81
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,668
And don't you teach those kids
your cult bullshit. Got it?

82
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,436
Next time, it won't be just words.

83
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,272
I warned you.

84
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,045
What?

85
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,914
Snow White, eat this apple.

86
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,186
Oh.

87
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,089
"Oh"?

88
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,157
I get it.

89
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,694
It's the woman that gave
a poisoned apple to Snow White.

90
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,029
That was it.

91
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,930
Do something about them, Prophet Ki.

92
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,232
Cult bullshit?

93
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,701
I will indeed do something
about those imbeciles.

94
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,771
I will give them
a thunderbolt of enlightenment!

95
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:09,075
Woo-ta!

96
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,979
What's with the grumpy look?

97
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,915
Go on and rampage
through the whole Gudam District.

98
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,550
Why don't you just dig into everything?

99
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,218
I will.

100
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,454
Wait.

101
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,324
Are you being mad at me now?

102
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,460
How dare can I be mad at you, Father?

103
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,829
From now on, I won't disturb you
and just be your guide.

104
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,297
A guide?

105
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,302
-Are you sulking now?
-No, I'm not.

106
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,870
Your eyes say you're sulky.

107
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,372
That's just how my eyes look.

108
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,140
I always got hit
by teachers because of that.

109
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,009
I was just looking,
but they thought I was glaring.

110
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,277
I got slapped every day.

111
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,912
Damn it.

112
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:46,979
"Damn it"?

113
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,049
You might have been annoyed by what I did,

114
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,819
but I made all the fuss to protect you.

115
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,287
What fuss?

116
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,556
Also, did you actually do that for me?

117
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,157
I did.

118
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,126
But you wouldn't listen to me at all.

119
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,728
What do I do about it?

120
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,832
What the...

121
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:06,999
Hey, Detective Gu.

122
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,735
He's being ridiculous. Come here.

123
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,470
Hey!

124
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,543
Could you order
mapo tofu with rice for me?

125
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,213
I want to eat something greasy.

126
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,248
-Okay.
-For me, oyster jjamppong.

127
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,384
What would you like to have, Detective?

128
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,618
She's good.

129
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,990
You need to stop testing
my patience, okay?

130
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,159
Tell me how you knew about the witnesses.

131
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,428
Otherwise, you can't leave here today.

132
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,330
The information is from my informant.

133
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,966
I have known the informant
since I became an officer.

134
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,002
Detective Seo Seung-a.

135
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,271
Human should not be cautious

136
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,874
only when they typed a wrong password
four times in a row.

137
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,343
You always need to be cautious.
Especially now.

138
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,312
Otherwise, you'll be in big trouble.

139
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,047
My answer won't change,

140
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,984
and I can't tell you
about the informant's background.

141
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,452
Hey!

142
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,401
For crying out loud.

143
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,805
So much stress.

144
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,974
You can go now.

145
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,377
NO BREACH OF DUTY IN GUDAM POLICE STATION

146
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,148
So where did you say
you got the information?

147
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,951
I told her the truth.
I said I got it from an informant.

148
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:32,952
And she believed that?

149
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,354
Of course, that's how I got back

150
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,125
Are you sure
you're not hiding anything from me?

151
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,993
I'm not hiding anything.

152
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,865
It's not something
informants can so easily find out.

153
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,967
Well, this informant is very competent.

154
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,138
Detective Seo.
Don't hide anything from me, okay?

155
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,542
Then I can't help you
if anything goes wrong.

156
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,179
Even if something goes wrong,
I won't ask for your help.

157
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,182
Hey, you're my partner.
Of course I'll help.

158
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,519
No. Just stay there.

159
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,087
I'll take care of everything.

160
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,362
Hey, wait. That little punk.

161
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,832
So the person who sent her the location

162
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,969
is Father Kim Hae-il?

163
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,070
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,074
You should have checked
Detective Seo's phone as soon as she came.

165
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,909
I'm sure she deleted everything
before she came.

166
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,410
You can tell she's thorough like that.

167
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,947
But how did he manage to track them down?

168
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,483
He doesn't work for the government.

169
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,619
Could it be that one of the church members
is a hacker?

170
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,356
He's a priest. How does he have access
to this kind of stuff?

171
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,824
Should we summon Father Kim?

172
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,060
He violated National Security Law
and Information Security Law.

173
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,630
Let's just

174
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:52,832
keep it quiet for now.

175
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,167
What? You won't tell the chief prosecutor?

176
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,235
No.

177
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,638
Think about it.

178
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,508
Let's say we caught
both the priest and the hacker.

179
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,012
What if it turns out that the hacker
has a lot of information?

180
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,814
Information that must never be disclosed.

181
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,516
-What?
-What is that?

182
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,018
You know, something like

183
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,855
scandalous video clips
of high-level government officials.

184
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,758
-Something like that.
-Oh my gosh.

185
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,260
I'm wearing arm warmers,
but I still got goosebumps.

186
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,399
If that really happens,
we will all be screwed.

187
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,001
Everyone here will be screwed.

188
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,904
You're indeed intuitive.

189
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,875
Actually, I had a weird gut feeling too.

190
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,011
-So do as I say first.
-Yes, ma'am.

191
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,414
Can I have some soup
from oyster jjamppong?

192
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,715
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,594
Here.

194
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,564
What sort of person is so stubborn?

195
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,334
She stood there for four hours.

196
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,672
Father.

197
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,608
Father.

198
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,411
I was right, wasn't I?
It was a cult, right?

199
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,680
He was even working with Hwang Cheol-beom.

200
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,682
Hwang Cheol-beom?

201
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,951
He came to church every Sunday,

202
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,753
but he was actually a member of Maegakkyo.

203
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,922
What an evil man he is.

204
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,391
How could he go this far
to recruit people to a cult?

205
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,792
I can't believe this.

206
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,561
He did all that to recruit more people.

207
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,996
-Gosh.
-Unbelievable.

208
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,065
Excuse me.

209
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,470
So you two think that's the reason

210
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,939
why he's trying to
take over the orphanage?

211
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,047
Goodness, what happened?

212
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,649
Hey, be gentle.

213
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,183
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes.

214
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,818
Did something happen?

215
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,856
Given the level
of your martial arts skills,

216
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,458
you would never get beaten up by someone.

217
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,726
Did you fall?

218
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,663
What if I did get beaten up by someone?

219
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,631
Why would you say that?

220
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,767
Only beasts and well-trained assassins

221
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,637
will be able to attack you.

222
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,807
Beast, my ass. You idiot.

223
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,008
Here.

224
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,310
-Let's drink.
-Yes, sir.

225
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,312
Here we go.

226
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,981
-Beom!
-Beom!

227
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,082
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

228
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,955
Your food is here.

229
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,424
Hi. Please put it here.

230
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,428
Honey, our jjajangmyeon is here.
Come and eat.

231
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,033
-That would be 22,000 won.
-22,000 won?

232
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,438
-Hurry up.
-Here you go.

233
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,972
Hey, take this.

234
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,611
SEONGWONGAK

235
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,816
Gosh, I almost wet myself.

236
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,351
Thank you.

237
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,624
Hey, did you think I didn't recognize you?

238
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,861
I have eyes on my back.

239
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,131
Can you see my eyes
on the back of my head?

240
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,366
Yes.

241
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,068
-You can?
-Yes.

242
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,638
No, I can't.

243
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,840
-You can't?
-No.

244
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,575
-You can't?
-No, I can't.

245
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,345
Say, "Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers."

246
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,482
-Say it!
-"Peter Piper

247
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,217
picked a peck of pickled peppers.

248
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,019
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked."

249
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,993
Bye.

250
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,333
What the hell?

251
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,206
"Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers!

252
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:59,245
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked"!

253
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,382
Oh, no. I need to drive carefully.

254
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,584
DISTRICT DIRECTOR,
POLICE STATION CHIEF, ASSEMBLYMAN

255
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,920
Listen carefully.
I will say this only once.

256
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,589
They are evil bastards.

257
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,124
Father.

258
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,894
Bad birds, you mean.

259
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:20,099
Sure, why not? They're "bad birds."

260
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,134
And this is our orphanage.

261
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,637
And this is the foundation
the "bad birds" are trying to establish.

262
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,606
The "bad birds" have a lot of dirty money.
What is dirty money?

263
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,141
-Bribe.
-Kickback.

264
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,676
-Speculation.
-And so on.

265
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,245
That's right. Excellent.

266
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,748
You already know what it is,
so I won't write it down.

267
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,518
The "bad birds" need a way
to launder the dirty money.

268
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,654
That's why they're establishing
the foundation.

269
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,722
Then who establishes the foundation?

270
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,724
That's a good question. Look.

271
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,026
HWANG CHEOL-BEOM, MAEGAKKYO

272
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,093
On the surface,

273
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,262
Hwang Cheol-beom and Maegakkyo are
establishing it.

274
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,364
In other words,
they're the one taking actions.

275
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,401
Oh, my. Those children of Satan.

276
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,670
Once the money is laundered
through the foundation,

277
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,306
the money will get clean
and they will use it however they want.

278
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,242
Bingo. Excellent.

279
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,079
As you said, once the money is laundered
through the foundation,

280
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,881
they can use it however they want.

281
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,016
They don't care
about the orphanage at all.

282
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,818
But...

283
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,422
But if they're committing
such an obvious crime,

284
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,123
why aren't they caught?

285
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,793
That's a very textbook question.

286
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,961
Listen, Sister.

287
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,296
The foundation
the "bad birds" are trying to establish is

288
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,099
supported by the district director,
police station chief, and the congressman.

289
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,602
They are in this together,
so no one gets caught.

290
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,604
Those evil sons of...

291
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,573
What did I just say?

292
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,309
Those "bad birds".

293
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,478
My goodness.

294
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,150
Leaving the foundation issue aside,
now our business is expanding,

295
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,586
so we must make sure
everything is under control.

296
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,155
But so many random things
have been happening recently.

297
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,157
Especially that man. Who is he?

298
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,860
The weird priest.
He's the biggest problem.

299
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,296
And there's also a kid who is hospitalized

300
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,331
after eating food from the orphanage.

301
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:03,102
So I've been thinking. Could you find us

302
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,770
a new family member

303
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,274
who can take care of all the problems
in Gudam District?

304
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,409
Not someone like Mr. Hwang.

305
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,612
Someone who can handle it
in a smart and legal way.

306
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,814
Well.

307
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,284
Mr. Hwang's methods

308
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,719
do come with a lot of risk.

309
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:23,923
Come on in.

310
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,725
Hello.

311
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,929
You know her. The national celebrity.

312
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,130
District Director Jeong Dong-ja.

313
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,599
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Prosecutor Park Gyeong-seon.

314
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,733
I'm Jeong Dong-ja.

315
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,503
Please have a seat.

316
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,340
-Have a drink.
-Thank you, sir.

317
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,316
I've heard a lot about you.

318
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,052
You're one beautiful woman.

319
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,219
Thank you, ma'am.

320
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,488
Did you find out who the informant was?

321
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,057
The detective was right.

322
00:15:58,857 --> 00:15:59,858
What?

323
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,194
So there was really an informant?

324
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,664
It's a hacker she caught
soon after she's become a detective.

325
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,733
We checked his background too.

326
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,303
This country is too good with technology.

327
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,206
I can't believe we let
such a small shot get the best of us.

328
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,908
I'll arrest him

329
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,943
and accuse him of violating
the security laws.

330
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,645
I'll teach him a proper lesson.

331
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,981
Okay. You take care of it.

332
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,182
Yes, sir.

333
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,557
You should join
me and Ms. Jeong another time.

334
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,092
Yes, sir.

335
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,395
Enjoy your meal.

336
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,598
-I'll see you again.
-Yes, ma'am.

337
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,002
Enjoy.

338
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,771
He called me over during dinner time,

339
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,606
and yet he didn't offer any food.

340
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,245
That red sea bream looked delicious.

341
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,483
She's the person who sometimes
takes care of our business, right?

342
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,587
Now I see her in person,
I like her even more.

343
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,056
She's smart and competent.

344
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,259
How about having her
as a new family member?

345
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,727
I'd love that

346
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,663
but let me tame her once more.

347
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,899
Then I'll let you know.

348
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,000
"Tame her"?

349
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,779
You read that kind of book too?

350
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,914
You might not have known,

351
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,150
but I majored in astrophysics.

352
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,918
-Astrophysics?
-Oh, you know.

353
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,521
Really?

354
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,123
You should be looking at stars.
Why are you dealing with barcodes here?

355
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,526
Well, it's pure science,
so it's not easy to find a job.

356
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,061
Then why don't you get a job

357
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,695
that isn't necessarily
related to your major?

358
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,931
I'm already working in my field.

359
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,132
What?

360
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,501
If the celestial bodies
are the great universe,

361
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,504
the world humans live in
is the small universe.

362
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,239
Each human is a star.

363
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:58,444
And I'm studying the stars every day,
one by one.

364
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,547
While scanning the barcodes.

365
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,615
That will be 1,800 won.

366
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,053
Then what kind of a star am I?

367
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,324
Tell me.

368
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,927
Antares.

369
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:16,862
Antares?

370
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,498
It's also known as Alpha Scorpii.

371
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,433
It's 700 times as big as the Sun,

372
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,668
15 times as heavy as the Sun,

373
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,436
and 10,000 times as bright as the Sun.

374
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,338
In China, it's called

375
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,874
The Big Fire.

376
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,009
The Big Fire.

377
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,215
So you're saying I'm fiery, short-tempered

378
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,983
and mean. Is that what you mean?

379
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,551
That's not what I meant.

380
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,121
It means you're that passionate.

381
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,856
In your heart, you have something...

382
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,592
Something like...

383
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,328
Exactly.

384
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,398
Fine. That's how you've been seeing me.

385
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,100
You scanned the barcode, right?

386
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,236
"The big fire" is heading off.

387
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,274
I should have said moon. It's normal.

388
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,486
Hello.

389
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,961
I heard you and the new detective
filmed an action movie in Gapyeong.

390
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,530
Words spread so quickly.

391
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,166
You must know
our witnesses were taken away too.

392
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,535
Maybe they're being protected,
and you misunderstood it?

393
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,704
"Protect"? "Misunderstood"?

394
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,174
Even you should be ashamed
at what happened this time.

395
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,542
Me?

396
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,178
I know you're ashamed.

397
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,146
Think about it. You must be.

398
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,448
Think about it. You must be ashamed.

399
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,716
Forget it.

400
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,421
If you want to do an investigation,
do it properly.

401
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,025
You act like you will fight
every evil in the world.

402
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,760
But you always show your cards

403
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:55,861
and mess up.

404
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,230
Seriously, you seem worthless, Father.

405
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,165
Mess up? Did you say I mess up?

406
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,601
What else did I mess up?

407
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,636
You messed up things today too.

408
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,975
What if the Pope suddenly comes
and checks the progress?

409
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,278
What if he says,
"What have you done until now?"

410
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,581
How dare you
sarcastically mention the Pope.

411
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,319
I'm not being sarcastic.

412
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,722
I'm just really frustrated. That's all.

413
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,725
You're such a potato man.

414
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,162
Potato?

415
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,600
Yo-han.

416
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,735
What does potato man mean?

417
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,303
A man who is dull like a potato.

418
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,711
I gave him advice, and he should take it.

419
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,179
Why won't he listen?

420
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,616
He is indeed lost now. Am I wrong?

421
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,951
And...

422
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,388
Why is he wearing slippers
with bare feet in this cold weather?

423
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,390
Does he think
he's Barefoot Ki-bong or what?

424
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,063
This is the last time
I give you a chance, Father.

425
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,599
Seriously, this is the last time.

426
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,436
You're all smiling there,
but I won't cut you slack.

427
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,340
Gosh, it stinks.

428
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,042
Damn it.

429
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,083
So much stress.

430
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,122
Evidence at the crime scene failed.

431
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,990
The primary investigation failed.

432
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,794
Autopsy failed.

433
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,895
Two witnesses...

434
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,266
Damn those assholes.

435

00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,374
THE PROSECUTION CLAIMS
THE INVESTIGATION WAS FAIR

443
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,691
Dear Lord.

444
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,361
Please let me catch one of them.

445
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,498
It doesn't have to be more than one.

446
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,166
Let me catch just one of them.

447
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,437
SEONGWONGAK

448
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,872
Seriously.

449
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:58,610
Why won't anyone listen to me?

450
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,811
Why?

451
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,047
Songsak, I'm heading off.

452
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,449
Okay. Goodbye, sir.

453
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,684
Make sure to turn off the lights.

454
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:06,852
Yes, sir.

455
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,824
WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY

456
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,693
What is it?

457
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,502
Thank you.

458
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,971
Dumplings.

459
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,739
You were in the ROTC?

460
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,408
Where did you get it?

461
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,878
A regular customer here gave it to me.

462
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,346
It's a girl.

463
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:35,981
WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY

464
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,048
From this university.

465
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,422
Do you want this too?

466
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,657
I don't want it.

467
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,359
Go away, you idiot.

468
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,728
I heard you were

469
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,696
an amazing detective.

470
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,899
Yo-han from the store said that.

471
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,836
What a talkative punk.

472
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:03,508
I want to protect people too.

473
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,679
I want to be a cool man
who protect people like you.

474
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,881
Cool, my ass.

475
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,883
Are you making fun of me?

476
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,785
No, I'm not.

477
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,520
I mean it.

478
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,489
Fine.

479
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,958
Stop the bullshit and bring more soup.

480
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,494
Let me give you all the leftovers.

481
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,728
Wait here.

482
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,937
Those guys know how to piss me off
in a creative way.

483
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,305
How creative.

484
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,113
You don't know what hell is like, do you?

485
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,116
Limb-cutting stools?

486
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,586
Fire and brimstone?

487
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,521
No.

488
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,190
No.

489
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,393
It's to be born again

490
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,263
exactly as you are now.

491
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:01,066
And to live the exact same life.

492
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,101
You will repeat

493
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,036
the stupid idiot's life

494
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,874
endlessly!

495
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,757
Repeatedly.

496
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,607
Is there any place
where I can feel comfortable?

497
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,343
A place where I can be at peace

498
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,212
even if I don't do anything.

499
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,407
Goodness!

500
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,208
Why are you here?

501
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,185
I was praying

502
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,588
and thinking.

503
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,022
But you don't believe in God.

504
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,657
You're acting weird.

505
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,927
Don't we all feel like
going to a church or a temple

506
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:40,265
about once a year.

507
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,034
Is church a resort or something?

508
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,235
You want to come once a year?

509
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,637
I come, and you scold me.

510
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,539
I leave, and you scold me.

511
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,407
You scold me no matter what I do.

512
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,912
Father, the breakfast is ready.

513
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:55,880
Okay.

514
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,515
You startled me.

515
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,786
You haven't eaten yet?

516
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,702
Church food is just as delicious
as temple food.

517
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,205
Who eats two bowls of rice in the morning?

518
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,140
Pay for the food before you leave.

519
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,110
Don't you know how many times
I bought you food? I'll eat a lot.

520
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,779
It's on us. Please help yourself.

521
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,883
What is that you did for us?
You've got some nerve.

522
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,587
Just let him eat in peace.

523
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,189
I'm okay.

524
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,791
My father used to slap me when we eat,

525
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,426
but I ate well anyway.

526
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,130
I see. That's why your face is...

527
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,402
Don't touch my fried egg!

528
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,107
You should have told me.
I'm terribly sorry.

529
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,310
Just take one.

530
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,745
Hey!

531
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,760
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

532
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,199
-Look.
-We should always be careful.

533
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,903
ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHANGE IN PERSONNEL

534
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:28,139
SPECIAL TEAM PROSECUTOR PARK GYEONG-SEON

535
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,411
CHUNCHEON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

536
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,246
AS OF THE FOLLOWING DAY

537
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,155
I couldn't do anything about it.

538
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,224
It was a direct order
from the chief prosecutor.

539
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,528
I admit that I made one mistake.

540
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,964
-But because of that one mistake--
-I know.

541
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,267
That's what the chief prosecutor is like.

542
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,503
He's brutally merciless.

543
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,673
Didn't he say he would block
some wind for me?

544
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,774
Prosecutor Park.

545
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,711
This meth incident isn't just some wind.
It's a giant hurricane.

546
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,179
Didn't you know that?

547
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,222
Hang in there for now.

548
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,858
Think of it as a break.

549
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,373
TODAY'S SCHEDULE: SAVINGS DAY 22:00

550
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,413
It was written, "as of the following day".

551
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,582
It means I have to be
in Yeongwol tomorrow.

552
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,651
Where should I go when I go to Yeongwol?

553
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,521
Is there a place there
that can comfort my pissed self?

554
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,356
Cheongnyeongpo.

555
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,159
It's where Danjong lived in exile.

556
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,361
You're unbelievable.

557
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,465
I'm going to be exiled
and you want me to go to a place of exile?

558
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,133
I'm sorry, ma'am.

559
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,735
Get me some boxes so I can pack.

560
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,673
You could have had coffee in church.

561
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,075
Do you really have to come outside
to drink coffee?

562
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,811
They only have
instant coffee mix in church.

563
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,647
Gosh, my money. My blood.

564
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,248
I saw you paid with the membership points.

565
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,117
You don't get points for free.

566
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,419
I got them from buying a lot of coffee.

567
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,256
Here are the two Americanos you ordered.

568
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,693
Where are we going today?

569
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,262
This coffee has a nice sour taste.

570
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,431
Level with me.

571
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,166
What?

572
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,703
You're lost, right?

573
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,572
You don't know what to do, right?

574
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,207
I know.

575
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,609
You've done everything you could.

576
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,078
No one will criticize you
even if you give up now.

577
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,980
What are you saying?
I haven't even gotten started.

578
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:50,682
Pardon?

579
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,250
You need to do something for me.

580
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,786
Let's go to Seoul!

581
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,323
Anytime.

582
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,691
I will do anything for you.

583
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,674
Damn it.

584
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,177
Sir! Sir.

585
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:20,945
Please stop.

586
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,691
Only beasts

587
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,960
and well-trained assassins

588
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,830
will be able to attack you.

589
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,100
No way.

590
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,470
It can't be.

591
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,175
Jang Ryong.

592
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,443
Yes, sir.

593
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,612
Call Night Mole in Mullae-dong

594
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,981
and have him run a background check
on Father Kim.

595
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,116
That crazy priest?

596
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,718
Yes. And not just any background check.

597
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,420
I want everything he can find on him.

598
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,189
And if tries to make a deal,

599
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:06,891
tell him I will kill him.

600
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,495
I'll make sure we settle
at a reasonable price.

601
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,464
Oh, right.
And are you ready for the Savings Day?

602
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,866
Yes, we are all ready, sir.

603
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,740
One kills cows

604
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,110
while the other eats steak.

605
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,551
What?

606
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:34,986
A briefing?

607
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,021
District Director Jeong Dong-ja,
Chief Nam Seok-gu,

608
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,523
Congressman Park Won-mu. Gosh, it's hot.

609
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,427
And Hwang Cheol-beom.
Tell me everything about them.

610
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,730
Why do you need a briefing about them

611
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,532
for Father Lee's case?

612
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,400
Because they are all related.

613
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,136
We need to do a shakedown on them
to find evidence. You know that.

614
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,939
Watch what you say.
What do you mean, a shakedown?

615
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,075
You're a priest.
You shouldn't be talking like that.

616
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,777
"Shakedown" is a word
you can even find in a dictionary.

617
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,280
And you said earlier
that you would do anything I say.

618
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,649
You're talking about personal details
of high-profile personnel.

619
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,717
That's not right.

620
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,122
I'll give you food.

621
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,256
Pardon?

622
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,994
For the next month, I will let you
eat one meal a day in church.

623
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,097
You're unbelievable.

624
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,967
Do I look like a beggar to you?

625
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,203
District Director Jeong Dong-ja.

626
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,506
An extremely competent self-made woman.

627
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,608
She started as a grade-nine civil servant

628
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,210
and has become a secretary,

629
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,278
serving three district directors in total.

630
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,248
She has an incredible sense of politics
and charisma.

631
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,484
So she must know very well
about Gudam District.

632
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,518
Of course.

633
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,022
She knows everything about Gudam District.

634
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,490
She knows who owns which business

635
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,192
and what's going on
on every single alley of the district.

636
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,495
Come inside and join us.

637
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,596
What?

638
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,234
Have you been eavesdropping?

639
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,435
Yes.

640
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,172
Not only did I eavesdrop
but also I recorded it.

641
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,010
The relationship
between Ms. Jeong and Mr. Hwang?

642
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,379
They're just a district director
and a local worthy.

643
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,547
A sworn brother and sister.

644
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,716
They call each other by first names
on unofficial occasions

645
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,985
and they often express their loyalty.

646
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,453
How do you know that?

647
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,221
I did some investigation myself too.

648
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,823
I take my words back
about the church food.

649
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,658
Come on. I was going to say that too.

650
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,528
It's a back-scratching relationship
between a corrupted politician and a thug.

651
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,496
Yes, I'm aware. They're closely linked.

652
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,765
Any details about Hwang Cheol-beom?

653
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,336
He's from an orphanage.

654
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,039
At the age of 20,
he's become a famous gangster in Yeosu.

655
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,108
He was the underboss
of the X Gang in Yeosu

656
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,943
until he moved to Gudam District
seven years ago.

657
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,311
You asshole!

658
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,647
He had his first breakthrough

659
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,016
with adult entertainment establishments
and construction business.

660
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,785
Then three years ago,
he founded Daebeom Trading.

661
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,488
If it's a trading company,

662
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,323
he must have committed
all kinds of illegal stuff.

663
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,860
Ripping off of other companies,
managing the Russian district,

664
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,495
and sometimes used his men instead.

665
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,297
Exactly.

666
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,065
How do you know all that, Father?

667
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,066
Next.

668
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,234
SEOUL GUDAM POLICE STATION

669
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,638
Our chief is from a prestigious family.

670
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,542
Since the Japanese colonial era,
all the family members have been police--

671
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,010
Prestigious, my foot.

672
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,946
They all have been pro-Japanese.

673
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,048
They're basically Japanese.

674
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,816
Enough. Next.

675
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,284
Congressman Park Won-mu.

676
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,019
He's the congressman of the opposing party

677
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,454
that won his third term.

678
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,655
He served in the army.

679
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,992
His main role in the party is
to lead strikes.

680
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,394
His specialty is intermittent fasting.

681
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,064
If he's a congressman,
he should use his brain,

682
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,332
not his body.

683
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,733
Anything special about him?

684
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,635
He was suspected of nine briberies

685
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,737
of four sexual harassments,
of three frauds,

686
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,672
and five physical violences,

687
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,674
but he was acquitted every time.

688
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,177
He's complete trash.

689
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,579
People can hear you from outside.
Please keep it down.

690
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,785
What are you doing?

691
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,455
-Hello.
-What?

692
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,760
Never mind, sir.

693
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,096
Hello, sir.

694
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,733
Damn it.

695
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,806
Oh, my goodness.

696
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,676
Damn it.

697
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,056
You should have been more careful.

698
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,791
Ma'am.

699
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,427
Or should I drop the honorifics now?

700
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,167
I took care
of the Nonhyeon-dong meth case,

701
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,836
so don't worry. Good luck with the exile.

702
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,073
It won't take long until you break down.

703
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,413
Hey!

704
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,750
You fucking asshole.

705
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,419
I guess...

706
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,356
I should knock some sense into you.

707
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,292
-What the...
-Stop there, you asshole!

708
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,129
GUDAM ORPHANAGE CONSIGNMENT DECISION

709
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,214
How could they process it so quickly?

710
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,516
Now, what do we do, Father?

711
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:34,752
We should change their decision.

712
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,688
Once it's stamped by the public officials,
it won't be easy.

713
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,558
Should we ask the Pope again?

714
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,961
We can't bother him again.
He's not a civil service officer.

715
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,498
He's right.
It's not like the Pope is Santa Claus.

716
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,668
We still have one month left
until the transition.

717
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,003
Until then, it's ours.

718
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,605
We will find a way.

719
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,576
Father.

720
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,045
What's the matter?

721
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,815
Eun-ji is...

722
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,251
What about Eun-ji?

723
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:09,887
The doctor said there's no hope

724
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,290
and told us to discharge her
from the hospital.

725
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,126
Oh, dear Lord.

726
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,198
It was about three months ago.

727
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,735
We were having our first lunch
since we changed the foodservice company.

728
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:28,739
The children were having lunch
like any other day.

729
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,977
-But then, some kids started to throw up.
-Are you okay? What's wrong?

730
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,079
-My stomach hurts.
-Ye-bin.

731
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,815
It was because of the rotten food.

732
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,986
And it affected Eun-ji badly.

733
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,122
Other children recovered after a few days,

734
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,858
but as Eun-ji was born
with a weak immune system,

735
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,593
she couldn't fight off the virus.

736
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:53,264
It caused complications
and she's now in a coma.

737
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,967
She needs to get good treatments,

738
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,303
but we can't afford it.

739
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,673
So the hospital wants us to discharge her.

740
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,179
We can't discharge her.

741
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,748
We need to keep her hospitalized.

742
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:16,921
CORRUPT FOODSERVICE COMPANY

743
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,190
THE CEO IS ACQUITTED
FEW LOW-RANK EMPLOYEES PROSECUTED

744
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,595
GROWN-UPS' GREED MIGHT TAKE
A CHILD'S LIFE AWAY

745
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,931
I'm sure the food service company

746
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,567
shirked their responsibility.

747
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,235
We sued them

748
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,071
and told the press about it

749
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,240
but none of that helped.

750
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:41,712
What's the name
of the food service company?

751
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,048
Wangmat Food.

752
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:47,885
Do you know the company?

753
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,221
Well, yes. It's in the neighborhood.

754
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,691
Level with me. What kind of company is it?

755
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,226
Well, they make delicious food

756
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,228
and offer food service to schools.
They do that, right?

757
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,201
Fine.

758
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,237
The CEO of Wangmat Food is

759
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,706
the leader of Maegakkyo,
Ki Yong-mun's nephew.

760
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,940
Whose nephew?

761
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,042
Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I did it again.

762
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,345
Cult. It's a cult.

763
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,721
Is she completely unconscious?

764
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,625
She wakes up from time to time
and makes eye contact.

765
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,461
But only for a short moment.

766
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,602
Right now, she's in condition

767
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,105
where just a cold can lead
to sepsis and death.

768
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,008
If she's in such a dangerous condition,
how can we take her home?

769
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,010
Please continue to prescribe antibiotics

770
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,278
and keep her from illness.

771
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:51,348
Then we need to give her
more effective antibiotics.

772
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,717
And it's pretty costly.

773
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,221
We will pay.

774
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,390
We will pay,

775
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,893
so please make her healthy again.

776
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,965
The kid's life is hanging by a thread
and no one is taking the responsibility.

777
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,903
I'm okay with everything else,

778
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,739
but I can't let them do this to children.

779
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:17,975
I will destroy them.

780
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,514
That old man was
putting himself out all alone

781
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,015
in order to save the girl.

782
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,051
You mean Father Lee?

783
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,687
Who else could it be?

784
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,158
Where are you going now?

785
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,127
Why did they deny Father Lee's petition?

786
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,662
The company already apologized

787
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,831
and accepted
the district office's corrective order.

788
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,767
The food poisoning made a kid
seriously ill. They must take the blame.

789
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,371
We can't blame them
because of one girl's special condition.

790
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,007
Just because other kids are okay
doesn't mean it's okay.

791
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,076
Shouldn't the company
take responsibility for it?

792
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,511
What responsibility?

793
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,580
Did the kid die?

794
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,316
Hey! Come here.

795
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,352
Say that again. What did you just say?

796
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:02,786
Come here and say that again.

797
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,022
-Come here.
-This is a public office!

798
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,225
If something happens to the kid,

799
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,661
you will be the first one I destroy.
Do you get it?

800
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,330
There's nothing we can do here.
Let's go out for now.

801
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:14,498
-Let go of me.
-How dare you...

802
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:15,599
Let go of me.

803
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,303
WANGMAT FOOD IS CHOSEN
AS A SECURE FOOD SERVICE COMPANY

804
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,038
Let go of me.

805
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,642
That's it.

806
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,778
WANGMAT FOOD IS CHOSEN
AS A SECURE FOOD SERVICE COMPANY

807
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,423
What are you doing?

808
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,826
Take it easy.

809
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,163
We only go by principles.
Don't take it out on us.

810
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,198
Principles?

811
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,701
Principles, my foot.

812
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,706
Why don't you respect
humans' principles first?

813
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,310
Damn it.

814
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,948
GUDAM DISTRICT OFFICE

815
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,849
I should have hit him on the Adam's apple.

816
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,953
That rude punk.

817
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,065
THE ONE AND ONLY PRINCIPLE
FOR PUBLIC HYGIENE

818
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,052
Are you showing me number one
because I said I wanted to catch one?

819
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,922
Or does it mean
that I should catch them one by one?

820
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,591
Your message is too ambiguous.

821
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,898
I guess I didn't have enough faith in you.

822
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,268
What are you gibbering about?

823
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,573
Still, a message is a message.

824
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,275
Let's go take down Wangmat Food.

825
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,911
Take down what?

826
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,847
The rotten food service company.

827
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,649
Let's go take down Wangmat Food.

828
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,485
That's random. Why all of a sudden?

829
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,186
What about Father Lee case?

830
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,155
This is about the case. Listen.

831
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,591
That company's CEO's uncle is Ki Yong-mun.

832
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,059
Ki Yong-mun and Mr. Hwang are friends.

833
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,494
Mr. Hwang and Ms. Jeong are close,

834
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,762
and there's Congressman Park too.

835
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,131
Isn't that amazing?

836
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,899
If I catch one of them,

837
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,201
I can catch all of them.

838
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,438
And I can clear Father Lee's name too.

839
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,541
Show me the way to Wangmat Food.

840
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,109
Damn it.

841
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,780
I'm feeling so suffocated.

842
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:44,948
Hurry up!

843
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,051
Gosh, I'm getting frustrated.

844
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:48,819
Hey!

845
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,755
Who told you that you can throw away
the small leftovers?

846
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,392
Eat it, you idiot!

847
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,860
Don't waste the ingredients.

848
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,396
Make the slice thinner.

849
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,266
Hey!

850
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,268
What are you doing now?

851
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,103
Are you going to throw this oil away?

852
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:11,442
Look. Put this in and stir it.

853
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:14,478
Now how does it look?
It looks new, right? Answer me!

854
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,481
What a mess this is.

855
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,116
Don't waste anything, okay?

856
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,584
Don't waste anything!

857
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,457
Put out the cigarette.

858
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,163
-Who...
-Do you use the ash as a spice here?

859
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,364
Put it out now.

860
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,434
You're a priest.

861
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,204
Does being a priest allow you
to make a scene in others' factories?

862
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,506
Put it out.

863
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,574
Go.

864
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,676
I said go, you prick!

865
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,444
Just put the cigarette out!

866
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,447
He's a psycho.

867
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,784
It's been a while.

868
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,152
Just go.

869
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,620
Put it out.

870
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,856
I'll take care of it. This is my factory.

871
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,198
What the hell?

872
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,439
My eyes! Son of a bitch!

873
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,041
You bastard!

874
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:19,910
Hey!

875
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,346
Wait.

876
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:31,088
Choco.

877
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,123
Choco.

878
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,558
Choco? Is that a dog?

879
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,483
Choco.

880
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:19,703
WANGMAT FOOD

881
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,655
Choco.

882
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,258
Oh, no.

883
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,630
I'll give you one more chance
because I'm a priest, not a cop.

884
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,831
So listen carefully.

885
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,367
Admit your wrongdoings

886
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:51,535
and compensate the orphanage

887
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,736
until two days from now at noon.

888
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,038
Call the church when finished.
The number is on the internet.

889
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,406
That's tight.

890
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:57,941
Why don't you give him a week?

891
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,243
Two days are long enough.

892
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:00,978
If you don't do as I said,

893
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,213
I will kill you. Understand?

894
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:05,682
Answer me. Do you understand?

895
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,284
Yes.

896
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,419
You answered,

897
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,022
-so put it back in. Open your mouth.
-No...

898
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,590
Open your mouth.

899
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,061
You'd better not drop it.

900
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,501
Father.

901
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,406
What are you doing here, Yo-han?

902
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,041
I work as a part-timer here.

903
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,143
Are you Forrest Gump?

904
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,811
Whenever something happens, you're there.

905
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,280
I'm sorry. By the way,

906
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,582
why were you fighting earlier?

907
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,284
This place produces rotten food.

908
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,919
That's why.

909
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,390
How could you play with food?
You might kill someone.

910
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,361
Since when are you working here?

911
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,996
I started working here yesterday.

912
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,765
Then you probably don't know much.

913
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:56,667
How many hours do you work?

914
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,002
I work from nine o'clock to six o'clock.

915
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,437
That's not a part-time job.

916
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,239
They should hire you
as a regular employee.

917
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,440
They're trying to save money.

918
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:04,708
Well, then.

919
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,377
If they don't pay you, tell me.

920
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,080
You're so cool. I mean it.

921
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,148
Come on.

922
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:18,488
DAEBEOM TRADING

923
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,363
Hello, sir.

924
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,766
Please get inside.

925
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:31,668
Welcome.

926
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,371
Please go in.

927
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:35,672
Hello.

928
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:38,909
Hello, ma'am.

929
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,617
Savings Day comes around so fast
every month.

930
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,353
I always forget about this day.

931
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,588
For me, it comes slowly.

932
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,824
A month feels like
two or three months to me.

933
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,393
For me, the day before this day

934
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,962
feels like the day before I go on a picnic
when I was young.

935
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,630
Savings Day.

936
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,400
I gave it a pretty clever name.
Don't you think?

937
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,669
I named it like that
so you would anticipate the day.

938
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:09,873
All right. Let's go in.

939
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:11,775
All right.

940
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,411
One,

941
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,781
two, three.

942
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,183
Matching fingerprints.

943
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:28,792
Yes!

944
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,564
Whenever I come here,
I feel like my body becomes healthier.

945
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,600
I don't need any other medicine.

946
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,435
I think my body will become healthier

947
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:41,238
when I see this much more.

948
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,975
Even if it rains gold,

949
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:46,710
I doubt it will satisfy you.

950
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:47,978
Oh, come on.

951
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,189
Thank you for your hard work this month.

952
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,258
That's okay, ma'am.

953
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:05,162
Another day of stacking up our future.

954
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,331
THE MONEY HERE IS WORTH
ABOUT 150 BILLION WON

955
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:09,966
Move them.

956
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,641
-Idiot.
-That's our precious money!

957
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,009
I'm so sorry, sir.

958
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,110
Be careful!

959
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,344
I'm sorry, sir.

960
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:26,516
Hello.

961
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,153
What?

962
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,124
So you just let him do that
like a dumbass?

963
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,692
Yes. I apologize, sir.

964
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:38,695
Even Choco stepped up, but...

965
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,263
That big piece of fat is useless...

966
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,599
Goddamn it.

967
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,468
The priest

968
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,171
must have an unspeakable past.

969
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:49,873
Just like me.

970
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,642
Hey.

971
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,878
You used to work
for illegal real estate agencies.

972
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,813
It's not like you have an amazing past.

973
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,984
I have an amazing past

974
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,053
from Khabarovsk.

975
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,489
Don't mind about him. Listen, both of you.

976
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,390
You know if something happens
to Wangmat Food,

977
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,959
it won't end there.

978
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,161
You, I, the district office,

979
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,563
and the district director
will all be done for.

980
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,703
I guess it's time for me to step up.

981
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,305
Leave the priest to me.

982
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:26,042
I will send him to his God.

983
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,681
Put the fork down and stop it.

984
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,750
Gosh, there he goes again.

985
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,186
Anyway,

986
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,188
we can't get rid of the priest now.

987
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,525
He has the Pope behind him.

988
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,765
How about I take care

989
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,134
of that priest jerk?

990
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:53,970
Do you have an idea?

991
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,440
Problems among religious people

992
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,910
must be sorted out by religious people.

993
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,811
Us religious people will sort it out.

994
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,287
What's all this?

995
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,889
Well, yesterday,

996
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,859
you were arguing with Detective Gu
over a fried egg.

997
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:19,696
You seemed to like it,
so I made a lot of them.

998
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:21,965
Do you want me to stuff myself to death?

999
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:23,833
No way.

1000
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,837
Father, you can't make such jokes.

1001
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,274
What's taking him so long?

1002
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,410
We delayed our lunchtime because of him.

1003
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,946
He texted me,
saying he has some work to do.

1004
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:39,716
Don't you guys

1005
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,419
hate Detective Gu?

1006
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,422
To be honest, he's not really on our side.

1007
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,190
He's rather disrupting the investigation.

1008
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,328
We're aware that, Father.

1009
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,763
But do you still want to make him

1010
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,098
food and everything?

1011
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,302
We should.

1012
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,174
If Father Lee was still alive,

1013
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,613
he would have done the same.

1014
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,551
No matter how hateful and sinful
the person is,

1015
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,054
he would have gladly

1016
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,857
offer warm food to them.

1017
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:22,559
I'm sure.

1018
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,297
That's why Father Lee

1019
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,634
accepted you in the church.

1020
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,437
Well, that wasn't really my reason.

1021
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,107
Oh, dear.

1022
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,541
Who is this?

1023
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,478
Goodness. Again?

1024
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:44,981
Yes, Sister.

1025
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:48,985
What? Those Maegakkyo people came again?

1026
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,587
I'm sorry.

1027
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,624
Why do they keep coming to the place?

1028
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:57,327
Goodness.

1029
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,299
-Give me that big suitcase.
-Okay.

1030
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:12,142
YEONGWOL

1031
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:15,645
YEONGWOL INTERCITY BUS TERMINAL

1032
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:22,185
THE DAUGHTER OF YEONGWOL,
PARK GYEONG-SEON'S GLORIOUS COMEBACK

1033
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,823
How humble.

1034
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,394
DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE,
YEONGWOL BRANCH

1035
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,730
Let's eat lunch.

1036
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,801
Where's Father Kim?

1037
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,003
He went to the orphanage.

1038
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:41,671
Why all of a sudden?

1039
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,749
Damn it.
I don't have a good feeling about this.

1040
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:53,917
I really don't.

1041
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,757
-We hate non-believers
-We hate non-believers

1042
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:05,061
-We like believers
-We like believers

1043
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,398
-Woo-ta
-Woo-ta

1044
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,266
-We will follow him
-We will follow him

1045
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,769
Woo-ta!

1046
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,171
We will follow him

1047
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:16,239
Hey!

1048
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:34,290
You came, Mother. I mean, Father.

1049
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,892
We were having a great time with the kids.

1050
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,595
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

1051
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:42,165
That lady gave me a noogie
because I didn't say "Woo-ta".

1052
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,266
She did it to me too.

1053
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,968
When did I do that?

1054
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:46,770
It was just a gentle stroke
out of pure affection.

1055
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,471
-I show too much affection.
-How dare you...

1056
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:51,941
Come on. Calm down.

1057
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:53,777
I told you not to come here.

1058
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,579
The district office made
an official announcement.

1059
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,149
-Didn't you know that?
-That's none of my business.

1060
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:02,519
Right. That's none of your business.

1061
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,455
We need to stick to the law.

1062
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,024
Even if it's unjust, it's the law.

1063
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,360
Laws must be obeyed, even unjust.
Socrates said so.

1064
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,694
Do you know how to spell his name?

1065
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,631
S.C.R.A.T.

1066
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,533
My goodness.

1067
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:21,104
I told you not to teach
that bullshit to children.

1068
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:24,040
I'm only trying to enlighten them.
What's so wrong about it?

1069
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,043
And your God is not the only higher being.

1070
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,078
You cult prick. What did you just say?

1071
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:30,280
Cult?

1072
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,182
To us, your religion is a cult.

1073
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,917
You believe in God
that doesn't even exist.

1074
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,318
God, could you come down for a second?

1075
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,053
Are you not there? You're not there.

1076
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,556
Now it's proved that God doesn't exist.
God doesn't exist.

1077
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,391
How dare you disgrace the Lord.

1078
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,692
Come here.

1079
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,794
No matter what you do to disrupt me,

1080
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:48,431
I will make these adorable kids

1081
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:50,867
the children of Maegakkyo.

1082
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,269
Woo-ta.

1083
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,671
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

1084
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,239
You need to speak louder.

1085
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,507
Woo-ta.

1086
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,309
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

1087
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:00,643
You...

1088
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,886
-Father, no!
-I can't let them do this.

1089
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,955
Not only that!

1090
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:16,693
I'm going to turn this place

1091
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,362
into Maegakkyo's chapel.

1092
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,268
He is a priest who hits people.

1093
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,341
He's a devil!

1094
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,644
A priest hit a man!

1095
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,646
I compel you, Satan!

1096
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,949
Father!

1097
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,769
You're causing trouble again.

1098
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,472
-Are you okay?
-Of course I am.

1099
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,345
Who is that man with a scythe?

1100
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,149
No one has a scythe.
What are you talking about?

1101
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:50,386
Fine. It may be a bit run-down,
but as long as it's quiet.

1102
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:52,855
Gross.

1103
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:53,923
THE PROSECUTOR OUT OF POWER

1104
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:57,560
Wisdom and wits always show their power
at the most dangerous moment.

1105
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,364
I think he should get another checkup.

1106
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:02,532
Then how about

1107
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,833
we work together?

1108
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,401
I feel like I'm Lee Jung-jae in New World.

1109
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:06,803
Going to Wangmat Food tomorrow?

1110
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:07,804
THEY FINALLY TEAM UP!

1111
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,239
-Are you sure the priest asked you this?
-Yes, he did.

1112
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:11,574
WANGMAT FOOD

1113
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,746
