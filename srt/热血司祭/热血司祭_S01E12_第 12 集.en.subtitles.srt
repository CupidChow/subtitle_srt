1
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,153
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,554
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,462
I can't believe he got caught.

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,730
Tell me about it.

5
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,701
Get down. Hands behind your head.

6
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,676
No need to go that far.

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,212
Why are you just standing there?
Go and get him!

8
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,714
Oh, right.

9
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,016
We should secure this path
in case he tries to run away.

10
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,018
Yes. The suspect might turn back.

11
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,488
Turn back, my ass.
The whole tables have turned.

12
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,558
-Go and get him.
-Yes, sir.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,828
You shouldn't go there, Ms. Park.

14
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,329
What's this?

15
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,532
What's going on here? What is it?

16
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,069
I was with Congressman Park,

17
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,438
and some bastard threw me down.

18
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,173
He's the suspect.

19
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,241
Is it?

20
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:17,977
Grab me!

21
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,314
Grab me! I said, grab me!

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,087
You dirty bastard!
Where is the rest of your gang?

23
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,288
Come on, grab me!

24
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,523
-Hurry!
-What are you doing? Get him!

25
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,991
Ma'am, come this way!

26
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,461
Look at this bastard's glare.

27
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,629
We should check his face. Come here, you--

28
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,467
It really hurts.

29
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,736
Let go of her!

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,071
Let go, or I'll shoot!

31
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,641
Put your guns down! Put them down!

32
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,877
-Put them down!
-Yes, ma'am.

33
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,145
Hurry up and put them down!

34
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,647
You bastard, you're going to get killed...

35
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,016
My goodness.

36
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,751
What's that sharp feeling?

37
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,287
Is that a knife against my back?

38
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,455
-Why, you!
-You!

39
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,724
Throw your guns back!

40
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,326
Hurry up and throw them down!

41
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,827
-What?
-Throw them away!

42
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,230
-Yes, ma'am!
-Step back!

43
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,898
Don't overreact.

44
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,234
-You could get me killed today.
-Get him!

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,537
Mom, I don't want to die.

46
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:18,738
What do I do?

47
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,341
-Get him!
-What? Get him?

48
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,310
Oh, no. Why did you say it so loudly?

49
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,478
Come on!

50
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,852
You'd better surrender now.

51
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,088
Do you know who I am?
I'm Park Gyeong-seon, the mad dog of...

52
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,189
-My goodness!
-Oh, no!

53
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,193
Open fire!

54
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,662
-Get him!
-Get that bastard!

55
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,399
Get him!

56
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,801
-Get him!
-That jerk!

57
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,538
Get that bastard! Get him!

58
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,406
Get him!

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,841
Get that bastard!

60
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,144
Ms. Park!

61
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,313
It's killing me.

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,681
-Hurry up and get him!
-Come on!

63
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:02,749
Get him!

64
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,386
Give me your hand, ma'am.

65
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,721
Come on! Get him!

66
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,324
Why, that...

67
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,249
Damn it!

68
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,753
How did she know?

69
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,390
Damn it, how?

70
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,639
Gosh.

71
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,375
I guess she recognized
these charming eyes of mine.

72
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,610
Gosh.

73
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,179
She's as smart as I am.

74
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,349
Focus, you fool.

75
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,059
Who is it?

76
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,894
Who the heck?

77
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,466
We're trying our best to find out, sir.

78
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,668
You should've gotten the job done

79
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,637
no matter what happened.

80
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm sorry, sir.

81
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:38,211
Maybe it's an enemy we don't know about.

82
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,580
I'll look into it and handle it.

83
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,682
You...

84
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,050
You...

85
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,219
Make sure to get rid of Congressman Park.

86
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,022
It's not the best timing
since he's at the intensive care unit.

87
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,125
I'll make sure to do the job
once he's at the general ward, sir.

88
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,027
You're always like this.

89
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,762
Once Congressman Park wakes up,

90
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,498
everything's over with you.

91
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,932
Do you understand?

92
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,379
How could you lose him
right in front of your eyes?

93
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,783
Well, you showed up out of nowhere, so--

94
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,584
Goodness, so it's my fault?

95
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm the reason you lost the criminal?

96
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,555
That's not what I meant, ma'am.

97
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,624
I guess I'm the one to blame.

98
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,327
I'm just one slow-witted
and unlucky prosecutor.

99
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,629
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

100
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,698
I should be beaten for what I did.

101
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:34,867
Go ahead with your report.

102
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,437
You should tell them that it's my fault
you lost him.

103
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,773
I'll sit here and wait,
so tell me when you're done.

104
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,208
I won't say that, ma'am.

105
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,577
Stop it. Go ahead.

106
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,778
You did nothing wrong, ma'am.

107
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,715
Detective Seo, could you order
a bowl of mapa tofu rice for me?

108
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,049
Yes, do that.

109
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,385
They don't sell that around here.

110
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,823
Go ahead and write the report.

111
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,925
SEOUL GUDAM POLICE STATION

112
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,094
It seems like she knows, doesn't it?

113
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,762
Yes, that's what I thought, too.

114
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,432
But why do you think she let him run away
if she knows?

115
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,101
She's trying to play it smart.

116
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,203
Since she got ahold of one fish,

117
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,605
she wants to follow it
and catch the entire school.

118
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,474
She's one evil and clever woman.

119
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,310
I knew it ever since that time
she wouldn't order food for me.

120
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,946
She only ordered mapa tofu rice
for herself.

121
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,314
-Seriously?
-Yes!

122
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,319
Thanks to you, Father Kim,

123
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,021
Congressman Park was able
to save his life.

124
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,125
Not really.

125
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,761
He'll be in a vegetative state
his entire life.

126
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,864
At least there's still a chance
that he might wake up.

127
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,766
They're so cruel.

128
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,101
How could they try to disguise it
into suicide?

129
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,369
We can't let this happen!

130
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,406
The Lord's words aren't enough
to repent those devils of their sins.

131
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,008
Yes, that is correct.

132
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,544
I agree with him as well.

133
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:55,214
The Lord didn't just use his words
to guide his people.

134
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,784
The Lord eventually sent down a punishment
to those evil people

135
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,051
who never repented of their sins.

136
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,188
Yes. Sodom and Gomorrah
were punished with burning sulfur,

137
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,024
and the stubborn Pharaoh
ended up losing his eldest son.

138
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,326
You know what he did when
the world fell into evil, don't you?

139
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,431
He got rid of this entire world
with a huge flood.

140
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes, that is correct.
I personally think God's justice

141
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,736
must be established in Gudam-gu
not just by spreading God's words,

142
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,171
but by taking action,

143
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,605
-What do you think, Father?
-Absolutely!

144
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,706
Right?

145
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,019
At this point,

146
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,289
I think there's a rage virus going around.

147
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:43,996
Aren't you taking the call?

148
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,602
OLD LADY

149
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,475
She might mention something
about yesterday,

150
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,642
so record us from outside.

151
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,611
I'm sure she's up to something.

152
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,947
That's why she still let you run away.

153
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,649
Anyway, don't let her get you swayed.

154
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,784
Act like you know nothing.

155
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,687
Since when did I ever get swayed?

156
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,856
Make sure to keep a straight face.

157
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,891
All right. Don't worry.

158
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,660
I've been keeping a straight face
ever since I was five.

159
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,741
The guy with a black mask
at the villa yesterday...

160
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,309
That was you, wasn't it?

161
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:31,978
Sorry? Me?

162
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,981
What are you talking about?

163
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,517
Trespassing, theft, and attempted murder
on a congressman.

164
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,519
Do you know how long
you'd be sentenced for all that?

165
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,221
You can't just play innocent with me.

166
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,024
What are you yelling at me for?

167
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,561
I really don't understand
a word you're saying.

168
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,000
Why don't you try explaining
all this to me?

169
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,868
If I can accept it,

170
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,540
I'll give you time to deal with it
on your own.

171
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,947
I'm not trying to throw you in jail,
Father Kim.

172
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,916
I'm trying to give you a chance here.

173
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:11,851
I mean,

174
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,453
do you even have proof that it was me?

175
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,523
From now on, no matter what happens,

176
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,892
you'd better not ask me for any help.

177
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,161
I'm going to ignore you completely.

178
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,667
If I were you,
I'd say something out of gratitude.

179
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,768
My gosh.

180
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,804
Listen, old lady.

181
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,374
Why are you making it
like I'm someone mysterious?

182
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,277
Your personal information

183
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,445
is classified as confidential.

184
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,980
Isn't that mysterious enough?

185
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,951
A civilian who's classified
as confidential

186
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,654
is either a government agent or a spy.

187
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,157
But my guts tell me you're not a spy,

188
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,758
so you're a government agent, for sure.

189
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,327
You're from the NIS?

190
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,563
Isn't it illegal for you to question me?

191
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,068
And besides, what am I, Jason Bourne?

192
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,135
What's with the fuss?

193
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,237
More like Tsunami Bourne.

194
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,774
See? I told you.

195
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,776
I told you he seemed like
an ex-government agent.

196
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,078
I got it right.

197
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,680
I thought he seemed more like
an undercover detective

198
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,549
who was looking into
Gudam-gu's irregularities.

199
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,684
I won, so give me my 30,000 won.

200
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,496
You only gave me 20,000 won.

201
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,666
I left out the tax, okay?

202
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,935
Plus, we're not even sure yet.

203
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,670
Let's bet again next time.

204
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,106
Listen to me, old lady.

205
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,810
I'm just an ordinary priest

206
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,013
who majored in Korean literature
and led an ordinary life.

207
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,082
You majored in Korean literature?

208
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,719
Then you must know the basics

209
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,521
to Korean literature
and classical literature.

210
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,157
Of course, I do. Who are you kidding?

211
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,026
Then I'll give you a quiz,

212
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,462
and you need to get at least
seven out of ten. Okay?

213
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,034
Gosh, why should I do that?

214
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,704
-Okay, fine.
-Okay, let's do this.

215
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,141
In The Dance of the Buddhist Nun,
by Cho Chi-hun,

216
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,676
what did he fold and send away?

217
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:17,943
A paper crane.

218
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,616
In The Self-Portrait, by Seo Jeong-ju,
what practically raised him for 23 years?

219
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,084
Rice.

220
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,185
ANSWER: THE WIND

221
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,487
In Crow's Eye View, by Yi Sang,

222
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,589
how many kids ran on the street?

223
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,258
Five.

224
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,362
Du-a-ryeong-syeong, du-a-ryeong-syeong
Da-ring-di-ri

225
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,463
What's the name of the song

226
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,664
from Goryeo with these lyrics?

227
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,099
Ring Ding Dong.

228
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,037
In the very end of
When Buckwheat Flowers Bloom,

229
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,639
what kind of relationship is Mr. Heo

230
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,740
assumed to have with Dong?

231
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,042
An inappropriate relationship.

232
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,912
Forget it!
You didn't get even one correct.

233
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,347
Well, it's been ages since I graduated.

234
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,716
People forget, don't they?

235
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,950
Didn't I get them all right?

236
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,887
Why do we have to be the ones
to feel embarrassed?

237
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,256
Maybe he was trying to be funny.

238
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,526
If he was, he succeeded.

239
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,964
You're so shameless.

240
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,700
You're already caught, you know.

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,635
What did you catch me doing?

242
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,738
I'm just who I am.

243
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,040
You'd better confess soon.

244
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,342
That's the only way you'll survive.

245
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,848
Take care, old lady.

246
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,386
Look at my hands and feet shaking.
That was a close one.

247
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,456
Why in the world...

248
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,768
How can you not know
about The Dance of the Buddhist Nun?

249
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,004
"The white band folded so carefully..."

250
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,105
Damn it.

251
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,441
There are 13 children in Crow's Eye View.

252
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,343
Even I know that.

253
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,313
Did you really work for the NIS?

254
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,550
-No wonder your eyes are so--
-Enough.

255
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,154
Let's go back. I'm tired and stressed.

256
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,359
He seems even more like a loser today.

257
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,696
There was a hacking incident
at the NIS in 2007.

258
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,533
Some information that was leaked
back then was still accessible.

259
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,235
The Night Mole of Mullae-dong
had the data.

260
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,672
Interfere as much as you can.

261
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,408
I'll just show up at the end.

262
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,943
INTERNATIONAL
COUNTERTERRORISM DEPARTMENT

263
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,944
But...

264
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:32,945
NIS

265
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,880
It makes me so furious

266
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,883
to have to keep holding it in.

267
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,186
PERSONAL INFORMATION

268
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,525
Damn it.

269
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,161
That ungrateful jerk.

270
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,431
How can a priest be so ungrateful?

271
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,333
I mean,

272
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,168
do you even have proof that it was me?

273
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,113
It really hurts.

274
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,018
Damn it, that jerk.

275
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,090
He's so annoying.

276
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,732
You told me once

277
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,237
that if I share a secret,
I'll be able to share everything else.

278
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,544
But does that work for secrets

279
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,313
that got out unwillingly, too?

280
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,753
It's just...

281
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,556
I wanted to know how much

282
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,460
I'm allowed to share.

283
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,033
Things got all messed up
because of this bastard.

284
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,936
What on earth...

285
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,838
What you tried on Congressman Park...

286
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,040
Was that how you got rid of Father Lee?

287
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,511
"Committing suicide due to the pressure
from the police and prosecution."

288
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,779
Is that the frame you used?

289
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,248
It's the most natural one. Why?

290
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,183
Do you have something against it?

291
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,552
No, sir.

292
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,323
The inspection on me and Director Jeong
will be called off later today.

293
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,158
I've already taken care of it.

294
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,894
Get ready to investigate Chief Nam next.

295
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,764
Yes, sir.

296
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,873
Father Kim, it's here. It has arrived.

297
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,649
GENETIC TEST REPORT

298
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,120
GENES FROM BOTH SAMPLES DETECTED

299
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,289
BOTH DNA SAMPLES MATCH LEE YEONG-JUN'S

300
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,793
"Both DNA samples match Lee Yeong-jun's
by 99.9 percent."

301
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,499
It is the blood of Father Lee.

302
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,517
Any information on Chief Nam?

303
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,820
We have plenty, ma'am.

304
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,888
But we found a really good one.

305
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,560
-How good?
-It's huge information.

306
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,998
There's a social club called "Rising Moon"
at Gudam intersection.

307
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,001
Aren't social clubs for the rich people

308
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,502
in that area?

309
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,237
Yes, but you see,

310
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:49,875
a huge amount of cash is flowing
to officers who work for Chief Nam.

311
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,478
A large amount is going to
the district office, too.

312
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,447
What is he, the whole city's breadwinner?

313
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:57,750
Who's the owner of that place?

314
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,385
A 30-year-old man named Park Shin-woo.

315
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,020
He's the son of Congressman Park.

316
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,922
What a perfect set.

317
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,225
There are other joint representatives
as well,

318
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,659
but they're borrowed names.

319
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,629
Should I look into this or not?

320
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,438
Let's look into it a bit more.

321
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,740
Let's see who this man is.

322
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,309
GENETIC TEST REPORT

323
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,647
"Therefore, the unidentified person

324
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,517
and the victim, Lee Yeong-jun,
may be identified as identical."

325
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,651
Unbelievable.

326
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,219
We really did find it.

327
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,789
I was worried that
we wouldn't be able to find a match.

328
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,424
We can take action now, can't we?

329
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,792
No way.

330
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,327
They'll find out
that we were at the villa,

331
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,996
and we might get backlashed instead.

332
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,598
But the blood matches Father Lee's.
What more do we need?

333
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,033
Detective Gu is right.

334
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,202
They might say we fabricated it.

335
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,006
You're right.
They're capable of worse things.

336
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,475
Then what do we do now?

337
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,243
First,

338
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,214
we'll confirm that the villa
is where it happened.

339
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,749
How?

340
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,889
What? A murder?

341
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,660
What did you say? A murder?

342
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,862
Yes.

343
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,331
Oh my gosh.

344
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,200
Yes, all right.

345
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:22,835
What's going on?

346
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,903
It's an informant about the attack
on Congressman Park.

347
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,505
What?

348
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,074
You should've stalled the call
so we can locate him.

349
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,476
That's not what's important.

350
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,378
He said there was a murder
at Mr. Hwang's villa.

351
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,147
-Murder?
-What?

352
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,483
-Who was killed?
-I'm not sure about that,

353
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,351
but he said someone was murdered

354
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,186
in a room on the first floor of the villa.

355
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,589
He said he also heard it from someone
under Hwang Cheol-beom.

356
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,792
But why the villa all of a sudden?

357
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,460
Are you sure it's credible?

358
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,697
Why don't we send the forensics?
It's worth a try.

359
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,333
It's Hwang Cheol-beom's villa.
It's not going to be easy.

360
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,568
Let's just leave it for now.

361
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,703
We can't, sir.

362
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,739
He said he'll report it somewhere else
if we don't investigate this.

363
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,476
Gosh, my blood pressure is going up.

364
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,313
Call the forensics right away.

365
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,315
Yes, sir.

366
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,416
-Call them now.
-Yes, sir.

367
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,898
Why are you pestering me like this?

368
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,233
This is an execution of official duties,
so please excuse us.

369
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,002
Official duties, my ass.

370
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,338
SEARCH WARRANT

371
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,309
Just don't mess up the house.
I have mysophobia.

372
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,112
Hey, Ryong,
do you think we're here on vacation?

373
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,214
We're here to investigate.

374
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,482
"Ryong"?

375
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,817
Don't call me by my name
and keep your mouth shut.

376
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,719
If you want to act all American with me,

377
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,422
call me "Mister Ryong". Okay?

378
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,693
Try it. "Mister Ryong".

379
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,363
Do you think you're a pizza brand
or something?

380
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,202
How are you so lively
when you always get beaten up like that?

381
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,070
Did you get a protection film
for your mentality?

382
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,838
Actually, I did.

383
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,007
I stuck it on with superglue.

384
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,076
Will you take it off for me, Hip Hop Girl?

385
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,179
We need to hurry up.

386
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,181
"Mister Ryong". Are you happy?

387
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,152
Shake off the dust before you enter.
It's so dusty outside.

388
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,888
How many of you are there?

389
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,649
What is it, Dae-yeong?

390
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,101
What do you mean, it changed?

391
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,170
They changed the entire flooring
and wallpaper.

392
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,273
And of course, nothing was detected.

393
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,076
I think our plans had been exposed.

394
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,279
All right. Let's talk later.

395
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,089
Yes?

396
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,125
-Father Kim.
-What?

397
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,028
Someone would like to make
a confession to you, Father.

398
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,563
Tell him to return on a Sunday.

399
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,065
I did tell him that,

400
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,933
but he insists that it must be today.

401
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,243
In the name of the Father, the Son,

402
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,412
and the Holy Spirit.

403
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:54,980
Amen.

404
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,615
Amen.

405
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,150
Is that what I'm supposed to say?

406
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,087
Yes.

407
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,457
Go ahead and confess.

408
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,194
I just tell you about the sin I committed,
right?

409
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,196
Yes, go ahead.

410
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:16,501
I used to do something important
for the country, you see.

411
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,938
I used to work

412
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,208
in a faraway country,

413
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,111
and I committed a grave sin there.

414
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,447
What was it you did?

415
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,482
How should I put it?

416
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,285
Do you know what a grenade is?

417
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,057
I threw that,

418
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,528
and I killed such young children.

419
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,171
I killed 11 of them.

420
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:02,981
Can someone who killed 11 young children

421
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,317
become a priest, too?

422
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,031
Hae-il. Victory.

423
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,936
You...

424
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,574
How have you been?
Why won't you say hello?

425
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,799
Hey.

426
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,435
I wondered what you've been up to

427
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,604
after you quit your job.

428
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,473
I was worried you'd go hungry,

429
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,410
but I guess you ended up
becoming a priest.

430
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:10,215
You know, things like that happen
when you're working.

431
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,451
Don't get so hurt like that.

432
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,188
-Just leave.
-Leave where?

433
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,958
Shouldn't you at least ask
why I came here?

434
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,228
Don't you think so?
Why are you here doing such petty things?

435
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,499
All you do is interfere with
the leaders of this town

436
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,334
and investigate dead priests.

437
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,502
Are you kidding me?

438
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,571
What is it that you want to say?

439
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,540
I just want you to do nothing
and not make a peep.

440
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,076
Then I won't come after you.
I'll just leave you alone.

441
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,580
And what if I can't?

442
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,484
I just want to make a deal
without having to go through a war.

443
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,555
Listen. If you and I get into a fight,

444
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:55,360
then innocent people,
like those little kids, might die again.

445
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,561
What will you do then?

446
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:58,797
You bastard.

447
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,701
Hey,
you're the one who threw that grenade.

448
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,237
Why are you getting angry at me?

449
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,472
Hae-il.

450
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,445
Just keep that dead priest in your heart.

451
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,048
No matter how hard you try,

452
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,251
nothing will change at all.

453
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,755
I'll give you a few days to consider it.

454
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,926
Think wisely, Father Kim.

455
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,918
FATHER LEE'S SUICIDE CASE

456
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,525
I can't understand it at all.

457
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,627
How did they know and clean out that room?

458
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,829
Could it be a coincidence?

459
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,099
Of course, not.
They only cleaned out that one room.

460
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,306
Father.

461
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,276
Father?

462
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,712
Yes?

463
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,880
Is something wrong? You keep zoning out.

464
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,482
No, it's nothing.

465
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,153
Oh, right. There's something
I forgot to tell you that day.

466
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,890
The man who moved Father Lee's body.

467
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,393
The man who ordered or was involved in it.

468
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,862
Who is it?

469
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,099
Jang Ryong.

470
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,703
This is what he said
right before I went to the rooftop.

471
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,773
Hold on. Don't grab him too tightly.

472
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,575
-You'll leave bruises.
-Yes, sir.

473
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,612
That means he knows how to kill
without leaving a trace.

474
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,781
We also found out about that
thanks to Father Kim.

475
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,883
Whether he moved Father Lee himself
or ordered it,

476
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,752
that bastard's the one who did it.

477
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,453
Shall I go and get him right now?

478
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,890
Let's just beat him up
and make him confess.

479
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,825
We can turn a blind eye.

480
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,727
No, that won't do.

481
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:43,795
No?

482
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,865
Then should we coax him
and make him confess?

483
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,467
That's even worse.

484
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,136
We'll need concrete evidence.

485
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,938
This is so frustrating.

486
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,075
Just wait.

487
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:01,513
Soon,
they'll be the ones feeling frustrated.

488
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,683
-Oh, you're here.
-Hello, sir.

489
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,518
Sit down.

490
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,386
Say hello.

491
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,689
He's our source at the NIS, Lee Jung-gwon

492
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:11,923
He'll be a free agent soon.

493
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,858
Hey, you didn't have to tell her that.

494
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,894
Hello, I'm Park Gyeong-seon.

495
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,095
Nice meeting you.

496
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,565
You don't look much like a prosecutor,
though.

497
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,001
If you need any information,
Mr. Lee can help you.

498
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,502
Yes, sir.

499
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,839
Oh, right. Tell us about that priest.

500
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,974
-You said you finished the analysis?
-Yes, sir.

501
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,144
There was this agent in our team
when I was the head

502
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,879
of the counterterrorism department
at the NIS.

503
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,352
He was like a character in a comic book.

504
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,321
It might sound like a comic book,

505
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,891
but even when he had starved for days,
got shot by a gun,

506
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,793
or had his bones crushed,

507
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,662
he would never back off

508
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,031
once he was in the enemy's territory.

509
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,434
No matter how well
the terrorist group was hiding,

510
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,336
he would find them and wipe them all out

511
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,439
with a single clue.

512
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,913
Once he spots the enemy,

513
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,550
he would change completely.

514
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:18,323
He was the top agent of
the NIS counterterrorism department.

515
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,225
Kim Hae-il.

516
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,198
I couldn't believe it either
when I first heard his name,

517
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,602
but I realized it was true
when I checked the file.

518
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,570
Then why didn't you tell me this earlier?

519
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:35,173
I couldn't believe
that he'd become a priest,

520
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,842
so I had to do some investigation myself.

521
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,144
And the results?

522
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,048
He's just an ordinary priest.

523
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,518
My gosh. That's a relief then.

524
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,620
No, I don't think so.

525
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,357
When Kim Hae-il loses it,

526
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,059
he turns into a monster.

527
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,837
The scene of the crime,
the corpse carrier,

528
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,239
the route and location
of dumping the body, all checked.

529
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,408
I identified the scene and route

530
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,677
through Director Jeong and Wangmat Food,

531
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,047
and I identified who moved the body
through Congressman Park.

532
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,082
Then next...

533
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,086
NAM SEOK-GU,
GUDAM POLICE STATION CHEIF

534
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,122
Chief Nam Seok-gu.

535
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,369
What now?

536
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,318
Agent Kim Hae-il.

537
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,059
You must feel much better
now that you know my past.

538
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,294
I put on a show so you could run away.

539
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:07,165
And all the other many things...

540
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,167
I did for you.

541
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,803
Why do you think I did all those things?

542
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,606
Out of guilt, I suppose?

543
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,342
You felt bad about Father Lee.

544
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:20,912
It's because

545
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,782
I didn't feel good about it.

546
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,854
I didn't feel good about having

547
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,591
two of my priests from church
ending up in the wrong place.

548
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,794
You know what that means, right?

549
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,197
Small, damp, prickly,

550
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,932
and disconcerting. Something like that.

551
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,536
My gosh.

552
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,873
Fine. Forget about me.

553
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,677
But are you saying Father Lee
meant nothing to you?

554
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:57,315
Nothing more than fish bones or humidity,
things like that?

555
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:10,061
You know,
I tried to avoid such situations,

556
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,997
but it's just getting in the way
of my life now.

557
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,204
Then why don't you just ignore me?

558
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,839
Mind your own business from now on.

559
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,876
Just leave me alone and feel bad.

560
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,680
Must I not get in your way
for your own future?

561
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,281
You're always like this, aren't you?

562
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,986
When I try to talk to you,
you get pissed and annoyed.

563
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,821
Old lady.

564
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,959
I think you only do this for
emotional amusement.

565
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,393
I think you're enjoying it.

566
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,162
Who would enjoy this?

567
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,897
Do you think I'm a wacko?

568
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,370
You're not normal, okay?

569
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,706
Why don't you see that, old lady?

570
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,911
An abnormal man calls
a normal woman abnormal,

571
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,647
thus making the normal feel
abnormally offended.

572
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,150
Don't try to make it rhyme.

573
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,053
And don't go easy on me anymore.

574
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,156
Like I said last time,
I'm going to go all the way.

575
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,027
As of today,

576
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,364
I won't go easy on you anymore.

577
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,601
Then as of today,
I won't pray for you, either.

578
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,447
Wait. You did what for me?

579
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,182
Pray? That's not it, right?

580
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,922
It can't be.

581
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,592
He just had nothing better to say.

582
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,560
Damn it.

583
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,168
Does she think a priest would lie
about praying?

584
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,571
By the way, she did put on a show
to help me run away,

585
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,775
but what were all the other things
she's supposedly done for me?

586
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,232
Yo-han.

587
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,336
-Yo-han!
-Welcome.

588
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,007
Will you get some proper sleep?

589
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,909
I don't have time.

590
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,644
I need to earn like crazy
for graduate school.

591
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,614
That's right.
You're free after 10 p.m., aren't you?

592
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,983
I am.

593
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,222
-Did you eat onions?
-No, this.

594
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,292
Do you want to work with me?

595
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:55,993
There's a well-paying job I know.

596
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,197
-What kind of job?
-My goodness.

597
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,534
There's a club called "Rising Moon".

598
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,903
A club?

599
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,672
Dance.

600
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,042
A club. What do you think? Smooth, right?

601
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,611
You are. You're such a great dancer.

602
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,414
But you don't need to dance.

603
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,416
You just carry things around and clean up.

604
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,352
And don't talk. You'll get fired.

605
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,154
-Why?
-You only need to say this.

606
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,523
"Welcome"! Try it.

607
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,292
-"Welcome"!
-"Welcome"!

608
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,328
"Welcome"!

609
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,395
Forget it. It won't work.

610
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,931
I like that they pay well. I'll do it.

611
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,968
Okay. Then you start next week.
Don't change your mind.

612
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:41,906
I don't change my mind easily, you fatso.

613
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,508
I get why that jerk Jang Ryong beats you.

614
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,742
Come here, Brother Songsak.

615
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,644
-I am here, fatso.
-Come here, you...

616
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,045
-Come on.
-I'm going to kill you.

617
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,251
What's this?

618
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,487
I put some effort into this briefing.

619
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,392
I dug a bit and ended up hitting a mine.

620
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,793
Tell me who the actual owner is.

621
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,264
On the surface, Park Won-mu's son
Park Shin-woo owns the club.

622
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,867
I looked into the borrowed names
of the rest of the owners, and...

623
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,170
They are Nam Seok-gu, Kang Seok-tae,

624
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,872
Jeong Dong-ja, and Hwang Cheol-beom.

625
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:18,075
This really is huge.

626
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:21,712
It seems like Chief Nam
is practically the representative.

627
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,849
He's not just the representative.
He owns the most shares.

628
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,586
Those red lines indicate the cash flow
to the district office and police, right?

629
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,588
Yes, ma'am. But the main point...

630
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,392
It is...

631
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,360
This, ma'am.

632
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,229
Hurry up and tell me.

633
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,666
It is...

634
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,670
It is...

635
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,006
We will proceed
after the commercial break.

636
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,709
Will you stop that? Gosh.

637
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:52,810
Yes, ma'am.

638
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,146
It is...

639
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,086
It must have been hard to lie low.

640
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,089
It was nothing, sir.

641
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,993
I'm very regretful for what I did.

642
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,796
I returned to the office today.

643
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,665
It was so foolish of Congressman Park.

644
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,737
Chief Nam, I think you should help us
ease our undying rage.

645
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:24,342
How should I help you, sir?

646
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:28,045
Maybe with your shares in "Rising Moon"?

647
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,449
What do you say

648
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,020
we divide your shares equally among us?

649
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,790
METH!

650
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:40,891
Meth!

651
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,762
Methamphetamine is openly used
within that club

652
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,799
The suppliers are from Russia.

653
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,937
Meth at a social club
on the outskirts of Gudam?

654
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,772
Because of this meth,

655
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,808
many celebrities
and heirs of rich businessmen

656
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,377
are known to visit in secret,

657
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,646
instead of all the hottest places
in Gangnam.

658
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,750
Kim Geon-yong of Hanju Group is a regular.

659
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,785
So that bastard
wasn't getting high at home.

660
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,153
That's what he'd been telling me.

661
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,724
If you can get this much information
out of just a bit of investigating,

662
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,027
why didn't the drug department
deal with it already?

663
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,795
They do raid the place from time to time,

664
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,931
but it's spotless whenever they get there.

665
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,533
And...

666
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,335
And what?

667
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,237
The late chief of the drug department

668
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,506
at Gudam Station was quite persistent
with the raids,

669
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,808
but he died in a car accident last year.

670
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,378
What is this, a movie?

671
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,616
Why is this so typical?

672
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,085
I think it would be best if you also

673
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,322
stop digging now and leave it here.

674
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:45,489
That's right, ma'am.

675
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,792
We only looked into Chief Nam,

676
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:51,829
but we're getting meth, addicts,
and bribery. Unbelievable.

677
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,536
Yes, Chief Kang?

678
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,273
Lunch today? Yes, I'm free.

679
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,643
Kim Geon-yong of Hanju Group
wants to treat us to lunch.

680
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,078
I see.

681
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:08,813
All right, sir.

682
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,751
What amazing timing.

683
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,588
What do you mean?

684
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,858
You know my friend
who ran Father Lee's DNA test?

685
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,227
He got fired for running

686
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,196
an unauthorized test.

687
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,131
Because of that test?

688
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,300
He wouldn't say exactly, but I think so.

689
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,402
How did the company know
when he ran it in secret?

690
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,471
They must've got a report from outside.

691
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:37,241
I think your enemy is tracking you
from all over.

692
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,377
And that's not all.

693
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,346
All the data on Father Lee
has been wiped out.

694
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,854
All right, I'll call you back later.

695
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,263
No matter how hard you try,

696
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,699
nothing will change at all.

697
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,601
Lee Jung-gwon.

698
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,506
This won't do.

699
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,681
We're lacking information right now.

700
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,084
We need a plan.

701
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,753
It won't be that easy.

702
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,456
I'll do all that I can.

703
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,524
No.

704
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,426
-Detective Gu.
-Yes?

705
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,263
I need you to become our...

706
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,864
Go on.

707
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:35,900
Triumph?

708
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:37,935
Trump?

709
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:39,904
Twice?

710
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,141
Our Trojan horse.

711
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:48,245
No. It's too dangerous.

712
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,114
-"Trojan horse"?
-Did you hear that?

713
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,116
Just forget about it.

714
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,019
It's way too much for you.

715
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,887
No, wait a minute.

716
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,190
So you want me to be a double agent.

717
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,058
I did consider it for a moment,
but no way.

718
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,094
You'll never pull it off.

719
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,399
I agree with you on that, Father.

720
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,601
It's way too much

721
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,937
for him to handle.

722
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,708
What are you talking about?

723
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,211
Why wouldn't I be able to?

724
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,680
I'm Gu Dae-yeong, the veteran.

725
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,981
No, don't.

726
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:27,418
I won't

727
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,554
send you to your death.

728
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,693
I'll try to find someone else
who can help us.

729
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,228
No way. I'm going to do it.

730
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,096
Why would we have to ask for help?

731
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,569
Do you think you can do it?

732
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,039
I found someone else, Father.

733
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,474
Stop that. I'm going to do it.

734
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,043
I'm the only one who can handle something

735
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,678
this difficult.

736
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,483
I don't feel good about this,
but I'll try and trust you.

737
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,919
Me too, Dae-yeong.

738
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,256
I need a drink of water first.

739
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:08,592
My gosh.

740
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,048
That was refreshing.

741
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,660
You're the expert here.
How do you think we should do this?

742
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,765
In order to make it plausible,

743
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,402
we need to give up one of our secrets.

744
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,270
Since we have nothing on that villa,

745
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:54,838
why don't we give that up?

746
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:59,009
No, Detective Seo.
That's not how it works.

747
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,644
What else can we give up, then?

748
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,845
We're not giving anything up.

749
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,149
Hit me on the face a few times, Father.

750
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,586
Make it look like I got beaten up
for getting caught while looking into you.

751
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,888
How would I hit someone innocent?

752
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,390
I'm a priest, you know.

753
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,830
You must do it, Father.

754
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,133
Thugs love a show like this.

755
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,202
Dae-yeong.

756
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,938
If that's the case,

757
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,907
I'll do it, sir.

758
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,098
Oh, dear.

759
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,835
So you're saying the priest found out
and beat you up?

760
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,543
He caught me trying
to break into his phone.

761
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,145
The lock pattern was too complicated.

762
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,748
It wasn't a "Z".

763
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,051
Poor thing.

764
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,821
So, how much did you find out
before you were kicked out?

765
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,557
Well, it was Father Kim
who broke into the villa.

766
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,926
His accomplice was the other priest.

767
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,230
They're practically thieves, not priests!

768
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,400
And who tipped us off?
Was that Father Kim, as well?

769
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,201
He was the one who called about the villa,

770
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,170
but not about Congressman Park.

771
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,706
I see.

772
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,309
Then who called about Congressman Park?

773
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,812
I don't know, sir.

774
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,482
But the caller said he has a source

775
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,551
within Daebeom Trading.

776
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,319
Who in the world is it?

777
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:52,189
Who's the bastard?
Look into everyone and find out.

778
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,323
Yes, sir.

779
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:54,925
Then,

780
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,795
does that mean you don't know
who the masked guy

781
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,363
in Congressman Park's building was?

782
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,399
It wasn't the priest?

783
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,135
No, sir. He was at the church then.

784
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,706
All right.

785
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,841
Good job.

786
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,776
Here,

787
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,645
go and get yourself a drink,

788
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:16,847
and cheer yourself up.

789
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,415
-Thank you, sir.
-Sure.

790
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:20,851
-Thank you, sir.
-Go on.

791
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,158
Does he really think I'm a fool?

792
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,927
That wasn't so bad.

793
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,865
Gosh.

794
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,233
I heard the news.

795
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,935
So, the priest beat you up?

796
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,971
If you're going to be a spy,
do it properly.

797
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,906
You're embarrassing yourself
with that up your nose.

798
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,213
Mr. Jang, I'm not in the mood,

799
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,215
so why don't we go and get a drink?

800
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,784
-You and me?
-Yes, I meant to

801
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:56,386
buy you a drink earlier,
but I kept forgetting.

802
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,722
Mr. Hwang gave me some money,
but I don't want to drink alone.

803
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,161
Well, I get drunk really quick

804
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,829
when I drink during the day.

805
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,631
That's why we drink during the day,
isn't it?

806
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,266
Let's go, Mr. Jang.

807
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,168
I'm only going because you asked.

808
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,405
I think I got drunk

809
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,709
and created a scene last time,
but I can't really remember.

810
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,180
-Hey, Songsak!
-Songsak.

811
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:29,219
-Songsak
-Songsak

812
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:30,554
Bring us another one, kid.

813
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,490
Yes, sir, it's coming.

814
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,427
-So I'm asking you.
-What?

815
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,130
Who throws a harder punch?

816
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:43,801
You got blows from both.
Is it Mr. Hwang or Father Kim?

817
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,869
-That's a tough one.
-Is it?

818
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,604
It's like asking to choose
between Mom and Dad.

819
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:48,739
Or maybe Detective Seo?

820
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,641
She's not that bad, either.

821
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,010
Enjoy your drinks, sir.

822
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,478
Enjoy your leave, too.

823
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:57,147
Here's to our

824
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,449
-friendship.
-Friendship.

825
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,123
-Mr. Jang.
-What?

826
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,660
How long are you going to keep
working for Mr. Kim?

827
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,930
If you two got into a fight,
would you lose?

828
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,033
Lose? Why would I lose?

829
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,267
You know,

830
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,370
I used to be the best fighter
in the South Chungcheong Province.

831
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:23,440
I'm the Three-story Blockhead Pagoda
of Buyeo.

832
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,443
Then just bring him down.

833
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,047
You got Congressman Park
with a single blow, didn't you?

834
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,915
You're right.

835
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,086
He was such an ass to me.

836
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,123
I knew this would happen to him.

837
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,228
What will happen to him now?

838
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,865
He'll start babbling everything
once he wakes up.

839
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,666
Blah, blah, blah.

840
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,404
He won't wake up. I'll see to that.

841
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,341
How?

842
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,742
Are you going to kill him?

843
00:47:58,809 --> 00:47:59,810
Why not?

844
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,180
He's at the intensive care unit now.

845
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,650
The day he's transferred out of there...

846
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,225
Who are you?

847
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,701
You little punk.

848
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,970
I'm Big Zero.

849
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:30,807
Nine Big Zero. Gu Dae-yeong, you fool.

850
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,482
Is your father doing well?

851
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,919
I never got to treat you
when I owe you for such a big favor.

852
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,622
No worries. Your father sent us gifts.

853
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,024
Was it snacks again?

854
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,259
It's nothing expensive, anyways.

855
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:52,829
Did you get some, too, ma'am?

856
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,133
Yes. We enjoyed it together.

857
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,269
I asked to see you today because...

858
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,208
Are you up to something again, ma'am?

859
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:10,180
Pardon? What do you mean?

860
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,482
We found out that someone
looked into the files

861
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,551
regarding Mr. Kim and Rising Moon
this morning.

862
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,586
Who?

863
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,222
Park Yeong-su from your department.

864
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,091
Isn't he your subordinate?

865
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,727
I'm not after you or Rising Moon.

866
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,930
A suspect I'm investigating
is a regular there.

867
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:29,232
That could be why the investigation
led to you as well.

868
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,638
I see. I get it now.

869
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,606
I thought we were having problems.

870
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,442
You know that can't happen, right?

871
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,911
I'll be careful from now on.

872
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,453
Why in the world
did you look in that file?

873
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,521
I was going after Chief Nam.

874
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,490
You dug in a little too deep.

875
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,659
Drop that and look somewhere else.

876
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,528
Make sure not to upset
Kim Geon-yong, okay?

877
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,530
Yes, sir.

878
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:04,935
See you, sir.

879
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,045
Mr. Hwang.

880
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,981
Congressman Park has just been transferred
to the VIP ward from the ICU.

881
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,217
Then I'm sure two cops will be sent there.

882
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,820
No, sir.
His wife said she can't trust the police,

883
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,422
so she hired private bodyguards.

884
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:29,292
Gosh, I didn't want it to get complicated

885
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,528
by bribing police officers, anyways.

886
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,998
Send in a skilled one
and get it over with.

887
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:39,069
Don't kill the bodyguards.
Just knock them down.

888
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:40,971
-Yes, sir.
-And...

889
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,376
Make sure to dress him
exactly like the priest.

890
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,814
We're going to frame him
at the right time.

891
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,316
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

892
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:26,483
What?

893
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,820
How could you tell me this now?
It's an important matter!

894
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,857
Yes, all right.

895
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,358
Okay.

896
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,496
Dae-yeong,
they moved Congressman Park to his ward.

897
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,765
That must be nice.

898
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:44,401
Damn it. It's been almost an hour
since they moved him. We need to go now.

899
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,104
What if Mr. Hwang's gang gets there first?

900
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,406
Come on!

901
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:51,842
You want to drink more?

902
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,945
-Come on, hurry!
-What?

903
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:07,424
HANGANG HOSPITAL

904
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,594
Damn it.

905
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,464
Dae-yeong, get out.

906
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,969
I drank eight bottles
to get some information out of--

907
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,638
You can throw up later!

908
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,020
ELEVATOR UNDER MAINTENANCE

909
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,021
Damn it.

910
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,399
Hurry up, Dae-yeong!

911
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,092
You still have one more left.

912
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,150
Who sent you?

913
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,020
Who sent you?

914
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,322
I don't know.

915
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,792
You're Russian, right?

916
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,333
Take the call.

917
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,303
Take the call now.

918
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,544
Have you finished?

919
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,146
Yes.

920
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:47,350
I'm still waiting. It's only
one woman, so it will be over soon.

921
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:49,419
Okay.

922
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:55,325
Who's the woman he mentioned?

923
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:57,627
I don't know.

924
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,301
I'm asking for the last time.

925
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:05,935
Who is it?

926
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,354
Dae-yeong, hurry!

927
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,462
Where did Father Kim go?

928
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,130
What?

929
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,166
Is he the culprit?

930
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,233
CULPRIT

931
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,736
He is the culprit. Let's arrest him first.

932
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,605
You have the right--

933
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:46,776
The right--

934
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,653
Dae-yeong!

935
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,824
-Thank you. Come again.
-Thank you.

936
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,077
Are you okay, old lady?

937
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,585
Was this really broken by a human?

938
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,654
Thank you.

939
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,024
I guess you meant it
when you said you prayed for me.

940
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,392
Thank the Lord.

941
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:24,027
You're awake, ma'am.

942
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,763
I'm not going to die. I'm a phoenix.

943
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,798
Phoenix Seon!

944
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,134
You want to investigate Rising Moon?

945
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,669
Yes. Let's dig out everything.

946
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:33,703
EVERYONE WANTS JUSTICE

947
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:34,938
Let's begin.

948
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:37,106
