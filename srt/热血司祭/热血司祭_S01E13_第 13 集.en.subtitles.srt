1
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,220
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,588
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,023
HANGANG HOSPITAL

4
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,692
Sir, where is Mr. Kim's room?

5
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:27,994
Okay.

6
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,582
Are you okay, old lady?

7
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,037
They might actually do
something about you this time.

8
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,274
They can never do that.

9
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,444
Now,

10
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,848
we know their biggest weakness.

11
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,218
We just followed the orders

12
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,987
that they gave us.

13
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:17,130
Let's begin a face-to-face fight.

14
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,172
Was this really broken by a human?

15
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,829
Are you okay? You must be scared.

16
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,067
I'm okay. What about the culprit?

17
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,502
We haven't caught him yet.

18
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,976
Are you okay, Father?

19
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,278
I'm fine, as you can see.

20
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,951
Thank you for saving me.

21
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,257
Thank the Lord, not me.

22
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,330
I guess you meant it

23
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,332
when you said you prayed for me.

24
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,871
That's why you're in one piece.

25
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,675
The Lord doesn't like freeloaders.

26
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,479
You're awake, ma'am.

27
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,081
Hi.

28
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,151
What happened to your face?

29
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,788
I had a fight with my family.

30
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,025
Detective Gu, keep her company.
I have to go somewhere.

31
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,162
Where are you going?

32
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,533
Don't worry.

33
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,677
I don't care
about your personal information.

34
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,916
I'm asking this out of pure curiosity.

35
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,485
Who ordered you to kill Congressman Park?

36
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:20,987
Lawyer.

37
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,057
Bullshit. I know your Korean is good.

38
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,326
I saw your text.
Your grammar was better than mine.

39
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,533
Hang on a second.

40
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,602
I see.

41
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,106
-You're a junkie.
-Hey!

42
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,478
Sir, I think the man
who tried to kill Congressman Park

43
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,513
-is a junkie--
-This is an important case,

44
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,582
-so you investigate him yourself, Mr. Lee.
-Yes, sir.

45
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,584
I started it, so I will end it.

46
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,787
How dare you talk back
to the chief of police!

47
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,222
Get out of here!

48
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,590
Detective Seo.

49
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,193
Come on.

50
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,504
What's going on?

51
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,116
It's uncomfortable when it's dark, right?

52
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,685
Who are you?

53
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,330
No one should know
about Rising Moon and Diyabol.

54
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,299
Congressman Park is one thing,

55
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,902
but what's with the attempted murder
of Prosecutor Park?

56
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,605
We are not behind it, okay?

57
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,273
I'll look into it.

58
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,276
We don't have any more chance
to get rid of Congressman Park.

59
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,178
What if he wakes up?

60
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,114
We need to make sure
that no one finds out about Rising Moon.

61
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,516
That's more important.

62
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,520
Sir, could you please ask
your superiors for help?

63
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,121
Please ask the chief prosecutor as well.

64
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,111
-You rat.
-Mr. Hwang.

65
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,981
It was you who recommended
the junkie from Rising Moon.

66
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,517
I simply did as I was ordered.

67
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,821
Are you

68
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,723
blaming me now?

69
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,760
I'm not blaming you.

70
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,363
I'm just analyzing the cause of this.

71
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,167
And...

72
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,504
killing is not always the best solution.

73
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,507
Today,

74
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,943
I'm going to take some rest.

75
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,084
-Let's go.
-That little punk.

76
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,636
Why do you guys not have tattoos here?

77
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,475
Did you come here to find Diyabol, Father?

78
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,878
"Diyabol"? You mean "demon"?

79
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,547
What's that?

80
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,749
The guys that have tattoos
on their wrists.

81
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,585
It's the name of their gang.

82
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,088
They used to work under me,

83
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,223
but they left and made a gang themselves.

84
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,827
You came to the land of your ancestors.

85
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,695
Then you should try
to live a diligent life.

86
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,664
But all you do is bad stuff.

87
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,700
Still, we don't do drugs.

88
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,441
Do they do drugs?

89
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,245
-No.
-Where are they?

90
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,015
Club Rising Moon at Gudam Intersection.

91
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,985
Why are you looking for them?
Did they cause trouble again?

92
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,288
It's not a big deal.

93
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,089
They tried to kill
a congressman and a prosecutor.

94
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,458
Crazy bastards.

95
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,496
Then they're not there.

96
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,697
By now...

97
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,304
They got on a boat, didn't they?

98
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,173
No, not a boat.
They definitely didn't get on a boat.

99
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,210
You're so transparent. Thank you.

100
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,950
Stop staring at me.

101
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,390
Detective Seo,
move him to the detention center.

102
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,626
But he didn't testify properly.
We can't move him yet.

103
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,860
He did testify.

104
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,731
He said he didn't like Congressman Park's
immigrant policy, so he tried to kill him.

105
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,167
Immigrant policy?

106
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,769
Then he should be punished in Korea.

107
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,105
He's already
a drug-related criminal in Russia.

108
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,874
We need to send him back
according to the international treaty.

109
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,276
We can't, sir.

110
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,578
His motivation is nonsense.

111
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,847
This is just not right.

112
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,948
Seo Seung-a!

113
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,519
It's an order from the chief. Just do it.

114
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,366
He was not just an ordinary burglar.
I'm sure of it.

115
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,872
When will you ever finish it?

116
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,041
The cold wind keeps coming in.

117
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,444
Don't worry. Just wait there.

118
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,214
I renovate my house on my own too.

119
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,382
I'll get it done perfectly.

120
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,454
My curtains. My wallpaper.

121
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,804
Just leave it. I can handle the wind.

122
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,172
Okay.

123
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,211
When I was young,
being cold like this was nothing.

124
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,080
This is cold enough

125
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,916
to freeze my whole body.

126
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,185
Why don't you take a seat and rest?

127
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,521
Okay.

128
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,292
It looks like you get along well
with Father Kim these days.

129
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,627
Get along well?

130
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,663
If he wasn't a priest,
I would have slapped his face already.

131
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,599
Did you make up your mind now?
To be on Father Kim's side?

132
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,470
No. What do you mean by that?

133
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,872
You shouldn't make any mistake this time.

134
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,209
If things go wrong this time, we will be
all dead meat. You know that, right?

135
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,211
It's not like what you think.

136
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,819
Hey, Detective Seo. What's up?

137
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,188
What? Really?

138
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,391
Okay. I'll get back to the police station.

139
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,992
Okay, bye.

140
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,032
Do you think you can be here by yourself?

141
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,801
-Would you like to come with me?
-I'm good.

142
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,437
He won't come again.

143
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,940
I'm really okay. You can go.

144
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,909
Okay, then. I'm sorry.

145
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,814
-Bye.
-Bye.

146
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,151
Why does the heater have to break now?

147
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,287
CRIMINAL DIVISION

148
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,824
Was the assaulter
sent to the detention center?

149
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,693
Yes, we heard he just left.

150
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,929
Did you call Incheon Port?

151
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,365
Yes. There's no boat
sailing directly to Russia today.

152
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,567
But there's a cargo ship

153
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,904
going to Vladivostok via Fukuoka,
and it departs at 11 p.m. from Pier 1.

154
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,640
-This is it.
-We have less than 40 minutes.

155
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,142
It'll take at least an hour to get there.

156
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,410
Call the police at the port
and ask for help. Let's go.

157
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,547
All the cops went
to the passenger terminal

158
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,149
to arrest smugglers there.

159
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,684
It's always like this.
Why does it have to be now?

160
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,720
Then let's catch them.

161
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,388
I think we can catch up with them
if we hurry.

162
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,023
How can we get there in 40 minutes?

163
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,692
Detective Seo and I will go there.
I want you to look into Rising Moon.

164
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,461
Rising Moon? Why?

165
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,164
Those who attacked Congressman Park
and Prosecutor Park are all from there.

166
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,199
Are they all Diyabol then?

167
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,337
DAEBEOM TRADING

168
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,643
My goodness!

169
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,613
Hey, Mr. Jang!

170
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,249
It's nice to see you.

171
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,219
What are you doing? That's old-school.
You're lagging behind the trend.

172
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,254
-What's trendy then?
-This is what they do these days.

173
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,556
Don't you know this?

174
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,129
It's nice to see you.

175
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,432
Mr. Jang.
Seeing you always makes me feel good.

176
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,834
We should grab a drink.

177
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,036
We already did. You want to drink more?

178
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,071
That was an appetizer.

179
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,540
There's a new bar
at the Damsu Intersection.

180
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,043
Where's the fun in drinking without you?

181
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,377
Come on. Please join me.

182
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,814
I guess your stomach can't take any more.
I'll go by myself them.

183
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,917
Don't be so hasty.

184
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,921
I can't now. Let's meet up after midnight.

185
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,957
Okay. Then I'll stay
in the office until midnight

186
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,291
and run to the bar straight away.

187
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,993
Mr. Jang. See you later then, okay?

188
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,462
You have to come, okay?

189
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,531
You're the best.

190
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,767
I guess we get along pretty well.

191
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,316
Will you turn that off?

192
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,823
Tell Anton to wire the money
before the weekend.

193
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,091
That's none of your business.

194
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,293
He always sends money after the weekend.

195
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,228
Follow me.

196
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,681
That took only 28 minutes.

197
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,085
So this is what they call a speeding taxi.

198
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,689
-Father.
-Let's go.

199
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,304
Hello, guys.

200
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,976
Don't get on the boat.

201
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,079
-Come with me.
-Who are you?

202
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,396
Detective Seo, take it easy.

203
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,131
Yes, sir.

204
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,702
Mister.

205
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,670
Come over here for a second.

206
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,107
Hey, Mister.

207
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,378
You're supposed to manage the port,

208
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,580
not help the smugglers.

209
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,882
Well...

210
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,120
It was for those
who want to go home but can't.

211
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,123
What a touching story.

212
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,163
It's a ledger.

213
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,632
You shipped a lot of people, didn't you?

214
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,536
You do business with Gojayev too, right?

215
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,071
Yes. Sometimes.

216
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,840
-Detective Seo?
-Yes.

217
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,642
What was the date of the day
when we lost the two witnesses?

218
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,613
It was February 13.

219
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,252
FEBRUARY 13, 1 MAN, 1 WOMAN
VLADIVOSTOK, PIER 2

220
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,687
Oh, right.

221
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,622
Wait! Let go of me!

222
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,358
This isn't what you promised!

223
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,860
I sent them in a bag.

224
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,396
Gojayev paid me so little, so...

225
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,669
Who is receiving them in Vladivostok?

226
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,375
You should be able to find out

227
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,277
if that person sent the two
to somewhere else, right?

228
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,448
Quit stalling, will you?

229
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,253
This won't do.

230
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,855
He's too used to pleading the Fifth.

231
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,658
It's time to exorcise.

232
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,080
Hey, sir. It's cold out here.

233
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,415
Hey.

234
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,352
Hae-il, it's been a long time.

235
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,154
How have you been?

236
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,392
Let's catch up later.
I heard you're in Vladivostok now.

237
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,096
Yes. I'm in Sakhalin today,
but I'm heading back tomorrow.

238
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,131
Why do you ask?

239
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,833
Could you do me a favor

240
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,434
and keep this secret from the chief?

241
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,884
Please excuse me for saying this.

242
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,020
I think how you tried to remove
a serving prosecutor

243
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,623
was a very dangerous move.

244
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,291
So why did she

245
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,461
have to visit the singer in the hospital?

246
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,965
I think it's a bit hasty
to see the situation that way--

247
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,000
If you get swayed
by your conscience or whatever,

248
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,535
you will crumble in no time.

249
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,170
We must stop her before it's too late.

250
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,440
If things go wrong,

251
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,744
all the blame might fall on you.

252
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:07,946
And that blame

253
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,983
is something you must block for me.

254
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,454
Isn't that why my father put you there?

255
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,792
I'll let you off
with just a warning this time.

256
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,195
If this happens again,

257
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,198
you'll be held responsible too.

258
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,124
The first thing we need to check
is who designed this.

259
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,567
-Goodbye!
-Bye!

260
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:06,138
-Don't talk.
-I'm sorry, fatso.

261
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,009
Of course you're here.

262
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,017
Well done. Where's Father Kim?

263
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,620
Bring him in. I'll examine him
and write the report.

264
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,021
I'll deal with him.

265
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,731
-Come on in.
-Don't you think this is unfair?

266
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,534
I'm the team leader. Don't challenge me!

267
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,004
If we do our job like this,
who would trust us?

268
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,607
Drop it, Detective Seo.

269
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,394
Being alone is scarier than I thought.

270
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,865
Gosh...

271
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,571
I'm not scared.

272
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,974
I'm not scared at all.

273
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,609
Goodness!

274
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:26,885
Hello?

275
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,089
Okay. I'll be right there.

276
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,042
Damn...

277
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,344
Are you the priest?

278
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,681
The priest that beats people up.
The word got around.

279
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,883
I came just to take a look.

280
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,820
But you shouldn't put a cross
and a statue of Virgin Mary here.

281
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,089
Bring them. Put them away.

282
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,292
We're all Catholics.

283
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,394
Whether to put them away or not
is up to us.

284
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,029
Is that so?

285
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,897
Then I'll put you guys away first.

286
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,200
What is he saying?

287
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,945
Gosh, there are a lot of you.

288
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,257
Damn it. Why are there so many of them?

289
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,127
I didn't know there were so many of them.

290
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,334
SEOUL GUDAM POLICE STATION

291
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,270
Where's the culprit?
I heard he was caught.

292
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,407
We moved him to the detention center.

293
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,309
Who told you to do that?

294
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,278
He's wanted in Russia for dealing drugs,

295
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,546
so he'll be repatriated.

296
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,948
You sent him away
without hearing anything from the victim?

297
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,784
He admitted to the crime.

298
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,086
He admitted that he broke in
to rob and murder you.

299
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,188
Are you kidding me?

300
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,023
Who said you could
just send him like that?

301
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,859
What if it wasn't his purpose?
What will you do then?

302
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,929
The chance of that seemed very low.

303
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,697
Forget it. Bring him back now.

304
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,300
Bring him back right now!

305
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,702
He's transferred already. I can't do that.

306
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,738
What the...

307
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,908
I knew this police station was a mess,
but what the hell?

308
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,577
Ma'am, you're going too far.

309
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,878
She's right. You are a mess.

310
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,547
I almost died.

311
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,217
You sent away the guy who attacked
Congressman Park too, right?

312
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,953
Did you do that?

313
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,163
Hey, you. Where are you going?

314
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,033
By the way, I should put this here.

315
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,801
-Detective Na.
-Yes, Father.

316
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:30,936
-Could you help me?
-Sure.

317
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,808
So he took the cross
and the statue of Virgin Mary?

318
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,810
What kind of a priest does that?

319
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,147
Consider yourself lucky that he ran away.

320
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,016
If he wasn't outnumbered,
you would have all died.

321
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,685
Is he that good at fighting?

322
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,222
He crushed Gojayev's boys long ago.

323
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,093
By the way, the guy who attacked
Congressman Park

324
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,496
and the guy who attacked
Prosecutor Park are friends?

325
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,931
Yes, sir. They're best friends.

326
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,134
I'm sorry we failed
to kill Congressman Park.

327
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,172
It's okay. It's better that way.

328
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:12,110
By the way,
who wanted Prosecutor Park killed?

329
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,316
It's Kim Geon-yong of Hanju Group.

330
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,520
Oh, my.

331
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,357
Why did it have to happen on the same day?

332
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,928
Do you have any ideas

333
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,863
who might have wanted to kill you?

334
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,538
I saw Chief Prosecutor Kang Seok-tae
coming out of Rising Moon earlier.

335
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,079
Chief Kang, Rising Moon,
and something only you know.

336
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:49,681
Do they ring any bell?

337
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,019
Let me give you a tip.

338
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,221
Killers usually follow their targets
for at least a day

339
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,323
before they kill them.

340
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,893
In order to see whom their targets meet
and decide when to kill the targets.

341
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,100
If there was someone following you,
it was definitely a planned murder.

342
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,371
Where did you go today?

343
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,912
Hurry up and tell me.
I'm an expert in this area.

344
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,417
I was at the office,

345
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,588
and then I went to the hospital
to see Mr. Kim, the singer.

346
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,590
Is Mr. Kim

347
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,026
the man who attempted suicide
because of the meth incident?

348
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,495
That's right.

349
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,632
-Why did you go there?
-Well...

350
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,368
I just wanted to check how he's doing.

351
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,305
And I came home
straight from the hospital.

352
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,048
What time did you arrive at the hospital?

353
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,552
When was it?

354
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,629
Do you think you can be alone?

355
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,697
I'm not scared of anything,

356
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,866
but the wind keeps coming into the place.

357
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,371
I'll just freeze to death.
It's no big deal.

358
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,006
Bye, then.

359
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,227
Stop looking back.
Pack your stuff and bring them down.

360
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,195
Why?

361
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,065
Why should I do that? Why?

362
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,412
Oh, my. Sister Angela.
You must have been really scared.

363
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,746
What on earth happened?

364
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:03,815
Hello.

365
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,252
We have a temporary bedroom for you
in the annex.

366
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,953
You can sleep there.

367
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,057
I'm sure you haven't eaten either.

368
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,659
I'm okay. I'm not hungry.

369
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,494
Give her some food.

370
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,463
Her stomach sounded like
water pipes on the way here.

371
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,952
We have some cold rice too,
so let us know if you need it.

372
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,688
Okay.

373
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,658
Why aren't you coming on Sundays?

374
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,494
Well...

375
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,597
I have been going through a lot recently.

376
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,933
We are very well aware

377
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:59,571
that you are in an awkward situation
with Father Kim

378
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,372
because of Father Lee's case.

379
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,844
We are also well aware of what you do.

380
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,047
I'm not saying this
to make you feel uncomfortable.

381
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,516
I'm saying this
to make you feel comfortable.

382
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:14,953
Thank you.

383
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,222
Father Lee

384
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,825
had special affection for you,
Sister Angela.

385
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,229
He said you did the same job as the Lord.

386
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,099
He said you might be inexperienced yet,

387
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,336
but you would be good like the Lord
one day.

388
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,172
He told us to bless you.

389
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,310
Thank you, Father.

390
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,923
Today, your tough daughter
almost went to you...

391
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,327
She almost went to hell.

392
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,268
I'm sure you saved her life
for good reason.

393
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,605
But is she aware of the fact

394
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,810
that the chance to repent
is the biggest blessing?

395
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,584
Why did you call me out
so early in the morning?

396
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,186
We could have just talked later.

397
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,554
It's urgent.

398
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,889
Brief me about the information
you got from Jang Ryong.

399
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,792
Our target is Chief Nam, right?

400
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,429
Then what Jang Ryong said
about Rising Moon completely makes sense.

401
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,464
The real owners of Rising Moon

402
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,900
are Chief Nam, Congressman Park,
Chief Prosecutor Kang,

403
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,002
Director Jeong, and Hwang Cheol-beom.

404
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,538
Everyone knows that.

405
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,542
I heard Chief Nam's share was the largest.

406
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,879
The police's protection is crucial,

407
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,280
so no wonder he takes the most.

408
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,583
And there's a guy called Anton.

409
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,018
He's the general manager
and the leader of Diyabol.

410
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,188
Using the drug, he attracts
the second-generation millionaires,

411
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,191
second-generation high-ranking officials,
and celebrities.

412
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,560
And the key person among them

413
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,330
is the son of Hanju Group family,
Kim Geon-yong.

414
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:09,067
They create a community like that
and protect each other.

415
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,435
That's right.

416
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,504
The prosecution, the police,
talent agencies, and corporations

417
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:14,772
are all in this together.

418
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,774
I guess things that they can't handle

419
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,209
will be sent to higher authorities.

420
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,544
You're right.

421
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,713
But Jang Ryong said he doesn't know

422
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,181
who the higher authorities are.

423
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,450
So the most corrupted part

424
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,518
was the most hidden.

425
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,587
Their guests are millionaires
and celebrities.

426
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,755
Plus they deal with drugs.

427
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,258
-They must make a lot of profit.
-They do.

428
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,995
He said 60 percent of the cartel's profit
came from Rising Moon.

429
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,830
Then if we bring Rising Moon down,

430
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,466
it will seriously damage the cartel.

431
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,567
Of course.

432
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,436
It's been two years since it was founded.

433
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,305
I wonder where all the money goes.

434
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,773
They can't keep it in banks.

435
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,608
And it will be hard to keep it as cash.

436
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,881
-What's wrong?
-If...

437
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,384
If they couldn't hold out anymore

438
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,420
and needed something like a bank...

439
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,923
"Something like a bank"?

440
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,994
-A foundation?
-That's right. A foundation.

441
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,264
It's the biggest
and most efficient washing machine.

442
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,035
That's why they were so rushed
to take over the welfare organization.

443
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,603
So they could establish a foundation.

444
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:23,374
Rising Moon is what killed Father Lee.

445
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,045
Hwang Cheol-beom, that dog,

446
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,414
is now trying to bite its owner.

447
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,516
Well, it's expected.

448
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,485
By the way, I heard
Kim Hae-il went to Rising Moon.

449
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:36,587
How did you know that?

450
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,691
Our company always gets updated

451
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,559
with anything about Rising Moon.

452
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,428
No matter how hard we try,

453
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,496
we can't seem to hide it from the NIS.

454
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,899
Those who drink, get high,

455
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,300
and seek for love

456
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,369
are people we can't really touch.

457
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,539
So you don't need to worry so much.

458
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,475
Gosh, I'm getting sick of this.

459
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,944
Mr. Lee. Let's straighten this out.

460
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,180
The priest and the dog.

461
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,414
Sure.

462
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,083
We should straighten it out.

463
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,386
But we might have to change

464
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,722
the way we catch them.

465
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,098
Hey.

466
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,334
I thought I gave you some time to think.

467
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,137
Why did you ignore my last advice?

468
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,307
Why? Tell me!

469
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,045
-You caused this.
-Make it short.

470
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,248
This is the last time

471
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,317
we meet like this.

472
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,186
It's a war.

473
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,907
Ma'am, are you all right?

474
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,176
I was so surprised to hear about you.

475
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,045
Don't worry. I'm not going to die.

476
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,714
I'm a phoenix.

477
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,983
Phoenix Seon!

478
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,557
Ma'am, Detective Seo
from Gudam Police Station

479
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,292
sent us a CCTV footage.

480
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,660
A CCTV footage?

481
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,896
She said it was
under Father Kim Hae-il's order.

482
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,832
There you go.

483
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,202
Remember that man in a jacket
following you.

484
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,910
The same person keeps following you.

485
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,847
He's watching you here.

486
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,753
This is really creepy.

487
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,627
Let me give you a tip.
Killers usually follow their targets for

488
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,663
at least a day before they kill them.

489
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:02,300
In order to see whom their targets meet
and decide when to kill the targets.

490
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,404
If there was someone following you,
it was definitely a planned murder.

491
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,479
May I ask you one question?

492
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,548
Who gave the order to kill me?

493
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,985
"Burglary"?

494
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,921
You know I won't buy it nor accept it.

495
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,790
Why did you have to provide a reason?

496
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,429
You know how sensitive
and irrational Kim Geon-yong is.

497
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,132
Why did you have to make him
suspicious of you?

498
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,235
Was visiting Mr. Kim that serious a sin?

499
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,739
Is killing a person
as easy as killing a cockroach

500
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,774
to Kim Geon-yong?

501
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,110
"Easy"? Do you really not know the answer?

502
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,179
I know you do.

503
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,882
I'm a prosecutor of Korea.

504
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,217
I smoothed it over
so he won't make this a bigger deal.

505
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,521
From now on, don't you go near
Rising Moon or Mr. Kim.

506
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,055
If this happens again,

507
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,992
I can't help you anymore.
Do you understand?

508
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,139
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KANG SEOK-TAE'S OFFICE

509
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,176
Is my life a game item or what?

510
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,479
Do you think you can toy with it
however you want?

511
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,149
Those fucking...

512
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,123
We can't just be sitting in church.

513
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,759
To bring our members back,

514
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,394
we must be out in the field.

515
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,162
I agree,

516
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,899
but I'm not sure if we can convince them
by just telling them to come back.

517
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,803
That won't be enough, of course.

518
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,940
We will get closer to them
and earn their trust.

519
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,343
We will show them
God's justice through action...

520
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,779
I will give them
annual confession fliers too.

521
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,981
We'll start with Zone One.

522
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,420
Here we go.

523
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,923
Gosh, I lost points.

524
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,060
-Hello, Sister Anes.
-Hi.

525
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,866
Well, it's been a while
since I saw you in the church.

526
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,768
So I came to see you.

527
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,770
No one's going. That's why I'm not going.

528
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,140
-They're all mine.
-Oh, my.

529
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,110
-Give me 120 won.
-Fine. Here.

530
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,846
With these cards,

531
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,449
you owe me 480 won.

532
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,318
Gosh, my precious 480 won.

533
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,921
Aren't you coming to the church?

534
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,956
That's not important.

535
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,926
I just lost 3,000 won.

536
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,231
If I help you win some money,

537
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,833
will you come to church?

538
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,435
Sure, I will.

539
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,338
I will bring all my friends with me.

540
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,809
I'm going to help Sister Anes
starting from the next round.

541
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,911
-Is that okay with you?
-Sure.

542
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:09,687
GUDAM POLICE STATION, CHIEF NAM SEOK-GU

543
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,125
Who are you?

544
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,264
Oh, my. Look who this is.

545
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,300
Aren't you the owner of Rising Moon?

546
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:23,567
What?

547
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,904
Sir, by the way, where did you buy
the police uniform?

548
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,307
From Pyeonghwa Market or on the internet?

549
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,441
Goodness.

550
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,209
Keep it down.

551
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,011
Oh, and about Rising Moon,

552
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,882
I'm going to make it burn like hell.

553
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,019
Do you think that will be easy?

554
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,255
Do you think you can just do
however you want?

555
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,193
I'm not sure if I can do however I want,

556
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,130
but God will do however he wants.

557
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,768
Oh, by the way, just in case
you get crushed later,

558
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,937
stop troubling Korea

559
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,439
and go back to your island.

560
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,441
Why don't you change your name too?

561
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,744
Change it to something
like Nambe or Nakamura.

562
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,245
What the...

563
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,215
Put that down.

564
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,753
You take money from everyone,

565
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,088
and yet you're so stingy with yours.

566
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,896
My goodness.

567
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,233
Do you know how expensive it is?

568
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,807
Both cards aren't good. What do I do?

569
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,309
Which one should I put down?

570
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,614
-Yes!
-Oh, my.

571
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:45,850
Well done.

572
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,420
It has to be a dud!

573
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,206
Look at all the points I've earned.

574
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:10,808
Forty-seven, forty-eight...

575
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,378
That would be 370.

576
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,680
Since we're feeling good,

577
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,383
just get 3,000 won from each of them.

578
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,418
Okay.

579
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,420
You heard her.
You can give me 3,000 won only.

580
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,122
You're coming to church from now, right?

581
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,124
Fine. I will.

582
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,326
I will bring everyone with me.

583
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,996
Please help me again next time.

584
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,097
Sure, I will.

585
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,700
Father.

586
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,403
Let's go.

587
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,708
How dare you try to take away my life.

588
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,879
I don't need
any support whatsoever from you.

589
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,247
I will crush

590
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,751
everyone who was involved in the plot

591
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,521
or turned a blind eye to it.

592
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,726
You just stepped on poop.

593
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,896
Poop that will never come off

594
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,798
from your shoes.

595
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,336
You're all dead!

596
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,075
What? You want to investigate Rising Moon?

597
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,445
Yes. Let's dig out everything

598
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,114
until there's nothing left to dig.

599
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,217
But we don't know
who could possibly be related to it.

600
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,319
It's too risky.

601
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,787
I'm going to do it.

602
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,289
I, Phoenix Seon, will do it.

603
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,593
The important thing
is that we don't have an ally.

604
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,896
You can't do this alone. It's impossible.

605
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,064
Ally?

606
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,266
That's a good point.

607
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,802
I can make one.

608
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,906
What brings you here at this hour?

609
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,980
What happened to your eyes?
Did you change your makeup?

610
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,615
I have a suggestion.

611
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,187
Let's join hands.

612
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,331
"Join hands"?

613
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,179
-Why, all of a sudden?
-We need to bring them down.

614
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,283
To be specific, some people in there.

615
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,286
Are those people related
to the attack on you?

616
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,687
Are you in or not?

617
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:40,291
This is not for justice. It's for revenge.

618
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,459
It is. I'm doing this to take revenge.

619
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,962
Bloody revenge, smart revenge,
the best revenge.

620
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,430
Then I can't join hands with you.

621
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,098
You can't take bloody revenge
with a priest.

622
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,567
That's nonsense.

623
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,702
We'll both get what we want.

624
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,238
You can take revenge on
the people of Gudam

625
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,140
and find evidence for Father Lee's case.

626
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,944
And I can take my revenge
and bring justice to this society.

627
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,747
No, I can't do that.

628
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,182
Just imagine.

629
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,918
Imagine what will happen
if the craziest woman in Seocho-dong

630
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,720
becomes your ally.

631
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,457
I'm going to be your ally.

632
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:14,825
Isn't that amazing?

633
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,527
Sounds convincing, right?

634
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,728
I know it does.

635
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:23,033
The crazy woman of the area.
I'd like that, but...

636
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,771
Gosh. No, I can't.

637
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,674
One more thing. If this works out,

638
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,310
I'll give you information
about Father Lee's case.

639
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,515
-Are you sure?
-Of course. Do you want it notarized?

640
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,385
Give me some time to think.

641
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,087
I need to talk to my team members.

642
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,122
I thought you worked alone.
You have a team?

643
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,392
I have Team Tsunami.

644
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,228
Team Tsunami? Goodness.

645
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,800
I'll give you time to think
until the evening. Why?

646
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,937
Because I'm going to start tonight.

647
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,806
If this gets out,

648
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,541
won't this be a national scandal?

649
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,911
I can assure you of this.
It won't do anything.

650
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,947
Only a few of their underlings
will be affected.

651
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,315
The leaders won't be affected at all.

652
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:16,086
You know why?
Because this is the Republic of Korea.

653
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,023
That's why I want to hear your opinions.

654
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,592
What do you think? Should we go for it?

655
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,328
I say we go for it.
Whatever her purpose is,

656
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,030
we will get what we want.

657
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,699
She doesn't sound like she would back off.

658
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,602
I think we can go for it.

659
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:33,637
If you don't want to, we don't have to.

660
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:34,938
That's not it.

661
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,542
The things is...

662
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,112
there's something that bothers me.

663
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,083
What is it, Dae-yeong?

664
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,863
What are you doing now?

665
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,499
I don't think that chair is yours.

666
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,001
The back and the seat of this chair

667
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,770
may be yours,

668
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,040
but aren't the five legs mine?

669
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,875
Why are you acting like this
since yesterday?

670
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,577
Do you have any idea

671
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,212
how hard it was to calm down Chief Kang?

672
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,685
Goodness.

673
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:26,423
You and those guys already abandoned me.

674
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:27,858
Did you think I didn't know?

675
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,829
Then you should have done better.

676
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,397
For our old friendship's sake,

677
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,300
I won't harm you or the other guys.

678
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,236
So don't you mess with me.

679
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:43,707
In other words, let's go separate ways.

680
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,977
And give me Congressman Park's share

681
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,079
from the secret safe.

682
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,016
I knew you would...

683
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,286
Just in case,

684
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,722
don't you think of killing me.

685
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,624
If I die,

686
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:04,328
the secret safe will be all burnt down.

687
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:14,204
Why are you saying this now?
You should have told me this!

688
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,107
I'm going to kill all those bastards.

689
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:20,477
He's right.
You should have told me this sooner.

690
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,179
I wanted to tell you guys too.

691
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,018
It's my fault, right?

692
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,054
I'm a sinner, right?

693
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,190
Gosh.

694
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,396
If you have told me about this,

695
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,533
I would have prayed for him.

696
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,203
Now, don't feel so bad about it.

697
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,438
We know it too.

698
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:54,244
I will.

699
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,885
I wish I could.

700
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,991
Do you think you can go back to
who you were if it weren't for his family?

701
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,728
-What?
-Do you think you can be

702
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,631
the old you, a righteous, fiery,

703
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:18,035
and spirited detective?

704
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:28,979
Of course.

705
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,381
I can crush them all.

706
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,192
Okay, good.

707
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:12,489
Let me ask you one thing.

708
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,359
Are you sure you're doing this
to take revenge?

709
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,827
Yes, why?

710
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,830
Are you sure it's not because you're angry
about what you have been doing?

711
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,432
I'm sure it's not.

712
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,635
I asked just to be sure.

713
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,404
I thought you might have wanted
to make amends through this.

714
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,409
You thought too much, Father.

715
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,044
If that's the case,

716
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:35,946
I would gladly

717
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,882
help you take revenge.

718
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,951
If not, will you not help me?

719
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,922
Are you in or not?

720
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:50,794
Let's

721
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,566
-join hands.
-Okay. Awesome!

722
00:48:58,568 --> 00:48:59,903
Okay, let's do this.

723
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,604
SEARCH WARRANT

724
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,677
This is an extremely rare case,

725
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,680
but I, a prosecutor,
issued the warrant myself and brought it.

726
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,415
I want to go with you to the scene.

727
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,051
This is my first time. I'm excited.

728
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,557
I know what you guys are like,

729
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:54,691
so I won't force you.

730
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,660
If you don't want to come,
you don't have to.

731
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,463
Just so you know, no one
from the drug squad wanted to come.

732
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:06,336
All right. I'm going to Rising Moon now.

733
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,139
Come and join me if you want.

734
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,508
-Follow me.
-I'm in.

735
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,012
Father.

736
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,446
You're going to the church, right?

737
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,421
Dae-yeong, please tell me
you're going to the bathroom.

738
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:25,522
Detective Seo.

739
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,058
Hey, are you really going?

740
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:31,962
This is crazy.

741
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,888
PROSECUTOR PARK GYEONG-SEON

742
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,971
Who's the owner here?

743
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,476
Instead of talking to the owner,

744
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,812
you can talk to me, ma'am.

745
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,381
Hey.

746
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:28,218
That's not how you talk
to the elderly, you rude punk.

747
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,856
Whether you're a guest or a gangster,

748
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,192
if you took drugs, come on out.

749
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,494
Otherwise, we will come to you.

750
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,030
Hey, let's not make this harder.

751
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,799
The prosecutor has come herself.

752
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,234
Who cares?

753
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,604
We won't do anything, so suit yourself.

754
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,608
I guess I will have to rent
a shuttle bus to hell today.

755
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,276
I will give you one minute.

756
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,545
If you're a junkie, come on out.

757
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:59,182
Stand in a row!

758
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,319
How many time did I tell you?

759
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,154
The prosecutor has come herself.

760
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,590
I told you
there was going to be a problem.

761
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,758
I'll talk to her.

762
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,895
I don't think
she will listen to you right now.

763
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,631
And what's with that priest?

764
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,266
The priest is there too?

765
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,603
If my father finds this out, I'll be dead.

766
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,707
I'll take care of this my way,
so you take care of the rest.

767
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,308
Okay?

768
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,943
Wait, sir. Sir!

769
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,418
Sorry, guys.

770
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,089
I think we can just kill you as we please.

771
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,325
Get them!

772
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,169
They even have tools.

773
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:54,538
What's wrong with them?

774
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,306
They're high.

775
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,477
This isn't what we expected.

776
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,247
My gosh.

777
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,584
If you don't stop, I will shoot you.

778
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:10,587
She's clever.
You don't have to get physical.

779
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:11,588
Well done.

780
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,257
You should have told me
that you brought a gun.

781
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,193
If they come near,
shoot them on their legs.

782
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,295
-Shoot them.
-Shoot them.

783
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,729
Those are all blank bullets.

784
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,031
What?

785
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,673
They won't mind dying.
They'll just push through.

786
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,508
If we stay here, we will all die.

787
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,377
I knew this would happen,

788
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,980
and I prepared the breakwater.

789
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:38,548
Breakwater?

790
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:44,221
-Choco!
-Yes, Father.

791
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,086
Hi, Choco is here.

792
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,723
Choco, did you register yourself
as a new church member?

793
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,224
Yes, Father.

794
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,861
Why is he so big?
Are there two people in there?

795
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,830
I and Choco will take care of them.

796
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,132
Detective Gu, Detective Seo,
take Prosecutor Park outside.

797
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,233
What?

798
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,237
As a prosecutor, I won't chicken out.
That would be embarrassing.

799
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,906
Wouldn't it be better
to stay alive than die?

800
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,509
How dare you look
at a prosecutor like that.

801
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:40,677
Drop that, you punks.

802
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:43,179
-Detective Seo.
-Yes, sir.

803
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,881
I'm not going.

804
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,483
-Let's go.
-Hey, wait.

805
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:47,651
You are all dead!

806
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,986
Don't hesitate. Leave right away.

807
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,188
After I escort the prosecutor out,
I'll come back.

808
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,352
Wait. There you go!

809
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,120
Awesome!

810
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:26,856
What are you doing?

811
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,928
Why are there so many of them
out here too?

812
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,931
Detective Seo,
get her in the car and leave.

813
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,800
What are you talking about?
Give me a bat too.

814
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,368
I will kill all of them.

815
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,569
Can you handle it alone?

816
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:42,138
Don't worry. These days,
I'm getting my old skills back.

817
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:43,773
-Go now!
-Please be careful.

818
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,608
Don't get hurt, Mr. Lucky Bag.

819
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,321
Ms. Park. Detective Gu.

820
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,958
It looks like we're in big trouble.

821
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,193
I know. What's going on?

822
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,061
Why am I at a fighting scene again?

823
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,373
Oh, my gosh!

824
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:55,345
Oh, my.

825
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,952
Hey, there are way too many of them.
What do we do?

826
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,654
Ms. Park is in danger.

827
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:05,955
What do we do?

828
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,223
You bastards!

829
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,959
Oh, my goodness!

830
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,364
-No!
-Yo-han!

831
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,202
Oh, no. Yo-han.

832
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:21,738
Are you okay?

833
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,578
You bastard! How could you...

834
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,415
Wait there!

835
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,471
Songsak.

836
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:56,773
There you go. One, two.

837
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:21,097
A tiger that protects the King.

838
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,566
Songsak!

839
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,540
Songsak.

840
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:08,945
-Well done.
-Songsak.

841
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:10,179
You're such a good fighter.

842
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,148
I will help you too, Father.

843
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:13,416
ONE BY ONE, THEY BECOME HEROES

844
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,719
-Could you teach me too?
-Did you hear that?

845
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,122
We need someone to play
the culprit to be repatriated.

846
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,891
It's an important role.
We need a good actor.

847
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,294
Father Han is an actor type...

848
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,529
-Let's do this.
-Let's go.

849
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,832
THE AVENGERS ARE BORN

850
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,802
My fury has gone up five points.

851
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,707
