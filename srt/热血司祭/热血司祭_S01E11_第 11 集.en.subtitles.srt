1
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,133
ALL PLACES, INCIDENTS AND NAMES

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,433
IN THIS DRAMA ARE A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,333
Where did the toilet paper come from?

4
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:40,100
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

5
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:44,566
This can't be happening. Shit.

6
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:52,100
Oh, no.

7
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:58,033
I can't believe
I suddenly don't want to go.

8
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:28,233
You hit a prosecutor in the neck.

9
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,433
I had no choice.

10
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,300
Wouldn't this be dangerous though?

11
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:34,233
-In what way?
-She was about to poop.

12
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,566
What if she shits her pants in her sleep?

13
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,000
She has a reputation, you know.

14
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,366
Whatever.

15
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:07,800
Seriously?

16
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,600
Sorry. I should do some squats.

17
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:10,800
Darn it.

18
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,200
Who are you people?

19
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,366
What happened?

20
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,100
They came from the second floor.

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,300
-Sir.
-What is it?

22
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,533
Two intruders escaped
through the second floor.

23
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:52,933
What?

24
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,333
Ms. Park?

25
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:57,700
Ms. Park!

26
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,200
Ms. Park…

27
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:01,633
Ms. Park.

28
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,466
Ms. Park…

29
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,100
Ms. Park? Hold on.

30
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:10,600
Are you all right?

31
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,200
Are you all right?

32
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,466
Yes.

33
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,600
The priest and cop
running away from thugs?

34
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,666
What is this madness?

35
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,266
Anyone would say we're the bad guys.

36
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,700
Why the hell do you have that on?

37
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,133
I couldn't let my face show either.

38
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:00,133
What did you carry around in this though?

39
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,000
My dirty underwear.

40
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,133
You can throw up later.

41
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
Right now, we need to get out of here.

42
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:15,000
We caught a burglary. Team Two, assemble.

43
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,966
We've been called
to Hwang's vacation home.

44
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,033
Who calls Violent Crimes for a burglary?

45
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
A burglary?

46
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:23,333
What are you talking about?

47
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,933
What is that?

48
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:29,966
We couldn't leave empty-handed.

49
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:31,800
I had to sell the part, right?

50
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,566
So you chose to be a loser?

51
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:35,533
Couldn't you have taken

52
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
a more expensive one then?

53
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,966
It looks expensive to me.

54
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,133
Anyway, I'll head to the cathedral.

55
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,766
-Hold on.
-What now?

56
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,066
Take this.

57
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:47,866
-Why me?
-I can't have it on me.

58
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:48,966
Should I?

59
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,200
Damn it!

60
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,500
Get in the car.

61
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:57,566
We have to go back there?

62
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,900
We have to go back?

63
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,066
Back to where we just came from?

64
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,066
This too.

65
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,466
His eyes had a decadent yet sexy look.

66
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,733
You didn't see his face, right?

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
He had on a mask.

68
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,400
How many times must I tell you?

69
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:04,700
I thought you could've
remembered something new.

70
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:05,933
There's this.

71
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,033
They were wearing shoe covers
to hide their shoe prints.

72
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,966
-There was also an orangutan.
-An orangutan?

73
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,366
-No, was it Bigfoot?
-Bigfoot?

74
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,066
-Caesar…
-Caesar?

75
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:24,266
Don't mind my blabbing.

76
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,100
So they were in disguise.

77
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,400
Sly bastards.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,266
Why haven't I seen you guys
since noon today?

79
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,366
The suspect of another case was spotted,

80
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:37,166
so we've been after him.

81
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,133
Where was the status report then?

82
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,333
Have you not yet figured out
why they broke in?

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,733
I'm afraid not.

84
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,666
Stolen items.

85
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:46,500
Was there anything stolen?

86
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,966
Something was taken from upstairs.

87
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,166
-See? Of course.
-What was taken?

88
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
A flask, sir.

89
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,366
A flask? That doesn't sound so expensive.

90
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,166
It was made from a Japanese master
by the name of Yamaguchi Toshio.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,366
The whole set is worth 80 million won.

92
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:11,066
What? 80 million won?

93
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,300
It wouldn't be 8,000 won, would it?

94
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,366
The burglar knows his art.

95
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:19,800
I'd like to make an assumption
that he's a professional thief.

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,866
What about the security cameras
or witnesses?

97
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,466
The camera footage is a no-go.

98
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,900
The footage is too messy
for us to see anything.

99
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:30,766
Also, the employees who went after them
said that there was another person.

100
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,333
Did they give you a description?

101
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,733
They only caught a glimpse

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,866
since this person came out of nowhere.

103
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:38,200
The culprit had a slender build

104
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,233
and wore a plastic bag on its face.

105
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:43,133
He or she was also wearing
black pants and a black jacket.

106
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,433
What's notable is that
the culprit was wearing white socks.

107
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,966
Detective Seo.

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,766
Yes, sir?

109
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,400
What is it about?

110
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,966
I told you not to dress like that.

111
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:17,133
It's the go-to outfit for criminals.

112
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,033
See how you fit the description?

113
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,300
This must be her only outfit.

114
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,600
Why don't we swap clothes?

115
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,966
My, one might think you're a thief.

116
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,233
She's the thief!

117
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:29,233
-I told you you look like a suspect.
-She's the culprit!

118
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,700
-Enough!
-Quiet.

119
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,733
I don't care who they are.

120
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,766
Bring them to me in three days.

121
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:40,133
How dare he strike
a prosecutor in the neck?

122
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,600
That bastard.

123
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:43,799
-Hun-seok.
-Yes?

124
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,500
Drive Ms. Park home.

125
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,966
-Yes, sir.
-I'm good.

126
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,033
Detective Seo,

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,033
you'll drive me home.

128
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,066
Sorry? Me?

129
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:55,966
Hurry up!

130
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,366
We're here, ma'am.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,766
-You.
-Yes?

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
You like Father Kim, don't you?

133
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
What?

134
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,400
Yes, of course.

135
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,200
He's eccentric but a man of action.

136
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,100
Not as a person, as a guy.

137
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,433
What?

138
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,533
That's absurd.

139
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,666
You're wrong. You couldn't be more wrong.

140
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,233
I doubt that the slow-witted men
in your office know it,

141
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,666
but I can tell.

142
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:40,533
We're indeed good friends,

143
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,033
but you're barking up the wrong tree.

144
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,266
You're free to like whomever you want,

145
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,066
but priests can be expelled

146
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,333
if they're caught in a scandal.

147
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,100
If that happens, what would
the poor former priest make a living on?

148
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:53,600
Ms. Park, I'm afraid
you have it all wrong--

149
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,333
Watch your actions.

150
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:58,333
If it's too hard to let him go,

151
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,200
go to a Buddhist temple instead.

152
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,400
They serve great food, you know.

153
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,566
Bye!

154
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,266
Get going.

155
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:15,600
That bitch.

156
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,733
How did she find out?

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,133
I'm so embarrassed!

158
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,933
For now, it seems like a simple burglary.

159
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,666
What kind of security is that?

160
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,600
How can the place have been burglarized?

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,466
Were any bugs set around the house?

162
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,166
We did a full sweep,
but nothing was detected.

163
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,766
Isn't it a bit weird?

164
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,133
All evidence points to petty burglars.

165
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,866
Could they have been sent
by Chief Nam and Congressman Park?

166
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,133
They wouldn't have chosen this route.

167
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:48,033
Whatever it is,
we should hurry and deal with

168
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:49,666
the both of them.

169
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,466
Exactly.

170
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
The coroner from the hospital

171
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,833
agreed to do the DNA test on the sample.

172
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,233
Wow, how exciting…

173
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,766
Would it kill you
to actually sound excited?

174
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,700
Father, we'll keep regrouping here,

175
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,200
so get some rest for now.

176
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:12,966
I'm fine.

177
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,300
Just listen to me this once!

178
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,100
There's no need to yell, you know.

179
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:22,833
She's right. Listen to your pupil.

180
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:27,066
Hold on.
What does that make me to you then?

181
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,966
Am I your lacky?

182
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,466
Give me back my plastic bag.

183
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,833
That's enough.

184
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,233
By the way, do you still not know
who the man

185
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,933
in the glasses is?

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,333
I don't, but he seemed
like Ms. Park's boss.

187
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:48,600
Judging by how oily his voice was,
my guess is that he's of high rank.

188
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,733
So there's a player we don't know about.

189
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:54,300
I'll dig into
Ms. Park's department tomorrow.

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,966
That department looks like a mess already.

191
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,400
The district director, Ms. Park's boss,
and Hwang Cheol-beom are on one side.

192
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,900
Chief Nam and Congressman Park
are on the other.

193
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Is the Supreme Prosecutors' Office's
search and seizure connected too?

194
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,900
That's what they said
at the vacation home.

195
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:10,266
Chief Nam and Congressman Park got

196
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,866
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office involved.

197
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,800
You won't believe the fuss we made trying
to cover our tracks at the vacation home.

198
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,933
-Hold on!
-What now?

199
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,833
What did you do with the flask we took?

200
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,200
The flask? I put it up there…

201
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,066
Where did it go?

202
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,733
Everyone, I brought you some warm tea.

203
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,800
You all worked hard on this job,

204
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,466
so have some tea.

205
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,433
Where did you get this flask?

206
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,933
What? This?

207
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,533
Father Kim put it up there earlier.

208
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,433
It was for me to use, right?

209
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,966
Actually, this is what we stole--

210
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,200
What?

211
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,566
I picked it up in Insa-dong
because I liked the simplicity of it.

212
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,900
How much was it?

213
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,500
Eight thousand.

214
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:11,966
Eight thousand won.

215
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:14,866
Eight thousand won?

216
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,133
Add another four zeroes.

217
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,500
So 18,000 won?

218
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:25,200
Father Kim, you sure have an eye for…

219
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:27,866
-Gosh, that's hot!
-No!

220
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,666
Goodness gracious. It's a bit hot.

221
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:35,566
Anyway, please carry on with your meeting.

222
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:37,633
Good luck and enjoy your tea.

223
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,333
-You should rest then.
-Sure.

224
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,200
Why does he seem so familiar?

225
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,966
He seems as familiar
as the candy I used to eat as a child.

226
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,933
Gosh. No way. I doubt it.

227
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:16,133
How silly of me. No, that's impossible.

228
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,266
No way, right?

229
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,133
Hold on.

230
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,466
No, that's impossible.

231
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,833
My Lord,

232
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,633
Forgive me for I have sinned

233
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,533
by breaking into a man's house
and stealing from him.

234
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,466
I didn't mean to steal anything,
but that stupid detective…

235
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,766
Gosh, forgive me.

236
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,200
I must be going insane.
How dare I blame others.

237
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,633
I only took action this time
to seek justice for you,

238
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:53,733
so please forgive me this once.

239
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:59,066
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

240
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,866
Amen.

241
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,966
I'll take that smile
as a sign of your approval.

242
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,866
Goodness. Look who it is.

243
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:41,300
DAEBEOM TRADING

244
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:43,766
What brings you by this shabby place
so early in the morning?

245
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,733
You're right about it being shabby.

246
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,500
I've thought about it,
but I won't have any use for this car.

247
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,066
Driving it is a hassle too.

248
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,566
If you had told me,
I would've sent you a driver.

249
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:58,166
In what world

250
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,600
is a prosecutor driven around by a thug?

251
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,200
Didn't I tell you

252
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,633
that I'd be at your house
until you accept this?

253
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:12,033
Lurk around my house once again,
and I'll make sure to take out

254
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,966
a restraining order on you. Got it?

255
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:20,433
Hey, asswipes.

256
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,900
Are you seriously still frowning at me?

257
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,700
Want to die, you bastards?

258
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:32,000
Stop frowning and smile at the lady.

259
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,433
She's a prosecutor.

260
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,700
That's not better at all.

261
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,666
Anyway, I'm off.

262
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:44,366
Ms. Park,

263
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,333
how about some calamansi tea?

264
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,566
Not interested.

265
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:54,066
Sure. Be cheeky all you want.

266
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,966
I can easily have
the sample tested for DNA,

267
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
but there's an issue.

268
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,033
It's because the data
will be accessible by the NIS.

269
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,033
My lab and the NIS are partners.

270
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:09,133
Your enemies may have access
to the result.

271
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,366
What about another lab?

272
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:14,000
A friend of mine works
at D-Lab Corporation.

273
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,166
Then have them run the sample.

274
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,633
I'll lie about the sample
being top secret.

275
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,099
Sure, sounds good.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,133
Mr. Park.

277
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,000
You said you didn't drink coffee,

278
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,900
so I brought you some tea.

279
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,300
Thank you.

280
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:33,366
Can't you stop using that flask?

281
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,200
You must be well-acquainted
with Father Kim.

282
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,733
Right, I guess you can say that.

283
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,133
How long have you known him?

284
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,566
Well, many years.

285
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,600
That means you two go way back.

286
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,433
-Sister.
-Oh, right.

287
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,800
You know how I can't help it
when I'm curious.

288
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:53,966
I'll stop talking now.

289
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:59,500
Sister, you seem awfully familiar.

290
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,666
Gosh, that's hot.

291
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:02,566
-Me?
-Yes.

292
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,666
I know I recognize you from somewhere.

293
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,200
I have a common face.

294
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,433
You must be mistaken.

295
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,200
It's too hot for me to pour.
Father, could you do it instead?

296
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,533
I'm busy anyway, so I'll leave you to it.

297
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Goodness.

298
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,700
I'm sure I've seen her before.

299
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,133
Ms. Park, what's that on your neck?

300
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,933
I'll talk about it when I want to,
so don't ask.

301
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,366
Got it.

302
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:32,466
By the way,

303
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:37,433
I looked into Chief Nam
and Congressman Park.

304
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,700
You hit the jackpot, right?

305
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:41,300
If I didn't know them
as high ranking officials,

306
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,133
I would've called them a fucking--

307
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:46,566
They're bad people.

308
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:50,366
Look more thoroughly
into Congressman Park first.

309
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:51,966
-Find something explosive.
-Yes, ma'am.

310
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,400
What a piece of trash.

311
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:58,800
Ms. Seo, check out the testimony
that Congressman Park gave.

312
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,233
He doesn't even have
an ounce of conscience.

313
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,533
He's a sociopath.

314
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:07,233
-Is that so?
-Shit.

315
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,300
You're right. He is a piece of trash.

316
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,000
Old Lady, you know
you could make a great sociopath.

317
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,366
There are so many sociopath tests
on the internet,

318
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:17,766
so try it.

319
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:31,666
SOCIOPATH SELF-TEST

320
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:43,066
"You don't feel guilty

321
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,300
about hurting others."

322
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:46,800
I've never hurt others before.

323
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,233
Let's say I have though.

324
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,966
Two masked burglars broke into

325
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:55,066
Hwang Cheol-beom's vacation house
near Mount Yeongyu,

326
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:57,733
and stole a flask
which is worth around 80 million won.

327
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:59,300
Do we have any prints?

328
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,166
All the prints found
have been accounted for.

329
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,566
-The security camera footage?
-It can't be restored.

330
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:07,966
With all due respect,

331
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,000
but why are we investigating a burglary?

332
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,800
Because it's
Hwang Cheol-beom's vacation home

333
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,333
and it's of special larceny.

334
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,966
This is a common burglary,
not special larceny.

335
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,900
There was no damage done whatsoever!

336
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,366
The windowsill on the second floor

337
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:21,766
was slightly scraped by the culprits.

338
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,633
How is that considered a special larceny?

339
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:26,900
Hold on.

340
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:27,933
Why are you getting mad?

341
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,166
You're not the one who did it.

342
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,666
-Tell me about it.
-I find it weird too.

343
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,433
My, I thought I was for a second.

344
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,766
"You don't want to show others
your ugly side."

345
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,333
Isn't that the same for everyone?

346
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,800
16 OUT OF 16, YOU ARE A TRUE SOCIOPATH

347
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:15,333
Wow, nice. I knew it.

348
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,300
What is it, Ms. Park?

349
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:19,100
I took a test online.

350
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,566
Go ahead and guess what I scored.

351
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:22,700
I bet it was a perfect score.

352
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,366
You've never gotten any questions wrong
on a test before.

353
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,633
Right? Yes, I always get a perfect score.

354
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:32,533
I knew it.

355
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,300
Stop that. Just go and talk
to Congressman Park's victims.

356
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,200
As you can see on this map,
the distance from Hangok Rock

357
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,733
in Mount Yeongyu to Hwang's vacation home

358
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,200
is 1.2km.

359
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,133
However, this is a public hiking path.

360
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,433
There are hikers all throughout the day,

361
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:50,500
so I doubt the body was moved this way.

362
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,300
Is that the only route?

363
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,200
There are at the center of the mountain,

364
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,700
but that part is a restricted area.

365
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,100
It has been zoned off by the district
as a wildlife preserve.

366
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:02,033
Then that's where they cut across.

367
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:03,333
Who owns that area?

368
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,833
Gudam-gu, Father.

369
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,566
Then there must be
a security camera there.

370
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,533
There is, but this area

371
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,366
is being managed
by Hwang's Daebeom Development.

372
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:14,800
Shit. Then looking into it
won't do us any good.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,133
So we enter.

374
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,166
But it's a restricted area.

375
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:21,166
That has never stopped me before.

376
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:22,933
If you get caught,

377
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,900
they'll know something is up.

378
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,100
The vacation home
was only robbed yesterday.

379
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,833
Then…

380
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,333
I'll make sure I'm not recognized.

381
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:34,966
How?

382
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,666
Why do you look like a swindler?

383
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What?

384
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,900
Don't I look like a rich mogul?

385
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,833
I should've made you look homeless.

386
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,700
The security cameras have been taken down.

387
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,700
Don't tell me this is a burial ground too.

388
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,866
Don't be ridiculous.
Have you been watching

389
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,133
too many movies like Memoir of a Murderer?

390
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,866
That movie was filmed in a bamboo grove.

391
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,133
This place has no cameras
and quite isolated.

392
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,333
Could there be a better place
to commit crimes?

393
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,733
There's no definitive proof yet,

394
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:50,000
but it's plausible to estimate
that they took this route.

395
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:52,500
Find something that could be a clue.

396
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,600
Wait, I just saw a white sable.

397
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:08,500
-A what?
-A white sable.

398
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,000
Don't be absurd. I don't see anything.

399
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,666
I'm sure of it.

400
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:12,800
What are you doing over there?

401
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:18,833
Who are you people?

402
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:22,066
We're here to buy some land, an oilfield.

403
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,666
How charming.

404
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,366
Don't you know that
this is a restricted area?

405
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:32,866
Get lost already.

406
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:33,866
DAEBEOM DEVELOPMENT

407
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:35,933
Daebeom Development. Okay, let's go.

408
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,100
Also, young lady,
I can't believe you'd hike up here

409
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:44,366
wearing that short skirt. It's dangerous.

410
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:50,733
Mind your own business.

411
00:24:58,133 --> 00:24:59,200
You're back.

412
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,333
I have the recordings
of Congressman Park's victims.

413
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,733
Just like you said,
they started to spill everything

414
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,033
once I told them who we were after.

415
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,666
What did I tell you?
Pretend to stick your neck out for them

416
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:13,166
and they'll give you everything.

417
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,366
It shows that no one's been
on their side until now.

418
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:17,966
I listened to some of the recordings

419
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,933
and Congressman Park
is a first-grade asshole.

420
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,866
He committed every cruel crime there is,

421
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:28,566
but he's still this brazen.
What a sociopath!

422
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:31,000
Why are you going on
about assholes and sociopaths today?

423
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:32,266
Why?

424
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,366
They seem like the best words
to describe this man.

425
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:37,833
That's hardly the case.

426
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,933
You could also call him bastard, dickhead,
prick, son of a bitch, and many more.

427
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:43,766
I apologize, ma'am.

428
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,666
Will you start digging
into Congressman Park?

429
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:04,733
Yes. He's too rotten
which makes him an easy target.

430
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,100
All we need are confirmed facts.

431
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,433
Then bringing him down will be easier
than the others.

432
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,500
It's only that he hasn't been caught.

433
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:12,400
We all know he's a corrupt bastard.

434
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:23,366
Until when are you going
to be on the fence?

435
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,700
You're currently on neither side.

436
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,666
Don't you want to go back to square one?

437
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:33,200
How did you know that?

438
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,333
I only thought of that in my head.

439
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,033
Well, stop thinking and make your move.

440
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:39,633
My patience is running out.

441
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,533
Just leave me be for now and let me think.

442
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,833
Is there a reason why
you can't be back at square one?

443
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:48,733
Are you being blackmailed?

444
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,466
It's not like that.
I'll tell you about it later.

445
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,500
Detective Seo found out
who Ms. Park's boss is.

446
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,233
IT WAS CHIEF PROSECUTOR KANG SEOK-TAE

447
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,533
Wasn't it Chief Nam and Congressman Park

448
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,400
who called
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

449
00:27:28,466 --> 00:27:31,000
Yes, sir. Someone they know
called in a favor.

450
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,900
Chief Prosecutor Park Seon-hyeok and

451
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:34,100
Chairman Lee of the Taehan Party

452
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,733
entered college the same year.

453
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:38,266
Chairman Lee and Park Seon-hyeok

454
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,633
are from the same hometown.

455
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,166
I knew it.

456
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:43,500
Playing games with
those stupid heads of theirs.

457
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:49,333
In there, you'll find a photo of them
having the time of their lives.

458
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,400
It's enough

459
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:54,466
to have them both kneel in front of you.

460
00:27:55,866 --> 00:27:57,066
Puny bastards.

461
00:27:58,033 --> 00:28:00,366
What about the background check
on that priest?

462
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,766
Oh, that priest.

463
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:07,533
Sorry, things were too busy at the office.

464
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,700
I'll soon get on it.

465
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:11,633
Get it done fast.

466
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,633
Meanwhile, I need you
to do something for me today.

467
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
And the attacker just walks
straight by her victim.

468
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Goodness, your nose!

469
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,466
It looks more than perfectly fine.

470
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:43,966
-I should just--
-It hasn't been settled yet.

471
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,966
I'll get my medical report and sue you.

472
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:48,500
Anytime. Bring it on.

473
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:00,566
Father, glare at me
like you want to kill me.

474
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:02,966
-What on earth are you doing?
-Right now!

475
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:06,066
Just like you always do,
glare at me as if you want to kill me.

476
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,633
What on earth are you doing?

477
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:09,600
Gosh, this is it.

478
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,633
A 90 percent match.

479
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,733
It was Father Kim Hae-il.

480
00:29:52,866 --> 00:29:53,933
What on earth is this?

481
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,933
My noodles are all mushy now.

482
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:06,466
Why was he at the vacation home then?

483
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:09,133
Who was the Bigfoot, then?

484
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:13,866
Who the hell is this guy?

485
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:19,033
Ga, na, da, ra, ma, ba, sa,
ah, ja, cha, ka, ta, pa, ha.

486
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,133
Now, go.

487
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:23,466
Ja, da, la, ma, ba, ba, sa…

488
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,466
-Keep going.
-Ja, da…

489
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,800
Wrong.

490
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,833
Do it again.

491
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,733
Look at that gaze.

492
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,933
It's as if you want to
kill me or something.

493
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,433
Gosh, something just flew into my eye.

494
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:58,266
That was a sorry excuse
to glare at us like that.

495
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:00,366
Hey!

496
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Who is it?

497
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,866
-Was it you?
-Yes.

498
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,833
Quiet down already, I'm eating.

499
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:18,400
What's with the hoodlums in this area?

500
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:20,633
You do know you look cheap, right?

501
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,600
-Cheap?
-Yes.

502
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,666
You hit hard with your words, don't you?

503
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,333
In the most hurting way.

504
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:29,866
I think

505
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:32,766
it's time to say goodbye
to your shoulder blade.

506
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:35,733
It'll be crushed soon.

507
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:39,000
My shoulder blade right here? Hey, there.

508
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
How's that?

509
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,633
Now, try and crush it.

510
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:44,866
Jang!

511
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:47,800
Step aside.

512
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,733
I am Kim Hun-seok,
and I'm here on Mr. Hwang's behalf.

513
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:59,266
See? Now, here's a dandy young man.

514
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:02,533
You really should get rid of this one.

515
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,900
Unbelievable.

516
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:16,400
Goodness. Jang Ryong, you're here already.

517
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:19,266
What brings you by
to this Chinese restaurant?

518
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:21,400
Even Chinese food can be enlightening.

519
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:22,566
Woo-ta.

520
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,800
It seems like we're all sporting
the same style.

521
00:32:27,466 --> 00:32:30,333
How about some drinks?
Some baijiu of enlightenment?

522
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:32,633
-Sound good?
-Sure.

523
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,533
Baijiu of enlightenment.

524
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:36,466
Let me serve you, sir.

525
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:16,366
Turn off the lights, will you?

526
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,500
Hae-il, you haven't lost your touch.

527
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,600
It's the same for all men.

528
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,633
You need money, connections, and tenacity

529
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,900
to be successful.

530
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,166
Which do you have?

531
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:06,033
I lack in all aspects, sir.

532
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:07,733
You money and tenacity.

533
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,566
Lack of connections

534
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:12,199
is why you're still being mistreated.

535
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Right.

536
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:20,166
It's finally time for you
to have a proper connection.

537
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:22,600
Congressman Park is your way in.

538
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,566
Then…

539
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,199
did you and Ms. Jeong
decide to make a move?

540
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,433
Yes.

541
00:34:31,366 --> 00:34:33,199
He'll meet the same fate as Father Lee.

542
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,933
The third-term congressman
who felt too pressured by the prosecution

543
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,933
decided to take a nose-dive
from the top of his own building.

544
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,900
I know I've been too tough on you.

545
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,699
Let's wipe the slate clean

546
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,166
and start afresh together.

547
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,400
Start afresh?

548
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:05,733
I'm more than happy to, you asshole.

549
00:35:06,866 --> 00:35:10,733
WE WILL FOLLOW YOU, WOO-TA

550
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:16,366
My Russian mole.

551
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm not Russian, I'm from Russia.

552
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:24,066
Be Russian, from Russia,
that's not the issue here.

553
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,866
There's something we must be aware of.

554
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:31,600
It's what I picked up over drinks.

555
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,300
There's something I haven't told anyone.

556
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,066
Look, okay?

557
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:41,866
There's a room at the basement
of Daebeom Trading's building, right?

558
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,166
And when four people, see? Four people.

559
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,733
When four people
press their thumbs like this,

560
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,566
the doors swoosh open.

561
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,600
Behind the door, there's a room
with stacks of money this big.

562
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:56,566
Is this true?

563
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:58,333
I heard it too.

564
00:35:58,766 --> 00:36:01,366
He said there's more money
than you can even imagine.

565
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:04,933
Just think about it. The four of them
stashed their money there.

566
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,800
What if all four end up dead though?

567
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,466
The money will belong to no one

568
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,133
which means that it falls under
the rule of finders, keepers.

569
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:17,200
But there's also Mr. Hwang.

570
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:20,633
What if Mr. Hwang suffers the same fate?

571
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:27,533
When my fully enlightened brain

572
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,300
and your power is combined,

573
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:33,833
we can achieve just about anything.

574
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:39,233
What do you say? Sounds tasty, right?

575
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,700
-Woo-ta.
-Woo-ta.

576
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,766
Opening this door

577
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,366
will let us do whatever we want.

578
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,266
I don't need connections.

579
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,666
This. Money is the real connection.

580
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:03,200
-Don't you agree?
-Yes, sir.

581
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:12,100
Why didn't I think of this until now?

582
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:18,366
DAEBEOM TRADING

583
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:21,233
Gya, da, ra, na…

584
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,033
Gya, da, ra, na, ba…

585
00:37:24,966 --> 00:37:26,000
That's not it.

586
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:33,066
Did you really receive the order
to kill Congressman Park?

587
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:35,833
Yes, how many times must I tell you?

588
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,000
I hated his guts anyway.

589
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,533
Isn't he an asshole?

590
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Right.

591
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:45,433
If we mess this up,
everything goes to shit.

592
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,300
Stay frosty.

593
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,800
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

594
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,100
What's taking the food so long?

595
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:51,433
I'm starving.

596
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:59,700
CONGRESSMAN PARK
"LET'S FIGHT GU-DAM'S CORRUPTION TOGETHER"

597
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,500
Is there an academy for journalists?

598
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,666
Fucking hell of a job
they've done with these headlines.

599
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:15,800
Damn it.

600
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:20,333
CONGRESSMAN PARK WON-MU OF GUDAM-GU

601
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:29,566
Where's the tissue box?

602
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,966
My Lord, is this another sign?

603
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,033
-Father Kim.
-What is it?

604
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,000
They're filming something outside

605
00:38:59,366 --> 00:39:00,633
and I got an autograph.

606
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:02,166
Good for you.

607
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,166
You won't believe how stunning she is.

608
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:06,666
Who is it?

609
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:11,200
GU HAE-RA

610
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,333
Gu Hae-ra.

611
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,900
Gu Hae-ra?

612
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,366
Yes, Detective Seo.

613
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:32,566
Father, there's an assassination order
out on Congressman Park.

614
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:41,833
Pigeon,

615
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,466
Gu Hae-ra, Korean for save…

616
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,433
Save Congressman Park?

617
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:00,766
Can I eat this?

618
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,666
Go ahead.

619
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:06,433
Other than the kill order,

620
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,366
did they mention a time or a place?

621
00:40:09,966 --> 00:40:11,033
The place…

622
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,166
I don't know.

623
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,466
They only said it was going down tonight.

624
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:19,533
Got it.

625
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:21,066
We'll go after Hwang Cheol-beom

626
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:22,833
for the attempted murder of Mr. Park.

627
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,800
To catch him out the scene,

628
00:40:24,866 --> 00:40:26,200
the whole squad will have to roll out,

629
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,633
and that's impossible.

630
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:30,366
Captain Lee will never
go after Hwang's gang.

631
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,866
How can a violent crimes squad
be such a coward?

632
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:35,133
The opposing side isn't even meticulous.

633
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,266
That's why I feel bad
for those of Gudam-gu.

634
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,733
Do you know what's most pathetic?

635
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
It's to be governed by a worthless douche.

636
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,066
Anyway, if we prevent this hit,

637
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:52,000
Hwang will be arrested
for attempted murder.

638
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:53,966
Mr. Park who was nearly
offed by his allies

639
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:55,333
will testify against them.

640
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:57,166
He won't want to go down alone.

641
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,066
If that happens,
we'll be killing two birds with one stone.

642
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,833
With Congressman Park
and Hwang Cheol-beom gone,

643
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,033
the other side will collapse.

644
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:05,900
So how will we do this?

645
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,166
It's easier than you think.

646
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,300
What if things go south?

647
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,366
Then we move on to Plan B.

648
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:15,033
Wow, you already have a Plan B?

649
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,033
No, it'd just be nice to have one.

650
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,300
Anyway, gather around.

651
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:22,400
You should sit here with us instead.

652
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:23,866
It's three to one, isn't it?

653
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:28,366
The handsome priest should join us!

654
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:33,633
Why do you find it so hard
to get off that?

655
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:35,266
-Is it your designated seat?
-Listen up.

656
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,866
-Songsak.
-Yes, Father.

657
00:41:49,766 --> 00:41:51,733
Is it okay for you to tell us this?

658
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,000
Yes, I'm fine.

659
00:41:53,566 --> 00:41:56,000
I, Songsak Tekaratanapeuraseoteu,

660
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:57,533
do not… What's the word?

661
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,500
Right, I don't regret it.

662
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,466
Still, aren't you scared
of getting hurt again?

663
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:08,333
To be honest,

664
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,533
I'm scared.

665
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
But

666
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:18,400
if I can help catch those bad men
who killed Father Lee,

667
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:21,466
I don't care what happens to me.

668
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,533
Father,

669
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,300
I always believed
that only fools showed their anger.

670
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:35,133
But from now on,
that's how I'm going to be.

671
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,966
I'd rather be a fool too.

672
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:43,133
Good.

673
00:42:43,966 --> 00:42:45,733
Father Lee would be proud of you.

674
00:43:01,066 --> 00:43:02,066
Welcome.

675
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:11,866
Do you even need this?

676
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,066
I brought some dumplings.

677
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,233
You yelled at me and walked away.

678
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,900
Dumplings ain't going to cut it.

679
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,833
I'm sorry, Yo-han. It's all my fault.

680
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:27,166
Whatever.

681
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,666
I'm a moron like you said,
so be friends with someone smarter.

682
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:33,866
No, Yo-han. You're not a fool.

683
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:37,433
You're my one and only friend.

684
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:40,133
I love you, Yo-han.

685
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:43,100
Love, my ass.

686
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,233
Damn it.

687
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:49,066
How can you get angry
with your one and only friend?

688
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:51,833
I'm sorry, Yo-han.

689
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,166
Give me the dumplings, you jerk.

690
00:43:57,933 --> 00:43:58,966
Yo-han…

691
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:06,066
Just eat it, you pig.

692
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:08,700
What's your problem? You're--

693
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,133
-Is it good?
-It is.

694
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:19,100
That's enough though.

695
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:23,700
Why on earth are you crying?

696
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,133
Do we have enough ammunition
to off Chief Nam

697
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,800
and Congressman Park?

698
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:31,833
Yes, sir. We have more than enough.

699
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,366
Then meet with
Congressman Park first tonight

700
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,466
and give him a little taste of it.

701
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,300
Aren't you going to indict him?

702
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:41,366
We once used to be in the same boat.

703
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:42,900
I should give him a chance repent.

704
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,500
If he cleans up the mess he made
with the search and seizure

705
00:44:47,766 --> 00:44:49,000
and begs on his knees,

706
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,600
say I won't indict him.

707
00:44:50,766 --> 00:44:51,800
Yes, sir.

708
00:44:52,633 --> 00:44:54,433
What about the deal
on the upcoming matters?

709
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:57,166
That should do for now.

710
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:58,866
Yes, sir.

711
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,800
Gyeong-seon.

712
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,400
Don't be alarmed

713
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,533
when things get rough tonight.

714
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,533
Rough?

715
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,900
It's not really a big deal.

716
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,633
You'll find out later.

717
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:14,800
Yes, sir.

718
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,666
How dare a mere prosecutor
order me to her office!

719
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:29,400
It's why I asked politely.

720
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,333
You impolite bitch.

721
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,866
Refrain from the profanities and listen.

722
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:37,066
The recording from a caddie
who you bribed after beating.

723
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:40,233
The dashcam footage
of you sexually harassing your secretary.

724
00:45:40,466 --> 00:45:43,266
The recording from Ms. Choe
who illegally funded your campaign fund.

725
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,800
I wonder how I came across
these rare items.

726
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:47,866
How weird.

727
00:45:48,233 --> 00:45:49,966
What game are you playing?

728
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,366
I'm asking for a conversation,
Congressman Park.

729
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:00,133
CHIEF NAM CHARGED OF ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT

730
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:04,100
Apart from written statements,
we also have video and audio evidence.

731
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,133
You're not thinking about
revealing this to the public, are you?

732
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:10,966
Judging by what you
and Congressman Park did,

733
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,133
it's only fair that we do.

734
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,033
Don't you agree, Mr. Kang?

735
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,333
We could reconsider
if you come clean about what you did.

736
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:19,733
I had no say in this matter.

737
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,800
It was all Congressman Park.

738
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:26,900
What can I do to show you
that I'm truly sorry?

739
00:46:27,466 --> 00:46:29,700
For now, don't take any action

740
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,266
no matter what happens today.

741
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:34,100
Turn off your cellphone

742
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:38,166
and enjoy some alone time at a sauna.

743
00:47:28,766 --> 00:47:30,866
What the hell? Why is she here?

744
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:47,633
Yes?

745
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:49,200
Got it!

746
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:51,166
-Captain.
-What?

747
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:53,133
I just received an anonymous report.

748
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:56,166
An attack will be made
on Congressman Park's life tonight.

749
00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:57,733
What?

750
00:47:58,433 --> 00:48:01,233
He's currently passing Gudam Intersection.

751
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:02,700
What the hell?

752
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:04,566
Are you sure?

753
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:08,566
-Get ready to roll.
-What?

754
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Gear up.

755
00:48:12,233 --> 00:48:13,833
What is it that Mr. Kang wants?

756
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,233
You know what.

757
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,033
He wants you to put an end
to the search and seizure.

758
00:48:19,466 --> 00:48:22,766
Then you'll apologize to him and Ms. Jeong
on your knees.

759
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,566
What? On my what?

760
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,833
You don't have bad joints, do you?

761
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:30,733
Then just kneel and get it over with.

762
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,900
Why you little…

763
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:42,400
Why isn't Chief Nam picking up?

764
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,700
We should notify Mr. Hwang too.

765
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:47,433
What good would it do
to get involved with him?

766
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,300
We must save the congressman ourselves

767
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:53,966
for you to receive all the credit.

768
00:48:58,466 --> 00:48:59,600
How is that important

769
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:01,633
when his life is at stake?

770
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,066
Should I call Mr. Hwang then?

771
00:49:03,133 --> 00:49:04,233
Don't!

772
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:06,266
Sure, I won't.

773
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:10,500
Let's roll!

774
00:49:10,566 --> 00:49:12,500
-You're the best.
-The absolute best.

775
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,166
-The best.
-The roads are probably still busy,

776
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:18,933
so let's cut through the allies!

777
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,433
Follow the captain.

778
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,033
Let's go.

779
00:49:22,233 --> 00:49:23,733
-Off we go.
-Off we go.

780
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:29,533
What if I don't do what he wants?

781
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,933
If it were me,
I'd refrain from such a sad ending.

782
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:35,133
What the hell?

783
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:37,333
Don't you know who I am?

784
00:49:37,866 --> 00:49:39,033
I won't let you do this to me.

785
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,700
There's no way I'll go down alone.

786
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:47,500
-What on earth…
-What the hell?

787
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,366
Wait, that guy is…

788
00:49:54,433 --> 00:49:55,466
Imbecile!

789
00:49:55,966 --> 00:49:57,166
Hurry along.

790
00:49:58,566 --> 00:49:59,566
-Oh, my!
-What?

791
00:49:59,966 --> 00:50:01,500
No, don't!

792
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,066
What's taking them so long?

793
00:50:11,566 --> 00:50:14,766
They call me artist, they call me idol

794
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,000
Call me anything else

795
00:50:17,066 --> 00:50:18,133
Whatever

796
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,600
-I don't care, I'm proud of me
-Get up!

797
00:50:21,133 --> 00:50:22,133
-I'm free
-Mister!

798
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:24,333
-I don't care
-Shit.

799
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:26,066
-Sir!
-The alley, did you say?

800
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:28,033
-You can't sing there.
-What have you done?

801
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,966
-Come on.
-Can I be any unluckier?

802
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:32,933
-Darn it.
-Stop it already.

803
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,333
Get that man off the street.

804
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,933
Mister, get out of the way.

805
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:38,666
You can't do this, sir.

806
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,466
My goodness.

807
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:42,733
Hurry up.

808
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,100
Those bastards.

809
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:50,600
What is the meaning of this?

810
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:51,666
Get out!

811
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,066
-How dare you!
-What…

812
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:00,666
-Hurry.
-Let go of me.

813
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:01,833
You prick.

814
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,866
-Let go.
-No, don't!

815
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:05,833
Are you insane? What the hell is this?

816
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:10,400
You should go home
and get some rest, lady.

817
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:11,500
Hey!

818
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:13,866
What are you doing?

819
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,333
Let go.

820
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,933
Where are you taking him?

821
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:23,933
Shit.

822
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,533
Is this what he meant
by a rough situation?

823
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:28,633
Damn it.

824
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,633
You bastards!

825
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:35,533
Those familiar long legs.

826
00:51:35,933 --> 00:51:36,966
That familiar back.

827
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:44,966
Taxi!

828
00:51:47,433 --> 00:51:49,566
Sir, hurry. That man there.

829
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:51,166
The one with the back…

830
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,466
I mean, follow that motorcycle. Go!

831
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,533
Get out.

832
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm unmasking you today
even if it's the last thing Ido.

833
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,833
Let go.

834
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:45,000
Who are you bastards?

835
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:50,466
You…
Don't you work for Hwang Cheol-beom?

836
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,966
Seriously?
Took you long enough to recognize me.

837
00:52:56,933 --> 00:52:59,633
-Get his print.
-Let go of me!

838
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:02,600
I'm former army commander Park Won-mu!

839
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:06,800
Won-mu, so what?

840
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:09,500
After you're discharged,
all you are is an old man.

841
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:11,800
So cut the crap, you pretentious asshole.

842
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:14,666
Did you get a clean one?

843
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,700
Toss him.

844
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,100
What? Toss me where?

845
00:53:20,366 --> 00:53:21,366
Toss me where?

846
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:23,466
Let go of me!

847
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:26,600
What a good day to fly in the moonlit sky.

848
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:27,600
-Let go.
-Hold on.

849
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,600
Don't grab him too tightly.
You'll leave bruises.

850
00:53:29,766 --> 00:53:30,833
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

851
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:32,733
I'll pay you.

852
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:35,000
-You'll pay me?
-Name your price.

853
00:53:35,633 --> 00:53:37,533
It'll be enough for you to retire early.

854
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,300
Toss him.

855
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:41,733
No, wait.

856
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:44,000
This isn't us tossing you.

857
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,300
You jumped all by yourself.

858
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:48,100
-Take off his shoes.
-No!

859
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:49,733
Let go…

860
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,633
-Sir, I'll put them here.
-Good.

861
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:55,733
Toss him with force.

862
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:58,933
No, hold on. Wait!

863
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:00,733
No…

864
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
Put him down.

865
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,100
What the hell? Who's this delivery man?

866
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,133
Get him.

867
00:54:35,466 --> 00:54:36,500
Oh, no you don't.

868
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:45,433
Damn it.

869
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,000
-It hurts.
-Move!

870
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,266
-Is this the location?
-Yes, sir.

871
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:08,066
-Off we go!
-Let's go!

872
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:12,300
Father Kim is in the building too.

873
00:55:13,766 --> 00:55:15,233
We can't let them cross paths.

874
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,933
Let's head in for now.

875
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,700
Damn it.

876
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,700
What is it? Okay, I got it.

877
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,800
Scram. The cops are here.

878
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:52,600
I'm on the roof of
the WM building in Gudam-gu.

879
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,866
A man has been hit on the head

880
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:56,333
and is losing a lot of blood.

881
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,666
He's unconscious, so please hurry.

882
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,700
What? The cops were there?

883
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,266
All right. Take cover for now.

884
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,633
Shit.

885
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:10,733
Didn't I tell you to keep this a secret?

886
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,166
I did, sir.

887
00:56:12,366 --> 00:56:13,700
Then how did the cops find out?

888
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:34,400
Father…

889
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:37,166
-Father…
-It's this way, right?

890
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:39,300
Right, let's go.

891
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:40,533
That way.

892
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,766
-That way.
-That way?

893
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:07,200
My gosh. This familiar height.

894
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:10,100
Wait, you're him from that day.

895
00:57:10,466 --> 00:57:12,600
You struck me in the neck, didn't you?

896
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:14,800
It is you!

897
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:06,300
Hands up!

898
00:58:11,733 --> 00:58:12,800
Hands up.

899
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:25,400
I can't believe he got caught.

900
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:27,166
Tell me about it.

901
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:34,000
This is the final warning.
Raise your hands!

902
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:14,766
What's this?
What's going on here? What is it?

903
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,466
He's the suspect.

904
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,333
There was this agent in our team
when I was the head

905
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,000
of the counterterrorism department
at the NIS.

906
00:59:20,066 --> 00:59:21,200
Kim Hae-il, the best member of

907
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,200
the National Intelligence Service's
anti-terrorism unit.

908
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,100
He's the type
to never back out of a fight.

909
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,700
The DNA of the blood sample
matches that of Father Lee's.

910
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,866
-Shall I go and get him right now?
-Just wait.

911
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:31,933
No, don't.

912
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,966
It's way too much for you.

913
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:35,366
I agree.

914
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,866
What are you talking about?
Why wouldn't I be able to?

915
00:59:38,266 --> 00:59:40,066
I'm Gu Dae-yeong, the veteran.

916
00:59:43,766 --> 00:59:44,966
You little punk.

917
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:47,433
