1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,000
(Episode 7 Would you marry me?)

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,842
(I really like you, )

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,077
(but I didn't mean to get involved...)

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:14,981
(Damian, )

5
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,816
(are you alright?)

6
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:17,951
(Please don't ignore me.)

7
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,587
(If Jerry misunderstood us, )

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,588
(I'd explain to him.)

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,523
(Text me back, okay?)

10
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,696
I was drunk.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,964
But please believe me

12
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,966
that there is nothing
between me and Wei.

13
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,446
Hey man, you scared me to death.

14
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:41,907
Why aren't you in bed?

15
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,279
Stop it.

16
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,648
Where's Papa? I want to find Papa.

17
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,350
What's the matter, Kai?

18
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,753
Daddy will put you in bed, OK?

19
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,157
Stop it.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,028
(Sorry, )

21
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,363
(I quit.)

22
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,931
(I don't want either you or the job.)

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
“PAPA & DADDY 2”

24
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,997
Kai often kicks off the blanket.

25
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,167
I don't know if Damian helped him
put the blanket on.

26
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,672
If you're worried, just go back.

27
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,973
I don't want to.

28
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:55,265
Baby, can you tell me what I have to do
to make you reply to me?

29
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:58,790
Where are you?
At least, let me know you are safe.

30
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,555
Is this man still a keeper?

31
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,794
I can't answer this question for you.

32
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,195
You should ask yourself.

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,065
What should I do?

34
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,233
Jerry.

35
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,135
What's that supposed to mean?

36
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,103
Did you do anything wrong?

37
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,872
No.

38
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,006
What you have to do now is

39
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,674
go explain it to him clearly.

40
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,710
Put your phone down.
I'll go with you.

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,210
Let's go.

42
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,145
- I don't want to.
- Now.

43
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,246
Don't force me.

44
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,948
If I go back now,
that means I will lose this battle.

45
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,583
What do you want to do then?

46
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,335
Sorry.

47
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,805
I'm fine.

48
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,944
So hungry!

49
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,614
You haven't eaten
anything yet, have you?

50
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,351
Let's drink something
to warm our stomachs first.

51
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,321
You need to have a proper meal first
in order to fight.

52
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,490
Kao,

53
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,492
thank you.

54
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,093
At least I have you here with me.

55
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,273
Jerry,

56
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,909
didn't we agreed to get it over?

57
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,146
If I knew you would be like this,

58
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,250
I should've come to Taipei two days later.

59
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,453
Alright.

60
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,787
I know.

61
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,055
Sorry.

62
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,258
I might have to go back
to the hotel later,

63
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,158
I have to rest a bit

64
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,994
and prepare for my work
in the afternoon.

65
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,328
What about you?

66
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,796
I'll go back.

67
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,865
I'm worried that Kai can't find me
when he gets up.

68
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,808
Pick it up.

69
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,777
Damian made Jimmy call you,

70
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
meaning he's really worried about you.

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,785
Hello, Jimmy, what's wrong?

72
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,687
Jerry, where are you?

73
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,188
Kai is crying and looking for you.

74
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,757
He said he's not well.

75
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,225
Not well how?

76
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,693
Does he have a fever?

77
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,261
Maybe.

78
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,196
Listen to me, Jimmy.

79
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,299
- There is a thermometer in the TV cabinet's drawer.
- Jerry.

80
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
Help me to measure
Kai's body temperature first.

81
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,502
- Sorry, there's no need.
- Then help me touch his forehead.

82
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,070
Let him calm down first.

83
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,907
- Are you feeling any better?
- Kai.

84
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,642
How are you feeling now?

85
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,810
You OK?

86
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,945
The doctor said we got him
to the hospital just in time.

87
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,947
It was just a bit of a cold.

88
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,182
There is no need to worry.

89
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,618
He just had his injection.

90
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,420
The doctor said if his tummy is fine,

91
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,188
then he should be alright.

92
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,656
Where were you earlier?

93
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:26,490
I couldn't find you this morning.

94
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,428
I'm so sorry, Kai.

95
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,330
I should've been there with you.

96
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,166
I didn't cry when I had the injection.

97
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,600
You're amazing, Kai!

98
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,835
You're so brave!

99
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,770
I have to go now, Jerry.

100
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,549
Kai, have as much rest as you can,

101
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,576
and get well soon, OK?

102
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,544
Good boy.

103
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,714
Kao,

104
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,217
thank you.

105
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,455
Your jacket.

106
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,391
Put it on.

107
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,792
Be careful not to catch a cold.

108
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,133
I'll go get the prescription.

109
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,668
Are you OK, Kai?

110
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,305
Kao.

111
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,641
What's the matter?

112
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,015
Is Jerry OK?

113
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,617
I was with him in the park last night,

114
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,686
and we stayed there all night,
it was windy and cold.

115
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,154
What do you think?

116
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,424
So...

117
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,926
I know he's disturbed right now.

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,661
He's...

119
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,631
He's very upset.

120
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,467
So...

121
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,771
did he say he wanted to leave me?

122
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,074
Don't you think

123
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,076
you should ask him
the question yourself?

124
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,742
Is it bitter?

125
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,743
No.

126
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,445
I just tasted it for you,

127
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,679
it's sweet.

128
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,953
Well done, Kai!

129
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,423
Get some sleep.

130
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,463
I want you to be here with me.

131
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,430
OK.

132
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,833
But I have something

133
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,835
that I need to tell Daddy.

134
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,772
Then do it quickly and come back.
Don't disappear again.

135
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,842
Make a pinky promise.

136
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,511
OK.

137
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,745
Go to sleep.

138
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,757
Kai's asleep.

139
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,897
Grab a seat.

140
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,909
I'm sorry

141
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,145
that you saw what happened yesterday.

142
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,816
There's really nothing
between me and Wei.

143
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,751
You almost kissed him.
Wasn't that obvious?

144
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,655
I was so drunk last night.

145
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,091
I didn't know what I was doing at all!

146
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,361
Use alcohol as an excuse.

147
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,963
This is a typical behavior of scum.

148
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,933
If I had been there a little later,

149
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,768
something might have
happened between you both.

150
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,737
Weren't you embarrassed
that you were late?

151
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,605
You didn't want to come, did you?

152
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,350
It was an important day,
and you didn't care, like, at all.

153
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,476
If you had arrived on time,

154
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,444
nothing would've happened.

155
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,581
I've already told you,

156
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,116
because I still had work to do.

157
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,751
But I arrived.

158
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,453
And your investor doesn't like me...

159
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,455
Why should I be there
and humiliate myself?

160
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,658
You only think about yourself.

161
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,742
Selfish.

162
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,695
Selfish?

163
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,964
You only care about
your YouTube channel,

164
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,832
and completely neglect
the fact that I put so much work

165
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,301
on Equal.

166
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,835
Isn't that selfish, too?

167
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,173
I thought you were on my side,

168
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,109
supporting my career
with your unconditional heart.

169
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,477
Now, it sounds like,

170
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,279
it has to be under many conditions.

171
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,514
So hypocritical.

172
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,950
That's because you are out of touch.

173
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,717
You have absolutely no idea

174
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,919
that I've been under so much pressure.

175
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,488
You only think about
your own grievances.

176
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,725
Did you know I was almost falling apart?

177
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,429
What made you think I was not like that?

178
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,997
Every couple days,
my parents would ask me

179
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,465
about children.

180
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,400
It's all because you can't
make up your mind yet.

181
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,436
I really don't know
how to answer them.

182
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,571
Not this again!

183
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,839
Haven't we already agreed on this?

184
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,442
We'll focus on looking after Kai!

185
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,079
After all, who cares abou the blood for the God's sake.

186
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,883
Dad, I care about blood.

187
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,821
What the hell, Jimmy?

188
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,490
What's wrong?

189
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,425
I'm alright.

190
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,928
It was paper cut by this leaflet.

191
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,830
Leaflet?

192
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,598
How did a leaflet
make you bleed so much?

193
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,768
Well, I made the blood
look messy on purpose...

194
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,169
in order to scare you.

195
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,305
Can't you see what's going on here?

196
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,107
You still have time to joke?

197
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,278
Dad, have some empathy.

198
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,280
It's really hurt.

199
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,718
It's hurt. You're right.

200
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,712
Go get him, Dad.

201
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,101
(There is a vast chasm between us.)

202
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,205
(I think it's better if we don't live
under the same roof, temporarily.)

203
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,174
(It will be better, if we separate
for a period to calm ourselves down.)

204
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,643
(I will stay with Bryan.)

205
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,645
(Don't come to find me.)

206
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,041
Again?

207
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,715
Who told you to have an affair
and get caught?

208
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,017
It's Wei!

209
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,953
You're going for younger guys now?

210
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:48,754
Oh, come on.

211
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,290
I didn't know that Wei likes me.

212
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,159
Not to mention that I was drunk
and out of control.

213
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,527
It was because of you.

214
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,228
Me?

215
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,329
Yeah,

216
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,365
you said you're going to leave me
and Equal behind,

217
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,799
and head back to the US.

218
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:07,539
How come you are being so cute!

219
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,541
OK, I promise you,

220
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,543
If I break up with Andrew,

221
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,812
I will come back to you immediately.

222
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:14,947
Oh, no.

223
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,716
Please, you should seize
the opportunity this time.

224
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,519
I really think that Andrew is a good guy.

225
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,955
I know!

226
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,258
That's why I don't want to have a long
distance relationship with him anymore.

227
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,661
I feel happy right now.

228
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,997
So, I hope that you
and Jerry can be happy, too.

229
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,401
But he doesn't want to see me right now

230
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,737
Can't you get it?

231
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,573
"Don't come to find me."

232
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,077
It actually means that
you should go to find him.

233
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,282
Of course, I know.

234
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,652
I have to get myself
prepared this time, though.

235
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,487
I don't want to screw it up again.

236
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,588
OK.

237
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,556
Let's have a think.

238
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,359
What does Jerry care about the most

239
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,828
amongst his various conflicts?

240
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,864
I think it's blood.

241
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,367
What blood?

242
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,742
So it's about having a child
to continue the family name.

243
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,512
This is tricky.

244
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,449
Jerry really does care
about his parents.

245
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,455
I told Jerry before,

246
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,657
that if he really wants a child,

247
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,126
we can plan this slowly.

248
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,894
I don't really want him

249
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,629
to please his parents

250
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,131
to do such a thing.

251
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,167
You know, how great a responsibility
it is to raise a child,

252
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,404
and also, Kia is his child.

253
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,605
Yeah,

254
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,607
but they don't think that way.

255
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,846
What if Kai changes his last name?

256
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,017
Why is it so difficult?

257
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,454
I'll go ask a lawyer.

258
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,893
Owe me a beer?

259
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,599
When are you coming back, Papa?

260
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,635
Maybe a couple of days.

261
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,071
You made a pinky promise
with me, and still lied to me.

262
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,140
I'm sorry.

263
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,378
No, thanks.

264
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,416
Kai,

265
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,984
Listen to me.

266
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,886
I have something important to do,

267
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,455
so I will be home in a couple of days.

268
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,725
Is there anything
more important than me?

269
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,631
Kai,

270
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,600
look, I bought

271
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,502
your favorite Lego toy.

272
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,904
It's a fire engine.

273
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,947
Wait for me to get back,
and we can play together, OK?

274
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:54,907
OK.

275
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,042
So, are you going to sleep now?

276
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,043
Yes.

277
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,778
- Good night.
- Good night.

278
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,032
Drink it.

279
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,438
No.

280
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,906
Your face is getting all wrinkly,

281
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,908
and you still don't want
to take collagen?

282
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,718
After all, it's your own home.

283
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,120
Just teach Damian a lesson,

284
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,621
wouldn't that work?

285
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,623
You don't really want
to leave them behind, do you?

286
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,093
I can tell you are reluctant to do that.

287
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,230
But a lot of things
have happened recently,

288
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,232
they made me feel very insecure.

289
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,567
Also, we're not married.

290
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,370
We're not related in any way
according to the law.

291
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,440
I thought I could shoot Men's Dormitory,

292
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,442
and that would bring us closer.

293
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,778
I didn't know
it would become so awkward.

294
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,916
So, you wanted to get married?

295
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,618
Yeah, I do.

296
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,853
Oh my God.

297
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,558
I don't know why would
someone want to sacrifice

298
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,393
his freedom, that is
more precious than pearls,

299
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,395
and walk into the graveyard of love.

300
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,169
I thought you rejected
Damian in the past.

301
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:33,772
That was because, at that time,

302
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,774
I hadn't come out of the closet
with my parents yet.

303
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,943
And I also feel, that marriage,

304
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,445
should have the blessings
of my parents.

305
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,314
That's why I didn't say yes.

306
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,315
But now, you see,

307
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,050
my parents have already accepted us
for a long time, now.

308
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,486
Damian's still not mentioned
anything about it.

309
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:49,888
Maybe he doesn't love me...

310
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,523
Stop.

311
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,326
Damian loves you very, very much, OK?

312
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,327
Tell him what you think,

313
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,496
and don't get so paranoid.

314
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,630
But, he and Wei...

315
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,665
It was definitely him that

316
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,967
has a crush on Damian, OK?

317
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,241
You're right.

318
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,676
I can't show any weakness.

319
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,490
(I know everything is
only your wishful thinking.)

320
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,015
(My relationship with Damian
won't be affected by you.)

321
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,870
(I hope)

322
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,033
(you will not show up
in front of us ever again.)

323
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,260
Get lost as far as you can!

324
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,628
Are you sure?

325
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,697
Jerry baby,

326
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,800
We can't be softhearted on him.

327
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,410
(Otherwise, I won't be
polite next time.)

328
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,030
(OK, I'm sorry.)

329
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,189
Alright, crisis averted.

330
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,624
You can roll back home.

331
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,092
What?

332
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,261
Who's run away from home
for only a day?

333
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,562
I don't want to go back yet.

334
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,232
That's true.

335
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,734
Let's do some research...

336
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,868
About what you want
to wear at your wedding?

337
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,536
Let me tell you, Jerry.

338
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,505
I watched Tyla's wedding.

339
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,607
It was super pretty, super beautiful.

340
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,142
Let me find it for you.

341
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,478
Let me find it for you.
It was so beautiful.

342
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,812
Excuse me,

343
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,748
has he asked me to marry him?

344
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,717
And also what did you just say...
some kind of graveyard?

345
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:26,318
Shut up.

346
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,753
It's you who want to
get married, not me.

347
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,789
Look, isn't it beautiful?

348
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:32,691
It is really beautiful.

349
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,558
Wow.

350
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,760
You fancy?

351
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,315
Did you mention that you have a friend?
Her surname is Liao?

352
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,284
I went to the law school with Yu Mei Nu.
She is my icon.

353
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,353
So, it's a tribute to her.

354
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,622
I see.

355
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,724
But you are also beautiful.

356
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,992
Don't flatter.

357
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,593
This case.

358
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,495
I will take it no matter what.

359
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,664
That's wonderful. Thank you.

360
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,933
So, Beauty.

361
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,569
Are there any other files my brother
has to prepare for this case?

362
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,706
I've received
most of the files, basically...

363
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,973
But, can I ask you something,
if you don't mind?

364
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,143
Do you and your partner
plan to get married?

365
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,812
Because, given circumstances,

366
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,448
marriage is the only option, actually.

367
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,359
After you get married, you can apply for
child adoption for a same-sex partner.

368
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,353
Then, Mr. Pan can adopt Kai.

369
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,054
So, Kai can change his surname.

370
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,357
This does sound doable.

371
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,864
A wedding!

372
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,767
Guess I have something to get busy for
before heading back to the U.S.

373
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,236
It makes me feel excited
just to think about it!

374
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,574
But last time, when I asked Jerry
to marry me...

375
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,842
He rejected me.

376
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,145
And right now, our relationship
is not in a good place.

377
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,981
I think it would be difficult.

378
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,518
But, he was young at that time.

379
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,320
Things are different now,

380
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,123
and people change their minds, too.

381
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:12,724
Just try again.

382
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,126
We'll help you.

383
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,762
But, I'm not really confident enough.

384
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,098
You both love each other.

385
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,534
Don't be defeated.

386
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,255
(Have you calmed down now?)

387
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,257
(Let's have a chat, OK?)

388
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,259
(I miss you.)

389
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,282
Dad, what did the lawyer say?

390
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,053
The lawyer said if Kai wants
to change his surname,

391
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,055
the quickest way to solve this is,

392
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,857
that Jerry and I get married.

393
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:22,461
God, so, you want to get married?

394
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,298
Can you not accept it?

395
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,533
Because you didn't want your mommy
to get married.

396
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,835
No!

397
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,837
I can accept it.

398
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,639
I think this idea is super cool!

399
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,609
About Mommy, it's because
I don't like Adam.

400
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,344
But I like Jerry.

401
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,581
And I so want to dance
at your wedding.

402
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,885
Jimmy,

403
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,522
Thank you, Jimmy.

404
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:54,092
Your support means a lot to me.

405
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,363
Although Jerry still doesn't want to talk to me,

406
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,631
I will work hard on this.

407
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,066
I can help.

408
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,534
I'll plan the marriage proposal.

409
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,002
It will succeed for sure.

410
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,604
OK.

411
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,105
I believe in you.

412
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,612
So, what do you think about me
dancing at your wedding?

413
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,881
I think it's awesome.

414
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:16,882
Let's have a talk show!

415
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,250
Or we can have a band?

416
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,484
DJ is way more cool.

417
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:50,415
Jimmy,

418
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,583
What happened?

419
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,285
The teacher said the parent
has to come over,

420
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,953
but Daddy can't come.

421
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,621
Is this because he's at work again?

422
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,291
No, he's really sick.

423
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,460
That's why I want you to come.

424
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,929
- Papa!
- Jerry.

425
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,931
Kai!

426
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,367
I missed you!

427
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:14,039
Jerry, can I talk
to you for a minute?

428
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,875
Jimmy can stay with you for now, OK?

429
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,314
Jerry,

430
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,184
Kai's mood has not been
very steady recently,

431
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,820
and he didn't want to
play with other kids.

432
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,455
He wouldn't tell me what's wrong.

433
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,556
So, I just want to share my concerns,

434
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,858
Is there anything going on at home?

435
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,462
There is something that need
to be sorted out at home.

436
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,599
I will talk to Kai.

437
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,900
Kai is a bright, clever boy.

438
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,234
We all like him very much.

439
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,303
So, we hope he can be happy again.

440
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,204
Thank you.

441
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:46,871
You're welcome.

442
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:47,806
I'm going inside the room now.

443
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:50,742
Bye bye.

444
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,143
Bye, Kai.

445
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,214
Kai,

446
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,483
have you been feeling upset,
the last couple of days?

447
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:00,885
When will you

448
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,688
sort out the important thing?

449
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,027
Probably, I need more time to sort it.

450
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,730
So, you're not coming back home?

451
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:19,204
If you don't want to come back with us,

452
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,506
I can take Kai home.

453
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,307
But,

454
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,243
Daddy is really sad.

455
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,613
He "bathed his tears in face."

456
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,749
You said it wrong.

457
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,884
It's "teardrops bathed in face."

458
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,986
No, it's "bathed his tears in face."

459
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,023
It's "face bathed in tears."

460
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,334
God!

461
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,835
The house turns into a mess!

462
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,837
No wonder he gets sick!

463
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,774
How come this is here?

464
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,776
He can't really live without me.

465
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,446
What's going on here?

466
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,059
Kai, let me ask you.

467
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,294
Daddy has been sick
for a long time, hasn't he?

468
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,395
Jerry!

469
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,997
Jerry, look!

470
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,199
Daddy's disease has spread
to the "nerve system",

471
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,934
and he still won't see the doctor.

472
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,303
Are you trying to say the disease
has spread to the "vital organ"?

473
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,305
Stop using Chinese idioms.

474
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,543
What the hell is going on?

475
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,477
Yes!

476
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,411
High five!

477
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,013
Yes!

478
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:35,814
Let's go!

479
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,554
Damian, are you crazy?

480
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,957
How can you put your life at risk?

481
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,992
You have two kids to look after!

482
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,761
And Daddy also said,

483
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,097
he doesn't want to live
without you anymore.

484
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,866
Don't listen to his nonsense!

485
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,570
Damian,

486
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,519
Baby, let's stop fighting, OK?

487
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,955
It's all my fault,

488
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,623
every single one of them.

489
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,160
I really hope that
every morning when I get up,

490
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,796
The first person I see is you.

491
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,637
Will you marry me?

492
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,574
Marry him!

493
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,143
- Marry me.
- Marry him!

494
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,444
Marry him!

495
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,178
Baby,

496
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,246
You are so annoying!

497
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,113
Baby, you're mean!

498
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,681
You all lied to me.

499
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,349
Baby!

500
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,117
- Marry me.
- You got tricked!
