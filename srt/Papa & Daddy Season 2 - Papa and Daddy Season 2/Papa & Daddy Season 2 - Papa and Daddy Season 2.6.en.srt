00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,534
(Episode 6 New Channel)
Good morning!

2
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:02,702
Good morning!

3
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:03,803
Morning!

4
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:04,904
Hey! Dad.

5
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:05,805
You know what?

6
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:08,141
Ms. Shih is trying to learn to dance.

7
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,442
She asks me to teach her.

8
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,378
So now she starts liking you.

9
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,312
It's not just that she likes me,

10
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,780
she loves me.

11
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,948
LOVE! So shy.

12
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,619
There are some students
who hate going to school,

13
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,021
but they all like to dance.

14
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,356
So I get them all to dance,

15
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,992
and now they love to go to school.

16
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,093
She is happy now.

17
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,029
You've made new friends too,

18
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,463
who also like to dance.

19
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,333
Yes. They all call me Jimmy Bro now.

20
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,636
Jimmy, you are improving so fast
with your Chinese.

21
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,338
The same goes for
the way you express yourself.

22
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,439
I understand most of the conversation.

23
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,540
I also understand other things.

24
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,978
Thanks to Kai. He's a good teacher.

25
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,679
He keeps talking to me

26
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,148
Nonstop.

27
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,716
Daddy, did you hear that?

28
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,384
Bro said, “I'm a good teacher.”

29
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,553
So I should keep talking nonstop.

30
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,088
Kai's incredible!

31
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,024
Do you want to learn English
with Jimmy Bro?

32
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,693
No.

33
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,998
Dad, I'll have breakfast
with classmates.

34
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:05,965
I gotta go.

35
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,167
Breakfast?

36
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,935
Aren't you having breakfast right now?

37
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,437
You can tell me earlier next time.

38
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,704
So I don't need to
prepare breakfast for you.

39
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,972
Otherwise, you won't
be able to eat anything.

40
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,973
You kidding me?

41
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:14,908
I'm still growing.

42
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,777
I can even eat two portions
without any problems.

43
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,612
Breakfast is for my family.

44
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,614
Breakfast is for you guys.

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,600
(Papa & Daddy 2)

46
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,218
Jerry.

47
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,453
Look! We're sitting here.

48
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,655
Our body shape and appearance

49
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,391
are much better than the young people
who came here to check-in.

50
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,459
All right.

51
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,361
Stop looking at hot guys!

52
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,395
There is some important updates

53
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,864
for you today.

54
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,099
I know what you intended.

55
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,535
You want me to compliment you.

56
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,337
You look so young.

57
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,205
The only good-looking person is you.

58
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,474
Silly! Why did you spit it out?

59
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,143
Wouldn't I know I'm pretty?

60
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,344
Silly!

61
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,112
How do you feel about

62
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,480
being a stepmother?

63
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,982
Did Jimmy tell on you?

64
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,717
I've seen the stepmothers in K-dramas.

65
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,952
You either get punked
or you're playing tricks on them.

66
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,053
So which type of stepmother are you?

67
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,155
My gosh!

68
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,390
What kind of K-dramas have you watched?

69
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,225
Jimmy is not as bad as you think.

70
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,527
He takes good care of Kai.

71
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,130
This is beyond my expectation.

72
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,565
I was actually worried about it.

73
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,667
I was afraid that
he wouldn't accept me and Kai.

74
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,403
From his point of view,

75
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,571
I think he hates us.

76
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,772
That's pretty normal though.

77
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,641
I thought you guys would fight.

78
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,276
How do you guys get along well with him?

79
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,813
In a way,
Kai is like a connector between us.

80
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,183
Of course, I try my best.

81
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,551
I often remind myself.

82
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,319
Mainly look at his bright side.

83
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,756
Accept and like him
from the bottom of my heart.

84
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,324
I want him to feel
the good intentions I have.

85
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,593
After all,
it's much harder to accept a stepfather

86
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,695
than a stepmother.

87
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,898
I truly feel I've grown up so much

88
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,201
in this period of time.

89
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,402
Grown up so much?

90
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,370
You've indeed grown up so much.

91
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,139
Then I'm going to check it out.

92
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,240
Not right here.

93
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,508
I'll check it out real quick!

94
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,642
Let's go to the bathroom!

95
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,543
- Okay?
- Okay.

96
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,711
Hello.

97
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,646
Are you guys Jerry and Bryan?

98
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,314
Yes. Hi.

99
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,582
I'm your fan.

100
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,717
I've been watching your channel.

101
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,018
May I take a picture with you?

102
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,386
Sure.

103
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,655
Dad, you've a fan.

104
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,657
Yes. Dad's got a fan.

105
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,625
Daddy?

106
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,228
So adorable!

107
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,462
Can I take a picture with him?

108
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,330
Sure.

109
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,064
Thanks!

110
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,232
Comes together.

111
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,469
One, two, three.

112
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,037
Thank you guys!

113
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,072
We’ve been planning

114
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,273
to have a child as well.

115
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,008
But since we are
in a long distance relationship.

116
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,209
He's Korean.

117
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,144
Hello.

118
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,379
We keep thinking that having a child

119
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,714
would make our lives more complete.

120
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,448
But we don't know

121
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,749
how to tell the parents?

122
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,252
Yes. My friends also
share the same thoughts.

123
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,621
But they don't know what to do about it.

124
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,889
But you guys did it.

125
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,890
Thanks!

126
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,925
I root for you guys!

127
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,559
Thank you!

128
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,127
Thank you so much!

129
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:21,995
Don't forget to watch our videos.

130
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:22,895
Okay!

131
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,030
Thanks! Bye.

132
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,331
I think you can shoot a

133
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,333
family video of four people.

134
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,735
Me?

135
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,469
Yes.

136
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,171
Look! You have such a inspiring stories.

137
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,240
If you can take advantage of
your popularity and your good image,

138
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,942
to convey positive energy.

139
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,511
You'll be
a great gay family model for sure.

140
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,380
There will be many more gay families

141
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,349
who take a bold step forward
because of you.

142
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,142
Darling.

143
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,678
Do you think that our present lives

144
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,612
are full of happiness?

145
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,783
I think

146
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,153
I'm the happiest person in the world.

147
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,587
Then

148
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,189
I think we should share
this happy feeling

149
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,824
to everyone.

150
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,068
I want to create
a new program on my channel.

151
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,737
We can share our story

152
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,405
to those gay couples
who want to start a family.

153
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,907
Make them braver.

154
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,746
It's great that you have such an idea.

155
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,384
I'll definitely support you

156
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,086
if you want to do it.

157
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,154
Really?

158
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,256
But my only condition is

159
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,925
not to influence the child.

160
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,626
After all, we can't control

161
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,061
what audiences think of us.

162
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,665
In fact, the main message of the video

163
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,966
is to record

164
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,568
is to record

165
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,971
This will allow our child
to be treated in a natural way.

166
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,139
This way is better than

167
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,042
waiting until they grow up,
and they don't know how to deal with it.

168
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,643
Through the video,

169
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,879
we can also invite everyone

170
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,780
to watch and get to know us.

171
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,415
Our family is the same

172
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,950
as other families.

173
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,551
We take very good care of the child.

174
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,254
We are all happy together.

175
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,822
At the same time, to encourage

176
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,257
those gay couples to

177
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,625
start a family together.

178
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,263
My baby has grown up.

179
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,965
Really?

180
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,867
Thanks! Darling.

181
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,669
Have you thought about

182
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,937
your channel name?

183
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,573
Right.

184
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,442
What name should we use for the channel?

185
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,444
And should you talk to your mother?

186
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,311
Help me think...

187
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,713
There are four men in the family.

188
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,681
So is it about four men...

189
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,186
Are you ready? Kai.

190
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:04,657
Five, four, three, two, one.

191
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,059
Hello! Jerry's fans. What's up, guys?

192
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,262
Today, we want to inform everyone

193
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,265
that we are going to create a new content.

194
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,734
This program is about four men's dorm.

195
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,570
We'll show you the daily life of
me and my beloved family.

196
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,338
We hope to give you a glimpse of

197
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,375
what a gay family has to offer.

198
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,578
First of all,

199
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:29,015
I'd like to introduce my partner.

200
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,584
Damian.

201
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:34,487
Hi guys!

202
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,721
I'm Damian.

203
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,624
I'm Jerry's partner.

204
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,495
I believe that...

205
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,833
I know a lot of people
are going to be shocked.

206
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,001
But I'm almost 30 years old.

207
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,637
I don't want to hide it anymore.

208
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,841
I like guys.

209
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,410
He is my partner,

210
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,112
the best gift of my life.

211
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,583
Let's talk about

212
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,818
how we get to know each other.

213
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,155
In the beginning, Damian is the one
who was chasing me like crazy.

214
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,656
It was you who went to my restaurant

215
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,558
and fell in love with me

216
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,726
When you interviewed me.

217
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,095
Yes. I admit that.

218
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,630
I had butterfly in

219
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,332
my stomach as I interviewed him.

220
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,634
Later, he was moved
by my famous Hualien souvenir.

221
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,503
We felt a sense of passion
for each other.

222
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,570
We fell in love.

223
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,472
Damian, he always wanted to have a baby.

224
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,341
So in the second year of our relationship,

225
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,109
we found a surrogate mother
from the US

226
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,844
and had Kai.

227
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,246
Kai, come over here.

228
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,381
Say Hi!

229
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,616
Hello!

230
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,552
The fourth new member is

231
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,054
Damian's son from his previous marriage,

232
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:42,688
Jimmy.

233
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,556
Fortunately,

234
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,526
At first, my parents
did not want to accept such truth,

235
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,895
but eventually, they accepted who we are.

236
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,096
I'll tell you guys more

237
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,931
about these stories later.

238
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,933
So stay tuned, guys!

239
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,303
They love you so much!

240
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,151
Wait a minute!

241
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,264
Hello, Mom.

242
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,065
What's up?

243
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,633
Jerry.

244
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,402
I'm so angry right now!

245
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,503
The aunt next door

246
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,071
told me you started a new channel.

247
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,506
I'm the last who knew about it.

248
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,474
I thought
you have already accepted the truth.

249
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,876
Your friends aren't

250
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,044
following or watching YouTube.

251
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,513
I haven't even told the relatives.

252
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,482
How your dad and I
are supposed to confront them?

253
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,751
It's impossible for us
to hide this fact all our lives.

254
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,386
Sooner or later,
it'll become public anyway.

255
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,354
It's not good for Kai

256
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,222
to hide him from anyone.

257
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,123
I don't care.

258
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,426
I don't want you to start this new channel.

259
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,962
So your so-called acceptance

260
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,863
is to accept us behind the closed door?

261
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:01,601
Kai and I face people
from the outside world every day.

262
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,703
There's nothing to be afraid of.

263
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,104
It's our own family's affairs.

264
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,505
Why you need to disclose everything

265
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,307
to everyone?

266
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,010
Because I'm proud so of

267
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,279
having a happy family life.

268
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,148
You don't think about the consequences.

269
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,252
If anything happens,
I'll be the one who's responsible.

270
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,442
Good morning!

271
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,844
Morning!

272
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,346
Did you sleep well?

273
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,582
Stop filming!

274
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,117
Let me film you!

275
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,320
Wake up! I'll film you.

276
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,254
No.

277
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,224
You are as handsome as you woke up.

278
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,596
Carry on!

279
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,363
Morning!

280
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,431
Give it back to me.

281
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,732
Wait. Stop filming for a minute!

282
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,733
Say ya.

283
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,235
Ya.

284
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,043
What are you doing? Darling.

285
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,144
What are you looking at?

286
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,745
I'm reading the comments of our fans.

287
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,846
Really?

288
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,747
Check it out!

289
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,516
Everyone says you are so handsome.

290
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,203
When the proposal is done,
please send it to me first.

291
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,104
I'll have a look at it.

292
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,305
I'll review and check it out for you.

293
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,840
I would like to see...

294
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,208
It's a bit heavy,

295
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,943
if it can be put under a yellow label,

296
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,144
It'll be OK.

297
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,479
- Okay?
- Okay.

298
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,431
We can discuss these things together.

299
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,966
Let's have a good discussion.

300
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,368
When it comes to my principles,
I won't compromise.

301
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,604
I don't get it.

302
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,973
Why such an important thing

303
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,375
was not discussed with me in advance?

304
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,310
The image of an business operator.

305
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,545
In fact, it's the image of an entrepreneur.

306
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,115
What you did is called wayward behavior.

307
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,750
Mr. Wang, do you know

308
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,619
we've got many positive

309
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,154
comments with great impact?

310
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,490
For example, tons of people
called and wanted to make a reservation.

311
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,191
We got so many inquiries.

312
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,493
The media also wanted

313
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,661
to interview us.

314
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,498
Coming out to the public
isn't following the principle.

315
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,533
You guys didn't ask for my permission.

316
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,301
You've crossed the line.

317
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,604
I decided not to invest anymore.

318
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,939
Mr. Wang,

319
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,274
this is not a game

320
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,776
that you can choose not to play.

321
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,177
We have signed a contract before.

322
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,745
We are protected under the contract.

323
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,913
The contract?

324
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,481
Have you read the part in the contract

325
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,683
where moral regulations are involved?

326
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,751
If there are

327
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,419
the violation of public order
and good morals,

328
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,955
The investment can be
completely withdrawn from me.

329
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,158
What is against morality?

330
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,793
Are we killing anyone?

331
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,628
What the heck are you talking about?

332
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,830
This is one of my moral rules.

333
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,598
I would never allow my business

334
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,667
to be involved with homosexuals.

335
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,068
To be involved with homosexuals.

336
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,670
Excuse me! Mr. Wang.

337
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,374
You're one of the big investors.

338
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,508
Didn't you know that

339
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,610
at the beginning, Verso

340
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,713
is an LGBTQ-friendly brand.

341
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,382
The target customers

342
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,017
are from the community.

343
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,518
Previously,
I believed you liked this fact,

344
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,955
then you saw a potential for investment.

345
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,357
You'd better listen up!

346
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,127
LGBTQ-friendly is one thing.

347
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,262
The restaurant owner coming out
to the public is another.

348
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,664
This is against my principles.

349
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,933
You guys crossed the line.

350
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,769
Mr. Wang.

351
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,741
You were too aggressive!

352
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,643
I told him already,

353
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:05,644
we can sort this out.

354
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,746
It turned out that the vibe is off.

355
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,348
I'll catch him up.

356
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,816
You should calm down and think about it.

357
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,357
Take a break first.

358
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,862
That investor acted nonsense.

359
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,497
I never thought that

360
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,900
Jerry's channel would be so popular.

361
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,570
I've promised to support him,

362
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,138
I'll never change my mind.

363
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,474
So I won't give in.

364
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,243
You love Jerry so much.

365
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,813
He’s really blessed.

366
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,952
But for you, Equal is also important.

367
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,588
He should also
take you into consideration.

368
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,366
I gotta go.

369
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,179
I'll let you play by yourself.

370
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,615
Be careful!

371
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,921
Hi Paul.

372
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,391
I think I need your help.

373
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,825
About my investor...

374
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,163
Okay.

375
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,498
Go and take care of your business.

376
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,632
Bye.

377
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,234
Hi Michelle.

378
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,335
Long time no see!

379
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,837
I am wondering if you're interested...

380
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,774
It's okay. We'll hang out next time.

381
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,815
Why did you push me?

382
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,784
I did it on purpose.

383
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,118
Why?

384
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,187
You're disgusting!

385
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,289
Why did you do this?

386
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,457
Which school are you studying at?

387
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,024
Come over here!

388
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,127
Why did you scold my son?

389
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,664
Didn't you see what he did to my son?

390
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,865
He pushed my son.

391
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:07,833
Did you do that?

392
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,401
Because daddy watched

393
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,003
their videos on the Internet.

394
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,137
He doesn't have a mom.

395
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,506
Daddy said gay's kid is disgusting.

396
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,308
Did your father tell you that?

397
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,609
Yes.

398
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,078
How could you

399
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,779
tell your kids that?

400
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,715
You're giving him the wrong idea.

401
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,883
It is your problem.

402
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,618
Why did you make such videos?

403
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,287
Aren't you making trouble for kids?

404
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,556
What's wrong with not having a mother?

405
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,457
I've got two fathers.

406
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,891
And you don't.

407
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,296
It's our freedom

408
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,430
to live whatever we want.

409
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,100
You don't have the rights
to tell us how to live.

410
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,701
Now that it was your child's fault
that pushed him first.

411
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,303
He was wrong.

412
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,538
Would you like me to call a cop
to make a judgment?

413
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:48,941
Sorry!

414
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:49,842
I apologize.

415
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,043
Let's go.

416
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,082
You're okay right?

417
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,120
Daddy, what does “disgusting” mean?

418
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,989
Why did he push me
just because I don't have a mom?

419
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,739
Darling.

420
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,941
Why didn't you go to bed yet?

421
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,154
I've got great news for you!

422
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,023
I've got sponsored
by an e-commerce platform.

423
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,327
They said they'd create a fully

424
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,663
LGBTQ-friendly shopping website.

425
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,099
The revenue is pretty high.

426
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,501
Until then,

427
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,136
let's take our child

428
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,471
to Kenting.

429
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,308
Today when Kai was playing
in the park,

430
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,876
he was pushed by a kid.

431
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,278
He fell off

432
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,813
and almost got hurt.

433
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,116
Why did it happen?

434
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,717
After the kid's dad

435
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,352
watched our videos,

436
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,354
he said we were disgusting.

437
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,823
So the kid bullied Kai.

438
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,059
This has gone too far.

439
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,362
I’ll go check if Kai is okay…

440
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,630
Stop.

441
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,865
He has fallen asleep.

442
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,434
What time is it now?

443
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,471
Darling, sorry!

444
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,506
Why didn't you call me?

445
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,574
I did.

446
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,075
But you didn't pick up the phone.

447
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,580
Let's stop the new channel.

448
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,883
You can continue with cooking videos.

449
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,785
After all, you've got many fans.

450
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,620
I don’t want to give Kai
any more exposure.

451
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,324
You said you would support me.

452
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,526
How can you change your mind so easily?

453
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,862
It's just because of a rude kid.

454
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,899
The only condition for me to support you

455
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,301
is our child isn't affected in any way.

456
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,504
But that's not the case today.

457
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,805
We encountered one bully.

458
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,007
I'm not sure

459
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,342
if there will be
two or three bullies after this.

460
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,414
I know you care for Kai a lot.

461
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,083
So do I.

462
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,252
The video's purpose is

463
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,854
to let Kai grow up in a positive way.

464
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,523
What happened today

465
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,058
represents that the society's prejudice
still exists.

466
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,760
We have to stand up against it.

467
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,930
You can say it confidently right now

468
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,665
because you weren't there.

469
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,334
You didn't see how Kai was bullied.

470
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,170
OK.

471
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,039
For the next episode,

472
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,340
I'll make a video about

473
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,075
prejudice and how serious it is.

474
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,077
By doing so, we can truly protect him.

475
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,582
Are you even listening to what I said?

476
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,652
If you did this,
wouldn't it be counterproductive?

477
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,820
Wouldn't it stimulate people's objections?

478
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,627
You make me disappointed.

479
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,795
You encouraged me to

480
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,263
stand up bravely.

481
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,731
Now I finally do,

482
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,266
and I give it a try.

483
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,068
And there are lots of people
who support me.

484
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,503
Everybody can protect Kai.

485
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,505
Now you want me
to stop working on the channel.

486
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,875
You got lost so easily

487
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,243
because there are too many people
supporting you.

488
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,411
You forgot that your family's safety

489
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,645
should be your priority.

490
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,114
How could you say something like this?

491
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,650
If someone supports me,
that means I'm doing the right thing.

492
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,153
It doesn't mean
I don't care about my family.

493
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:21,853
OK.

494
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,855
You said you care about your family.

495
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,159
Because of your goddamn channel,

496
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,927
Equal almost had to be closed.

497
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,395
I don't believe that!

498
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,336
Hey!

499
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,303
Where are you going?

500
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,771
Finish what you were saying.

501
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,773
You don't care even care
about the consequences!

502
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,382
You don't think about the consequences.

503
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,385
If anything happens,
I'll be the one who's responsible.

504
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,760
Mr. Wang, look at the statistics.

505
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,929
In fact, Verso was such a success.

506
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,297
For our second restaurant,

507
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,932
It didn't cost us a penny

508
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,434
from the beginning till now.

509
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,270
The LGBTQ consumer groups,

510
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,738
on social media platforms,

511
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,073
are willing to promote this cost.

512
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,842
In fact, it has exceeded five million.

513
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,310
Please look at this.

514
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,451
Mr. Wang,

515
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,453
I'm so sorry that I was unable to

516
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,855
control my feelings earlier.

517
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,257
Please forgive me for being reckless.

518
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,093
You have been supporting us
along the way,

519
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,962
I believe you admire us too.

520
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,963
And you know that

521
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,065
we are partners
who take things seriously.

522
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,434
From the business perspective,

523
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,935
LGBTQ communities have been

524
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,570
our target customers.

525
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,006
If we're going to
set boundaries with them right now,

526
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,574
that won't help anything at all.

527
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,478
We also understand
Mr. Wang's principle.

528
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,781
Under such principles,

529
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,449
we are also thinking
about the possibility.

530
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,785
For example,
after the new video was released,

531
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,220
Our reservation rate
is increased by 30%.

532
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,655
And more than half of the customers,

533
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,991
who visited our restaurant,
mentioned our channel.

534
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,260
So it proves that they were brough here

535
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,661
because of the channel.

536
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,434
This is a report that I got.

537
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,638
Our competitors have also noticed

538
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,806
that we monopolized this market.

539
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,207
This is what they had planned.

540
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,475
For the next steps,

541
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,010
is to target this area.

542
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,612
If we limit ourselves,

543
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,881
it won't be helpful
for our market development.

544
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:30,716
Of course,

545
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,185
Mr. Wang, your opinion
is the most important to us.

546
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,419
What do you think?

547
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,429
You guys must think it's strange.

548
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,933
Why did I act so harsh before?

549
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,635
I won't hide it from you two anymore.

550
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,645
He's my son in the States.

551
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,116
He met another guy

552
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,585
in a church.

553
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,387
And they ended up dating with each other.

554
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,689
This is my only son.

555
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,858
My wife can't accept it.

556
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,294
Right now my son has no faith.

557
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,830
There will also be no offspring for us.

558
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:23,402
My wife no longer talks to my son.

559
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,270
If I let my wife know that

560
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,905
the bar I invested in

561
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,974
has something to do
with an openly-gay person.

562
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,211
I believe she'll tell me
to stop investing right away.

563
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,553
Sorry to hear that.

564
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,289
In terms of business,

565
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,660
your difficulties and thoughts

566
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,128
are understandable to us.

567
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,265
Of course right now we have to

568
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,100
find a balance between us.

569
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,270
Mr. Wang, it's your personal matter,
we won't ask any further questions.

570
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,572
But I'm quite close with

571
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,940
the LGBTQ church in the States.

572
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,608
So if your son

573
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,544
is in need of help,

574
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,045
we are always here to help.

575
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,020
Yoyo, what do you think of this outfit?

576
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,887
It looks great!

577
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,589
OK. Jerry.

578
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,124
How is it?

579
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:20,859
It's very beautiful.

580
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,693
Ok.

581
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,428
Thanks!

582
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,496
This one?

583
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,298
OK.

584
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,933
I'll pick some outfits first.

585
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,334
Yoyo will take you
to the changing room.

586
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:29,935
OK.

587
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,002
Yoyo, you take him to the changing room.

588
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,170
OK.

589
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,605
Hair's done?

590
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,506
Fix here a bit.

591
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,509
OK.

592
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,610
OK.. Thanks!

593
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,711
OK. I'll change the outfit.

594
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,679
- This way.
- Okay.

595
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,050
Xiang, thanks!

596
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,884
Please stand there.

597
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:46,718
OK.

598
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:47,719
OK.

599
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,621
Look at the camera.

600
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,956
Good!

601
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,290
Relax your shoulders.

602
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,660
Look at me.

603
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,063
It looks great!

604
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,532
- Perfect looking!
- It suits you well.

605
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,766
It's so good-looking!

606
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,501
Please stand there.

607
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,401
OK.

608
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,173
Take it easy!

609
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:08,507
OK.

610
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,441
Look at the camera!

611
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,275
He just changed his shoes.

612
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,610
I think it looks better.

613
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,644
Yes.

614
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,286
Good job! You look very good.

615
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:21,953
Wait!

616
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,822
Please help me fix his hair.

617
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:24,289
OK.

618
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,991
Also fix the pant area.

619
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:26,825
Thanks!

620
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,659
Sorry. Keep it lower a little bit.

621
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,994
OK. Sorry.

622
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,863
Come and have a look in the pictures.

623
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,031
In fact, I'm a fan

624
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,500
of your YouTube channel.

625
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,034
Really?

626
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,335
Yes. And

627
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,271
I thought about coming out to my mom.

628
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,007
In order to prepare for it,

629
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,643
I let her watch your videos.

630
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,679
She likes Kai a lot.

631
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,481
Thanks!

632
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,248
Keep it up!

633
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:50,949
Okay.

634
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,017
I'll fix this a bit.

635
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,485
OK. Thank you.

636
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,286
Jerry is such

637
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,820
an LGBTQ icon in this new generation.

638
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,821
No, I wouldn’t dare!

639
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,091
Mr. Wang decided to compromise.

640
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:04,129
As long as you don't appear on the channel.

641
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,698
And the videos that were previously released

642
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,633
have to be taken down.

643
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,236
Because his wife hasn't found out
about this channel yet.

644
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,905
So he could hide this from her.

645
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,741
Then he can continue to support us.

646
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,246
Removing the videos...

647
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,482
Will it give Jerry a hard time?

648
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,786
But it's Mr. Wang's bottom line.

649
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,956
If you still want Equal
to operate like usual,

650
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,891
you should go talk with Jerry.

651
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,526
I tried my best.

652
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,065
You know that Jerry
must be so disappointed.

653
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,001
Go and speak with him nicely.

654
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,904
This business is also important to you.

655
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,484
Is this a kind of return?

656
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,086
Now it's my turn to wait up.

657
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,154
Feel how you felt before.

658
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,592
God's fair.

659
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,893
I'm tired today.

660
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,261
I don't want to fight.

661
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,565
You're not the only one that's tired.

662
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,203
OK.

663
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,671
We are both tired.

664
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,641
Whatever's on your mind, just say it.

665
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,746
If you're still clear-headed.

666
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,815
I am clear-headed.

667
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,350
I also face reality.

668
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,221
The investor's bottom line is that

669
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,491
I have to stop filming.

670
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,194
And all of the previous videos
that I was filmed in have to be removed.

671
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:47,265
Otherwise, the efforts I put in Equal
will be all wasted.

672
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,700
I know this is really

673
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,502
hard for you.

674
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,505
But this investor
is also important to me.

675
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,307
I'm about to open my restaurant.

676
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,777
I can neither take the risks,

677
00:27:58,777 --> 00:27:59,911
nor bear the loss.

678
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,746
This is not just about me.

679
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,149
I'm also responsible
for all of my workers.

680
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,419
As the owner, I can't be so selfish.

681
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,088
OK.

682
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,190
You're right.

683
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,093
I can't drag others into this.

684
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,996
I'm willing to compromise.

685
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:21,599
Thank you.

686
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,004
I understand how hard it is for you
to make such a decision.

687
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,138
Wait.

688
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,340
I haven't finished yet.

689
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,644
You don't have to be
in front of the camera anymore.

690
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:36,114
But I can't remove the videos
that were previously uploaded.

691
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,048
This will affect

692
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,850
the contract with the advertisers.

693
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,028
Can we do something

694
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,830
with the videos that I was filmed in it?

695
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,666
For example, add a blur effect to videos
or something like that?

696
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,234
It is not great to

697
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,737
use such an effect.

698
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,371
It will make
the videos look even worse.

699
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,440
OK.

700
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,677
I'll think of solutions.

701
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,293
It looks so cool!

702
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,229
Yes. I want everything.

703
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,096
Look!

704
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,465
I think you only need
this hangover relief drink.

705
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,900
No need.

706
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,668
Mama needs alcohol.

707
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:31,770
Give me drinks.

708
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,937
OK.

709
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,606
Here they are.

710
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,275
Congratulations!

711
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,076
Thanks!

712
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,010
Awesome!

713
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,480
Which company do you work with?

714
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,715
TK LAB.

715
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,950
They're using a vending machine.

716
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,452
It makes these skincare products

717
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,721
no longer a high-priced luxury product,

718
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,389
but an affordable daily necessity.

719
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,325
And by this development path,
money that can be saved

720
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,327
is being used to produce something
that's useful and effective.

721
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:59,030
High quality product
with reasonable prices.

722
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,698
I really admire them.

723
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,500
Next time
I'll introduce them to you guys.

724
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,868
OK.

725
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:04,936
Where's Sasa?

726
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:05,904
She's parking a car.

727
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,639
But I think we can go inside first.

728
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,608
I can't wait to drink.

729
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:11,009
Yes.

730
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:11,843
Quickly.

731
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,278
We won't leave until we get drunk.

732
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,112
Go and have a drink!

733
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,213
Oh let's see!

734
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,082
Today, we invited Ms. Meiru

735
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:18,950
to share with us on

736
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,051
a guide to getting into
an affectionate relationship.

737
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:23,021
（Equal Opening Party）

738
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,856
Ms. Meiru, can you teach us?

739
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,258
I'm getting tired of flings.

740
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:27,759
We really want to know.

741
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,960
Sorry, hold on.

742
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:30,195
Thanks!

743
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:34,599
Mr. Wang, thank you
for attending today's event.

744
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,302
Equal can be like this today
because it relies on everyone's help.

745
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,638
Mr. Wang's friends
are all our VIPs.

746
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,074
So today we put

747
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,009
all the special wines here.

748
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,211
Please feel free to enjoy your wine!

749
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,912
You guys must have some fun! Thanks!

750
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:48,713
Let's drink!

751
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,048
Drink all together!

752
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:50,615
Thanks!

753
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,416
Cheers to a night without kids.

754
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,519
I just said the same thing.

755
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,687
Cheers!

756
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,324
Where's Jerry?

757
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,058
No idea.

758
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,459
Not sure if he's delayed by work.

759
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,294
I haven't seen Jerry.

760
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,296
Are they fighting again?

761
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,232
They look okay on the channel.

762
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,499
I'll call him.

763
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,737
Excuse me! Hold on a second.

764
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,083
He rejected my call.

765
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:25,683
Rejected your call?

766
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,418
Bad news.

767
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,187
Shit.

768
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,521
Let's drink first.

769
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,125
Here he is.

770
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,894
Thanks! Congrats!

771
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,427
Thanks!

772
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,428
Damian

773
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,998
All right, I'll leave you to it.

774
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,032
I'll go now.

775
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,201
Welcome!

776
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,670
Thank you for coming!

777
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,748
Hello.

778
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,516
Are you on your way?

779
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,820
I got a last-minute interview invitation.

780
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,790
And your investor is at Equal.

781
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,592
It would be better if I don't show up.

782
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,627
Doesn't he dislike my channel?

783
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,796
Why should I join the party
and ruin the vibe?

784
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,898
You're throwing a tantrum, aren't you?

785
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,700
He didn't say you can't come.

786
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,169
You better tell me earlier
if you don't want to come.

787
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,672
Forget it!

788
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,206
Just go and do your thing.

789
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,089
Cheers to us!

790
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,791
Cheers to our internal authorities.

791
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,059
Right?

792
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,762
C'mon!

793
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,764
Drink up.

794
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,633
Come!

795
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,634
Drink up!

796
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,469
You guys must drink it up!

797
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,604
Thanks!
Join us if you're free next time!

798
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,840
- Thanks!
- Bye.

799
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,607
Awesome!

800
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,243
My weight is only 67kg in the picture.

801
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:00,311
Just 2kg difference.

802
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:00,979
Where is the difference?

803
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,314
Let me have a drink.
You were drinking just now.

804
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,816
You can drink half of it.

805
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,250
It's way too much.

806
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,386
Please share some with me.

807
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,388
Damian.

808
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,657
You drink too much.

809
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,159
Not really.

810
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,561
Your body is getting thinner.

811
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,529
You're really losing weight.

812
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,298
Because you know I just saw...

813
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,967
Raise your wine glass.

814
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,035
Ok.

815
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,339
Keep on drinking!

816
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,441
Today's Grand Opening,

817
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,443
no one can return home sober
and clear-headed.

818
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:32,944
Cheers!

819
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:33,444
Cheers!

820
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,879
Ok. The glass.

821
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,315
It seems like Jerry's not coming today.

822
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,249
Damn.

823
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,550
OK.

824
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,485
All right!

825
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,287
I've got something to announce.

826
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,825
Good friends from Taiwan,

827
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:51,829
thank you for being here today!

828
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,964
Everyone knows that

829
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:56,200
Damian and I have poured
our hearts and souls into Verso.

830
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,370
Today Equal's opening is very successful.

831
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,372
So everything is settled.

832
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,508
I also accomplished it.

833
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,576
Great success!

834
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,446
Congratulations!

835
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:12,884
It's time for my life.

836
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,919
I'll go back to the States next month.

837
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,354
I'll live with my boyfriend and

838
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,556
start a new life.

839
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,061
I'll leave Equal to my brother.

840
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,762
Please support Damian, okay?

841
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,764
Okay!

842
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,499
Congratulations!

843
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:30,968
Congratulations!

844
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,603
Cheers!

845
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,340
Why didn't you discuss
such an important thing

846
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,843
with me first?

847
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,245
You are so busy.

848
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,914
I'm afraid you'll be distracted.

849
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,083
So you just want to leave right?

850
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,851
You can leave whenever you want, right?

851
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,518
Hey! Come on!

852
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,519
Ok.

853
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,688
He's going to puke.

854
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:51,522
Go away!

855
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,290
Hurry up!

856
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,091
Go away!

857
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:53,591
Ok.

858
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,725
Calm down.

859
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,160
I'll take care of him. It's okay.

860
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,862
Damian, are you okay?

861
00:34:59,330 --> 00:34:59,664
Nothing.

862
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:00,298
No worries.

863
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,999
Have some drinks.

864
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,976
Why?

865
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,512
Why?

866
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,450
Are you okay?

867
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,284
Let me take you inside.

868
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,486
Come on.

869
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,424
I'll take you inside.

870
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,060
It'll be fine.

871
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,195
- Why?
- Be careful.

872
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,631
Come on!

873
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,602
Why the things I do
never work well for me?

874
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,739
Why Jerry can't understand me?

875
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:42,340
I can understand you.

876
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,108
I can accompany you, right?

877
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,745
Why the investor
can't accept me coming out?

878
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,347
Just ignore him.

879
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,581
What the heck did he talk about?

880
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,650
Why does Celine want to leave?

881
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,652
Why does she want to leave?

882
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,688
They left you but I'm here for you.

883
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,956
I'm here for you.

884
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,658
It's fine.

885
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,861
I don't fucking like this.

886
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,796
- I don't fucking like myself.
- It'll be okay

887
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,402
It'll be okay.

888
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,004
Okay?

889
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,972
Don't worry.

890
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,344
I'm here for you.

891
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,579
It'll be fine!

892
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,550
Let's drink!

893
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,951
Here he comes!

894
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,152
Where's Damian?

895
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,820
Why didn't he pick up my phone?

896
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,088
No, today is an important day.

897
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,390
Why did you just arrive?

898
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,392
Did you guys fight?

899
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,031
No worries.

900
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,132
I'm here.

901
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,274
I'm telling you
right now he's in a bad mood.

902
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,476
He's been drinking

903
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:53,244
nonstop all night long.

904
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:56,180
He is now vomiting in the bathroom.

905
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,014
Anyway it's an awful situation,

906
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,783
just go check on him quickly.
