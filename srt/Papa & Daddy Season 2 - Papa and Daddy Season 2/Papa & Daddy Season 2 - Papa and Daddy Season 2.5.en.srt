(Episode 5 Forgiveness)

2
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,326
Good morning, Taipei.

3
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,451
Good morning.

4
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,130
Daddy, I...

5
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,132
Oh, sorry!

6
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,167
I'm going to play basketball.

7
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:15,902
No!

8
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,303
Where are you going instead of school?

9
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,072
Auntie said I don't have to go to school.

10
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,074
No, wait a minute!

11
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,178
You should only do what I told you.

12
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,479
What if there are bad guys out there?

13
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,581
I don't think there are so
many bad guys out there.

14
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,983
No, wait, you...

15
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,987
Listen to me,

16
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,955
Who are you going to play basketball with?

17
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,624
I'll see who's there.

18
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,760
When are you going back to school?

19
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,829
There's no need.

20
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,465
I can take you to school.

21
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,133
Can you put your clothes on first?

22
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,206
Thanks, Taipei.

23
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,500
“PAPA & DADDY 2”

24
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,084
Kai, listen to Daddy,

25
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,385
do whatever
your teacher tells you to do,

26
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,954
and take a nap during lunchtime, OK?

27
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,322
But I can't sleep.

28
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,256
Then you can read a book.

29
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,791
Don't bother other children, OK?

30
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,692
You need to keep quiet, understand?

31
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,294
I don't have to take a nap
at grandparents' house.

32
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,763
Rules are the rules, OK?

33
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,764
Is that OK?

34
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,167
Haven't seen him for a long time.

35
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:54,667
You see.

36
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,501
Kai

37
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,607
I want it.

38
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,207
Kai,

39
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,909
remember to leave some for the teacher.

40
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,644
Kai, you're here.

41
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,645
- Hello.
- Kai's Dad.

42
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,447
OK, let's all come inside.

43
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,249
Let's welcome Kai.

44
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,350
- Long time no see.
- Bye, Kai.

45
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,950
Hurry up.

46
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,952
- Kai.
- Let's go inside and eat.

47
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,954
No goodbye again.

48
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,029
(Babe, Amy needs our help!)

49
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,430
(Meet you at TKK.)

50
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,973
Wait for Mommy.

51
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,508
- Hi, Matt
- You're finally here.

52
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,277
What's going on?

53
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,279
I heard Matt was bullied.

54
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,281
Matt said he wanted to wear a skirt

55
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,449
when we went out this morning.

56
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,318
So, Sasa and I thought that was fine

57
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,086
if he wanted to wear a skirt.

58
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,255
But when we just arrived
at the gate of kindergarten,

59
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,623
there were a few children
and they started laughing at him.

60
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,825
One of them even pulled up his skirt.

61
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,194
Didn't the child's parent
stop him doing it?

62
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,096
Nope.

63
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,932
Luckily, Matt wasn't aware
that they were being mean to him.

64
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,934
He thought it was funny.

65
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,936
Does Sasa know about this?

66
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:04,937
No, I didn't tell her.

67
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,973
You know what's she like,

68
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,908
she'd probably rush to school
to scold those kids.

69
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,043
That would be even worse.

70
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:10,910
What about the teacher?

71
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,478
Does the teacher know about this?

72
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,114
Well, I was too angry a minute ago,

73
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,182
and you know, I...

74
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,284
I just wanted to bring Matt
out of that place.

75
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,720
I didn't even have time
to tell the teacher.

76
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,823
I just thought
if I told the teacher about it,

77
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,825
it might turn out badly.

78
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,726
Because we're not sure

79
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,728
that the teacher can accept it.

80
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,540
I think, nowadays,
teachers are quite open-minded.

81
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,701
If they can't accept the children
who are different from the rest,

82
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,703
how are they going to tell other children

83
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,104
that we need to respect
each others' differences.

84
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,806
It's hard to tell,

85
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,608
many people are still
conservative nowadays.

86
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,010
Like what happened
to The Rose Boy, Yung-Chih Yeh,

87
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,611
that wasn't too long ago.

88
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,314
Can you not make it sound so serious?

89
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,917
That time was very different
from what we have now.

90
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,186
Who's he?

91
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,990
- American.
- American.

92
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,293
- Matt's Mom.
- Why are you here, teacher?

93
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,260
I heard what happened
at the school gate,

94
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,396
I'm very sorry about
what happened there.

95
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,064
Luckily, I've found you all here.

96
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,300
I've talked to
other children in the class,

97
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,801
especially Sean,
who pulled up Matt's skirt.

98
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,503
He feels sorry for what he had done.

99
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,071
Does Matt feel alright?

100
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,140
Would you like to come back
to the class with me?

101
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,542
Because Sean would like
to apologize to you.

102
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,577
I finished my drink.

103
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,679
Can I go back to the class now?

104
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,680
Of course, you can!

105
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,282
Can we change your skirt

106
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,017
into pants? Is that OK?

107
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,285
It's OK.

108
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,221
I think every child is exploring

109
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,389
during this stage in life.

110
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,391
We should learn to respect that.

111
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,759
As for the students in class,

112
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,827
it's a good learning
opportunity for them.

113
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,996
Him, wearing skirt
doesn't bother anyone.

114
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,731
As a teacher myself,

115
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,999
I also hope he can wear the clothes

116
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,935
that he feels the most comfortable with.

117
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,804
Teacher, you are amazing!

118
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,339
Yeah, thank you, teacher.

119
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,673
Thank you, thank you.

120
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,875
Then, lets' head back to
the kindergarten.

121
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,260
Let's go!

122
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,010
Thank you, teacher.

123
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,278
Thank you.

124
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,448
Thank you for dropping by.

125
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,449
No worries,

126
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,650
I'll bring him back now.

127
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,819
OK, bye.

128
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,787
Oh, I almost forgot,

129
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,822
what Jerry just said reminds me that

130
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,657
there is a Yung-Chih Yeh memorial concert

131
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,125
this weekend.

132
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,593
You must all come together!

133
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,261
OK.

134
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,195
I'll bring them there.

135
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,363
Together.

136
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,365
Bye-bye!

137
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,369
It would be great if Jimmy

138
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,503
had such an amazing teacher like her.

139
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,173
Oh,

140
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,475
who's that person
you were talking about?

141
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,779
Are we going to a concert?

142
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,115
Hip-hop or rock?

143
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,184
It's a memorial concert,

144
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,953
In memory of a boy named Yung-Chih Yeh.

145
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,688
Who is he?

146
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,091
He passed away
when he was about your age.

147
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,626
Some incidents happened to him.

148
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,796
I've just heard about it.

149
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,599
Anyways, it's a very sad story.

150
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,902
But also because of his story,

151
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:54,674
many Taiwanese have realized
the importance of gender diversity.

152
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,908
We don't want children who are like him

153
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,610
to be bullied again.

154
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,413
His parents must be very sad.

155
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,385
If this ever happens to me...

156
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,888
I change the song into a hip-hop song.

157
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,491
Are you listening?

158
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,104
I share a similar situation

159
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,640
with this Rose Young Man.

160
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,911
Just because we're different in school,

161
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,248
like we've done something wrong.

162
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,961
Are you alright, Dad?

163
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,097
Jimmy,

164
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,802
you aren't wrong.

165
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,237
Don't think like that.

166
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,705
Just be yourself.

167
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,879
I won't ask you to change
to who you aren't.

168
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,081
So, don't feel stressed, OK?

169
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,751
OK, I see.

170
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,654
I respect who you are.

171
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,558
You know that
Daddy is always behind you.

172
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
I understand.

173
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,095
I'll go back to school.

174
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,230
Next week.

175
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,698
OK.

176
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,233
I'm proud of you, man.

177
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,172
That concert,

178
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,941
can I go on stage?

179
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,576
I don't know about that.

180
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,511
If that's allowed, I'll definitely
let you go on stage.

181
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,245
OK.

182
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,518
I'll teach you my dance moves.

183
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,719
Kai, watch my move.

184
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,820
Kai, see?

185
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,655
We can apply this to the concert.

186
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,590
You see?

187
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,060
Now spin.

188
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,164
I'm dizzy.

189
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:00,933
Jimmy, Kai.

190
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,534
It's bedtime.

191
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,035
Right now.

192
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,037
You see this move?

193
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,606
Pretty cool, huh?

194
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,674
You've already said "right now"
half an hour ago.

195
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,709
It's very late now

196
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,243
and no more postponing bedtime.

197
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,552
Turn off the music, and go to bed now!

198
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,821
You don't need to go to school,
but Kai does.

199
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,200
Jimmy.

200
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,652
Darling,

201
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,624
It's late now. Why aren't you in bed?

202
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,432
What's the matter?

203
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,069
I yelled at Jimmy.

204
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,575
Why?

205
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:51,777
Because I don't like it

206
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,113
when he disrupts Kai's bedtime routine.

207
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,183
I wasn't able to control
my temper,

208
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,085
and I raised my voice.

209
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,123
You don't have to be so nervous.

210
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,060
Jimmy cares for Kai very well.

211
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,496
I know that.

212
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,064
I'm touched by it, too.

213
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,735
But I still have to take charge of them.

214
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,105
I just don't know
if I am entitled to...

215
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,873
After all,

216
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,509
I can't count as him "stepmom."

217
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,747
After I told him off,

218
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,548
and looked at the way he looked at me,

219
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,051
I felt regret doing all this.

220
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,821
Or you can help me to tell him...

221
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,563
Wait,

222
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,935
I think, as a family, we shouldn't
keep secrets from each other.

223
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,004
Now, we should spend some time,

224
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,173
so everyone can open up
and have their say.

225
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,274
OK?

226
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,116
Jimmy.

227
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,523
Baby.

228
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,998
OK.

229
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,134
I'll count to three,

230
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,503
then everyone has
to say what's on their mind,

231
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,438
OK?

232
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,539
One,

233
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,541
two,

234
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:03,609
three.

235
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,977
- Jerry hates me.
- Jimmy is angry with me.

236
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:05,578
I don't hate you.

237
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,579
Papa was so angry.

238
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,913
- I'm not angry at you.
- Bro ignores me.

239
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,949
That was because that day,
you made Kai sleep late.

240
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,217
He had to go to school, you know?

241
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,818
You were so mad.

242
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:13,752
- I'm not mad.
- OK.

243
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,254
Thank you

244
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,224
for being willing to speak up.

245
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,894
Now, we have two choices,

246
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:22,995
number one,

247
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,765
we can stay gloomy like this
and go to the concert.

248
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,201
Number two,

249
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,904
we can let it go for now

250
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,240
and enjoy the time at the concert.

251
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,275
Reach out your hand,

252
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,711
if you're willing to let go.

253
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,154
Kai, hurry, let's go.

254
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,923
Let's go to the concert.

255
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,729
Thanks, Baby.

256
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,530
I'll repay you

257
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,532
at night time.

258
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,175
Heading this way, thank you.

259
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,877
"Faraway loneliness,"

260
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,113
"as if the thorn on the rose"

261
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,116
"Let memories of pain
disappear into oblivion."

262
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,653
"That year, the young boy
was as frightened as a lamb."

263
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,924
"He was expelled by the howling wolves."

264
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,927
"Driven out of the meadow
that so called world."

265
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,195
"The rose darkened,"

266
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,498
"the boy was full of sorrow."

267
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,967
"What he had to face
for the past sixteen years,"

268
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,168
"was where did he come from and where should he go."

269
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,536
"where did he come from and where should he go."

270
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,605
"The loss in his youth."

271
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,374
Hello! Welcome!

272
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,242
Give it to me.

273
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,643
Welcome Daddies join our activity.

274
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,244
Jimmy,

275
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,979
we have a new activity today.

276
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,280
- What activity?
- The rose always represents

277
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,316
the gentleness and the feminine quality
that Yung-Chih Yeh possessed.

278
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,017
Let's hope our sorrow will
transform into empowerment,

279
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,486
just like a tough
and persevering cactus.

280
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,922
It represents
the Never to Give Up spirit.

281
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,525
We especially selected the Rose Cactus

282
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,859
that represents perseverance and beauty.

283
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,262
This is the message we want
to convey as organizers.

284
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,463
So, today, you can choose

285
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,297
whatever you like

286
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,132
and whatever you want
to tell the world today.

287
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:07,766
OK.

288
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,134
Can you please give us two of these?

289
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:09,835
Sure.

290
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,603
Do you like this one, Kai?

291
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,104
Jimmy.

292
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,006
Can I write in English?

293
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,007
Sure.

294
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:15,975
OK.

295
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,476
Write it down here.

296
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,277
You want to write something, Kai?

297
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,212
"Scatter rose petals onto the sky."

298
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,215
"The comely sunset dyed red."

299
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:27,653
"The boy said when the rose
encounters the cactus."

300
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,455
"If I want to love,"

301
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,358
"I must love myself
for who I really am."

302
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,626
Hi, Matt.

303
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,596
Why do you wear a bunny costume today?

304
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,431
He came up with the idea
to wear a bunny costume,

305
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,399
when we were about to set out.

306
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,001
Nothing I could do about it.

307
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,235
You're not telling him

308
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,703
that you want to have a pet
or something like that, are you?

309
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,771
So, he misunderstood you.

310
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,374
Hi. Matt.

311
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,942
So cute!

312
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:51,243
Hi, everyone.

313
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,412
I'm Jay Lin.

314
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,581
I'm gay,

315
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,083
and also a father of two boys.

316
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,053
I wish every child in the world

317
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:05,057
could live happily and healthily.

318
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,025
Thank you.

319
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,966
Next, let's welcome SKY and Hao

320
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,335
to perform the theme song

321
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,138
for our memorial concert on stage.

322
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,339
Welcome!

323
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,915
It's OK.

324
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,421
You are only a child on this path

325
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:41,660
Staggered and stumbled into the world
without even knowing why

326
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,800
But you give your big hugs

327
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,335
It's OK

328
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:55,441
We are in this together

329
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,445
Eat the hot soup
Imagine it slowly

330
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,581
A home with an extra set of
bowls and chopsticks

331
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:07,920
Add another member
to the family photo

332
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,389
We aren't wrong

333
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,958
We wouldn't be weak

334
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,828
We aren't wrong

335
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,163
Gentle but firm

336
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,866
Standing right here

337
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,135
It has never gone away

338
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,774
Rain and storms, water and fires,
we're in this together

339
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,477
We aren't wrong

340
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,146
We wouldn't be weak

341
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,815
We aren't wrong

342
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,485
Gentle but firm

343
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:44,823
In an infinite universe,
let the love keep growing

344
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,759
Carry on promising,
carry on achieving

345
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,030
Carry on sparkling like the firework

346
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,165
- Thank you.
- It's beautiful.

347
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,171
A beautiful song.

348
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,951
Thank you, everybody!

349
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,753
I'm Hao's mother.

350
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,222
I feel sorry

351
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:22,127
that his mother wasn't able
to see Yung-Chih, a considerate child

352
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,530
who never bullied anyone,

353
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,599
but was harmed, grow up.

354
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,235
Just like Mrs. Yeh said,

355
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,738
"We wouldn't be weak."

356
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,107
"Because we aren't wrong."

357
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,610
Everyone of us standing right here,

358
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:43,215
is for Yung-Chih,
to perpetuate the meaning of his life.

359
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:49,188
Everyone of us has the right to grow up,

360
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,622
and,

361
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,559
we can choose the way
how we want to grow up.

362
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,866
I don't know if my child
is queer or not,

363
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,236
but I'll keep him company

364
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,637
until he figures it out.

365
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,006
Just like Mrs. Yeh, for all these years,

366
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,475
she's been keeping us company.

367
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,378
In order to
let the love continue to grow,

368
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,249
and to diminish
the inequality permanently.

369
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,250
Thank you.

370
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,850
Babe.

371
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,663
I think,

372
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,834
it doesn't matter if Matt likes
to wear boy's or girl's costumes,

373
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,136
even animal costumes,

374
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,539
as long as he's happy, right?

375
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,110
So, we don't need to guess or suspect

376
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,413
what Matt turns out to be.

377
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,182
He'll always be our baby,

378
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,650
right?

379
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,787
Since Jimmy's been here with me,

380
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,223
I'd kept trying to change him.

381
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,860
I thought I was right
to ask him to follow my way,

382
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,862
but I had overlooked

383
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,131
that either me, or Taiwan,

384
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,133
is all strange to him.

385
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,136
He feels rather aggrieved in school,

386
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,905
and not validated when he comes home.

387
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,509
Maybe, in his heart,

388
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,511
This is a kind of way

389
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,581
resembles the life of Yung-Chih Yeh.

390
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,683
Don't worry, Damian.

391
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,185
Jimmy is a bright and upbeat child.

392
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,754
He'll be alright.

393
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,456
Yeah, don't blame yourself.

394
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,592
No one was born to be parents.

395
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,394
Look at us,

396
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,996
We're learning
by being parents ourselves.

397
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:39,798
Darling,

398
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,935
I'll have more patience with Jimmy,

399
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,570
and try to understand the real him.

400
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,872
Thank you, Baby.

401
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,073
Let's stick together!

402
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,342
Cheers!

403
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,511
D... J... A... S...

404
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,281
I think we are really good parents.

405
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,517
Yes, we're good at
looking after the children,

406
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,519
and also good at reviewing ourselves.

407
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,920
I feel like I want to be my own son now.

408
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,424
- You're sure you have the right to say this?
- Everyone, ready to be different?

409
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,525
Jimmy,

410
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,995
Jimmy!

411
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,465
Damian.

412
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,300
Jimmy's very special.

413
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,902
You're lucky.

414
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:17,903
We wouldn't be weak

415
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,472
We aren't wrong

416
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,207
We wouldn't be weak
Jimmy is so handsome on stage!

417
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,008
We aren't wrong

418
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,276
We aren't wrong. We aren't wrong

419
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,177
We aren't wrong

420
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,244
Hurry, go.

421
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:26,878
Hurry up.

422
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:27,612
Hurry.

423
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,514
Go, go onto stage.

424
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,650
Carry on.

425
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:33,685
Go.

426
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,759
So cool!

427
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,862
My son choreographed this.

428
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,896
Isn't it cool?

429
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,365
Cool!

430
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,366
Look over here!

431
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,670
Thank you for accepting
that I'm different, Daddy.

432
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,704
I love you.

433
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,905
I love you, too.

434
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,243
Amy, Sasa!

435
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,880
Come and dance, Kai.

436
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,048
Let's dance together.

437
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,285
So cute!

438
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,154
He's so small.

439
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,927
Thank you, everyone.

440
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,362
Thank you, Bye-bye!

441
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:30,575
That's Jimmy's.

442
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,511
I wish the young man got a brother

443
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,179
to protect him at school

444
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,881
like I would do.

445
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,250
Look, the one next to it is Kai's.

446
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,820
Papa, Daddy, Bro!

447
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,822
Yung-Chih Yeh.

448
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,990
Baby.

449
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,893
Our children are wonderful.

450
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,029
We're truly a happy family.

451
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,202
Hi, Mom.

452
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,337
Have you seen how many people
are watching the live streaming video?

453
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,306
It's really meaningful.

454
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,941
I wouldn't be here,

455
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,343
if it weren't for Dad.

456
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,579
Yeah, I know.

457
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,714
I saw you and Kai.

458
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,784
You looked so happy.
I'm so glad.

459
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,953
That concert is really unique.

460
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:16,955
Hey, Damian.

461
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,391
I've been following Jimmy online.

462
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,792
I think,

463
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,761
he's grown up a lot,

464
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,497
and has experienced many things
that are not common.

465
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,565
You know what,

466
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:30,101
I have started to consider forgiving you.

467
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,573
It's Celine. I need to take this call.

468
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,807
OK. Later.

469
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,875
Bye.

470
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,877
Bye-bye.

471
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:43,548
What's up?

472
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,850
Look!

473
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,218
There's an Instagram account...

474
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,920
Stonelez0909...

475
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,654
Wait a second.

476
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,489
Jimmy,

477
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,523
Find this account on Instagram.

478
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,525
Stonelez0909.

479
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,594
Yeah.

480
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,428
0909.

481
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,762
Yeah, this one.

482
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,498
Then what?

483
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,733
She just uploaded Jimmy's dancing video.

484
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,069
The likes are increasing.

485
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,337
So awesome!

486
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,239
And what's even more exaggerated...

487
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,342
The account belongs to Mrs. Shih,
Jimmy's teacher in school.

488
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,743
I had thought about it before

489
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,545
that I want to find a way
to get to know her.

490
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,280
I didn't expect you to act so quickly.

491
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,215
This is beyond expectation.

492
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,518
I started to follow her
when I went to school last time.

493
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,586
Thought I had
to "know the enemy and know oneself."

494
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:25,090
Now, I've realized, she's in the loop.

495
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,691
I think it's time

496
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,894
that we should start to know her again.

497
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:32,030
I guess to has started to like me.

498
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,905
I've never thought about this.

499
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:40,972
How could this be possible?

500
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,480
Cheers!

501
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,358
Baby.

502
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:05,530
I really appreciated you today

503
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:10,335
that you invited us
to Yung-Chih Yeh's concert.

504
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,506
Not only does it mean a lot to me,

505
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,441
but also for Jimmy,

506
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,346
and Kate... It means a lot to them.

507
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,259
Finally, both of you have reconciled.

508
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,394
It makes me happy.

509
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,936
To be honest,

510
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,673
I've been thinking,

511
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,212
that I might even
have failed as a daddy.

512
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,681
That's not true.

513
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,185
Jimmy said he loved you today.

514
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,988
Kate forgives you, too.

515
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,990
Everything is getting better.

516
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,561
Not just Jimmy,

517
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,699
You and Kai had been staying in Hualien,

518
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,267
and didn't want to come back.

519
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,804
That's because I was being useless...

520
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,573
And I...

521
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,341
also wanted to keep busy as an excuse

522
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,510
to cover my insecurities...

523
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,679
and helplessness.

524
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,757
I don't want,

525
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,993
and am afraid to have another child.

526
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,797
It has nothing to do
with our financial situation.

527
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,500
It's because I'm not confident

528
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,903
that I can be a good father.

529
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,175
That's what I'm really scared of.

530
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,279
OK, don't think too much.

531
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,057
Actually, I'm scared, too.

532
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,360
I don't know
if I can be a good stepfather.

533
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,137
But do you know?

534
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,006
I've got you,

535
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,842
and you've got me,

536
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,944
haven't you?

537
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,513
I think,

538
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,483
we still need to learn for a period.

539
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,288
As for my parents...

540
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,224
Don't worry.

541
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,026
I'll cover for you.

542
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,595
Baby.

543
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,166
I really feel

544
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,103
that I'm happy.

545
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,712
Now, we're a family of four,

546
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,582
and it makes me feel

547
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,417
another level of happiness.

548
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:22,093
So, can we just enjoy it at the present?

549
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,629
Just two of us.

550
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,767
What kind of "happiness"?

551
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,756
Are you OK?

552
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,527
Morning.

553
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,778
What happened last night?

554
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,947
I should ask you.

555
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,218
I warn you,

556
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,154
If I'm pregnant, you have
to take full responsibility.

557
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,960
Then I'll have to think about it.

558
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,129
Hey!

559
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,032
Teasing me.

560
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,867
You're done!

561
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,214
No, don't.

562
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,449
No!

563
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,017
Please.

564
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,419
Stay still.

565
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,520
Listen.

566
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,088
No.

567
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,695
Stay there.

568
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,373
Why we don't get interrupted?

569
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,713
Pants.

570
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,222
Jimmy?

571
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,192
Jimmy?

572
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,028
Kai?

573
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,200
Kai?

574
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,069
Nobody.

575
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,573
Kai?

576
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,441
Where did they go?

577
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:02,053
Red wine, candles

578
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,364
xoxo enjoy

579
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,291
I took Kai for breakfast.

580
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,059
You two can do a second round.

581
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,427
No one will bother you.
