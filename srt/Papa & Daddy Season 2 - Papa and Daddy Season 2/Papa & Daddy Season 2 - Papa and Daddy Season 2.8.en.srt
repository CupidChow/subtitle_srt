00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,303
(Episode 8 My Daddy's wedding)
I have so many questions and I want to know the answer.

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,572
I won't forgive you before
finding out what happened.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,173
I don't want to look into your eyes.

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,210
You can either nod or shake your head
to tell me the answers.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,011
OK?

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,684
Did you have an affair with Wei?

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,989
In fact, you don't want to settle down?

8
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,693
You still want to play around?

9
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,063
You think you're bored
when you face me everyday?

10
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,137
Do you really want to get married?

11
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,272
Not just because
you want me to be back?

12
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,714
Are you nodding or
shaking your head, Daddy?

13
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,187
What do you want?

14
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,425
I really want to get married,

15
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,094
and also want you to come back home.

16
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,033
Now you may kiss him.

17
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,445
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,846
I think I have a flu.

19
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,900
“PAPA & DADDY 2”

20
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,118
All of them don't even
score more than five.

21
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,019
Baby,

22
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,554
Your standard is too high.

23
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,589
Well, they just don't taste good enough.

24
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,258
Bride cakes are given to

25
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,160
our friends who come to bless us.

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,528
I don't want it to be lousy.

27
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,797
Baby,

28
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,298
I really think,

29
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,033
I've had enough sugar intake for today.

30
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:47,934
I can't eat anymore.

31
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,473
Your are getting too picky.

32
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,976
I wonder is it because you ate

33
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,279
too many tasty dishes
cooked from Kao in Hualien?

34
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,281
Yeah.

35
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,883
No wonder I looked down
on those bride cakes.

36
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,553
The desserts that Kao make
are just too good.

37
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,555
Darling,

38
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:12,392
Do you think we can let Kao
make those custom cakes?

39
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,827
OK.

40
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,829
Whatever you said.

41
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,831
Thank you, darling.

42
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,302
And,

43
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,538
we can also go back to Hualien,

44
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,774
to tell your parents about it.

45
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,012
I know.

46
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,916
I just need to think how
to explain it to them.

47
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,658
Baby, it's not too bad.

48
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,131
Hi.

49
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:52,966
Brother.

50
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,335
Haven't seen you for a while.

51
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,369
Jerry.

52
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,337
You're late.

53
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,473
Don't you know there are many things
to sort out for the wedding?

54
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,374
Brother.

55
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,408
Congratulations.

56
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,444
I'm so happy for you.

57
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,612
Thank you.

58
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,818
Damian really spent
a lot of money on this.

59
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,953
Look, Sister! It's a diamond ring.

60
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,457
Two carats.

61
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,658
So pretty!

62
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,094
Damian treats you really well.

63
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,296
So true.

64
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,397
I think so, too.

65
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,600
April showers bring May flowers.

66
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,302
Yes, they do.

67
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:29,936
Oh!

68
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,871
Fang has good news to share with you.

69
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,206
What?

70
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,208
Hurry up.

71
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:36,609
Come here.

72
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,244
I...

73
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,646
am pregnant.

74
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,681
Shh, be quiet.

75
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,983
There are other customers.

76
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,184
That's wonderful, Fang.

77
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,185
How many months now?

78
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,120
Just turned three months.

79
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,256
I'll have to ask you to teach me

80
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,624
how to look after children, Brother.

81
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,925
No worries,

82
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,161
I will pass on
the skills to you by then.

83
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:55,795
Wonderful!

84
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,963
I feel lucky that you had a child first.

85
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,532
It wasn't from your sperm.

86
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,266
What?

87
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,834
I really have a husband.

88
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,504
You're so silly.

89
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,739
Have you told Mom and Dad that

90
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,174
you and Damian
are getting married?

91
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,246
I'll go back and tell them
in a few days.

92
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,983
You don't need to worry.

93
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,985
Mom and Dad like Damian a lot.

94
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,020
And we'll help you, too.

95
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,388
We got your back.

96
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,356
That's right!

97
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,324
You have our support.

98
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,025
Thank you all.

99
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,228
Darling,

100
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,764
Where do you think

101
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,466
that we should hold our wedding?

102
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,268
I'll go first,

103
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,403
I don't want to hold our wedding
at an ordinary banqueting hall.

104
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,404
It's too impersonal there.

105
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,941
I want it to be in a private

106
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,509
and beautiful garden.

107
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,044
That would be heartwarming.

108
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,313
In terms of dishes...

109
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,481
we can leave it to Equal.

110
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,515
What do you think?

111
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,550
And drinks.

112
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,086
In that case, no one will be sober
before they leave.

113
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,492
Wait,

114
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:03,896
Darling, look.

115
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:04,897
Isn't that amazing?

116
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,200
This is perfect.

117
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,003
- Hello.
- Excuse me.

118
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,673
I want to ask if this place

119
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,208
can be hired out for weddings?

120
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,676
Sorry,

121
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,844
This is a private property.

122
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,445
It's not open to the public.

123
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,281
I see. Thank you.

124
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,056
Let's go find somewhere else, OK?

125
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,191
That's a shame.

126
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,960
Let's go, we're nearly late.

127
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,894
Wait, I need to take another picture.

128
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,096
Let's go. Hurry.

129
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,265
My God. This one I can't.

130
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,266
Yeah?

131
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,268
I thought the background
was pretty good.

132
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,303
I don't think it works.

133
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,540
I've heard so much about you.

134
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,076
I am your biggest fan.

135
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,644
I... I'm Thomas.

136
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,946
My nickname is Little Train.

137
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,214
Chu, chu!

138
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,517
You're both handsome boys.

139
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,118
So good to see you here.

140
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,555
If you don't like them,

141
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,056
we have other different styles.

142
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,425
Are you both going to wear suits?

143
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,593
Or one of you would like
to wear a wedding dress?

144
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,595
Wear a wedding dress?

145
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,396
Yeah.

146
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,832
If my baby wears a wedding dress,

147
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,467
that would look absolutely stunning!

148
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,968
Knock it off.

149
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,336
Why don't you both
wear wedding dresses?

150
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,204
I'll sponsor you.

151
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,306
What? No!

152
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,608
Darling, if you wear one,
I would wear one, too.

153
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,476
- I don't want to.
- Come on.

154
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,143
No, I don't want to.

155
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:24,944
- Let's wear them together.
- It will be beautiful.

156
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,379
Let's do it.

157
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,614
Don't you think too many people
have already put on those clothes.

158
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,715
It can't represent us.

159
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,050
You're right.

160
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,218
I don't think we should

161
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,719
follow the conventional weddings,

162
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,054
and have the same style of clothes.

163
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,456
Yeah.

164
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,557
Do you think so, too?

165
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,662
We are such a match.

166
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,766
Oh,

167
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,168
last time, Bryan said he wanted to help.

168
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,704
I think he's very good at styling,

169
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,272
and he knows us very well.

170
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,807
Or we can let him design
our wedding clothes.

171
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,641
Of course.

172
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,342
Really?

173
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,777
Let's go.

174
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,317
Mom,

175
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,321
Have you talked to
your older brother lately?

176
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,356
Nope.

177
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,324
What's up?

178
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,227
Once he goes back to Taipei,

179
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,995
it's very hard to reach out to him.

180
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:17,730
Maybe he's busy.

181
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,975
I don't even know if he's followed
the things I told him to do.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,034
Honestly!

183
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,641
Mom,

184
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,677
If I got married,

185
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,678
what would you think?

186
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,146
Get married?

187
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,215
That depends on if you marry a guy

188
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,950
or a girl.

189
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,018
What do you think?

190
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,453
Alright.

191
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,754
I will give you my blessings

192
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,223
as long as you're happy.

193
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:44,724
Then if...

194
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,893
But don't be like your brother.

195
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,928
Coming out on the live streaming video.

196
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,329
In the end, your dad and I didn't know

197
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,365
how to face some of our relatives.

198
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,034
What do you mean you didn't know
how to face them?

199
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035
Anyways, those relatives

200
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,904
don't watch Jerry's live stream videos.

201
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,105
And if you think about this,

202
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,740
Damian has been with him for so long.

203
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,042
The next step for them,
should be getting married.

204
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,211
There is a difference between you
and your older brother.

205
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,113
When you get married, you'll be added to
another family's Ancestry Book.

206
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:07,947
He's the first son,

207
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,181
so it's different with your situation.

208
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,816
Why don't you come in?

209
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,184
Mr. Pan.

210
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,155
But I think our ancestors
would want me to be happy.

211
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,223
Mom.

212
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,031
Damian, you're here.

213
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,233
Have you had your lunch yet?

214
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,235
I just made some dumplings.

215
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,136
That sounds great.

216
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,704
I miss your dumplings.

217
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,906
- OK. I'll go cook them.
- Thank you.

218
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:37,843
Mom,

219
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,812
Just pause for a minute.

220
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,547
I have something to say to you.

221
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,507
I've considered this.

222
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,877
I really don't want another child.

223
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,447
It is because, for me,

224
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,782
Kai is like my biological child.

225
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,151
And I've discussed this with Damian,

226
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,921
he's willing to let Kai have my surname.

227
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,357
Then he can be added
to the Ancestry Book.

228
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,194
I've talked to the lawyer.

229
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,164
Letting Jerry adopt Kai is
the quickest way to do this.

230
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,101
That sounds good.

231
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,770
If you can adopt Kai
and change his surname,

232
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,806
that counts as blood related family.

233
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,014
Then, why don't you consider
having another one?

234
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,582
Mom,

235
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,817
Why are you so stubborn?

236
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,120
Mom,

237
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,489
Jerry is not the only one
who can have kids,

238
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,491
also, Fang is pregnant.

239
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,227
I can have kids in the future, too.

240
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,094
You?

241
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,496
Yeah.

242
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,099
Maybe I might make a kid, too.

243
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,367
Dad's on your side.

244
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,473
The condition for adoption is
to get married.

245
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,943
So, Damian and I,

246
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,712
are going to get married.

247
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,982
Get married?

248
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,018
That's good.

249
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,952
Very good.

250
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,354
Yeah.

251
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,024
It's not just about the Ancestry Book,

252
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,494
I also want to give Jerry
a sense of belonging.

253
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,633
So, I hope Mr. Pan and Mrs. Pan

254
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,767
can give us your blessings.

255
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,474
Of course, I will!

256
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,876
Have you agreed on a date?

257
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,777
Mom,

258
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,381
will you come when we get married?

259
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,653
You guys continue.
I'm going to the shop.

260
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,622
Jerry is already an independent adult.

261
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,959
I hope Mrs. Pan
can respect his decision.

262
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,670
Dad,

263
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,072
What's the matter with Mom?

264
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,409
I've already been reasonable with her.

265
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,313
You just spat out two things in one go.

266
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,449
Do you think your mom
can take them both in?

267
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,585
Let us have some time to think about it.

268
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,004
There are three sets in total.

269
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,105
I will specially design for you both,

270
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,975
the costumes will be very
meaningful and also stylish,

271
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,011
This also
includes white bouquets and top hats.

272
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,513
The evolution
through the three sets of costumes

273
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,214
will lead the guests to experience

274
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,984
how you both met, knew,
and fell in love with each other.

275
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,386
This will be special and impressive.

276
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,522
I'm so thoughtful.

277
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,222
Please excuse my talents.

278
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,891
This is amazing.

279
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,126
Awesome, I know.

280
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,194
Yeah.

281
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,533
My God!

282
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,234
This is a set of SM costumes.

283
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,703
This will make the wedding
reach its climax.

284
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,971
I will sponsor this.

285
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,439
I want to see Jerry wear it.

286
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,041
But, Damian...

287
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,510
Uncomfortable.

288
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,078
Come on, please.

289
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,814
If I have to compete with my baby...

290
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,950
I am way hotter.

291
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,255
Alright,

292
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,723
knock it off, all of you.

293
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,659
There will be many elderly guests
at the wedding.

294
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,693
This is too much for them.

295
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,762
Let's see if your parents
are coming or not,

296
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,263
then we'll decide to have it or not.

297
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,132
Are your parents not coming?

298
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,802
We've told them about
the wedding already,

299
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,938
but, they haven't said anything yet
about coming or not.

300
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,907
How come?

301
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,109
Jerry,

302
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,344
weren't you mentioning before

303
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,113
about the garden you want to rent?

304
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,648
My baby sorted it out.

305
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,816
Really?

306
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:11,817
I had a case last year,

307
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,219
and the client was the owner
of that garden.

308
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,622
He's a mysterious, quiet man.

309
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,326
He's also a senior supporter
of gay rights.

310
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,527
And the point is,

311
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,762
he likes to watch
Jerry's Youtube channel.

312
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:24,964
So, a bright idea occurred to me,

313
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,665
I gave him a call
and talked to him about it,

314
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,701
now, the place's been sorted.

315
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,935
Thank you, Sasa.

316
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:30,469
Anytime.

317
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,372
Wait, there's something
that's just popped into my mind...

318
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,208
I remember that I had read
a comment on my channel,

319
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,611
"Support from a 70-year-old soul."

320
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,713
I also replied
and chatted to him at that time.

321
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,715
Perhaps, he was the owner?

322
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,117
Possibly.

323
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:45,985
In the past, most gay people

324
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,687
had to live lives
that were against their will.

325
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,756
It was not very easy, actually.

326
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:51,924
Yeah.

327
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,127
That's why we have to cherish more
about our happiness in the present.

328
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,264
When's the date of your wedding?

329
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:58,931
Tell me quickly.

330
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,466
I'll phone them up,
so we can set up the date.

331
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,601
You guess.

332
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,270
Why are you making that face?

333
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,839
Unless... it's on the date that you both

334
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,806
had sex for the first time?

335
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,976
That's good, Jerry.

336
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,177
That's so meaningful.

337
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,579
The day when you had sex
for the first time.

338
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,514
Not on that date, you're so annoying!

339
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,549
The date will be on Kai's birthday.

340
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:23,088
Because... that day was
when we all became a family.

341
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:24,590
Yes.

342
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,493
So, that day,
will also be Kai's birthday party?

343
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,495
This is so touching!

344
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,629
And meaningful, too.

345
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,565
I'm going back to the U.S. soon.

346
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,167
Both of you, promise me,

347
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,204
you will be happy together.

348
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,773
It's none of my business,

349
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,141
if you run away again next time.

350
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,375
There's nothing I can do about it then.

351
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,278
OK, I know.

352
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,247
And now, we have Jimmy
who watches me like a hawk.

353
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,014
I won't dare to act rashly.

354
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:49,848
That's right.

355
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,384
Our big gathering in the future

356
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,719
will lack you.

357
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,355
Yeah, I'll miss your food.

358
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,258
Yeah, I don't want you to go.

359
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,926
Excuse me,

360
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,828
What are you doing?

361
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,496
You're all happy couples,

362
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,632
I'm single here.
I should be the one crying.

363
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,434
How bizarre!
Why are you all pulling faces?

364
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,368
Look happy, OK?

365
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,669
OK.

366
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,670
So, can we go back to the subject?

367
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,105
Yes,

368
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:13,939
Be happy, OK?

369
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:14,974
OK.

370
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,241
Pulling faces.

371
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,677
Next costume.

372
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,014
Here. There's a side dish, too.

373
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,082
You can eat as much as you like.

374
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:23,749
Oh, this is too much.

375
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,452
- I won't be able to finish all this.
- Jerry's dad can cook some more if it's not enough.

376
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,587
OK. Thank you.

377
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,090
Oh, these are for you.

378
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,157
These are presents.

379
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,326
You're too polite.

380
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,728
Oh, you shouldn't have.
This is too much.

381
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,030
Thank you, Damian's sister.

382
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,264
I'm Celine.

383
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,166
I remember it ends with Lin.

384
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,835
Sorry, our English is not so good.

385
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,403
Celine. It's OK.

386
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,007
So, how come Damian's sister
has time to come here today?

387
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,676
Damian told me to come here.

388
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,277
He said Jerry's mom had asked

389
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,079
why his skin looks so perfect.

390
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,448
This is what he drinks everyday.

391
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,151
This is a collagen drink,

392
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,420
and it contains rich, natural vitamin C

393
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,955
in the ingredients.

394
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,457
If you drink this, it will be good
for your skin and also your health.

395
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,194
And because Jerry's dad
was sick a while ago,

396
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,896
Damian has been really worried about it.

397
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,499
But he's been very busy
sorting out the wedding

398
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,200
and that leaves not much time
for him to come here for a visit.

399
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,669
So he told me to bring
this stuff for you.

400
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,774
Say thank you to Damian for me.

401
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,841
He's so considerate.

402
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,213
When's the wedding?

403
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,782
On the 15th of December.

404
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,417
It's Kai's birthday.

405
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,924
After sorting out Damian's wedding,

406
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,794
I'll go back to the US.
To pursue my dreams,

407
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,729
and start a new life.

408
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,832
Damian is my closest family.

409
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,934
I can't imagine

410
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,437
my life without his support.

411
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,906
Without it, I would be very upset.

412
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,678
When he was younger,
he encountered gender identity issues.

413
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,015
After his failed marriage in the US,

414
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,418
he's become very careful.

415
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,220
He wasn't able to move things forward,

416
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,622
until he met Jerry.

417
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,358
This is the first time,
I can feel that he's sincere about it.

418
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,561
He wants Jerry to be truly happy.

419
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,531
He has never loved
someone so much before.

420
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:21,800
Let me show you,

421
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,502
This was before, when they had a fight.

422
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,204
He told me that
Jerry wouldn't talk to him.

423
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,305
He was worried.

424
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,541
So I gave him some of my opinions,

425
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,543
and he also told me

426
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,945
to give Jerry a call.

427
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,447
He loves Jerry very much.

428
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,751
Actually, my sticking point is...

429
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,788
I don't know how the relatives
will think about us through this.

430
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,624
Jerry's mom.

431
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,794
Jerry told me yesterday,

432
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,963
one thing he wanted most
for his wedding

433
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,965
was to have both of your blessings.

434
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,735
If you don't come,

435
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,304
he would feel regret
for the rest of his life.

436
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,845
We only have this one son.

437
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,415
It doesn't matter
what other people think about us.

438
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,184
It doesn't matter what he's like.

439
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,719
I love him no matter what.

440
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,788
What about the child?

441
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,458
Kai can change his surname.

442
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,766
So pretty!

443
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,934
Thank you, Bryan.

444
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,402
Bryan, you are a genius!

445
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,803
I know.

446
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,005
And,

447
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,473
look!

448
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,041
So cute!

449
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,075
Who does this belong to?

450
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,143
I want to wear it now.

451
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,745
Is this for Kai?

452
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,146
Come, Jimmy.

453
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,047
Kai,

454
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:42,881
try this. Let Papa help you
to put this on.

455
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:43,949
OK.

456
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,486
Can Matt also be a ring bearer with us?

457
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,054
Of course.

458
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,457
Jimmy can also join us.

459
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,159
We will have four ring bearers
and flower girls.

460
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,427
No way!

461
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,162
I don't count as one.

462
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,063
Excuse me,

463
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,998
I was too excited,

464
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,633
so, I've also prepared
clothes for your parents.

465
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,737
Have I overdone it?

466
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,314
Thank you.

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
([Breaking News] We're getting married!)

468
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,733
Kate, I think I should tell you

469
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,068
in the first place

470
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,736
that I'm getting married.

471
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,472
I appreciate all your support and kindness.

472
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:44,576
And luckily, Jimmy is fine with me and Jerry as well.

473
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,700
Today, is the day,

474
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,168
for Jerry Pan, my best friend
from university,

475
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,436
and also his most handsome husband's...

476
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,471
Damian's wedding of the century.

477
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,105
Have a look.

478
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,574
This is Damian's sister, Celine.

479
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,476
Take a look.

480
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,312
Twisting and swinging.

481
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:55,681
No one can beat me
in my live stream video.

482
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,215
OK, stop.

483
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:00,419
Today is also Kai's birthday party.

484
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm so looking forward to it.

485
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,488
You see that I wear all white today.

486
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,123
It represents purity and innocence.

487
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,367
I think my fans will barely see me
wearing these bland clothes.

488
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,394
I chose delicately, to wear this.

489
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,996
I'm already looking
forward to the guests coming.

490
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,264
I'll see what they look like soon.

491
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,333
However, I'll still be the prettiest.

492
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,434
Now, let's get the show started,

493
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,235
and see other on-site wedding scenes.

494
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,672
Look.

495
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,808
This photo album is so pretty.

496
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,476
Look at them! So happy!

497
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,046
Today, we're at a very
beautiful place, you see?

498
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,781
My God!

499
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,383
Is this the most famous private
chef Kao in Hualien?

500
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,085
And you have to reserve
at least half a year,

501
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,853
in order to eat his cuisine?

502
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,487
Hello.

503
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,322
Wow, he's very handsome.

504
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,557
Can you introduce us,

505
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,392
what have you prepared
for this new couple?

506
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,093
Introduction?

507
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:41,960
Yes, an introduction,

508
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,128
- OK.
- To our online audience.

509
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,396
OK. Wait a second.

510
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:46,732
I'll show you this.

511
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,934
This is...

512
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,736
Hello, everyone! I'm Kao.

513
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,071
This is... that
I specially designed Jerry

514
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,107
and Damian's bride cakes.

515
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,743
In the cake, I used the special
ingredient from Hualien,

516
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,345
and combined it
with an ingredient from the US,

517
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,480
in order to symbolize their

518
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,315
different cultural backgrounds.

519
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,751
And, it also symbolizes
the various tastes in a marriage.

520
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,321
You're so talented.

521
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,021
Thank you.

522
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,957
Now, I will ask you a question
on behalf of our fans.

523
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:12,524
Sure.

524
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,459
What's your type?

525
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:15,794
Your kind of type.

526
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,362
Kao!

527
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,363
Careful! My bride cake!

528
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,398
Kao!

529
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,465
Are you feeling
very nervous right now?

530
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,533
- Yes.
- Congratulations!

531
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,667
Congratulations, Damian.

532
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,468
- Hi.
- May you two always be in love.

533
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,603
- Welcome.
- Hello.

534
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,037
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

535
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,006
Congratulations, Damian.

536
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,442
Thank you. Have more drinks.

537
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,176
Sure.

538
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,611
- This is a must.
- Please have a seat, first.

539
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,945
Welcome.

540
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,785
Sasa,

541
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,286
Is he the owner of the property here?

542
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,988
Yes, that's him.

543
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,224
Our boss wants to give you this, Mr. Mo.

544
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,292
Thank you.

545
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:50,962
Thank you for living a happy life

546
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,131
that I had imagined a long time a ago.

547
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,633
Happiness is priceless.

548
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,935
From a 70-year-old soul.

549
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,937
Congratulations on your wedding.

550
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,215
Damian,

551
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,750
congratulations!

552
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,852
Thank you.

553
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:14,853
How's it going?

554
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,188
Finally, the day has come.

555
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,389
Are you nervous?

556
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,124
A little bit.

557
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,292
Relax.

558
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,827
Everything will go well.

559
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,630
Jerry's parents are not here.

560
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,251
Ms. Shih.

561
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:46,885
Hi.

562
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,552
Welcome.

563
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,587
Congratulations.

564
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,856
Jimmy's dad invited me to come.

565
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,024
I want to apologize to you.

566
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,393
I didn't want to make things difficult

567
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,662
for you all on purpose.

568
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,264
I just thought

569
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,966
that as a lesbian myself,
I want to do my best

570
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,100
in every field,

571
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,070
so people won't have a chance
to talk behind my back.

572
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,606
I can understand what you mean.

573
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,040
Thank you for your endeavour.

574
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,178
We can be seen as
"out of blows friendship grows".

575
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,047
So...

576
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,716
Let's shake hands
and make peace together.

577
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:20,719
Welcome!

578
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,187
Thank you.

579
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,723
Please come inside.

580
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,291
Your girlfriend is very pretty.

581
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,325
Welcome!

582
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,361
OK, you look awesome today.

583
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,163
Let's take another picture.

584
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:37,769
Careful!

585
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:38,803
Are you alright?

586
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,571
OK. OK.

587
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,572
Are you OK?

588
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,640
OK. OK.

589
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,908
Matt won.

590
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,075
Let's do it again.

591
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,110
The last spin.

592
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,578
Sasa.

593
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,445
Amy.

594
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,580
I'd go out and get some fresh air.

595
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:15,874
Jerry.

596
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,275
Kao.

597
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,710
You're here.

598
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,578
Of course.

599
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,379
I want to take a picture with you first.

600
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,487
Let's look ugly like in high school.

601
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:29,988
Look ugly.

602
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,089
OK?

603
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,892
One, two, three.

604
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,493
OK.

605
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,362
You still look cute.

606
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,363
Look.

607
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,465
Maybe, I should have accepted your love

608
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,033
at the beginning...

609
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,201
It's too late now.

610
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,336
Do you regret it?

611
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,503
Prince Charming.

612
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:50,809
Jerry,

613
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,344
promise me...

614
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,412
that you will be happy.

615
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,948
Thank you...

616
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,916
for everything.

617
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,220
Come here.

618
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:07,959
Congratulations.

619
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,698
Jerry,

620
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:14,432
Your parents haven't showed up.

621
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,234
Do you want to give them a call?

622
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:18,837
Wait a minute.

623
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,756
It's alright.

624
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,158
The ceremony will be starting soon.

625
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,459
Let's go.

626
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,066
Here they come.

627
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:48,600
Hi.

628
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,734
Alex, Fang.

629
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:50,735
Mr. Pan.

630
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:51,536
Let's go change.

631
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,303
Let's go.

632
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,039
Where's Mrs. Pan?

633
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,407
Hello to everybody,

634
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,075
and also to our friends who watch
our live streaming video.

635
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,977
I'm today's host, Mike.

636
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,679
I'm grateful that everyone
has come here today

637
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,014
to join Damian Mo
and Jerry Pan's wedding.

638
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,049
What a wonderful afternoon!

639
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:06,618
Should we give a passionate applaud
to ourselves first?

640
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,387
Now, the wedding has officially begun.

641
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,590
First, let's introduce our ring bearers

642
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,959
and flower girls walking
on the red carpet...

643
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,163
It's Matt, Charlotte,

644
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,332
and Damian's younger son, Kai.

645
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,734
Wave hello to everyone.

646
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:23,735
Hello.

647
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,302
Great!

648
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,838
Now, the next one who's going

649
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,873
to walk on the red carpet,

650
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,309
is our Jimmy, Damian's son.

651
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,716
So handsome!

652
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,821
- Daddy wants to join in as well?
- Jimmy, you're so cool.

653
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,025
Excellent!

654
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:47,992
- Fantastic!
- So handsome.

655
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,736
Awesome!

656
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,708
Let's give them a big round of applause.

657
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,776
Wonderful!

658
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,645
Now, we're going to the climax
of this wedding.

659
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,614
Our newlywed's Dad!

660
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,917
He's going to bring Jerry
to the red carpet.

661
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,456
Jerry.

662
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:27,999
Wait...

663
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,569
Is that Damian's sister, Celine...

664
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,571
bringing Jerry's mom?

665
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,608
Jerry's mom is here, too.

666
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,386
Thank you, Mrs. Pan.

667
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,739
Although I'm a bit late,

668
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,240
ut my blessings for you both

669
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,875
will never change.

670
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,077
Thank you, Mr. Pan.

671
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,413
It's time for a change.

672
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,148
Dad.

673
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,051
Mom.

674
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,461
Let's give them a round of applause!

675
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,731
OK. Let Jerry's mom and dad have a seat.

676
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:34,532
Thank you.

677
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,700
Thank you for coming, Mrs. Pan.

678
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,768
Thank you.

679
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,936
The next important thing is,

680
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,872
to hear the vows
from our newlyweds.

681
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,675
I feel a bit nervous.

682
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:45,543
You can do it, Damian!

683
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:46,878
Don't be nervous.

684
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:47,979
- You can do it!
- Go, go!

685
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,547
You can do it, Daddy.

686
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:51,950
Baby,

687
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,086
Since the first time I saw you,

688
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,490
I haven't been able
to take my eyes off you.

689
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,828
You're like an angel and saved me.

690
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,966
Your innocence, kindness,

691
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,536
passion, and brightness,

692
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,505
have touched my heart.

693
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,043
Everyday, I'm with you,

694
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,846
makes me feel at ease.

695
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:27,185
Thank you for all those years...

696
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,857
No matter what, when I was in trouble

697
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,027
or made you angry...

698
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,763
You...

699
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,367
you're still willing

700
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,803
to hold my hand, no matter what.

701
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:54,078
You're not just a beautiful interlude
in my life,

702
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:58,816
you're the reason I want
to work hard in the future.

703
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,453
Today,

704
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,722
I held your hands

705
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,692
from your parents.

706
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,928
I really feel,

707
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,164
your generous support and tolerance.

708
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,867
I promise,

709
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,404
I promise you, and your family,

710
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,175
that I will use all my life's effort,

711
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:28,746
to protect you, gently and firmly,

712
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,949
and to protect our family, our home.

713
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,086
You are the love of my life.

714
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,800
Darling,

715
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,904
This year, is the 7th year of us
being together.

716
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,142
They say, "The seven year itch."

717
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:04,482
And our relationship have been through

718
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,152
some unforeseeable rains and storms,
in this year,

719
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,623
Until now, I've realized,

720
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,525
those hurdles are there to help us,

721
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,860
to better understand ourselves,

722
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,696
and the process
of loving each other deeply.

723
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,799
For all these years,

724
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,638
I have you and Kai,

725
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,841
now, I've got Jimmy.

726
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,911
You make me feel more brave.

727
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,583
And I've been influenced by you,

728
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,952
that makes me want to
plan for the future.

729
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,755
But you often remind me,

730
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,790
to be more flexible.

731
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,695
I like you

732
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,032
that you always consider for me.

733
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,667
There's a benefit of getting older.

734
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,475
I want to hold your hands,

735
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,512
in the future blueprint that you've drawn,

736
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,515
to keep walking on this journey.

737
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:13,918
Although,

738
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,689
I've called you my husband for 7 years,

739
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,862
but at this moment,

740
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,403
it has gained a legal meaning.

741
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,404
Darling,

742
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,239
I love you.

743
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,597
It's time to exchange wedding rings.

744
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,886
It's so touching.

745
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,423
May the newlyweds be on the same boat,

746
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,891
and bathe in love forever.

747
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,626
This is so amazing!

748
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,294
It's not over yet.

749
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,029
Jimmy has something to say?

750
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,771
That I want to tell Daddy and Jerry.

751
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,773
I've been practicing for so long.

752
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,310
Listen, Daddy,

753
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,780
I will speak in Chinese.

754
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,153
I want to thank you, Daddy,

755
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,923
although we haven't spent a long time
with each other,

756
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,925
But...

757
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,028
I feel like I've known you for life.

758
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,466
Although I'm American,

759
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,135
I love being here,

760
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,238
in Taiwan.

761
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,077
It's because...

762
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,747
I got you in Taiwan.

763
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,083
You take care of me,

764
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,252
and respect me.

765
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,155
You spot my strengths,

766
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,157
and accept my flaws.

767
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,963
Then, I want to thank Jerry,

768
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,566
for accepting me,

769
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,269
and letting me be a part of this family.

770
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,939
When I get along with you,

771
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,474
it's like I have another older brother,

772
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,810
a dad,

773
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,914
and also a mom, too.

774
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,518
I want to say something to Kai.

775
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,554
You're very cute.

776
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,524
I hope you can grow up quickly,

777
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,360
so we can do
lots and lots of things together.

778
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,497
Thank you.

779
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,034
Your love is infectious,

780
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,740
So, now, I feel very loving, too.

781
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,377
I hope everybody can get married soon,

782
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,280
and pass more love to more people.

783
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,248
Thank you.

784
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,756
The son gives his deepest blessings
to his dad.

785
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,425
Except the wedding day today,

786
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,128
is also Kai's birthday!

787
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,967
Happy birthday!

788
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,802
Let's sing
the happy birthday song together.

789
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,271
OK?

790
00:37:53,271 --> 00:38:04,649
Happy birthday to you!

791
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:15,459
Happy birthday to you!
