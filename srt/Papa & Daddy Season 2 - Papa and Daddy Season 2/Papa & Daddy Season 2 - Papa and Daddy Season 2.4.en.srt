(Episode 4 Education Crisis)

2
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,670
I fell asleep.

3
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,920
Yes. You fell asleep.

4
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,810
- And you were snoring.
- Sorry.

5
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,810
It doesn't matter.

6
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,050
Jerry sent us some videos of Matt.

7
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,300
Open the video and have a look.

8
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,720
Wait.

9
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,380
Why this man

10
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,160
appeared in the videos every time?

11
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,480
He looks like Jerry's old friend.

12
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,980
Be careful.

13
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,840
The main point is that

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,810
he is attractive.

15
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,950
Baby, don't you remember

16
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,200
once we were playing Rummikub,

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,060
then what did Jerry say?

18
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,910
His high school crush was in Hualien.

19
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,470
Do you remember?

20
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,430
It seems to be the case.

21
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,830
Could it be him?

22
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,250
Let me tell Damian about this.

23
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,450
You don't need to tell him.

24
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,030
No! I'm going to tell him.

25
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,870
- You fell asleep again!
- Oh. Yes.

26
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,710
Look at the photo.

27
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,490
Photo.

28
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,010
Baby, I miss our son.

29
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,760
Let's pick him up this weekend, okay?

30
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,370
OK.

31
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,640
I want to kiss you.

32
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,280
One more kiss.

33
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,280
Are you awake now?

34
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,940
Are you awake now?

35
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,510
Are you sure?

36
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,240
Need me to wake you up?

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
"Papa & Daddy 2" "Episode 4"

38
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,670
Jimmy.

39
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,990
Your dad is here.

40
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,640
Do you want to explain

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,370
why you keep bothering Honey Liu?

42
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,750
What "Jiucan" means?

43
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,490
Ms. Shih.

44
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,550
I don't think you should

45
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,850
use such a strong word.

46
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,630
Jimmy is just more passionate.

47
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,920
Nothing else.

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,390
Passionate?

49
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,880
He followed her after class,

50
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,660
wrapped his arms around her neck,

51
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,690
and talked very closely to her.

52
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,900
You know someone told me.

53
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,820
He saw him kiss her.

54
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,730
Maybe they are just dating.

55
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,200
That is not allowed in my class.

56
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,250
He even called

57
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,170
the female classmate honey.

58
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,600
If she were your daughter,

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,740
you would be angry, wouldn't you?

60
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,400
Honey?

61
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,610
That's her English name.

62
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,270
I am very serious.

63
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,140
He even encouraged one male classmate

64
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,790
not to suppress his feelings;

65
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,370
instead, be brave and come out.

66
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,840
He can't get involved in such thing

67
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,170
Mr. Mo,

68
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,400
as I expected,

69
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,500
you being a gay dad

70
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,870
might have an influence on your child.

71
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,910
You should be more careful.

72
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,490
Hey, it's not fair.

73
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,700
Speak Chinese.

74
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,280
And this is not America.

75
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,120
You can't

76
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,480
take a leave and skip all classes.

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,010
Even in the US, it's nonsense of you

78
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,610
to take one week leave.

79
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,920
Mr. Mo,

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,250
you've got to understand

81
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,750
middle school is a crucial time

82
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,750
for Jimmy.

83
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,890
Hi, I am back!

84
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,390
Aunty.

85
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,990
Kai, long time no see.

86
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,610
My daughter is finally home.

87
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,320
Hi.

88
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,140
You are

89
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,080
Jerry's high school friend,

90
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,110
I remember.

91
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,780
My brother used to have a crush on you.
You're his Prince Charming.

92
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,660
He has a name.

93
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,240
OK. Shut up!

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,470
- Prince Charming.
- Shut up!

95
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,060
Shush!

96
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,760
Prince Charming.

97
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,050
Alex. Happy birthday!

98
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,490
Have a seat.

99
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,640
Thanks!

100
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,730
Looks yummy!

101
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,600
You look horrible!

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,570
- Did you put on sunscreen cream?
- Mom.

103
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,740
It's fine.

104
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,060
I got sunburnt easily.

105
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,010
It'll be fine after days.

106
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,010
You'll get skin cancer.

107
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,590
Who in the world
curses her own daughter?

108
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,460
Glad you know you are a girl.

109
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,550
I just came home.

110
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,800
Put on the aloe gel,

111
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,410
and it'll be fine.

112
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,720
- Yes. Aloe gel is okay.
- Come and have some food.

113
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,520
Kao, come over here!

114
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,270
Have a seat.

115
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,390
Sit down.

116
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,220
Mrs. Pan, have a seat.

117
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,580
Who made these dishes?

118
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,990
All of these dishes

119
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,660
were made by Kao.

120
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,230
Kao is such an amazing cook.

121
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,690
Have a try.

122
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,340
Not really.
Mr. Pan also helped me.

123
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,880
Let's dig in!

124
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,750
Let's eat!

125
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,710
So yummy!

126
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,280
- Awesome!
- Do you eat bitter gourd?

127
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,540
Mrs. Pan, try this out.

128
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,670
Kao is like a pro chef.

129
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,590
Matt, try this.

130
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,730
Alex.

131
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,960
You said you were going to
scuba-diving in the Great Barrier Reef?

132
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,310
I went to Xiao Liuqiu.

133
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,620
Xiao Liuqiu.

134
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,600
Dad.

135
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,270
Everyone's full?

136
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,110
Yes.

137
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,910
Okay.

138
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,450
Next, Kai, who Alex likes the most,

139
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,240
and Kai's friend, Matt

140
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,510
will put on a show.

141
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,130
Let's give them a round of applause and

142
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,980
welcome these two kids.

143
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,060
So cute.

144
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,460
Amazing!

145
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,300
Let's do this.

146
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,630
Where's this dancing style from?

147
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,990
From Xiao Liuqiu?

148
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:03,970
One leg.

149
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,140
Do a single-leg hop.

150
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,130
Do it again.

151
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,010
Again.

152
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,940
I am the grandpa of our future star.

153
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:26,770
Happy birthday to you!

154
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,000
Thanks, guys!

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,530
Happy birthday! Come over here.

156
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,410
Kao made this cake.

157
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,030
I present to you

158
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,270
the vanilla pudding mousse cake.

159
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,110
So talented.

160
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,480
OK. Make a wish.

161
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,920
OK.

162
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,010
First wish is,

163
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,720
I wish my lovely family

164
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,420
will be all healthy and sound.

165
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,420
Ok.

166
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,090
Second wish is,

167
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,280
I wish everyone

168
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,810
can freely love someone.

169
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,430
Because real love is abstract

170
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,390
with no definition.

171
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,420
Exactly!

172
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,260
Great!

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,190
As for the third wish,

174
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,470
I want to give it to
the next birthday person

175
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,410
Whose birthday is the next?

176
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,375
Who was born in April?

177
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,550
I was born in April 20th.

178
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,610
It's you.

179
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,840
Come over here.

180
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,750
April 20th.

181
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,590
Matt was born in April.

182
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,200
Matt.

183
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,500
Matt, what's your wish?

184
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,140
I wish Moms will could get a girl.

185
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,040
They will have a real daughter.

186
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,400
It is an awesome wish.

187
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,880
It'll come true for sure.

188
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,070
Let's blow out the candles.

189
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,690
Let's do it!

190
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,120
All together.

191
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,410
One, two, three.

192
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,770
Good job!

193
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,260
Thanks!

194
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,560
Matt, I have a question for you!

195
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,000
Why did you make that wish?

196
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:42,395
Moms said they wanted a girl.

197
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,300
Who did they tell?

198
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,820
You.

199
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,370
Ok. After you finished the cake.

200
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,460
For those whom want to

201
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,590
go to the beach. Raise your hands!

202
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,360
Me.

203
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:54,325
Let's go!

204
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,670
Matt wants to go and so does Kai.

205
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,550
Let's go to the beach together.

206
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,600
I am just being honest.

207
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,670
Just keep distance from girls.

208
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,360
I did.

209
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,850
She likes me.

210
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,460
She wanted to kiss me.

211
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,680
Why didn’t you just tell your teacher about this?

212
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
I did.

213
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,120
She didn't believe me.

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,570
I don't know who I am now.

215
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,540
Can I skip the school?

216
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,430
No.

217
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,560
I will talk to your teacher.

218
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,770
Not happy with this?

219
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,220
Bathroom.

220
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,480
Stop pushing him!

221
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,660
Sounds like teacher's problem.

222
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
Or Jimmy can transfer to another school.

223
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,530
No.

224
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,585
I've got to rely on connections
so he could be accepted by the school

225
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,680
His Chinese is not good.

226
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,650
There were only a few options.

227
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,390
Enroll in American school?

228
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,390
Teach him Chinese yourself.

229
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,450
I've thought about that.

230
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,310
I wish he will adapt
Taiwanese culture quicker.

231
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,650
Daddy, am I pretty?

232
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,700
Kai.

233
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,650
Pretty.

234
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,280
Hello, Kai.

235
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,330
- Aunty
- I miss you!

236
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,780
Hi, Damian.

237
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
Alex.

238
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,200
Happy Birthday!

239
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,760
Will give you the gift later.

240
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,340
Thanks! Damian.

241
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,180
Kai. Where's Papa?

242
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,150
Papa is busy.

243
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,470
When will you come here?

244
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,210
I....

245
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,240
I will pick you up this weekend.

246
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,190
OK. I am going to play.

247
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,190
OK. Bye.

248
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,930
Being separate for too long is not good.

249
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,870
That's his friend in Hualien.

250
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,550
It's nothing.

251
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,500
Right?

252
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,620
Stop pretending!

253
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,440
I haven't seen

254
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
Jerry smiling like that for a long time

255
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,060
That guy.

256
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,680
They seem to be good friends since before.

257
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,290
Take a trip to Hualien then.

258
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,290
Go and bring Jerry and Kai back!

259
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,890
It's okay!

260
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,840
I believe in Jerry.

261
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,140
After all,

262
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,770
Jimmy can't keep following me along and

263
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,170
running around like this.

264
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,660
Leave Jimmy to me.

265
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,990
Let’s go with that decision then.

266
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,270
I'll tell Jimmy about this.

267
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,950
He must be so happy.

268
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,450
Jimmy.

269
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,940
We arrived.

270
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,450
Jerry.

271
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,340
We arrived.

272
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,020
I fell asleep.

273
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,590
Hope I didn't bother you.

274
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,870
Kai and Matt,

275
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,070
wake up!

276
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,050
We hold each one of them.

277
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,490
Don't wake them up.

278
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,130
You went to take a family picture.

279
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,260
And smile like that!

280
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,730
Are you tired?

281
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,530
Would you like to
grab a drink and chat?

282
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,190
What are you doing?

283
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,580
Split up!

284
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,887
It is just shadows.

285
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,830
Pick up the phone!

286
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,700
Damn.

287
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,750
What's your current status

288
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,540
with Jerry?

289
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,910
You think of me so highly.

290
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,910
I'm flattered.

291
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,910
I trust Jerry,

292
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,230
and I also know how close you were.

293
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,470
If Jerry has a feeling...

294
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,240
The Jerry I knew is

295
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,180
a person who's serious toward love.

296
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,830
He doesn't change his heart easily.

297
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,630
So you can be rest assured.

298
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,710
He’s never betrayed your trust.

299
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,910
What about you?

300
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,910
Can I trust you?

301
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,630
What do you think?

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,660
I admit that

303
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,050
I did have a feeling for Jerry.

304
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,050
That’s because I like him

305
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,900
I also want to tell you

306
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
when I was with him,

307
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,840
he couln't stop talking about you and Kai.

308
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,780
Do you know that?

309
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,820
As Kai was little,

310
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,320
he didn't dare to play on the slide.

311
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,960
Damian is a patient person.

312
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,069
He played on the slide with Kai
again and again.

313
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,020
This one would suit Damian.

314
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,700
Would you like to
grab a drink and chat?

315
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,590
Forget about it today.

316
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,160
It's been a busy day.

317
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,250
So tired.

318
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,810
I...

319
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,750
Jerry.

320
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,840
In fact,

321
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,420
I have something to tell you

322
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,210
I think this time we met again

323
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,680
I have different feelings toward you

324
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,200
Really?

325
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,050
Isn't it the same?

326
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,790
I feel I would cherish

327
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,990
our times more.

328
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,500
Do you know?

329
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,640
As I wake up every morning,

330
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,740
I look forward to you calling me.

331
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,210
I once thought…

332
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,470
Kao.

333
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,790
Thank you.

334
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,430
But I don't wish
Damian misunderstands.

335
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,400
He loves you so much.

336
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,690
You are so lucky.

337
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,960
Thank you

338
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,560
for your help this whole time.

339
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,610
Actually, I am happy

340
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,720
to know he has a stable

341
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,840
relationship and a family.

342
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,410
But,

343
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,280
I hope you cherish him.

344
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,790
Otherwise, who knows

345
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,730
what the future holds.

346
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,640
Gotta go.

347
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,370
Without the permission of Jimmy's parents.

348
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,540
It's impossible to
take such long leave.

349
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,980
Education means to teach students
in accordance with their aptitude.

350
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,820
Jimmy has a unique cultural background.

351
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,400
Just because you
are not flexible,

352
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
it caused him trauma.

353
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,600
He has to take a rest.

354
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,650
Jimmy's aunt.

355
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,950
I've been a teacher for 15 years and

356
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,250
I've seen all kinds of students.

357
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,040
You know that

358
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,380
you're spoiling the kids?

359
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,280
We take him as an
independent person

360
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,500
with his own freedom and willpower.

361
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,880
Ms. Shih, you might not have a clear

362
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,020
understanding toward education.

363
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,020
I'll call Mr. Mo.

364
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,590
No need! I've told him.

365
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,740
You took a long leave
without parents

366
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,950
coming over in person
for this procedure.

367
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,330
I won't allow him to go.

368
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,420
If anything happens,
I’ll be the one who’s responsible.

369
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,670
You!

370
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,880
Hello.

371
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,150
Is it Jimmy's mom?

372
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,130
Daddy.

373
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,420
Kai.

374
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,210
Good morning.

375
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,780
- Did you sleep well?
- When did you come?

376
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,360
I arrived here last night.

377
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,970
So you guys had a long sleep.

378
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,730
I didn't bother you guys, right?

379
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,690
Come and have a breakfast.

380
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,340
Come and sit down.

381
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,690
Have a seat.

382
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,560
Come over here.

383
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,010
Yummy?

384
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,790
When I came back yesterday,

385
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,280
I bumped into your
high school classmate at the door

386
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,000
Kao.

387
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,380
What you guys talked about?

388
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,130
What do you think?

389
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,560
Kao has a pro cooking skill.

390
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,640
So you want to hire him for Equal.

391
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,370
Impossible.

392
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,850
How can I create such opportunity?

393
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,530
Let you meet with your high school crush

394
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,160
He's not my crush.

395
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Stop talking nonsense!

396
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,970
He said you love me.

397
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,970
Really?

398
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,560
I also thank him.

399
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,860
He has been taking care of you.

400
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,860
But it's my responsibility.

401
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,500
So.

402
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,990
Go back to Taipei with me

403
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,760
I really miss you

404
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,270
and Kai.

405
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,030
Moreover, we can't deprive Kai of his school life

406
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,030
just because of us.

407
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,510
Papa, I want to play
with Jakob at school.

408
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,880
What the hell are you doing?

409
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,370
Why did Celine take Jimmy away

410
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,790
and said they won't come
back to school?

411
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,500
Did you take a good care of him?

412
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,210
Calm down.

413
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,870
Celine wants Jimmy to have a break.

414
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,940
He is stressful.

415
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,910
What's that supposed to mean?

416
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,840
He has to go to school and

417
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,100
adapt the current lifestyle.

418
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,550
It seems like that teacher
has a prejudice against him.

419
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,080
It's not that simple.

420
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,150
So you have to take him away.

421
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,390
You should solve the problem,

422
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,800
not avoid it.

423
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,610
I'm not avoiding the problem.

424
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,520
Jimmy lives with me now.

425
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,930
I'll take care of it.
Please rest assured.

426
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,880
OK?

427
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,050
Fine.

428
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,320
Hey. Dad.

429
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,070
What's up?

430
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,560
Aunty is taking a shower.

431
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,730
Later, she's going out.

432
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,130
She is to leave you alone at home?

433
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,590
No worries.

434
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,590
Hey, bro!

435
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,380
Kai.

436
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,330
I miss you so much.

437
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,910
I miss you, too.

438
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,910
Come back quickly.

439
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,020
OK.

440
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,690
Check it out!

441
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,510
It's a car.

442
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,640
You'll like it.

443
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,530
I drew you. Have a look!

444
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,490
Cool!

445
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,120
Alright.

446
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,160
When aunty is free,

447
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,190
tell her to call me.

448
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,190
Okay, bye.

449
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,790
Darling.

450
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,060
Let's go back to Taipei tomorrow.

451
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,530
You mean it?

452
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,690
Really?

453
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,960
Awesome! Baby.

454
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,280
Thanks.

455
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,360
Tonight,

456
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,270
let's have a barbecue party.

457
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,550
Kai, we are heading back to Taipei.

458
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,200
To Taipei.

459
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,330
OK?

460
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,670
Let's see what else.

461
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,070
Kai, do you want this?

462
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,570
Lemon candy.

463
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,950
Uncle, I miss my moms.

464
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,190
You miss them, don't you?

465
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,520
I'll take you to ice cream, okay?

466
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,620
Matt, I want to ask you something.

467
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,620
You didn't get the flavor

468
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,340
your wished for.

469
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,640
Would it upset you?

470
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,890
No. I love this one the best.

471
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,950
Under most circumstances,
you might have imagination

472
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,510
about some things you don't have.

473
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,310
But once you got it,

474
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,310
you'll realize that is
the most wonderful thing in the world.

475
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,260
Like Mom and Mommy,

476
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,440
they might once want to have a girl.

477
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,560
But after they had you,

478
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,430
they thought you are the best thing in the world.

479
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,520
So don't worry about
what you have heard.

480
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,100
Just believe that you are the best.

481
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,940
Mom and Mommy

482
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,120
would think the same.

483
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,430
Do you know that?

484
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,830
Uncle, I want to call Moms.

485
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,590
Ok.

486
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,570
Let's call them

487
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,880
after you finished the ice cream.

488
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,080
Matt, look at it.

489
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,240
Sorry.

490
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,670
That was rude.

491
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,370
Come here.

492
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,510
It's your turn to serve first.

493
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,510
Keep it higher.

494
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,780
I'll get the ball.

495
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,510
Put it there.

496
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,720
OK.

497
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,350
Damian.

498
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,590
Put it down.

499
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,200
Come over here and have a seat.

500
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,500
Come and have a seat.

501
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,170
Take a break.

502
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:54,740
What's up?

503
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,440
Come.

504
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,510
You see, Matt has been
having a good time

505
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,750
with Kai.

506
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,050
So it's better for children

507
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,990
to have siblings

508
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,000
Yes.

509
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,650
Like you have a sister.

510
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,210
You both started a
business together.

511
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,280
Such a lovely thing.

512
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,410
Although Jerry tends to have quarrels with

513
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,840
his two sisters,

514
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,370
they are quite close to one another.

515
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,500
Yes.

516
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,470
Jerry has told me that

517
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,890
you wish us to have another kid.

518
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,470
Oh, you knew already.

519
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,520
Kai was made by your sperm.

520
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,000
So he doesn't count as our legacy.

521
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,070
Right?

522
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,700
This time you can use Jerry's sperm.

523
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,510
Is it because of the heritage?

524
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,270
No, you misunderstood us.

525
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,650
It wasn't about the heritage.

526
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,850
It's about blood.

527
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,150
Mr. and Mrs. Pan.

528
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,960
Compared to blood,

529
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,800
Jerry and I think that

530
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,590
looking after and accompanying with
Kai are more important.

531
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,870
This is the definition
of a family, isn't it?

532
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,840
Darling, why it takes you
so long to grab a chair?

533
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,170
What are you chatting about?

534
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:13,880
Hmm...

535
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,840
Yes.

536
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,100
Nothing really.

537
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,930
Damian looked tired.

538
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,930
So we told him to rest a bit.

539
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,670
Just have a chat.

540
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,200
Right? Nothing happened.

541
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,230
You can leave now.

542
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,000
Okay.

543
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,840
Thanks.

544
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,780
Go ahead.

545
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,290
Jerry, help with the chairs.

546
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,220
No need.

547
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,710
I can handle it.

548
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,830
We're going to put
the barbecue sauce.

549
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,940
- Looks so tasty!
- Yummy!

550
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,130
So tasty!

551
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,430
- Damian did well on barbecue.
- Is it?

552
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,860
Damian is good at barbecuing.

553
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,390
Thanks! bro.

554
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,050
Come and have a try!

555
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,190
Did he come from the US?

556
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,630
Who's coming?

557
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,800
No idea.

558
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,170
I invited Kao.

559
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,730
He said after he's
done with the restaurant.

560
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,040
Barbecue meat is ready!

561
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,980
Roasted chicken is ready!

562
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,560
Put barbecue meat in the middle.

563
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,250
Be careful! So hot!

564
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,270
So hot!

565
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,020
Awesome!

566
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,720
Amazing!

567
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,180
Here it is.

568
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,390
Yummy!

569
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,290
- Here it is.
- Been long time since I had grilled chicken

570
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,340
You are amazing!

571
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,100
Kai, do you want some?

572
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,230
My pants.

573
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,650
Sorry.

574
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,700
Eat more, this is tasty!

575
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,910
Yes.

576
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,960
Thanks! Everyone.

577
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,350
During the time while I was not here,

578
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,690
you helped take care of Jerry and Kai.

579
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,080
Because of me,

580
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,530
Jerry has carried so much burden.

581
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,630
I feel rest assured

582
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,030
because you accompany with them.

583
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,320
So you guys are

584
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,840
our most important family.

585
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,540
Thank you guys!

586
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,540
Cheers!

587
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,070
Thanks!

588
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,390
Cheers!

589
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,160
Cheers!

590
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,210
Damian,

591
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,790
You spoke so well.

592
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,097
Can you sponsor me to go diving

593
00:27:55,122 --> 00:27:56,370
in the Great Barrier Reef?

594
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,770
None of your business!

595
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,755
Of course! it's my business.

596
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,740
I won't make a scene
if I don't stay in Hualien.

597
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,000
No need to be thankful?

598
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,360
It's okay.

599
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,390
Take it as your birthday gift.

600
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,590
Really?

601
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,530
How generous of you!

602
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,370
- No need, it's fine!
- Awesome! Thanks! Damian

603
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,750
Give me a hug!

604
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,270
Thank you! Scuba-diving!

605
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,020
Dad and Mom, come over.

606
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,710
Let's have a big

607
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,320
hug together.

608
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,390
Kai.

609
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,270
Matt, come over here.

610
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,680
Awesome.

611
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,910
One big family.

612
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,130
Full of happiness.

613
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,010
- Come with us together.
- I also want to go.

614
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,080
OK.

615
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,760
Let's go there together!

616
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,280
So happy!

617
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,420
- We are going to have a vacation
- in the Great Barrier Reef.

618
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,820
Can Mommy also scuba diving?

619
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,720
Yes. I have a scuba
diving license.

620
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,590
Awesome!

621
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,320
Yes.

622
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,080
Great Barrier Reef.

623
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,590
Let's go!

624
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,900
Great Barrier Reef.

625
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,030
- Come and take a picture.
- Come, little kid.

626
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,270
You guys stand in the front.

627
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,160
Let's take a picture!

628
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,430
Come over here.

629
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,740
Are you ready?

630
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,940
Look at here.

631
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,710
Look over there.

632
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,030
One, two, three.

633
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,260
Change a pose.

634
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,770
One, two, three.

635
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,370
Mom. Mommy!

636
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,500
Aren't you coming to
pick him up tomorrow?

637
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,200
How can we miss this?

638
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,930
Yes.

639
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,170
All together.

640
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,690
Ok.

641
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,290
Let's take a picture

642
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,580
all together.

643
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,090
- So many people.
- One, two, three.

644
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,780
Yes.

645
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,390
You miss me?

646
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,180
Come and eat barbecue.

647
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,010
Keep on eating.

648
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,310
Sit.

649
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,020
OK.

650
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,200
Let's eat!

651
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
OK.

652
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,140
There's a cake at the gate.

653
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,750
There is a card.

654
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,410
Let me see.

655
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,260
Come over here.

656
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,560
What?

657
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,180
May Jerry and
Damian be full of happiness.

658
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,690
Kai and Matt be happy always!

659
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,000
The video you sent to us,

660
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,500
there's always a suspicious guy.

661
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,980
Yes. You aren't afraid that
Damian found out about this?

662
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,160
Didn't you see him save
the situation in person?

663
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,320
Nothing.

664
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,150
What happened?

665
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,050
Come over here.

666
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,130
Do you miss me?

667
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,750
Miss us?

668
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,200
Yes.

669
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,010
Come.

670
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,360
Kao made this cake.

671
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,940
Kao.

672
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,990
Kao's cake.

673
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,650
When did Kao
send the cake to here?

674
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,160
He just sent it here.

675
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,750
Mr. Pan,
this is for you.

676
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,710
Thanks!

677
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,210
Mrs. Pan.

678
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,160
Blueberry.

679
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,570
Okay.

680
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,410
Matt

681
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,380
Do you think

682
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,600
we want a girl?

683
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,420
Since we had you,

684
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,860
we think a girl or
boy isn't important anymore

685
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,780
You're better than a girl.

686
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,180
Yes. You made us so happy.

687
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,750
So I want to tell you,

688
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,310
You don't have to
wear girly clothing

689
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,300
OK?

690
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,810
But girly clothing is so pretty.

691
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,960
Boys also have pretty clothing.

692
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,010
I got an idea.

693
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,110
Maybe next time, you,

694
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,840
and us.

695
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,110
Three of us

696
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,020
will wear boy clothing.

697
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,660
It's fun, right?

698
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,860
Make a promise with me.

699
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,810
Come and let me kiss you!

700
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,730
Let me kiss you!

701
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,790
Kisses

702
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,390
on two cheeks.

703
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,090
Bon voyage.

704
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:40,920
Bye. Mr. Pan.

705
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,810
Have a good trip!

706
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,300
Bye.

707
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,310
OK! Bye.

708
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,910
OK.

709
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,320
Matt. Bye.

710
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,870
Ok. Bye.

711
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,070
Matt, remember to miss me.

712
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,020
Okay. You get
in the car first.

713
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,990
Thanks!

714
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,530
No sweat!

715
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,830
I can't remember

716
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,550
we talked about it
in front of Matt.

717
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,930
About having a girl.

718
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,220
I forgot.

719
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,830
Yes. We did talk about it.

720
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,330
You did show me a picture of you

721
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,350
wearing the skirt
when you were little.

722
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,050
We laughed so much.

723
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,470
And then Amy and Sasa said

724
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,510
if they got a girl,

725
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,410
how they were to dress her.

726
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,510
You guys forgot?

727
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,200
He's a considerate kid.

728
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,840
Don't talk nonsense
in front of him.

729
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,700
Alright, let's not focus on us.

730
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,870
You guys must talk to Jerry's parents

731
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,870
about having a second child.

732
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,010
Be peaceful.

733
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,870
OK.

734
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,270
D J A S.

735
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,250
Safe trip.

736
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,220
Bye.

737
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,350
When you get to Taipei,
remember to text or call us.

738
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,370
OK. I will call you.

739
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,020
Drive safely.

740
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,690
Bye.

741
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,300
- Bye, Matt.
- Bye.

742
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,420
- Close the door.
- Bye.

743
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,190
Bye. Matt

744
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,630
Bye.

745
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,780
Take care!

746
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,980
Bye.

747
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,100
Let's go!

748
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,780
What are you doing?

749
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,120
We don't get each other.

750
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,500
Darling.

751
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,300
Take Kai to car

752
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,410
as mom and dad aren't home.

753
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,240
I'll tell them after
they came back.

754
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,340
Otherwise,
they will nag us about kids again

755
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,260
That's okay!

756
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,110
I think

757
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,150
we should greet them goodbye.

758
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,620
You sure?

759
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,950
We already bought it back.

760
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,620
- Mom.
- Mrs. Pan.

761
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,970
Why did you buy so much?

762
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,840
It's not for you though.

763
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,340
Damian likes to eat it.

764
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,040
And Damian owns a restaurant.

765
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,140
There are many workers
and they can share.

766
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,050
Thanks! Mrs. Pan.

767
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,540
Thanks! Mother.

768
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,050
Remember to take
Kai back next time!

769
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,360
Otherwise, we’ll miss him so much

770
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,290
Yes. Definitely.

771
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,330
By the way!

772
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,260
Put important things in mind.

773
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,870
Okay?

774
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,170
Come here, Kai.

775
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,060
You are a good boy.

776
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,150
Remember to eat well at home.

777
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:19,800
OK.

778
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,030
Good boy.

779
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,380
Come and let me hug you.

780
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,410
I will miss you.

781
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,050
Make sure you'll miss me.

782
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:25,650
OK.

783
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,270
Behave well.

784
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,520
Ok. We're leaving now.

785
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,230
Have a good trip!

786
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,190
OK.

787
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,450
Kai, we are going
back to Taipei.

788
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,340
Are you happy?

789
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,550
Happy.

790
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,160
Let's sing a song!

791
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,170
Let's sing!

792
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:48,550
Twinkle twinkle little star

793
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,670
How I wonder what you are

794
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,980
Twinkle twinkle little star

795
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,110
How I wonder what you are

796
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,530
(Jerry.)

797
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,600
(It was such a
wonderful times in Hualien.)

798
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,400
(Damian loves you so much.)

799
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,640
(May you guys well and sound.)

800
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,520
Do you know how
to sing Tricycle?

801
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,390
Tricycles drive so fast

802
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,010
There's an old grandma sitting on there

803
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,430
Driver wants five cent
but she gives one dollar

804
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,260
You say, is it strange or not

805
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,560
Daddy is weird?

806
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,350
Weird.
