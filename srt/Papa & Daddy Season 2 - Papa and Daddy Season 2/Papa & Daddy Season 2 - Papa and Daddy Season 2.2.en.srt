00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,900
(Episode 2 Ex Is Never Passed)

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:09,709
Jerry!

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:10,977
She looks so pretty!

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,245
Is she your friend?

5
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:14,114
Sho looks fashionable!

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,084
This is actually Damian's friend...

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,619
Yeah, Mrs. Pan.

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,054
She's my friend in the US.

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,255
She is visiting Hualien
for the first time.

10
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,323
Hello.

11
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,257
Welcome!

12
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,091
Please come in.

13
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,159
Have a seat.

14
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,894
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

15
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,162
Come in.

16
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,132
Have a seat.

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,467
Go tend your guest.

18
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,436
I'll get you
the most popular snack in Hualien.

19
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,137
Please sit.

20
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,138
Thank you.

21
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,073
Mom.

22
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:40,774
You gotta pay me

23
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,675
to keep the secret!

24
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,244
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

25
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,251
Here is the famous Hualien snack.

26
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,353
Try our famous Hualien snack.

27
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,888
That's kind of you. Thank you.

28
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,492
Try this. The best snack in Hualien.

29
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,727
This is the best.

30
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:02,562
Thank you.

31
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,763
Good boy!

32
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,632
Kai is so well-mannered.

33
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,067
He is very mature.

34
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,168
Mom...

35
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,602
Don't you need to go
to your restaurant?

36
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,105
Yeah, I need to go to work.

37
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,840
Remember to bring
the guest to our restaurant.

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,474
That's alright.

39
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,242
I'll make you the biggest dumplings.

40
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,510
Ok, no problem.

41
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,311
Ok, bye-bye.

42
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,546
Thank you, Mrs. Pan.

43
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,948
Jimmy, we need to talk.

44
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,585
Let Dad and his friend

45
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,120
catch up first.

46
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:29,989
Friend?

47
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,827
Yes, friend.

48
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,331
Bro, play with me.

49
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,232
OK.

50
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:40,867
Bro?

51
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,603
Bro?

52
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,474
I think we need to talk too.

53
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,714
Damian,

54
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,416
I want to go for a walk with Kai.

55
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,817
Do you want to stay here

56
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,018
or go out with us?

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
(Papa & Daddy 2)

58
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,200
OK, good.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,635
I think there isn't enough sand.

60
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,303
Can you help Papa get more sand?

61
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,305
Here, use the spade.

62
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,082
Hey bro, be careful!

63
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,920
Kai, be careful.

64
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,655
I'm okay.

65
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,292
Be careful.

66
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,693
OK.

67
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,094
It's fine, I'll protect you.

68
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,600
Just play here, OK?

69
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,440
I really want to talk to you.

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,009
Jimmy said you guys were here.

71
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,978
I think he's getting on well with you.

72
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,817
OK.

73
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,352
Let's talk.

74
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,087
I should apologize to you first,

75
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,488
the fact that
Jimmy showed up without notice

76
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,690
must have scared you.

77
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,793
This is not your fault.

78
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,127
You don't need to apologize.

79
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,898
Jimmy...

80
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,033
his dad wasn't around
when he was little,

81
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,802
nor does he have any siblings.

82
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,437
That's why he depends on me a lot.

83
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,439
Since I've had a boyfriend...

84
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,341
I probably haven't paid much
attention to him like before.

85
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,076
He thinks I don't love him anymore.

86
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,716
Plus he doesn't get along
with my boyfriend.

87
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,184
They argue all the time.

88
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,586
That's why this time,

89
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,456
he wants to look for Damian
all of a sudden.

90
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,024
I'm really sorry.

91
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,998
The whole time when I'm with Damian,

92
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,101
He never told me about this.

93
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,637
So it was hard to
understand him at first.

94
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,106
After all, for me, Jimmy

95
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,107
was like a stranger who

96
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,642
bursts into our household.

97
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,077
Speaking of this...

98
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,015
I haven't talked to Jimmy that

99
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,851
his dad left him was because...

100
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,220
his dad is gay.

101
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,222
I'm afraid he won't accept the fact,

102
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:50,757
so I told him

103
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,025
that you two were roommates

104
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,693
and Kai is your child.

105
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,162
Please help me keep a secret.

106
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,034
He can't accept that...

107
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,205
Will Jimmy not accept us?

108
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,441
Don't just assume he's very open...

109
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,943
He's actually quite conservative.

110
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,650
Dad,

111
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,285
are you top or bottom?

112
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,457
Sorry,

113
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,125
you don't have to tell me.

114
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,594
I know this is too much

115
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,296
for a son you haven't met in ages.

116
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,033
Conservative.

117
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,107
OK. No problem.

118
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,542
I'll keep the secret for you.

119
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,576
Thank you.

120
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:46,846
I thought...

121
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,749
it's good for him to
stay with his dad here.

122
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,751
But now...

123
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,586
I decide to take him back to the US.

124
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,021
I won't bother you guys anymore.

125
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,393
Actually, I've thought about
what would it be like when we meet up.

126
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,230
I didn't expect it to be like this.

127
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,166
I didn't particularly expect
to meet you guys.

128
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,974
But Kai is a lovely boy.

129
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,242
Congratulations.

130
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,645
Thanks.

131
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,350
It's nice to walk around the beach.

132
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,852
I'm going to paddle
in the water for a bit.

133
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,055
Hi!

134
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,492
What are you guys up to?

135
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,096
It's hurt.

136
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,632
So hard.

137
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,176
Over here!

138
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,545
Big car!

139
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,747
Why did you rent a car?

140
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,683
My car is at the garage.

141
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,285
I decided to rent a bigger car

142
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,320
so everyone can sit comfortably.

143
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,590
Let's all get in.

144
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,972
Kai, you get in first.

145
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,311
OK, Kai is ready.

146
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:31,250
Dad...

147
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,385
Kai,

148
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,186
Look at you,

149
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:33,953
sand is all over your mouth.

150
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,755
Papa helps you to clean up.

151
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,964
All done.

152
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,099
Let's go!

153
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,381
Mommy.

154
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,755
Dumpling?

155
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,723
Really?

156
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,057
No kidding!

157
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,826
They are handmade!

158
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,095
It's real deal.

159
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,163
OK, I'll try.

160
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,103
Baby, are you OK?

161
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,540
What did Kate tell you about?

162
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,344
She just explained
why Jimmy came to see you.

163
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,815
We've already talked to Jimmy
about going back to the US,

164
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,485
so we will keep him in our company
for the next couple of days.

165
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:20,059
I feel that Jimmy
had such a good time here...

166
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,363
I don't think he's willing to go back.

167
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,901
I promised him,

168
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,236
I will go and visit him in the US.

169
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,470
No worries.

170
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:38,978
Daddy,

171
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,681
can I call Jimmy bro?

172
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,282
- Sure.
- No.

173
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,786
Kai...

174
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,487
you can call Jimmy bro,

175
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,757
but today, you can only call me uncle.

176
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,827
Let's play "The Uncle Game" today, OK?

177
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,299
OK, Kai, let's get out of the car first.

178
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,402
OK! Let's go.

179
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,445
You've gone too far,

180
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,379
it's just here I guess.

181
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,614
Here?

182
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,550
Jerry!

183
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,585
We love to watch
your online-streaming show!

184
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:19,919
Thank you!

185
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,920
Can we take a picture with you?

186
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,787
Sure!

187
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,755
Quick!

188
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,294
Thank you!

189
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:28,995
You're welcome.

190
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:29,895
Are you guys tourists?

191
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,664
Yeah, we come here
to eat at this restaurant,

192
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,733
Their dumplings look so good!

193
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,266
Eat it up!

194
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,601
Hey girls!

195
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,869
What's up?

196
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,237
What a coincidence!

197
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,238
Let's go.

198
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,606
I remember you...

199
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,143
Bro said your body's hot.

200
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,712
He's so cute!

201
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:47,813
Come on, let's go.

202
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,489
Thank you!

203
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,391
They have curry too.

204
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,558
Kai.

205
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,560
You're so considerate!

206
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,596
- You must be thirsty.
- Thank you.

207
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,530
It's so hot today...

208
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,132
I can put your money to mine.

209
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,001
Put our money to yours?
That's not safe.

210
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,903
He means the food is on him.

211
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,007
Handsome, where's the money?

212
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:17,677
Mom...

213
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,912
Now you know when to look for me!

214
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,114
What shall we eat?

215
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,115
Any recommendations?

216
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,650
Since you're so "hot"...

217
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,553
You should eat Korean dumplings.

218
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,254
Hot.

219
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,789
OK.

220
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,824
And you're a Mori Girl...

221
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,959
You should eat
Chinese cabbage dumplings.

222
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,695
- Chinese cabbage?
- Mori Girl?

223
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,296
Sounds pretty good to me.

224
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,197
- Chinese cabbage.
- Mori Girl.

225
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,832
What about you?

226
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,469
You look like a beach girl...

227
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,705
so seafood dumplings for you!

228
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,507
OK!

229
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,775
Like father, like son.

230
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,078
Both are good at hitting on girls.

231
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,080
Jerry,

232
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,451
so that woman is Damian's ex-wife.

233
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,089
You said that was impossible!

234
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,624
Look! She's come all the way here!

235
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,060
Mom, don't get nervous.

236
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,062
She comes here to bring Jimmy home.

237
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,865
It'd better be!

238
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,736
I'm so cool, so what should I eat?

239
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,637
Ice.

240
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,438
Ice.

241
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,373
Cool man.

242
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,009
Sorry to keep you waiting,
here are your dumplings.

243
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,478
Great!

244
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,645
Here.

245
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,115
- So great!
- Thank you!

246
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,683
Thank you.

247
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,584
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

248
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,785
- Let's sit together.
- It smells so good!

249
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,854
- Come, sit and eat.
- So delicious!

250
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,758
That's alright. I can just sit here.

251
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,664
This tastes so good!

252
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,040
Jimmy...

253
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,042
use chopsticks...

254
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,310
Chopsticks.

255
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,045
You are so strict.

256
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,348
Don't try to be a father all the time.

257
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,750
Hey, watch your attitude.

258
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,789
Let's dig in.

259
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,162
Baby

260
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,364
Jimmy, try this.

261
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,399
Daddy, thanks.

262
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,036
See? Did I already tell you that

263
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,772
chopsticks can get food
that is farther away.

264
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,511
Can you get me that, Uncle?

265
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,280
Sure.

266
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,714
This is for you.

267
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,285
Can you eat it with chopsticks?

268
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,023
It's all over your mouth.

269
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,892
It's all over your mouth.

270
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:50,696
Got it.

271
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,231
Let's go.

272
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,499
Dear...

273
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,869
Damian,

274
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,605
I've got something to do.
I gotta go.

275
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,074
What's that?

276
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,644
I haven't found
a restaurant for our next show.

277
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,812
I have to get it done.

278
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,280
Have fun, you all.

279
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,086
Kai can stay with us.

280
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,092
OK, I'm heading off now.

281
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,827
I'll leave Kai to you.

282
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,395
You're not coming?

283
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,731
See you back home in the evening.

284
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,733
Take care, OK?

285
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,602
Let's go inside.

286
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,703
Let's go.

287
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,771
Come with us, Kai.

288
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,088
Let's go inside and have a look around.

289
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,399
You can pull this,
ring the bell and make a wish.

290
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,566
Just like this.

291
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,868
That's right. Pull this...

292
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,604
Pull again, Kai.

293
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,306
OK.

294
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,573
Go.

295
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,718
Wash your hands.

296
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,054
The hand wash pavilion.

297
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,257
Left and then right...

298
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,091
OK?

299
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,326
- Left.
- Jimmy...

300
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,393
Right.

301
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,462
Left. Right.

302
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,699
OK.

303
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,067
Come on, let's go.

304
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,835
Let's go. This way.

305
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,705
One, two, three...

306
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,012
You sit here, Kai.

307
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,381
Two, three...

308
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,389
Hello, have you made a reservation yet?

309
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,423
Yes.

310
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,358
May I have your surname, Miss?

311
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,759
My surname is Jiang.

312
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,594
Two reserved for 6:30, right?

313
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:36,462
That's right.

314
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,063
Please wait over here.

315
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:38,931
Thank you.

316
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,466
Excuse me...

317
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,043
I'm a YouTuber from the channel
"Follow Jerry For Excellent Cuisine"

318
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,470
My name is Jerry.

319
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,204
I'm looking for

320
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,840
an excellent restaurant in Hualien
to do our live-streaming show.

321
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,974
I've seen many good reviews

322
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,010
about your restaurant.

323
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,846
Coincidentally, chef Kao...

324
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,881
happened to be my high school classmate.

325
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,316
I want to ask if he's...

326
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,418
I see, you are chef Kao's classmate.

327
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,387
He's been out and hasn't come back yet.

328
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,889
Do you want to come in and wait for him?

329
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,024
I'd love to.

330
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,525
Please take off your shoes over here.

331
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,593
Thank you.

332
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,702
Excuse me,
are you chef Kao's girlfriend?

333
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,872
Sorry, I shouldn't ask about it.

334
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,807
I'm not his girlfriend.

335
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,275
Please come this way.

336
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:26,845
Please wait in the couch area.

337
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,313
Thank you.

338
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,550
OK.

339
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,651
Give you a bit of this.

340
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:34,953
You see?

341
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,422
- OK.
- Can you see?

342
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,258
Now throw it.

343
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,662
That's awesome!

344
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,264
I'll take a photo here.

345
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,965
Look over here.

346
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,302
Kai...

347
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,072
You mistake daddy for uncle, huh?
That's so silly of you.

348
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:53,906
You are the silly one.

349
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,743
I'm playing "The Uncle Game"
with Daddy.

350
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,311
Great job, Kai!

351
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,213
Let's get you some ice cream later, OK?

352
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,283
I want ice cream too...

353
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,384
Uncle?

354
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,251
You can't.

355
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,753
You have to call me Daddy.

356
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,092
So many fish, look.

357
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,626
The fish swim and run fast.

358
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,360
Are you done?

359
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,562
Yeah.

360
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,765
Let's go there to buy some ice cream.

361
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,799
OK.

362
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,469
Come on, let's buy some ice cream.

363
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,105
What a huge turtle!

364
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,809
Look, Lucky Cat!

365
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,518
This way.

366
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,519
Welcome!

367
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,221
Hello!

368
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,633
Here.

369
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,301
Try this.

370
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,855
Jerry.

371
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,959
Long time no see.

372
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,128
When were you back to Hualien?

373
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,630
Why didn't you tell me?

374
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,233
I thought you were still in Japan.

375
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,668
Also...

376
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,303
You are a big chef now...

377
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,371
you won't have time for me.

378
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,140
Are you kidding?

379
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,275
Who are you?

380
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,377
You are Jerry Pan.

381
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,313
The first person who
confessed to me in my life...

382
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,183
I'll spare my time
for you even when I'm busy.

383
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,884
God, you still remember?

384
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,519
This is so embarrassing.

385
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,521
Why are you embarrassed?

386
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,291
But promise me.

387
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,825
Since you came here today...

388
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,261
you just have to
sit down and enjoy my food.

389
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,597
Don't go anywhere.

390
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,436
This is your favourite.

391
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,571
Barbeque Squid.

392
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,372
You still remember?

393
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:15,914
This is...

394
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,349
32.

395
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,050
My high school seat number.

396
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,154
You try.

397
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:22,988
See if you like it or not.

398
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,858
I'll dig in then.

399
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,306
Eat slowly.

400
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,947
This is from chef Kao.

401
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,150
What's this dish?

402
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,721
Australian beef short rib.

403
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,531
Try it.

404
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,475
What's this?

405
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:17,676
Do you remember...

406
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,411
we discussed one thing about...

407
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,947
the most famous snack
in Hualien is mochi...

408
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,448
But we couldn't find
any stall in Hualien

409
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,183
that sold tasty mochi.

410
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,519
We were like idiots at that time.

411
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,520
We went to
every single stall in Hualien...

412
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,554
and then complained about
every single one of them.

413
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,356
Yeah, that was so crazy.

414
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,625
Then do you remember what happened?

415
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,161
We found the best mochi stall

416
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,263
that we both felt satisfied.

417
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,776
It was the old granny
in your neighbourhood.

418
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,344
I knew you would remember it.

419
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,314
How do you know how to make it?

420
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,748
I kept bothering the granny...

421
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,750
until she was willing to
pass me the secret recipe.

422
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,186
Good, isn't it?

423
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,856
I miss the flavor of it.

424
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,858
Want more?

425
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,160
Wait, I haven't finished it.

426
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:09,494
One more.

427
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,862
Then one more for you.

428
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,974
So are these specialties

429
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,477
of your restaurant?

430
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,279
No, they aren't.

431
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,547
Just for you.

432
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,617
Here.

433
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,421
See if you still remember this?

434
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,495
Hong Kong barbeque.

435
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,800
Your favourite barbeque
restaurant in high school.

436
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,073
You still remember?

437
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,243
Yeah, he was
a very grumpy old Hong Kong chef.

438
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,480
We stayed in there all day until

439
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,514
the restaurant was almost closed.

440
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,216
And he would stare at us angrily.

441
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,484
Yep.

442
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,151
And do you know what happened?

443
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,053
Because the chef didn't have
anybody to pass on his skills...

444
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,254
Also he wanted to close his store.

445
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,689
And it's because
I kept bothering him until

446
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,425
he was willing to share
his recipe with me.

447
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,927
I think I helped him
in some way to pass on his skills.

448
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,998
Jerry...

449
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,734
would you like to taste what I cook

450
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,569
when I become a famous chef?

451
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,239
You're so popular.
I bet many people would stay in line.

452
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,306
There would be no room for me.

453
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,808
I am popular?

454
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,510
So many people have a crush on you.

455
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,099
Kao.

456
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,101
I have to go back now.

457
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,138
What?

458
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,773
You are not as free as before.

459
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,053
I miss the days
when I could stay up all night.

460
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:37,909
Thank you.

461
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,145
Just pull over here.

462
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,115
Thank you.

463
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,455
Jerry.

464
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,723
You are home.

465
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,162
You remember where I live?

466
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,932
You really have no idea
how important you are to me.

467
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,714
Am I important?

468
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,153
OK. Go home now.

469
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,232
I'm home.

470
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,676
You had some wine?

471
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,319
Thanks.

472
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,464
Kate will leave in two days.

473
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,133
And she will take Jimmy back home too.

474
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,070
Soon, our lives will be

475
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,438
back to normal.

476
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,808
That's kind of a rush.

477
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,510
Why doesn't she stay for a few days?

478
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,714
She has to go back
to sort out her wedding

479
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,316
and also there are other things
she needs to do.

480
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,152
This time, she particularly came here

481
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,186
to take Jimmy back.

482
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,621
And that's it.

483
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,430
Jimmy had so much fun
during his time here.

484
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,932
I don't think he wants to go back.

485
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,950
Since he came...

486
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,687
you and Kai
have been staying in Hualien...

487
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,993
I know I have wronged you and Jimmy.

488
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,161
It's all my fault.

489
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,963
I didn't sort things out properly.

490
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,934
But if you...

491
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,536
can't forgive me because of this.

492
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,173
I have to make a decision.

493
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,913
Do you think I'm chucking him out?

494
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,287
No.

495
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,559
Actually I'm confused myself.

496
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,095
I don't want to leave him.

497
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,034
You know...

498
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,671
Jimmy protected Kai at the beach today.

499
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,907
Protected Kai?

500
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,078
Even though Kai isn't scared of water,

501
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,683
But I saw that
he was so worried about him...

502
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,486
I was really moved.

503
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:22,267
They picked up those seashells for you.

504
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,311
What's the matter?

505
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,956
Baby, what's going on?

506
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,562
Stay...

507
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,163
Don't stay...

508
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,531
Stay...

509
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,600
Don't stay...

510
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,835
But stay...

511
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,436
- Can I look after him?
- Baby.

512
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,505
Of course I can.

513
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,540
Haven't I looked after Kai very well?

514
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,510
And he seems to like me a lot...

515
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,245
and Kai, too.

516
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,982
But there will be conflict
after living together for a long time...

517
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,518
What if he misses his mom?

518
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,353
Stay...

519
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,165
That's alright, baby...

520
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,466
Alright.

521
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,801
Don't cry.

522
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,571
I will let Jimmy go back, OK?

523
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,140
Alright, don't cry.

524
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,144
Is that better for him

525
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,779
if Jimmy goes back to the US?

526
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,748
Not better for me!

527
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,450
In the States,

528
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,885
no dumplings...

529
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,386
no Kai...

530
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,388
nobody...

531
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,525
Only me...

532
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,493
no family.

533
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,795
Jimmy.

534
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:00,732
I will look after Bro Kai.

535
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,934
My Chinese will get better.

536
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:06,738
Less gaming for me
and I'll take more time to study.

537
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:10,275
I will try my best not to cause you trouble.

538
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,447
You are smiling.

539
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,750
That means yes, right?

540
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,351
I can stay?

541
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,826
Welcome to our family.

542
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,109
Look, Daddy.

543
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:46,544
I can be really fast!

544
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,812
You can do it faster.

545
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:48,980
You've got two left feet.

546
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,715
Even faster!

547
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,518
Jimmy,

548
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,387
why you unpacked your luggage?

549
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,259
Answer my question.

550
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,628
Because I'm not leaving.

551
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,130
I'm not going anywhere.

552
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:06,631
What do you mean...

553
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,066
you are not leaving?

554
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,005
I let Jimmy stay.

555
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,641
Jerry and I
will take good care of him here.

556
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,043
Jimmy.

557
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,879
I need to talk with your dad.

558
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,280
Out.

559
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,251
Out!

560
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,093
When did he find out

561
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,095
about your relationship with Jerry?

562
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,066
So he knew it all along?

563
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,868
You are such a liar.

564
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,937
We didn't want to upset you.

565
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:46,971
So...

566
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,374
So you all put on an act, just for me?

567
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,145
I'm a joke!

568
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,513
I'm leaving.

569
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:58,917
Kate!

570
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,055
Kate!
