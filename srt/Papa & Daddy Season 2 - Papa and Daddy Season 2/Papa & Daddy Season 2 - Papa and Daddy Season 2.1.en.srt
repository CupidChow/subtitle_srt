00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,800
(Episode 1 The break is the new start)

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,560
Where have you been?

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,450
Why so serious?

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,500
Have I done anything wrong?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,770
I've been waiting for 20 minutes.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,170
I was talking to my friends.

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,750
After school, you should leave earlier.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,210
If you want to talk to your friends,

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,820
you can talk to them tomorrow.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,150
I thought something happened to you.

11
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,250
You wouldn't pick up your phone.

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,274
I was worried about you.

13
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:27,340
It's not a big deal.

14
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,900
What if you meet bad people?

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,670
I'm talking to you now.

16
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,340
It won't happen again.

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,960
What?

19
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,192
Well...

20
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,580
If you want to stay in Taiwan,

21
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,500
you need to speak Chinese.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,080
It's too hard.

23
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,500
I insist.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,830
You have promised.

25
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,480
Promise it is, then.

26
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,830
Fine, I will behave.

27
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,570
Can we go eat now?

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,762
Okay.

29
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,430
What do you want to eat?

30
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,810
Steak.

31
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,820
Let's go then.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,320
Jerry, let's go.

33
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,220
Kai, you're so good now.

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,930
Back then, you wouldn't even get on a scooter.

35
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:13,360
What?

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,910
Auntie's scooter is very cool.

37
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,910
It's because I'm cool.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,010
Look at you.

39
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:23,380
Overtake me.

40
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,930
Fine, I'm coming.

41
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,950
We're almost there.

42
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:11,620
It's here.

43
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,940
Kai, get down.

44
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:14,362
Wait there.

45
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:15,410
Wait for me.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,260
Kai.

47
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,170
We're going to the beach. Are you happy?

48
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,248
I'm happy.

49
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,459
Come.

50
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,410
Hold this.

51
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,170
Need a hand?

52
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,172
No.

53
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:31,800
- Kai, wait for me.
- Kai, wait for me.

54
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,180
- You're too slow. Hurry up.
- Don't run.

55
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,400
Kai is from here, indeed.

56
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,680
Why are you so stubborn?

57
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,350
Just talk to him.

58
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,640
I want to talk,

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,140
but where is he?

60
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,570
You're just too arrogant.

61
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:03,001
It's not your business.

62
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:04,095
It is.

63
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,470
Kai, wait for us.

64
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,616
Kai.

65
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,790
He runs way too fast.

66
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,820
Kai.

67
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
(PAPA & DADDY 2)
(Episode 1)

68
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,590
Can you tilt a little?

69
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,600
Right.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,680
Okay.

71
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,790
I'm gonna toss you.

72
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:13,440
If you miss him that much, go bring him back.

73
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,420
He won't respond to my texts nor my calls.

74
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,471
I can only look

75
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:22,030
at Alex's feed

76
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,390
to see what they are up to.

77
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,270
Alex said that

78
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,550
she has never seen Jerry acting like this.

79
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,570
He is this mad because he cares.

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,900
Why don't you start with Kai?

81
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,940
And do what?

82
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,330
Think about it.

83
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,860
Jimmy's teacher.

84
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,990
What's going on with him again?

85
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,470
I need to answer the phone.

86
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,400
Hello.

87
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,540
I don't want to bother you.

88
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,850
I'm so sorry.

89
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,100
I got it.

90
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,480
Jimmy's teacher said

91
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,390
he's in class for a few minutes
and went to the toilet,

92
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,320
but never came back to class.

93
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,170
It turned out he went to play basketball
with friends from another class

94
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,390
in the playground.

95
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,850
Really?

96
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,450
The teacher must be shocked.

97
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,830
Do you guys get along well?

98
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,550
He seems easy-going,

99
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,810
so he shouldn't be rebellious.

100
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,560
But we have never lived together before.

101
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,390
Sometimes I just don't know

102
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,230
how to deal with him.

103
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,610
Maybe I'm just not used to it yet.

104
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,290
Be his friend.

105
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,290
Try to understand him.

106
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,050
It's going to be okay.

107
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,580
You can do it.

108
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,250
Now I am worried about...

109
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,530
Jerry.

110
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,870
Then take Jimmy to Hualien with you.

111
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,100
Let everyone talk things through.

112
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,590
It's been three months.

113
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,070
Jerry might have stopped being mad.

114
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,790
I can't do that.

115
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,230
Jimmy wants to stay in Taiwan.

116
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,040
He must get used to the life here.

117
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,290
He can't stop going to school.

118
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,470
The key to making Jimmy stay in Taiwan

119
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,610
is to talk things through with Jerry.

120
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,760
Studying is not important at all.

121
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,998
I know but...

122
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,130
I can't.

123
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,800
- Let's eat.
- Jimmy can't be running around.

124
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,802
Come.

125
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,473
You worked hard. Let's eat.

126
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,200
Come.

127
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,290
Hualien is not far. It won't take long.

128
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,534
Right?

129
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,720
Damian

130
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
I know you're on a no-carb diet.

131
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,580
I prepared a healthy meal for you.

132
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,580
Very thoughtful of you.

133
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:23,627
Thank you.

134
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:25,040
You name is Wei?

135
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,270
Wei in first tone.

136
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,670
Wei that means formidable.

137
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,760
Wei.

138
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,900
Thank you so much.

139
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,390
How's your work here?

140
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,480
It's quite alright.

141
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,519
I really like you

142
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,900
and Celine.

143
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,290
I feel as if everyone were my family.

144
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,290
We are family.

145
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,810
I will go pick a bottle of wine.

146
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,002
Alright.

147
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:48,460
Let's fly.

148
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,700
I'll hold you up.

149
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,821
Let's fly.

150
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,010
Go.

151
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,560
Go to the right.

152
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,430
Yes.

153
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,310
Faster.

154
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,450
Yes! Awesome, bro!

155
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,190
Go.

156
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,840
How is school lately?

157
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,620
Nothing new.

158
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,950
Can we just talk later?

159
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,690
Scott woke up early just to play with me.

160
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,450
Stop playing for a minute.

161
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
I have something to tell you.
It won't take long.

162
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,390
Sorry. I gotta go.

163
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,700
Talk to you later.

164
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,880
I will go to Hualien tomorrow.

165
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,720
In the meantime,
you need to stay at your aunt's.

166
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,394
Are you going to see Jerry?

167
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,520
Yes.

168
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,700
I will go to bring him and Kai back.

169
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,170
I want to go with you.

170
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,930
You can't. You need to go to school.

171
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,470
Please.

172
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,470
Please.

173
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,780
Fine.

174
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,970
I will apply for a leave for you.

175
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,020
Yes.

176
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,780
However, you still
need to take homework with you.

177
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,910
No problem.

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,180
Have you been in contact
with you mother lately?

179
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,970
Last time I called her, Adam picked up.

180
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,060
He said Mom was trying on wedding dresses.

181
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,230
After that, Mom called but I missed it.

182
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,090
What about your friends in the US?

183
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,520
Do you miss them?

184
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,700
We talk online.

185
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,020
They've transferred to other schools.

186
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay.

187
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,820
Go on with your game then.

188
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,690
What is it?

189
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,080
What song are you listenning to?

190
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,680
Want to hear it?

191
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,861
Of course.

192
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,180
It's a new song.

193
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,570
It's good, right?

194
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,579
Not bad.

195
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:06,720
Awesome.

196
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:08,500
Keep dancing.

197
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,110
Pan, who's this kid?

198
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,290
He's so cute.

199
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,310
He's my grandson.

200
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,740
His name is Kai.

201
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,779
He is your son's child?

202
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,951
Yes.

203
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,123
That's such a surprise.

204
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:19,150
Your son is still young.

205
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,250
And his son is this big.

206
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,310
What about his wife?

207
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,070
They're usually in Taipei.

208
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,136
Thet are very busy.

209
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:27,245
Eat dumplings first.

210
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:28,339
Is that so?

211
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:29,408
Right.

212
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:30,980
The child looks like his mother, right?

213
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,670
He doesn't look so much like your son.

214
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,060
Is that so?

215
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,480
He's young. You can't see it yet.

216
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,870
Pan.

217
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,986
I will go boil dumplings.

218
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,110
You're so cute.

219
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,160
Come, come.

220
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,299
I have something for you.

221
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:47,390
Here.

222
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,970
You can have it.

223
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,677
Aw, he's such a good kid.

224
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,770
I still have more.

225
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,880
Come, come.

226
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,900
I give you all. All of this is for you.

227
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,430
Say "Thank you."

228
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,515
Thank you.

229
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,560
You're welcome.

230
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,010
You got so many candies.

231
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,490
Hey, cabbage dumplings are done.

232
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,550
Dumplings are ready.

233
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,490
Please do me a favor.

234
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,600
Be careful with the plate.

235
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,040
Kai knows how to serve too.

236
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,091
It's for this table.

237
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:16,195
Thank you very much.

238
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,880
Good boy.

239
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,270
Come get your candy.

240
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,420
He's so cute.

241
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,610
Good boy. Eat the candy now.

242
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,080
Hello to all the fans.

243
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,980
Hello, hello.

244
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,050
Is everyone here?

245
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,470
Okay, let's get started then.

246
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,590
Hello.

247
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,360
This person beside me

248
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,030
has travelled around the world.

249
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,900
Wherever he went, he used Airbnb.

250
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,560
The wild child who has lived
almost everywhere in the world

251
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,360
is my best friend who grew up with me.

252
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,320
And this is our guest chef for today.

253
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,600
Hello, Jerry's fans.

254
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,670
I am Gao Daxia.

255
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,080
Today, I bring you local food.

256
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,230
A small thing I learned
from an owner of a place

257
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,330
on Airbnb.

258
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,490
And then he mixed work with life.

259
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,700
I envy him so much.

260
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,561
That's why we should toast him.

261
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,710
Let's toast.

262
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,570
Wait. What to say when you toast?

263
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,874
Nu mita.

264
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:11,943
Is that correct?

265
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:14,120
Isn't it uwaken nu mita?

266
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:15,421
That's right.

267
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,890
Are you the local man

268
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,973
or am I?

269
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,035
I was testing you.

270
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:19,860
Testing me?

271
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,380
Yes.

272
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,030
OK.

273
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,740
To my viewers,

274
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,880
uwaken nu mita.

275
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,230
Let's get to the point of today.

276
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,860
Today I bring you Chicken Thigh Steak.

277
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,150
- Chicken Thigh Steak.
- That's right.

278
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,250
Mix it with ailanthus-like prickly ash.

279
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,260
Ailanthus-like prickly ash?

280
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,750
- Then, we will grill it like Australians do.
- I've never heard of it.

281
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,928
Right. It also got a name that
means birds wouldn't step on it.

282
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:41,970
Birds wouldn't step on it.

283
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,250
Why wouldn't birds step on it?

284
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,510
Because its leaves have thorns on the back,

285
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,510
so birds wouldn't step on it.

286
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,520
Come see, guys.

287
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,210
Ailanthus-like prickly ash

288
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,261
has small thorns,

289
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:50,375
so birds wouldn't step on them.

290
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,890
Now everyone gets it, right?

291
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,310
You're so good at cutting that.

292
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,630
How many times have I told you

293
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,770
not to let Kai have candies?

294
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,230
He won't sleep soundly at night.

295
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,810
It's not like he has it every day.

296
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,905
It's not that bad.

297
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,935
Right?

298
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,920
No means no.

299
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,770
If you are like this,

300
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,830
how can I trust you with Kai?

301
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,720
Papa, it's so hot.

302
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,400
Why are you sweating so much?

303
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,980
I remember that I didn't

304
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,290
put on this thick sweater
for him this morning.

305
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,990
It's cold today.

306
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,920
Children shouldn't get sick, you know?

307
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,380
That's right. Hualien's sun can't be trusted.

308
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,920
The temperature outside is really low.

309
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,130
What kind of grandparents

310
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,070
are you guys?

311
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,650
You two grew up like this too, didn't you?

312
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,560
You're one to talk.

313
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,450
There was this really hot summer.

314
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,690
She didn't turn on the AC,

315
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,030
and told us to keep calm to feel cool.

316
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,780
Right. I sweated a lot that day.

317
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,560
The next morning, I was covered in rash.

318
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,810
I thought I was having a fever.

319
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,090
Is there something wrong
with Kai's genes?

320
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,870
He doesn't look like you one bit.

321
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,770
Mom, why are you
talking about this in front of him?

322
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,330
Young kids wouldn't understand this.

323
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,880
Which words can't he understand?

324
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,410
Is he really your child?

325
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,830
Alright.

326
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,960
You two stop talking.

327
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,510
No. You want to know too, don't you?

328
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,400
Damian.

329
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,610
Daddy.

330
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,160
Damian.

331
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Mr. and Mrs. Pan.

332
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,450
Stand still.

333
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,910
Don't move.

334
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,010
Yes.

335
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,550
I can't believe it.

336
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,040
It's been three months and you just came.

337
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,440
Baby.

338
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,170
Don't call me Baby.

339
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,970
Why didn't you tell me you have a child?

340
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,100
Do you remember six years ago?

341
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,570
We broke up because

342
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,140
I wanted a kid, didn't we?

343
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,410
It wasn't easy to get back together.

344
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,450
Sasa told me

345
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,240
not to tell you

346
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,380
about the kid that I had in America.

347
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,360
Sasa knows?

348
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,167
I made a promise to Jerry.

349
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,370
During these two years,

350
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,370
we won't dream about having kids.

351
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,560
We're going to enjoy our lives for now.

352
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,680
He really loves you.

353
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,050
Also, it's me who decided to have a kid.

354
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,960
He doesn't have to help me take care of it.

355
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,530
Just staying by my side is enough.

356
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:43,060
Do you really think it will be that easy?

357
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,860
What if the child cries at night?

358
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,200
Can he ignore that?

359
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,137
We can just find a helper.

360
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:49,200
It's no big deal.

361
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,301
No problem.

362
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,230
Don't tell him you already had a kid.

363
00:15:58,102 --> 00:15:59,230
Why?

364
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,130
I don't want secrets between us.

365
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,750
You two just got back together.

366
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,990
Jerry is very sensitive

367
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,500
when it comes to children.

368
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,760
I think you should
keep it to yourself for now.

369
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,750
Also,

370
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,460
You are not in touch with Jimmy anyway.

371
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,240
You don't really have to mention it.

372
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,670
It's called concealing for one's own good.

373
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,090
Actually, I was struggling too.

374
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,183
To be honest, I'm in Taiwan now,

375
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:32,460
but Jimmy and his mom live in America.

376
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,319
We can never end up together,

377
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:34,960
so...

378
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,021
When you told me you were once married,

379
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:37,940
you should mention that too.

380
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,500
Those are two different topics.

381
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,890
When I married Kate,

382
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,510
I was very young.

383
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,740
I didn't even know what I wanted.

384
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,390
When I realized I was into men,

385
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,170
Kate was already pregnant.

386
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,980
She was devastated.

387
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,030
And she didn't want
anything to do with me again.

388
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,530
So, I respect her decision.

389
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,320
Actually, all these years,

390
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,790
I've been feeling I owe it to them.

391
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,530
To me, the past

392
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,910
is really painful.

393
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,700
Despite that,

394
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,740
you still should have told me.

395
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,580
You didn't trust me, did you?

396
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,590
It's not that.

397
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,600
I was afraid that I'd lose you.

398
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,860
What an excuse.

399
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,070
Baby.

400
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,300
What do I have to do to make you forgive me?

401
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,210
I really miss you and Kai.

402
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,450
I mean it.

403
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,490
Alright.

404
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,240
I'll think about forgiving you later.

405
00:17:58,012 --> 00:17:59,290
But you need to give me some time

406
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,550
to get to know Jimmy.

407
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,180
If it's possible,

408
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,410
let him go back to America.

409
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,010
He grew up there anyway.

410
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,950
Also,

411
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,070
you need to explain to my parents

412
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,340
who he is.

413
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,630
Baby.

414
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,570
Baby.

415
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,660
What about me now?

416
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,860
- Stay there.
- Baby.

417
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,260
Do you know who your mommy is?

418
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,410
I don't have a mommy.
I only have dads.

419
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,680
That's alright.

420
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,770
We are family,

421
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,210
so you can think of my mom as your mom.

422
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,287
Okay.

423
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:44,400
Cool.

424
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,400
Good brother.

425
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:48,460
It'll be cooler

426
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,660
if you say bro.

427
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,140
Bro.

428
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,000
Dumplings are ready.

429
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,170
You understand Chinese too?

430
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,500
You are Damian's relative, right?

431
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:02,852
You look very handsome.

432
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:03,920
Relative?

433
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,650
I'm his son.

434
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,730
Kai, what does he mean?

435
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,098
He's my bro.

436
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:11,140
Dad, Mom.

437
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,600
He doesn't get to come here a lot,

438
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,910
so I will take to to the night market.

439
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,280
We'll come back a bit late.

440
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,730
What does bro mean?

441
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,280
It means older brother.

442
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,850
Bro means good friend,

443
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,536
or best friend, or something like that.

444
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:24,610
That's right.

445
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,990
He is my friend's son.

446
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,856
Alright, let's go.

447
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:29,622
Let's go.

448
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:30,785
Go, go, go.

449
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:32,582
Don't wait up.

450
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:33,738
He's my brother.

451
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:34,863
We will be a bit late.

452
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:35,970
We'll eat before we come back.

453
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,800
Bro.

454
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,150
Brother.

455
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,310
Take the smaller one. It's better.

456
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,408
This one.

457
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,640
Thank you. Bye-bye.

458
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,160
Thank you.

459
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:57,380
Hold it well.

460
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,920
Try again.

461
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,810
Thank you.

462
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:14,780
I don't want it.

463
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,480
I do.

464
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,570
No.

465
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:20,080
There?

466
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,141
Yes.

467
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,430
Excuse me. Can you take a picture for us?

468
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,710
Sweep it?

469
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:28,190
Picture.

470
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,225
Take a picture.

471
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:29,820
Take a picture.

472
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,450
That's right. Can you?

473
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,120
OK.

474
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,770
Thank you.

475
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:35,110
OK.

476
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,410
You just came back from America?

477
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,150
Yes.

478
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,152
Which state?

479
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:39,199
California.

480
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:40,291
I've been there.

481
00:20:40,316 --> 00:20:41,410
I love the beaches there

482
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,852
because everyone can just wear bikinis

483
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:43,910
and walk around.

484
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,220
Such freedom.

485
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,961
Your shape is great.

486
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:48,030
Your skin color looks healthy.

487
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,230
You can wear little.

488
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,829
Wear little?

489
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:51,895
What does it mean?

490
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:54,040
He means your skin looks healthy.

491
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,880
You must look good in swimsuits.

492
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,180
Don't interrupt.

493
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,320
It's rude.

494
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,780
You Mandarin is broken.

495
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,850
I am just helping.

496
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,510
I told you to practice Mandarin.

497
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,581
I don't have any ill intent.

498
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:07,650
I'm sorry.

499
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:08,680
That's okay.

500
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,220
Thank you for the photo.

501
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,470
Papa, what does good shape mean?

502
00:21:33,282 --> 00:21:34,470
Thanks.

503
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,150
I'm sorry.

504
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:03,240
Baby.

505
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,010
I'm really sorry

506
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,560
that I hurt you.

507
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm sorry too.

508
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,570
I know Jimmy means a lot to you.

509
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,030
But...

510
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,840
Give me a little more time
to learn about him.

511
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,650
I know.

512
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,060
I'm trying to adjust too.

513
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,860
I already told Kate

514
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,030
to come

515
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,750
and take Jimmy.

516
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,770
Does Jimmy know?

517
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:47,824
He doesn't.

518
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,120
I'll just tell him when Kate comes.

519
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,856
Papa, there are mosquitoes.

520
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Where? Let me see.

521
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,950
Come sit.

522
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,400
Where did you get bitten.

523
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:30,575
Here?

524
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,620
Don't scratch it.

525
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,310
I will apply ointment for you
to stop the itching.

526
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,410
Okay?

527
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,210
Hello, my fans.

528
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,360
Today, we're taking you
to Mrs. Pan's Dumpling Shop,

529
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
the most famous dumpling place in Hualien.

530
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,530
These two beside me

531
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,740
are masters of dumpling making.

532
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,370
Hello, everyone.

533
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,290
Our Mrs. Pan's Dumpling Shop

534
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,830
is in Hualien.

535
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,750
We have parking spaces available

536
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,010
and it's convenient to get here.

537
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,020
As for our dumplings,

538
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,150
they are all hand-made,

539
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,650
with fresh ingredients.

540
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,032
Please come when you have a chance.

541
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,148
Moreover,

542
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:21,290
and it's very important.

543
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,040
Our Jerry had all these dumplings growing up.

544
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,340
See? He's tall and handsome, right?

545
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,160
Madam, why are you so sweet?

546
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,326
No. She's my mother.

547
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:31,364
Right.

548
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:32,668
I bet you all know now

549
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:34,370
who I got this from.

550
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,451
That's right.

551
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:36,504
So, remember.

552
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:37,910
If you guys come to Hualien,

553
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,090
don't forget to come to
Mrs. Pan's Dumpling Shop.

554
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,800
Please come.

555
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,920
Mom, look.

556
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,460
Everybody says you're so cute.

557
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,630
There're so many comments.

558
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,240
Live streaming is so hard.

559
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,630
We've been preparing since this morning.

560
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,050
It's so tiring.

561
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,760
Do you realize how good he is now?

562
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,060
My son, you must be so tired.

563
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,810
I'm not as tired as you two.

564
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,410
But, Damian, you made my face look so big.

565
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,120
No. That's not possible.

566
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,900
No. That's very small.

567
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,240
It's my face that is big

568
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,690
like a pancake.

569
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,240
That's right.
He made Jerry look the best, didn't he?

570
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,343
It's because of love.

571
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:12,720
- I can't believe you.
- Pan.

572
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,830
There are customers.

573
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,760
Welcome.

574
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,600
Come and have some dumplings.

575
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,400
Right.

576
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,950
Please come in and sit here.

577
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:19,160
Hello. Welcome.

578
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,540
See for yourself.

579
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,130
I want to take a photo with you.

580
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,320
Of course, you can.

581
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,404
So cool.

582
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:25,930
Go away.

583
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:27,820
Great.

584
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,290
It looks good. Thank you.

585
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:30,319
I'm a big fan of yours.

586
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:31,388
Alright.

587
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:32,421
Please sit there. Thank you.

588
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:33,607
Please sit.

589
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,753
Please sit.

590
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,408
Go back first.

591
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,648
I will take care of the rest.

592
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,589
Your mom has been busy all day.

593
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:44,710
You take care of it then.

594
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,120
Okay, no problem.

595
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:47,460
Be careful.

596
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,050
Alright.

597
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,070
Tell me when you get home.

598
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,172
Okay.

599
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,890
Is it good?

600
00:26:31,578 --> 00:26:32,680
Very good.

601
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,110
My mom doesn't cook.

602
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,580
There's love here.

603
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,770
You're so lucky.

604
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,210
Do you miss your mom?

605
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,540
If you miss her,

606
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,490
why don't you go back to her?

607
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,980
Why are you staying in Taiwan?

608
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,860
She's getting married.

609
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,310
I don't like it.

610
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,099
What else do you like to eat?

611
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:33,280
Tell me.

612
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,730
I'll make it for you.

613
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,740
Steak.

614
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,310
Alright.

615
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,480
I'll make it for you.

616
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,820
You're so kind.

617
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,080
I like you.

618
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,970
Baby.

619
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,330
Kate's flight will land tomorrow.

620
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,720
She wants to come to Hualien,

621
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,180
so I will pick her up tomorrow.

622
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,600
Why so sudden?

623
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,730
She'll busy doing taxes.

624
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,110
And there's also her wedding.

625
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,880
It seems like Jimmy doesn't want his mom
to get married.

626
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,130
That's right.

627
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:54,010
But I believe Kate can find a way.

628
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,570
Will she be unhappy?

629
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,260
She won't.

630
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,550
Don't overthink it.

631
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,020
Well...

632
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,580
Are you unhappy?

633
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,840
How can I be unhappy?

634
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,340
I love Jimmy so much.

635
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,520
So, even though he goes back to America,

636
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,570
how I love and care about him

637
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,020
will never change.

638
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,520
Now I hope you don't blame yourself,

639
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,630
Okay?

640
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,590
But...

641
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,570
I have something to ask you.

642
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,580
What is it?

643
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,980
Is it possible not to let your parents

644
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,210
meet Kate?

645
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,470
An.

646
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,390
C, h, u, a, n. Chuan.

647
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,860
M, a, o. Mao.

648
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,160
An chuan mao (helmet)?

649
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,220
Doesn't it mean cat?

650
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,280
Jerry.

651
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,649
Mom, didn't you go to the shop with Dad?

652
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:22,710
Why are you still here?

653
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,350
I have something to ask you.

654
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:25,649
Come here.

655
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,620
Jimmy and Damian,

656
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,380
how exactly are they related?

657
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,600
Why does Kai call him big brother?

658
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,101
He's Damian's son.

659
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,150
Son?

660
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,320
Biological son?

661
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,970
Isn't he gay?

662
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,060
He had Jimmy while he was still in America.

663
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,060
Could he change just like that?

664
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,870
Sexuality can be fluid.

665
00:30:49,524 --> 00:30:50,680
Well...

666
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,210
did you know it all along?

667
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,430
I did.

668
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:56,610
Are you stupid?

669
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,980
You help raise his kid.

670
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,220
You're so stupid.

671
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,900
Mom, don't say such hurtful things.

672
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,940
So...

673
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,699
Will this kid stay here?

674
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:08,760
No, he won't.

675
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,150
He will go back soon.

676
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,870
Really?

677
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,060
Alright, Dad is waiting for you.

678
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,070
Hurry up and go.

679
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,940
Just don't let him take advantage of you.

680
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,380
What if Damian goes back to dating women?

681
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,721
What will you do

682
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:21,750
when that time comes?

683
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,150
Mom, don't worry. That's not happening.

684
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,221
Hurry and go.

685
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:25,294
I will...
