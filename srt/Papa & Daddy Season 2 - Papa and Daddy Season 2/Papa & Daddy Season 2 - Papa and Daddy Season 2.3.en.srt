00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:03,169
(Episode 3 DNA Matters)
Quick! Drive! Go put out the fire!

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,671
Pull up the carrot first!

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,174
Chop! Chop!

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,176
I'll let you chop the carrot.

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,945
I want to plant it here.

6
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,016
You take this.

7
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,283
Mommy.

8
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,651
Go play with Mommy.

9
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,629
You've been searching for a long time.

10
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,398
I think we can just
choose a costume from home

11
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,133
for Matt to wear.

12
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,135
He's not a graduate anyway.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,371
But we only have
princess costumes at home,

14
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,173
he needs something different.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,512
Matt, look!

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,314
Younger Mommy found you
some new costumes!

17
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,916
See if there's one you like?

18
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,918
Have a look.

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,487
- This.
- So cool!

20
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,755
How about this?

21
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,657
Iron Man?

22
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,491
No.

23
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,026
- No?
- Iron Man is awesome!

24
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,195
What about this?

25
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,396
Star Wars.

26
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,364
No.

27
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,066
Not even Star War?

28
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,033
No.

29
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:07,700
OK.

30
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,334
What else...

31
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,269
Then this?

32
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,403
Buzz Lightyear?

33
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:10,970
No.

34
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,972
Buzz Lightyear can fly like this.

35
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,807
No.

36
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:14,674
No Buzz Lightyear?

37
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,042
Then what do you want?

38
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,078
What do you want?

39
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,082
Mom, I want Elsa.

40
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,650
You want this Elsa?

41
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,517
This looks like a new version.

42
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,653
Haven't seen it before, right?

43
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,322
It's quite pretty.

44
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,891
Matt.

45
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,893
You've dressed as Elsa before.

46
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,695
This time, let's dress
as a different cartoon character, OK?

47
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,566
But this one is different
than the last one.

48
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,268
But even they are different,

49
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,236
they are still Elsa.

50
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,971
Your classmates have already
seen you wearing them,

51
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,606
so can we change to a different one?

52
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,707
No.

53
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,679
Spider Man?

54
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,546
Yo everyone!

55
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,115
Welcome!

56
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,084
Thank you.

57
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:00,887
Just one, Sir?

58
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,688
Please come in.

59
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,922
Please have a seat.

60
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,159
Mrs. Pan!

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,328
You got such a lovely boy
to help you.

62
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,029
Everyone comes here
to check-in because of him.

63
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,265
Yeah, children are just adorable, right?

64
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,735
So is that big kid your relative's child?

65
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,004
He looks a lot like Kai.

66
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,906
No.

67
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,574
He's the kid of my son's friend.

68
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,476
He came here to visit from the US.

69
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,713
You are so well-behaved!

70
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,081
Wait a second.

71
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,083
Mr. Pan, Mrs. Pan.

72
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,484
I'm coming here to pick them up.

73
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,218
Then I will go get Jerry.

74
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,019
OK.

75
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,187
Take your time.

76
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,955
OK, bye.

77
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:36,523
Let's go.

78
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,190
Kai, let's go.

79
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,958
Kai, let's go.

80
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,993
Pan.

81
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,094
Come with me.

82
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,103
I have a question.

83
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,672
In order to make a baby...

84
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,842
you only need one man's...

85
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,011
Do you mean sperm?

86
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,145
Yeah.

87
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,548
So which one was Kai made out of?

88
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,550
I thought you asked our son about it.

89
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,652
I didn't, did you?

90
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,422
But just look at Kai's face...

91
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,193
maybe it was Damian's...

92
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,894
It's pointless to guess it by yourself.

93
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,796
Why don't you just ask him?

94
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,765
- You ask.
- You ask.

95
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,436
OK, I will.

96
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,477
So do you think it's okay to
include this child in our Ancestry Book

97
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,146
who has no blood relation in our family?

98
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,382
Is Kai considered to be

99
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,384
our first grandson?

100
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,500
“PAPA & DADDY 2”
(Episode 3)

101
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,960
Matt, let's play this.

102
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,065
I think that...

103
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:29,102
because we like to make compliments
about girls, how pretty they are...

104
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,903
Matt wants to
draw our attention by doing this.

105
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,006
He wants to dress like a girl.

106
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,474
But those girls are really pretty.

107
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,476
I think so.

108
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,877
He just likes performance.

109
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,512
Don't you go to musicals often?

110
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,346
Those performers like to sing and dance.

111
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,481
But the point is,

112
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,449
Matt feels comfortable
in girl's costumes.

113
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,118
He's not shy at all.

114
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,452
Isn't that a good thing?

115
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,453
You see our Charlotte,

116
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,855
she's very shy.

117
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,423
That's because you don't feel shy at all, OK?

118
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,759
Let it go.

119
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,526
That's enough.

120
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,095
We can't encourage these kinds of things
in our house anymore.

121
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,463
But I‘ve seen Matt like to

122
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,965
play toy cars as well.

123
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,300
I think there is no need to be worried.

124
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,302
Yeah, I've told her.

125
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,203
This is just a phase.

126
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,438
But...

127
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,539
She's just so worried about it.

128
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm not.

129
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,775
I'm just wondering,

130
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,610
the reason that he makes such choices,

131
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,477
is because there is no

132
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,313
male influence in our house?

133
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,581
Or he was born like this?

134
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,218
Yeah, but it doesn't matter
what the reasons are.

135
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,720
We've always taught him that

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,789
there is no dichotomy between genders?

137
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,657
Of course, I knew this already.

138
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,859
But aren't you curious
about what causes this?

139
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,494
I'm not curious!

140
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,072
I just think that he can
do the things he enjoys.

141
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,499
I think so too!

142
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,436
Amy, but I've seen Matt and Kai

143
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,505
playing shooting gun games before.

144
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,140
Yeah, and Jerry said that

145
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,943
Matt was manly when he played the game.

146
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,413
Or you should take Matt
to Hualien for a visit.

147
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,148
He can stay with Jerry for a few days.

148
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,050
Yeah, good idea!

149
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,418
My baby's so amazing!

150
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,990
Hualien, Hualien...

151
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,763
Just a minute.

152
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,637
Are you still asleep?

153
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,639
I was working late last night.

154
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,343
Today is Grandpa's death anniversary.

155
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,680
Oh, I forgot.

156
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,316
Darling, get up!

157
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,016
Get up!

158
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,585
We're going to worship my grandpa today.

159
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,019
I'll go get Kai up.

160
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,391
Damian doesn't have to
come this time.

161
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,861
OK.

162
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,629
What about Kai?

163
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,698
Kai has to come with us, of course.

164
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,233
Not yet...

165
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,300
We haven't figured that out.

166
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,236
If we want to include Kai
in the Ancestry Book,

167
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,338
we have to take Kai to worship with us.

168
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,273
Then you ask him right now.

169
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,241
In front of Damian?

170
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,675
No, I will not!

171
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,680
How much does it cost, ma'am?

172
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,481
One hundred and fifty.

173
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,350
Ok, wait for a second.

174
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:00,620
OK, thank you.

175
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,121
Great, thank you.

176
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:02,655
Thanks.

177
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,389
Let's go.

178
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,660
Mom,

179
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,395
your response to Damian earlier on

180
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,330
was kind of rude.

181
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,498
What was it about?

182
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,067
Wait for your dad, let him explain...

183
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,504
Got everything we need.

184
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,372
Let's go!

185
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,072
Wait,

186
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,943
don't you have something
to say to your son?

187
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,146
OK, hurry up.

188
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,281
Yeah.

189
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,782
That...

190
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,818
is...

191
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,454
I think...

192
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,655
Dad,

193
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,423
can you just spit it out?

194
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,464
After we worship your grandpa...

195
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,264
Do you want to go to eat

196
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,999
your favorite rice-flour noodle soup
in that stall?

197
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,871
You are so useless!

198
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,107
We just want to ask you that

199
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,244
which one of you made Kai...

200
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,415
Because he doesn't look like
anyone in our family.

201
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:03,883
Yeah.

202
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,518
I've been digging into this
with your mom for so long,

203
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,155
so we figure we should just ask you
and make it clear.

204
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,027
It was Damian's sperm

205
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,496
given to the surrogate mother.

206
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,865
I knew it!

207
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,666
Does that make any difference?

208
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,935
Will that affect your love towards him?

209
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,704
Of course not,

210
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,908
it's just this involves whether or not
he can be included in the Ancestry Book,

211
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,077
or whether he can go to
worship Grandpa's anniversary.

212
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,645
In terms of the order,

213
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,947
Kai is considered as the first grandson
in the entire family.

214
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,449
I told your grandpa

215
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,583
during the Chinese New Year

216
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,086
that our Pan family
finally has the next generation...

217
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,124
Later you can tell
your grandpa all by yourself!

218
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,763
Mom, Dad!

219
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,269
I'm not going to lose again!

220
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,603
Let's try again!

221
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,671
Again!

222
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,141
We won this time, Kai!

223
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:02,942
Fantastic!

224
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,610
- High-five, Kai!
- Wei.

225
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,145
Is everything OK?

226
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,047
- Great!
- Sorry to bother you on your holiday, Damian.

227
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,151
- See? I told you.
- But Celine hasn't been in for days.

228
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,611
The workers asked me about the construction.
I don't know what to do.

229
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:18,400
So we have to delay our progress...

230
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,927
We are so amazing!

231
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,295
Did you call her?

232
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,297
Yes, I did,
but no one answered the phone.

233
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,242
Later, our first cutlery delivery

234
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,936
will arrive any minute.

235
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,505
We will have to pay for it.

236
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,607
I see.

237
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,377
Then you tell the delivery guy,
I'll pay for it online.

238
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,947
OK, could you contact Celine, please?

239
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,582
If not, the restaurant will be a mess.

240
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,684
I will call her.

241
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,385
And I will go back right away.
Don't worry.

242
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,344
That's great.

243
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,229
I miss...

244
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,155
Please come back as soon as possible.

245
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,156
Bye.

246
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,383
Celine,

247
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,086
call me as soon as you get this message.

248
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,152
You're back.

249
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,587
Where's Mom and Dad?

250
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,355
They are in the restaurant.

251
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,592
Where's Kai?

252
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,396
Jimmy's taking a nap with him upstairs.

253
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,404
Do you want to go for a walk？

254
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,878
Sure.

255
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,055
Baby,

256
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,157
I think...

257
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,391
I should go back to Taipei

258
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,926
to sort out the second branch store.

259
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,930
Also Jimmy can't stay out of school
for too long.

260
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,000
He can't be like this
and do nothing all day.

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,268
Just fooling around.

262
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,906
- Do you want to go back to Taipei with me?
- Do you want to have another baby with me?

263
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,842
Another baby?

264
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,755
Is it because I have Jimmy?

265
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,057
So you want another one, too?

266
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,393
No...

267
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,831
It's because my parents asked me today

268
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,466
who's Kai's real parent.

269
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,173
Kai was from your sperm...

270
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,510
Therefore, for them,

271
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,011
he's not my real child.

272
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,248
What?

273
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,951
We both consider Kai to be our child.

274
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,987
They don't think that way.

275
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,591
Their point of view is,
it has to be blood relative...

276
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,194
So...

277
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,797
Do you think like that as well?

278
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,399
No, of course not!

279
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,069
But I can't just ignore them,

280
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,939
and this is also something to do
with the Ancestry Book.

281
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,040
Ancestral what?

282
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,575
I don't get it.

283
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,977
Ancestry Book.

284
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,213
Ancestry Book is that
every family has one...

285
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,517
The book has listed every ancestor,
every grandchild's name till nowadays.

286
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,620
It's a record of how our family
has passed generation after generation.

287
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,422
My dad is a single child,

288
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,390
and so am I.

289
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,392
- So...
- Wait a minute.

290
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,131
Are we living in ancient times?

291
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,666
That's a very conventional concept.

292
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,371
Do you think we really can

293
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,473
look after another child?

294
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,408
It's not like you don't know

295
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,545
how much it costs to have another child.

296
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,316
And also I'm still investing in Equal...

297
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,552
I don't really think
I can take on any more stress.

298
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,887
My parents say that
they can help with the money.

299
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,521
Do you think I'm useless?

300
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,561
I just want to know
what are you really thinking about.

301
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,731
If it wasn't about the Ancestry Book...

302
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,601
Do you really want to have another baby?

303
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,306
I wouldn't have considered it
if it was before...

304
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,243
But now...

305
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,879
I'm not so sure about it.

306
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,314
OK, I'll go first,

307
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,749
I don't want another baby.

308
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,920
Except for our financial situation,

309
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,422
I feel happy that I have Kai
and that's enough for me.

310
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,859
And you also have Jimmy.

311
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,639
Baby,

312
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,477
If you really want another baby...

313
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,812
after long and serious considerations.

314
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,052
I'm willing to go with your plan.

315
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,053
But,

316
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,222
not so quick.

317
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,723
We have to plan this properly.

318
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,894
Thank you, darling!

319
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,063
Then can we go back to Taipei together?

320
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,598
Not yet!

321
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,634
But I really don't want us
to live separately

322
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,603
as a family.

323
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,205
You let me stay for a while.

324
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,341
I think I still need more time

325
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,976
to comfort my parents.

326
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,447
It will only be another three more days.

327
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,717
I've already scheduled
some shootings

328
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,218
in a restaurant for next week.

329
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,954
Jerry!

330
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,589
It's a deal then!

331
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,591
I will pick you all up after a week.

332
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,592
Deal.

333
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,729
We should go back now.

334
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,897
I'm afraid Kai might wake up

335
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:05,931
and can't find us.

336
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,366
Yeah.

337
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,003
Let's call a taxi.

338
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,172
Where is this place?

339
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,074
There aren't any taxis around here.

340
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,043
How come there are no taxis
available right now?

341
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,878
Don't forget. This is Hualien.

342
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:20,713
Baby,

343
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,781
Let's hitchhike like we are abroad.

344
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,450
You roll up your pants...

345
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,985
Sure.

346
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,220
So sexy.

347
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,189
Car? Any cars?

348
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,991
There it is! Hello?

349
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,593
Hitchhiking, beautiful?

350
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,395
How come you are here?

351
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,396
Have I told you that I'm coming?

352
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,063
You forgot!

353
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,165
Yeah, I kept calling you along the way
but you didn't answer the phone.

354
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,967
Now I pick you up on the road.

355
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,369
Yep.

356
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,503
Matt is coming to stay with us.

357
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,337
I totally forgot.

358
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,772
Angelina Jerry!

359
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,439
Sorry!

360
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,574
Hop on!

361
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,842
Come on, let's go!

362
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,110
What a coincidence!

363
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,144
Yeah!

364
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,412
Say hi.

365
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,480
Hi, Matt.

366
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,081
- Let's go!
- Hello.

367
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,118
Your clothes look beautiful on you.

368
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,635
Who's that girl?

369
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,003
He's a boy.

370
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,238
Boy?

371
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,808
Taiwanese children are so cool!

372
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,609
Kai!

373
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,610
We can go to night markets

374
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,911
to perform Drag Queen

375
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,446
to make pocket money for ourselves!

376
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,015
Jimmy, go pack up your luggage.

377
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,550
We are going back to Taipei.

378
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,951
No way!

379
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,421
I can't make any pocket money
if I go back now!

380
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:35,954
Hurry up!

381
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:36,889
Look at him!

382
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,424
- Go.
- He's popular!

383
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,558
Just to let you know that

384
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,161
He's not good with hot weather,
and will get rashes easily,

385
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,763
so don't let him put on too many clothes.

386
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,532
And he also needs to
cuddle this to sleep.

387
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,666
A must-hug kitty at night.

388
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,567
And then,

389
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,102
also only give it to him before bedtime.

390
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:50,969
Don't give it to him during the day.

391
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,938
- OK.
- Also there's a trick to play,

392
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,141
you need to
bang the kitty's tail like this.

393
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,242
Bang, bang, bang!

394
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,078
Yes, and this...

395
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,480
This is his favorite snack.

396
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,050
But you can only give him one at a time.

397
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,285
I only give him the snack

398
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,553
when I have to bribe him.

399
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,887
So if you give it to him all the time,
it wouldn't work,

400
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,421
you know?

401
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,756
No problem.

402
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,324
OK, do you remember
what to do with this kitty?

403
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,460
- Yes, I do.
- Just play bang bang with him before bed.

404
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,662
You've already explained that,
Mommy!

405
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,397
Children are in good hands with Jerry.

406
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,698
You don't have to be so anxious.

407
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,033
Yeah, don't worry!

408
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,000
Matt has Kai in company.

409
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,535
He will be fine.

410
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,205
OK.

411
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,906
We just hope to give him

412
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,141
something different in life

413
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,977
to see if his gender identity
is influenced

414
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,646
by us in our family.

415
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,081
We just hope when he grows up,

416
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,616
life won't be too harsh for him...

417
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:39,785
Don't worry.

418
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,121
You can rely on me, OK?

419
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,322
Thank you.

420
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,224
Thank you.

421
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:46,758
Oh,

422
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,760
Come over here...

423
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:51,830
My parents knew...

424
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,999
Kai was not my biological son,

425
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,267
and want me to make another one.

426
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,101
What do you suggest?

427
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,373
I suggest whilst Matt is in your house,

428
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,541
you should fully experience...

429
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,076
what is it like
to become a father of two.

430
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,979
After that, you can make a decision
if you want another one or not.

431
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:07,980
Yeah.

432
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,350
See?

433
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,518
Don't throw it like that!

434
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,952
- No, don't do that, Kai!
- Matt!

435
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,554
What are you two doing, Kai?

436
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,121
Enough!

437
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:16,889
Don't do that!

438
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,892
I'm going to Taipei right now!

439
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,693
Wait,

440
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:22,427
Wait, listen....

441
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,363
Listen up, Matt,

442
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,631
We're heading back to Taipei now.

443
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,900
Listen to Kai's Dad, OK?

444
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,500
Understand?

445
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,067
Behave yourself, OK?

446
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,736
OK, I know.

447
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,439
OK, please take good care of them.

448
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,808
Alright, be sure to
take good care of them.

449
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:37,743
OK.

450
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:40,879
Look at them!

451
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,848
Ok, let me handle this.

452
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,083
Take care.

453
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:45,984
- Bye.
- Bye.

454
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:46,652
Bye bye.

455
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,553
The suitcase is here.

456
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,086
OK.

457
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,688
Come here.

458
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,741
Are you both hungry?

459
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,077
Yesterday that restaurant
was really good, Sir.

460
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,178
All of us were lined up like crazy.

461
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,213
Superb tastes.

462
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,581
Yeah, and it doesn't cost much.

463
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,049
So proud of Hualien!

464
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,816
Stop, stop!

465
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,117
Hey, stop right here!

466
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,386
Do you know it's dangerous
to ride like this?

467
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,655
I'm sorry, because it's quite close to

468
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,523
my house, just over there.

469
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,591
Sorry.

470
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,125
Alright, it's OK.

471
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:27,859
Not alright, Sir.

472
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,294
Your ID card?

473
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,230
Papa.

474
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,231
It's OK, Kai.

475
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,432
Wait for a second.

476
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,700
Where's their mom?

477
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,540
He's single, Sir.

478
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,775
But the kid just called him Papa.

479
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,912
Are you their father?

480
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,451
So the kid in the front seat is...

481
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,652
That's right. I'm his dad,

482
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,320
but he wasn't born to me.

483
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:56,922
Yep.

484
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,157
And the kid at the back,

485
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,792
he's my friend's son.

486
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,661
He came to stay with us in Hualien.

487
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,134
Don't give two kids a ride
at the same time again.

488
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,869
OK, I'm sorry.

489
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,805
It's not easy to be a dad.

490
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,373
All good.

491
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,174
Thank you.

492
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,080
Kai?

493
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,181
Matt?

494
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,651
Kai?

495
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,920
Kai?

496
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,467
He's awake.

497
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,236
Do you feel like vomiting?

498
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,105
I think we should
take him to a hospital?

499
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:47,973
- Keep your voice down.
- Mom...

500
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,541
What happened?

501
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,145
I remember I fell off my motorbike...

502
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,014
The police brought you home.

503
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,015
The doctor just left.

504
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,251
The doctor said you had some injuries
but nothing serious...

505
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,218
But we still have to keep an eye on you.

506
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,553
In case you have had any concussions.

507
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,323
Don't move, stay in bed!

508
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,858
Where are Kai and Matt?

509
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,560
They are watching TV in the living room.

510
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,895
Don't worry, they're fine.

511
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:10,929
No worries.

512
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,075
You've told Damian?

513
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,976
Yeah, we must to.

514
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,314
Now you two can leave.

515
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,716
I will talk to him.

516
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,951
Let us know if you need anything, OK?

517
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,252
Listen,

518
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,420
Have a good rest
after the phone call OK?

519
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,655
Yeah.

520
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,800
Are you OK?

521
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,236
I'm OK, just a bit dizzy.

522
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,204
Dizzy?

523
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,806
Could it be a concussion?

524
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,041
The doctor just came,

525
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,676
and said to watch over me
for the next few days.

526
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,975
I think I should come this evening
and bring you home.

527
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,848
No. Just go
and take care of your business.

528
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,316
I'm fine, really.

529
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,519
You make me even more worried now.

530
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,920
And be good.

531
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,288
Just listen to me, OK?

532
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,690
Don't make me worry about you.

533
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,958
But at this moment,

534
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,993
it's best not to move around.

535
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,995
Besides, my parents are here.

536
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,181
No need to worry.

537
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:19,524
See who's here?

538
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:20,999
Jerry.

539
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,367
My friend's here.

540
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,435
I'll talk to you later.

541
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,870
What friend?

542
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,871
Anyways.

543
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,305
You don't have to come.

544
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,613
How come you are here?

545
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:35,614
Please sit, Kao.

546
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,616
Thank you, Mr. Pan.

547
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,684
I just passed your restaurant,

548
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,186
and found out it was closed.

549
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,155
So I ask the lady next door,

550
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,756
She said the boss' son
had a car accident.

551
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,391
I've rushed to
get here for this reason.

552
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,628
That's ridiculous.

553
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,062
You still haven't changed, Kao.

554
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,064
Still good-looking like in high school.

555
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,332
You haven't changed at all.

556
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,334
Thank you, Mrs. Pan.

557
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,502
OK, let's go.

558
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,737
I'll let you two talk.

559
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,471
OK.

560
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,673
Stay here for dinner, Kao.

561
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,008
OK.

562
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,209
You chat.

563
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,583
Are you really OK?

564
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,486
I'm alright.

565
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,523
Forgot about this,

566
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,525
I brought your favorite...

567
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,228
Mille crepe cake.

568
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,566
Let's check, is it at the crossroads?

569
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,600
A bit further ahead.

570
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,069
- Saw it.
- Guang Fu Street.

571
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,172
OK, turn right here.

572
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,816
Arrived.

573
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,351
Are you sure you don't want me
to come with you?

574
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,953
No, I'll be fine.

575
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,822
OK, I'll go do some shopping,

576
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,923
and then come back to pick you up.

577
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,893
If you feel any discomfort at work,

578
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,027
remember to call me

579
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,462
anytime.

580
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,731
Thank you, Kao.

581
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:00,999
No worries.

582
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,908
I'm getting out now.

583
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:10,909
OK.

584
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,411
Good luck.

585
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,986
Are you feeling any better?

586
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,891
Why are you outside?

587
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:26,758
Yeah.

588
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,893
Working.

589
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,029
Why don't you rest at home?

590
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,797
I've already scheduled it
with the restaurant,

591
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,566
and I'm fine really.

592
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,634
Jerry!

593
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,802
You forgot your stuff.

594
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:38,937
You're way too careless.

595
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:39,971
Who's that?

596
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:41,873
My high school classmate.

597
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,475
He fetched me here.

598
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,978
So, when can I come and bring you home?

599
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,015
If every time you call just to ask me

600
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:50,749
this question,

601
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,284
then don't bother calling again!

602
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,919
I'm busy, I got work to do.

603
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,220
That's it.

604
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,893
Hung up on me again.

605
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,546
Put this on.

606
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,647
Thank you.

607
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,725
Play with me, Papa!

608
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,162
Come here, Kai.

609
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,430
Papa has a question to ask,

610
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,599
Do you think you look like me,

611
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,434
or you look like Daddy?

612
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,735
Papa.

613
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,804
Why?

614
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,806
It's because you are younger,

615
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,208
so you and I look alike.

616
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,112
You're such a sweet talker!

617
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,114
So...

618
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,149
What do you think if you have
another baby sister or brother

619
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,517
to play with you?

620
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,187
You can ask Matt's Moms

621
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,355
to "rent" Matt for a year,

622
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,991
just like Daddy rents a car.

623
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,400
Come play with me, Kai!

624
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,641
Here!

625
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,142
You're so childish.

626
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,644
What are you thinking, huh?

627
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,946
Nothing.

628
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,320
Can you keep us company for a while?

629
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,122
I just want them to play a bit longer,

630
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,657
so they can sleep better at night.

631
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,491
Sure, no problem.

632
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,992
I'm on leave today,

633
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,494
and have nothing to do.

634
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,563
I'll leave it to you then.

635
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,133
They like to play Hawks Catch Chickens.

636
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,406
Hawks Catch Chickens?

637
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,176
I'm a master of this game!

638
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,577
Let me do this.

639
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:00,645
Kai, Matt!

640
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,913
Don't let me catch you!

641
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,181
I'm coming!

642
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,249
Coming right away!

643
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,086
How come you're so good at hiding?

644
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,355
I jump!

645
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,757
Don't let me catch you!

646
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,225
A chick is left alone.

647
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,960
All alone.

648
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,095
I caught you!

649
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,797
What to do next?

650
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,066
I'm going to catch another one!

651
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,368
Hurry up! Almost got you!

652
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,204
Kai, Matt.

653
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,605
We're home.

654
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,945
Kao.

655
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,184
Thank you for taking them out
and playing with them today.

656
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,219
Sorry to hold you up for so long.

657
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,287
You're tired, aren't you?

658
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,456
I'm alright.

659
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,824
I'd never thought that

660
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,293
I can spend all day with children.

661
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,096
Will you not pick up my call next time?

662
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:53,765
I will block your number

663
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,333
as soon as you get out of the car.

664
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,916
Jerry...

665
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,052
- I...
- Kai, Matt.

666
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:14,853
Kai, Matt.

667
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,387
Wake up.

668
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,029
You're so tired. We're home now.

669
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,874
Let me show you how to do this.

670
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,075
Kai, do you wanna give it a try?

671
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,010
See?

672
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,579
Got it.

673
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,081
He got a turtle.

674
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,158
Come on.

675
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,560
Clap!

676
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,495
Awesome!

677
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,231
You're good!

678
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,994
Jerry!

679
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,529
You forgot your stuff.

680
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,231
You're way too careless.
