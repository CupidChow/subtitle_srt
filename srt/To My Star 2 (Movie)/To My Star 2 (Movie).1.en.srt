00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:40,780
(To My Star 2)

2
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:23,713
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yes.

3
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:29,333
What are you doing?

4
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:32,413
It smells.

5
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:35,853
Please stop it.

6
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:38,643
Can you stop working and play with me?

7
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:40,033
One second.

8
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,023
I'm almost done.

9
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:46,183
Stop working and play with me.

10
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:49,023
Give me one second. I'll finish it soon.

11
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:50,943
Let's play!

12
00:02:58,073 --> 00:02:59,753
Okay.

13
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:00,783
I'll stop working now.

14
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:02,703
One more time.

15
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,563
- Again?
- Yes.

16
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:10,833
I love you.

17
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,993
You are good at it!

18
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,953
You have to express it a lot, okay?

19
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:20,653
Look at your cheeks.

20
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:22,713
You are so cute!

21
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:24,763
Let me bite you just once.

22
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:31,593
Shit, so where the heck are you now?

23
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:36,553
I became like this now because of you. Do you really want to die?

24
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:38,613
Come here right now.

25
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,789
Let's talk in person.

26
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,729
I said, let's talk in person.

27
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,889
Let's talk in person, for heaven's sake!

28
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,019
Cut! Okay!

29
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,239
Director said cut, okay!

30
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,019
Seo Joon!

31
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,469
Seo Joon.

32
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:59,549
We'll take another bust shot and a close-up shot to finish it.

33
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,039
- That...
- What are you waiting for? Let's take the bust shot!

34
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,599
We'll take another bust shot in the same placement!

35
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,579
Excuse me, Assistant Director. I know you are busy.

36
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:14,599
Yes?

37
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,219
If it gets delayed every time, it affects our schedule.

38
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:20,059
He has an ad shooting tomorrow as well.

39
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:24,549
I mean, we also worked overnight for days.

40
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:29,339
We also want to finish shooting this as soon as possible.

41
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,979
Move that more carefully!

42
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,179
I know that well as well. But, Assistant Director—

43
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:38,659
- Hello!
- Hello!

44
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,259
You are here! Hello!

45
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,409
Hello.

46
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:43,839
Bro! How have you been?

47
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,699
- Jae Won, did you just arrive?
- Yes.

48
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,239
- It's very cold, isn't it?
- I'm okay.

49
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,249
I'm happy to see another worker come.

50
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,409
Excuse me?

51
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,839
It means I love you.

52
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,539
Hello.

53
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,089
Bro, why are you acting like this? It's not like you.

54
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:05,889
I repeated that short line more than twenty times.

55
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,259
I mean, but still, if you leave like this—

56
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:11,029
Open the door.

57
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,579
Open the car door, now.

58
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:19,139
Mr. Actor!

59
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,539
Please don't leave like this, and let's talk first.

60
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,189
How many hours did you sleep?

61
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,209
Pardon?

62
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,099
I'm so sorry.

63
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:29,659
I'm asking you how many hours you slept.

64
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:33,319
In times like this, just say "That damn Kang Seo Joon bastard."

65
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,069
And take off tomorrow's shooting and rest.

66
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,889
I think we have to do another 50 shoots.

67
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,089
But we can't do it like this, right?

68
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,439
So why don't you go and say "Kang Seo Joon bastard"?

69
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,729
Fighting!

70
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:04,229
Bro, I didn't know you had such an idea.

71
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,979
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,219
What was tomorrow's schedule?

73
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:09,419
Tomorrow's schedule.

74
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,899
Originally, this drama shoot was in the morning, and a paper ad shoot for Estee Jewelry in the afternoon.

75
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:18,779
I was worried that I had to say we'll be late for the ad shoot because of this drama.

76
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,729
- Tell this to CEO Kim that he should get ready for a big penalty fee for tomorrow's thing.
- I'm sorry?

77
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:25,899
Also, tell him that from today on, I'm on strike.

78
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,669
Why?

79
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,879
CEO Kim didn't keep his promise first.

80
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,919
I definitely told him to find him by today.

81
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,989
Wait. Don't hang up yet, Honey.

82
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:53,729
Honey. I mean, what am I supposed to call you besides Honey?

83
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,119
CEO, you haven't found the person yet, have you?
(Manager Baek)

84
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,439
H-Hello?

85
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,989
Hyung said he wouldn't go to the drama or the ad shooting tomorrow.
(Manager Baek)

86
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:03,009
We are on the way home after today's shooting.
(Manager Baek)

87
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,039
Am I a private detective? Why do I have to find someone who's disappeared?
(TB)

88
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,579
Ask him. Am I a private detective?

89
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:18,859
Did he give me money or what? Why the heck is he threatening me!

90
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:20,689
He's working with a legitimate contract. Did he lose his mind?

91
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,669
- The more I think about it, and it makes me angrier.
- CEO, one second, please.

92
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:25,129
Do I have to care about my actor's dating life?

93
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:28,249
Should I even care about the end of a relationship?

94
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:31,379
That drama director is a slow worker, but he's good at it!

95
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,429
Bro! Are you crazy?!

96
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:36,799
What? What's going on?

97
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:39,289
What did he do now?

98
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:42,399
- What is it!
- CEO, the thing is...

99
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:46,189
What's going on? Tell me!

100
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:48,069
He keeps trying to jump out of the moving van's door.

101
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,689
Tell him I'm going first. See you in Heaven.

102
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:51,639
- Bro, are you crazy?! Stop it!
- He's trying to jump out?

103
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,899
What on earth are you saying!

104
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:55,369
- Ho Min!
- Bro, stop it!

105
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:57,369
- I told you. See you in Heaven.
- Ho Min, say something!

106
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:58,799
- Let me go.
- Bro!

107
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,169
- Ho Min?
- Bro, please!

108
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,859
Oh, wow! It's Kang Seo Joon!

109
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:03,129
- Seo Joon!
- Are you listening to me?

110
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:04,929
Yes, I'm Kang Seo Joon.

111
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:06,439
I don't know what to do now.

112
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:09,149
It's a bit hot in here. It's hot.

113
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,529
You're so handsome! I'm your fan!

114
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,639
Threaten him that I'll jump off or I'm really going to jump off.

115
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,449
Many people are taking pictures of me outside right now.

116
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,259
CEO, he says he'll really jump off if you don't find him by tomorrow.

117
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,909
Okay.

118
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,209
I'll find him by tomorrow, no matter what.

119
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:31,709
♪ I live because I can't die... ♪

120
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,979
I'll talk to you later.

121
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,139
- Bro, stop it!
- Have a safe drive.

122
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:40,999
Also, please love the show "When a Gangster Loves."

123
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:46,579
I'm not a real gangster.

124
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:51,999
I have lived obediently lately

125
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,689
doesn't mean you don't have to listen to what I'm saying.

126
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:13,699
You came early.

127
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,149
What? Why are you at home?

128
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,639
It's break time, so I came for a second.

129
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,779
You came home because you missed me, right? You couldn't wait even for a bit.

130
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:23,739
I came because I remembered that we didn't throw out the trash.

131
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:26,039
It's the day to take it out.

132
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,479
You could do that at night. You can't even lie that well, Han Ji Woo.

133
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,849
I made a frittata for you.

134
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:34,819
So why don't you go inside and eat that before it gets cold?

135
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:35,989
Really?

136
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:36,869
I'll be back.

137
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,929
But can you not go to work today?

138
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:43,089
Stop right there. You worked overnight.

139
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:44,769
Eat what I made and have some sleep.

140
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,139
Come back home soon.

141
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,809
Throw that out soon and run back home!

142
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:23,299
The phone is turned off. After the beep, it'll connect to the voice mail.

143
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:26,049
You'll be charged with a call charge.

144
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:41,457
(A Definite Errand Center)

145
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:45,617
Why are you rushing so much? If that's the case, you should ask a different place.

146
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:58,619
Yes, it's Kim Pil Hyun from TB Entertainment.

147
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:01,969
Hello, I'm Kim Hyung Gi.

148
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:35,279
Are you going to work already?

149
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,499
Wake up now. You have to go.

150
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:42,179
Here.

151
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:46,309
Come over here.

152
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,389
Use it carefully today as well.

153
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,499
I said it's okay now.

154
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:59,029
It's mine as well.

155
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:00,939
So be careful.

156
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,459
All right.

157
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,779
Here.

158
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,359
Wait.

159
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:18,609
I'll go get it since you're tired.

160
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,179
You woke up early.

161
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,659
Yes.

162
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,069
Yes, stay like that right now!

163
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,749
Okay!

164
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:37,289
Hold your arm up to show the ring and bracelet.

165
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,639
Yes! It's great!

166
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:42,459
That's right, like that!

167
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,039
Your smile is good, too. You're so handsome!

168
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,959
Should I ditch the shoot and go out?

169
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,609
- What should I do?
- Where's the jacket?
- It's inside.

170
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,759
Message arrived!

171
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,889
Come to the CEO's room after the shooting. I found him.

172
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:02,559
Just tell me right now.

173
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:19,575
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:22,875
It's okay. I dropped it on my own.

175
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,485
No, it looks like it's your personal stuff. I'll pay you back.

176
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,955
Ho Min, give me my wallet.

177
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,045
Or if you give me your business card, I'll—

178
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,865
It really doesn't matter.

179
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:36,255
It's okay.

180
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:40,695
As you know, I'm Kang Seo Joon. So it might be an issue in the future.

181
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:44,825
It was not that expensive.

182
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:50,025
If you give me that much, it'll be free money that'll make me happy for a month.

183
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:52,885
But I don't like free money.

184
00:13:57,065 --> 00:14:02,585
But instead, please do a great job on today's shoot.

185
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:04,925
(Estee Design Team Leader: Jeong Seong Yoon)

186
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:06,505
Okay.

187
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:15,905
(My Honey♥)

188
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:20,165
The person you're trying to reach is not available at the moment.

189
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:21,225
(My Honey♥)

190
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:24,405
Why did you want to see me in person when you could've just texted me?

191
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,595
And you don't even care about me and just play games.

192
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:33,165
There's nothing better than this when you're stressed out. It's all because of someone.

193
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,755
- The person you're trying to reach is not available at the moment.
- My god!

194
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,295
Did you fight with your partner?

195
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:41,385
It's hard to get in touch with them. My Honey's busy.

196
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:44,919
I'll get to the point.

197
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,069
But why were you making a fuss to find him by tomorrow?

198
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:53,559
Suddenly, I didn't want to live anymore. It hit my limit.

199
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,719
Did you really find him?

200
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:59,199
I got a call from Kim Hyung Gi.

201
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,299
Kim Hyung Gi? Why?

202
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:03,959
He has money to pay back to you.

203
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,489
I think Han Ji Woo told him to pay you back directly from now on.

204
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,329
So they kept in touch until now?

205
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:12,419
I don't know! How am I supposed to know that?

206
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,020
Anyway, Kim Hyung Gi said he didn't know, either.

207
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,100
But I begged that bastard who I don't want to see to find out about this.

208
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,089
Look over here.

209
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:28,869
(A restaurant in Haseong? Ti Aspetto!!)

210
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:31,289
Ti Aspetto.

211
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,849
Give me the car key.

212
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,949
Do you have to go there?

213
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:38,879
Give it to me, now.

214
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:41,559
Just give him the car key.

215
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,819
Tell them he can't go to tomorrow's shoot as well.

216
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:49,659
Really?

217
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:52,749
That site has a lot of issues.

218
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:55,739
The one on the top should blow out the bubble.

219
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,489
(401m | Seo Joon's performance | 9:55 arrival | Arriving at Haseong Destination)

220
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:08,679
He moved away so far.

221
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,589
It just feels like he's still at the Buam house.

222
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:20,020
What nonsense is that? We sold that house a long time ago!

223
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,970
Why would Han Ji Woo still be there?

224
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:27,069
For a month after Ji Woo left,

225
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,669
I thought he would come back.

226
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:34,939
Ji Woo.

227
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,620
(Let's end it here.)

228
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,689
The phone is turned off. After the beep—

229
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:59,219
For two months, I worried that he got a terminal disease.

230
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,989
Han Ji Woo!

231
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,229
And for months after that.

232
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,580
He's such a bad person!

233
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,689
Yes, he is.

234
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:19,089
He just left a note and left.

235
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,009
Do you think that makes sense, Ho Min?

236
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:28,949
What? Are you crying?

237
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,609
You're crying!

238
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:34,909
I was angry that he had just left a note and left me.

239
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:37,359
People say that time is medicine.

240
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:47,955
1 km from here is the destination.

241
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:50,535
Now, I want to ask him.

242
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:52,165
What did I do so wrong?

243
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:54,335
(Dacham Village | the Village of Truth)

244
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:58,725
I think that way so I can live.

245
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,915
Hey! Who is it over there?

246
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:54,965
Who are you? Why are you smelling someone else's restaurant when you are not a dog?

247
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:57,385
Hello, I...

248
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:01,485
I think I saw you somewhere a lot!

249
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:04,355
I'm Kang Seo Joon.

250
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:07,165
Recently, I was in a show riding a motorcycle—

251
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:09,955
- That actor!
- Yes.

252
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:14,785
It's good to meet you. But why did you come this far from Seoul?

253
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:19,155
Sir, I have something to ask you.

254
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:25,395
I'm the head of this village, but he's not that sociable.

255
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:26,810
And his restaurant business is not going well.

256
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,700
I don't even understand what his menu says!

257
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:31,915
Nobody's going to his restaurant!

258
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:13,845
Every word I prepared for a year disappeared as if it was a lie.

259
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:15,875
Isn't that a car that we've never seen?

260
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,295
That's right. I wonder if someone came.

261
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:21,095
I've never seen a car like that before.

262
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:28,265
Dad! Who is he?

263
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:35,625
Who are you? Why are you calling him dad?

264
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,375
Are you really his daughter?

265
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,855
Mister, who are you?

266
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:40,935
Mister...

267
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:44,695
We live next door. But we are friends with Han Ji Woo.

268
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,575
We just stay close to each other.

269
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:48,815
You don't have to explain it to him.

270
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,485
I think I can't come over tonight.

271
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,335
You two should hang out without me.

272
00:20:57,595 --> 00:20:59,295
Okay.

273
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:05,165
You shouldn't call anybody a dad.

274
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:07,025
Somebody can be shocked when they hear it.

275
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:08,435
I don't have a dad.

276
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,195
Also, we have the same last name.

277
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:13,085
Han Yoo Ha, stop it!

278
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,225
It's nice meeting you.

279
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:17,655
I'm leaving.

280
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:37,815
It's cold. Let's go inside.

281
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,085
Let's eat first and talk. I didn't eat anything today.

282
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:41,275
Don't do this.

283
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:49,155
We are not in any relationship to do so.

284
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,875
We are not in any relationship to do so?

285
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,935
Who says?

286
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:59,790
You left me by leaving a note.

287
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:03,255
But how can you decide that we are not in any relationship to do so?

288
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:11,256
Dad had a strange expression on his face.

289
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:13,966
Come on. I told you not to call him "dad."

290
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:17,556
I can't find anyone better than him. That's why.

291
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:22,146
Seriously, who do you take after, huh?

292
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:27,766
But it's fascinating. I wonder how they know each other.

293
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:30,396
How do you know him? You said you're not classmates.

294
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:34,746
Don't you know top star Kang Seo Joon? One of his lines is...

295
00:22:34,746 --> 00:22:38,326
"If you struggle, I'll be there."

296
00:22:38,326 --> 00:22:41,296
Don't you know this?

297
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:46,526
If there was someone like him among our countryside neighborhood...

298
00:22:46,526 --> 00:22:49,396
It would've been crazy!

299
00:22:49,396 --> 00:22:52,136
I would've just...

300
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:55,486
I would've just, you know?

301
00:22:55,486 --> 00:23:00,056
I'm saying it would've been something to boast about all over town, you know.

302
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:02,266
Eat this.

303
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,970
You are living very well.

304
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,890
If you have something to say, say it quickly and go.

305
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,560
How can you do this to me?

306
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,390
How can you just disappear after leaving a note saying, "Let's end it here?"

307
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,510
It was even on my birthday.

308
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,360
Do you know how frustrated I was all this time?

309
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,110
I almost reported you missing.

310
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,740
And in the house we moved into because of you,

311
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,460
- without you, alone for a year—
- So...

312
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,120
do you want to hear an apology from me?

313
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,550
You could be mindful of proper manners with me, at the least.

314
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,080
I don't think I did anything wrong to you so as to be treated by you like this.

315
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,770
You woke me up in the early morning hours because you came home, then.

316
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,900
Once you start shooting a drama,

317
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,500
you become overly sensitive to everything from your food to your sleeping habits.

318
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,970
We can't even take a walk outside just because you're a celebrity.

319
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,050
I don't like that, either.

320
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,190
If you ever got a blemish on your face, it was such a hassle for me to squeeze it out.

321
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,880
Especially...

322
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:58,190
the sound of you grinding your teeth in your sleep. That was unbearable.

323
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,640
Got it? Had I kindly written down all the reasons,

324
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,640
I guess you wouldn't have come looking for me.

325
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,700
I didn't learn manners. So I made a mistake.

326
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:13,422
I'm sorry.

327
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,680
You sure hit a blow.

328
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,230
As if you were all prepared.

329
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,284
So did you come this far because you didn't like all those things?

330
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:27,394
Don't be mistaken.

331
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:30,527
I just returned.

332
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,810
Fine.

333
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,930
I'm glad you came back.

334
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,320
What's this?

335
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,330
What about it?

336
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,820
It's mine. Why didn't you toss it?

337
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,620
Why should I toss it?

338
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,040
You don't care, do you?

339
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,610
That's right. Then you don't care if it's gone. Right?

340
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,180
I'll take it.

341
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,880
Since it was mine, to begin with.

342
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,380
All right.

343
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
How about your ring?

344
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,480
Did you throw it away?

345
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,740
Yeah.

346
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,440
Do you know how much...

347
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,290
You should've sold it. Why throw it away?

348
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,420
Where did you toss it?

349
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,100
In the mountain.

350
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,210
♫ Winter wind, it blows across my face ♫

351
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,050
♫ And I'm so lonely ♫

352
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,520
♫ It's been this way for an eternity ♫

353
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,990
♫ You see ♫

354
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,930
Oh, this restaurant?

355
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,200
They open pretty early every morning.

356
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,350
Hey, good morning!

357
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,320
You should've told me sooner if you had such a great friend like him.

358
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,360
Well, he's not so well-mannered...

359
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,310
- Village Chief, what would you like to eat?
- Oh, yes...

360
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,640
But I have no idea what this is talking about.

361
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,560
I need something for my hangover.

362
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,480
That sounds great. Something for a hangover.

363
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,090
We drank some makgeolli last night.
(T/N: Raw rice wine)

364
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,970
I was starving last night, and you gave me some makgeolli and pancakes.

365
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,800
See, see, see? There are reasons why some people succeed.

366
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,270
- You have a great personality.
- Gosh.

367
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,920
I had so much fun last night, thanks to you.

368
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,630
I feel so refreshed after going to the spa this morning, too.

369
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,750
I thought you were friends. Why did you let him go in the middle of the night?

370
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,210
Do you know how far Seoul is from here?

371
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,340
What are you doing? Hangover soup.

372
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,020
Make it two hangover soups.

373
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,320
- It was fun last night, huh?
- I had so much fun.

374
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:37,670
Wow, it must be ready.

375
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,090
I smell it. I smell it.

376
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,760
Let's see.

377
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,050
It's called Goulash. It's spicy Hungarian stew. It's soup.

378
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,520
I don't see oysters.
(Sounds like Goulash in Korean)

379
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,490
- Oh, there are no oysters. There's beef, onions, wine—
- Wine?

380
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,580
I told you I want something to relieve my hangover.

381
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,980
Chief, I've had this before. It's similar to our hangover soup. It's good.

382
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,455
Try it.

383
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:02,710
And is there anything else you want?

384
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,295
Order whatever you want. I'm indebted to you, so I'll pay you back.

385
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:08,210
Gosh! No, no, it's okay.

386
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,310
Shall I try it then?

387
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,710
It's delicious. How neat.

388
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,110
Right? It's refreshing, isn't it? He's not all that friendly, but

389
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,960
he's a good cook. Please come here often.

390
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,630
All right. All right. Since he's our top star Seo Joon's friend.

391
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,610
Let's eat.

392
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,500
What are you doing? Was it for free?

393
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,390
I was exhausted yesterday after my shoot,

394
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,990
so I couldn't drive all night to go home.

395
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,900
No matter how much you hate me, you wouldn't want me to get into an accident.

396
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,030
How about you change the name of your restaurant?

397
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,730
I don't think anyone would know what it's saying.

398
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,640
- My top star, thank you for the meal.
- Gosh...

399
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,540
I'm the one who enjoyed the meal, thanks to you. You liked it, right?

400
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,570
We really broke up now.

401
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,080
Hi!

402
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,550
Han Yoo Ha.

403
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,430
- How was school?
- Good.

404
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,740
By chance, did you sell goulash today?

405
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,940
Yeah. How did you know?

406
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,890
There's a rumor all over the place. That you served him something weird without oysters.

407
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,230
Really?

408
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,840
But he said it was good.

409
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,630
Chief said that Kang Seo Joon was here

410
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:38,340
and the villagers were going crazy asking if it was true.

411
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,540
She scared me. The granny is back.

412
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,870
It's the end of the world.

413
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,800
Everyone is busy taking care of their own stuff.

414
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,390
No one cares...

415
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,540
And no one is around here.

416
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,330
A phone call?

417
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,740
Ti Aspetto.

418
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,550
It's me.

419
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,880
I didn't have a chance to ask you this because I was so stunned.

420
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,640
Do you still stay in touch with Kim Hyung Ki?

421
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,350
Never mind.

422
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,350
I guess it's none of my business. Forget it.

423
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,050
We broke up, you know.

424
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,040
So take all your things with you.

425
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,070
So I don't see any trace of you.

426
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,180
Throw it away.

427
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,780
I'm Kang Seo Joon.

428
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,650
What if someone sees me throwing out my ex-boyfriend's things?

429
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,550
- Take them as soon as you can.
- I don't care what you do.

430
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,680
It's me. Hurry up and take it.

431
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,560
Oh, thank you! Goodbye!

432
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,510
Take it. You have so many things, now that I've packed them up.

433
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,760
Stop...

434
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,150
Stop it already!

435
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,480
Please don't be so clingy.

436
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,770
Don't you have a pride?

437
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,540
Cut! Okay!

438
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,540
Take them right now.

439
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,290
I heard he kept calling you.

440
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,270
I don't keep secrets from my mom.

441
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,720
Did something happen in Seoul?

442
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,230
The fact that you came here so suddenly means...

443
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,770
Nothing.

444
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,730
It's nothing.

445
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,320
Dad, you tend to avoid things.

446
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,500
You little thing. You're such a know-it-all!

447
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,520
Come on.

448
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,820
The village elders were so excited, saying a top star had stopped by.

449
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,930
It could be a good thing, you know.

450
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,890
They might be nicer to you, thanks to the top star.

451
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,730
Our friend Seo Joon...

452
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,800
said to have you come to Seoul to take care of things.

453
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,100
I guess he couldn't reach you?

454
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,000
I've never seen you answer satisfactorily!

455
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,090
Gosh, so frustrating. So frustrating.

456
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,670
You see that? I'm right.

457
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,380
- I'm sure he borrowed money from that celebrity.
- Don't make excuses

458
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,440
go to Seoul tomorrow. Got it?

459
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,870
Cut, okay!

460
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,470
Let's do the next setting.

461
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,030
Have some water.

462
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,930
You worked so hard.

463
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,040
Really, thank you so much.

464
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,830
I'll change my clothes. You can go out first.

465
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,960
Let's go outside.

466
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,930
Let's go.

467
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,320
Since you are here, why don't you watch my shoot, too?

468
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,910
It's okay. I should go.

469
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,810
It'll be my time to express my charm.

470
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,700
I see you all the time at home.

471
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,970
That's true.

472
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,780
But...

473
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,000
There's nobody here. Shall we kiss just once?

474
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,650
Stop it.

475
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,720
Wait, be quiet.

476
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,010
We can do it quietly.

477
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,520
Come over here!

478
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,560
There's a surveillance camera here. This is dangerous.

479
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,950
I'm fine with it.

480
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,830
I don't have any energy right now.

481
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,690
Hurry up.

482
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,110
And give me some energy.

483
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,780
Can't we do this at home?

484
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,900
You must be tired.

485
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,970
But where's Ho Min?

486
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,550
He went to abduct someone.

487
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,500
I wasn't going to tell you.

488
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,870
I'm sorry.

489
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,790
It's okay.

490
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:26,060
I was going to wire transfer it, but I wanted to apologize for the last time as well.

491
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,740
Don't ever do that again.

492
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,790
But did everyone come out just to receive this?

493
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:45,070
I thought it would be good enough for me to apologize to Han Ji Woo and Kang Seo Joon.

494
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,590
We came out instead of Seo Joon!

495
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,130
I don't know if you know about this.

496
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,810
But Ji Woo and Seo Joon are not in a relationship to be here together.

497
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:02,740
By the way, Ji Woo, how can you cut off all contact and leave so far away?

498
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,630
Do you know how hard it was for me to find you?

499
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,350
It's just because...

500
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,960
that was where I used to live when my parents were alive.

501
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,250
How's your restaurant?

502
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,610
What are you going to do now?

503
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,750
I'm now back to the rich life.

504
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,830
I should enjoy it.

505
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,980
You are making us, non-rich people, feel bad.

506
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:37,840
I'll go back to Italy and try new things while resting.

507
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:49,850
I'll get going. We are not in a relationship to chat about our lives.

508
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,590
I'll get going.

509
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,480
Finally, I'm seeing your face. I was wondering about you.

510
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,980
You two can go, right? I have work to do.

511
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,390
I can go by myself to pick up my stuff.

512
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,650
Bro told me a strange man shouldn't go into his place when he's not at home.

513
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,050
So he told me to bring you to him first.

514
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,350
- Team Leader, I wore it like you today.
- What?

515
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,650
Setting up some sets and wearing them. I think it's a great idea.

516
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,180
Right? It saves you time and is convenient.

517
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,270
Exactly.

518
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,070
I'm going to buy a couple of good clothes and wear them only.

519
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,890
We'll start shooting in five minutes. Get ready, please!

520
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,000
Team Leader.

521
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,270
Come inside.

522
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,800
- Ho Min!
- Excuse me one second.

523
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,380
Ji Woo.

524
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,300
Do you know each other?

525
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,770
Yes.

526
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,130
Since when?

527
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,220
Didn't you come from America? That's what I heard.

528
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,890
I studied abroad in America.

529
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,310
I'll wait until you finish.

530
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,970
You said let's go together.

531
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:15,835
You've been well, right?

532
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:21,020
I heard about you from Da Kyeong sometimes.

533
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,635
I still stay in touch with Da Kyeong.

534
00:42:25,995 --> 00:42:31,665
I don't know if you were curious, but I told her not to tell you about me.

535
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:35,610
It's not like we broke up peacefully or anything.

536
00:42:40,195 --> 00:42:43,930
You don't speak in dialect anymore.

537
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:52,385
English is comfortable for me now.

538
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:03,445
I heard you're close to Yoo Ha.

539
00:43:03,445 --> 00:43:07,120
I'll finally meet her. We had just called each other a lot.

540
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:13,190
Yoo Ha will be happy to see you.

541
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,265
Really?

542
00:43:19,835 --> 00:43:21,695
It's a relief I saw you first.

543
00:43:21,695 --> 00:43:24,205
Even though it was a bit abrupt.

544
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:30,125
It might have been more awkward if we met again in Haseong.

545
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:38,245
Once I move to the Korean headquarters, I can take two months' leave.

546
00:43:38,245 --> 00:43:40,975
I'm planning to spend it in Haseong.

547
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:48,085
The chief asked me to tutor his kids, and you, Yoo Ha, and Da Kyung are there, too.

548
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:52,875
It's the place where I have the most memories.

549
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,325
You're done already? You should have called.

550
00:43:55,325 --> 00:43:57,665
What's their relationship?

551
00:43:57,665 --> 00:44:01,115
From what I've heard, they've been close since they were in Haseong.

552
00:44:01,115 --> 00:44:03,415
- And they—
- Don't say any more.

553
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:10,015
Good work today.

554
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:12,295
Let's go.

555
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:16,125
The ratings for the last commercial were very high.

556
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:18,365
Thank you.

557
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:23,185
It'll be high this time, too. I concentrated 500% at the end.

558
00:44:23,185 --> 00:44:24,795
We should get going.

559
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,195
It's okay, go rest. I called a taxi.

560
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:28,345
What?

561
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:31,175
See you again. I'll text you.

562
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:37,815
The neighborhood is tiny,

563
00:44:37,815 --> 00:44:41,035
but there are so many different jobs there.

564
00:44:44,325 --> 00:44:45,925
Let's go.

565
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:29,215
If you're going to take them, then do it.

566
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,390
Throw them away.

567
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:37,950
What is yours should be thrown away by you.

568
00:46:04,655 --> 00:46:06,615
It's even now, right?

569
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:10,825
The fridge and drawer.

570
00:46:10,825 --> 00:46:13,535
Take all the weird sauces you brought, too.

571
00:46:14,575 --> 00:46:16,275
Clean it all up.

572
00:46:48,665 --> 00:46:52,460
And take this, too. It smells like you.

573
00:46:56,185 --> 00:46:58,005
This too.

574
00:47:04,915 --> 00:47:07,005
Take all this.

575
00:47:10,115 --> 00:47:11,645
Okay.

576
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:14,595
Take care of yourself.

577
00:47:22,295 --> 00:47:24,565
There's still something left.

578
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:45,205
A little more...

579
00:47:45,205 --> 00:47:47,755
Right here.

580
00:47:47,755 --> 00:47:50,185
All right.

581
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:52,645
One, two, three!

582
00:47:52,645 --> 00:47:54,845
Surprise!

583
00:47:55,745 --> 00:47:59,995
I sincerely congratulate you, Mr. Han Ji Woo!

584
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:04,815
How is it? Isn't it cool?

585
00:48:10,584 --> 00:48:13,604
Why? Do you not like it?

586
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:19,955
This is a bit burdensome for me to accept.

587
00:48:19,955 --> 00:48:23,165
But the restaurant is far from here. And it has a parking lot.

588
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:26,825
Just use it to go to and from work.

589
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:33,125
Is it kind of weird?

590
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:38,855
I'll think about it.

591
00:48:40,195 --> 00:48:41,915
Thank you.

592
00:48:46,675 --> 00:48:48,855
This is yours, too.

593
00:48:48,855 --> 00:48:50,615
Take it.

594
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,840
I never accepted it in the first place.

595
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,980
It's not mine.

596
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,125
Then, what do I do with it?

597
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:01,175
Take care of it yourself.

598
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:03,645
Sell it or something.

599
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:05,725
I'll get going. It's late.

600
00:49:14,275 --> 00:49:18,995
Are you really leaving like this?

601
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:28,495
Even this gift that you gave me with such excitement...

602
00:49:29,835 --> 00:49:32,195
made me feel dirty.

603
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:36,705
It's the thought that counts.

604
00:49:36,705 --> 00:49:41,185
That's right. I don't think either of us was wrong.

605
00:49:41,185 --> 00:49:46,315
It's just that our tendencies and values didn't match up.

606
00:49:47,455 --> 00:49:50,485
- I know. I know, but—
- So...

607
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:56,210
If you knew all that,

608
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,770
why do you still want to date me?

609
00:51:01,715 --> 00:51:05,645
(We ship and deliver)

610
00:51:07,015 --> 00:51:10,035
Why couldn't I answer that question?

611
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:17,005
They say that when you break up, the first thing you do is throw away that person's belongings.

612
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:21,455
Their pictures, too. So you don't think of them.

613
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:25,305
That's right. Give me your phone.

614
00:51:25,305 --> 00:51:27,935
We'll delete all the pictures for you.

615
00:51:39,255 --> 00:51:41,305
I deleted them all.

616
00:51:41,305 --> 00:51:43,055
You did.

617
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:47,895
To be honest, I want to talk about work now.

618
00:51:48,585 --> 00:51:51,065
We were walking on eggshells around you.

619
00:51:51,065 --> 00:51:55,595
So even if you got variety show offers, we used to turn them down without telling you.

620
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:59,165
Who?

621
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:01,405
Who says?

622
00:52:01,405 --> 00:52:03,155
Who told you to do that?

623
00:52:04,785 --> 00:52:07,045
Be professional about it.

624
00:52:07,045 --> 00:52:09,945
I'm only going to focus on work. Bring me all the work.

625
00:52:09,945 --> 00:52:13,045
I'm only going to focus on work. I'll work like an ant now.

626
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:16,245
I'll be a hardworking ant now. Got it?

627
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:18,245
Bring me all the work.

628
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:21,485
I'm only going to work.

629
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:25,785
I wish I was an ant. An ant...

630
00:52:25,785 --> 00:52:28,225
I'm an ant now.

631
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:30,985
What a jerk...

632
00:53:29,885 --> 00:53:33,595
(Dacham Village, ~The Village of Truth~)

633
00:53:38,945 --> 00:53:40,695
Thank you for your help.

634
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:44,065
Gosh, don't mention it. Geez, this is cold.

635
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:46,835
I'm okay.

636
00:53:46,835 --> 00:53:49,405
- I'll do it.
- This is for me.

637
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:51,685
So many people are borrowing your parents' land

638
00:53:51,685 --> 00:53:55,355
and live so cheaply. All I did was find a house for you.

639
00:53:55,355 --> 00:53:57,535
How are your parents?

640
00:53:57,535 --> 00:54:00,145
They say the air in Seoul is so bad. They miss it here a lot.

641
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:03,405
Seong Yoon, you've lightened up a lot, too.

642
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:05,385
You look good, Seong Yoon.

643
00:54:05,385 --> 00:54:07,395
Take six!

644
00:54:07,395 --> 00:54:09,035
Action!

645
00:54:10,735 --> 00:54:15,855
Min Ji died.

646
00:54:18,845 --> 00:54:21,005
I told you to stop lying.

647
00:54:21,005 --> 00:54:24,025
It's the same as if you killed her.

648
00:54:24,025 --> 00:54:28,225
So, you should've left her when I told you to leave her.

649
00:54:28,225 --> 00:54:33,345
Why? No matter how stupid you are, I'm sure you knew this much.

650
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:35,125
Cut!

651
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:37,245
Why can't you tear up?

652
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:44,315
One teardrop here and another one there. Can't you do that?

653
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:46,785
One teardrop at a time separately.

654
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:49,355
You can do that when you cry, right?

655
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:51,805
- Let's go again.
- Okay.

656
00:54:53,495 --> 00:54:55,715
Take seven.

657
00:54:55,715 --> 00:54:56,845
Action!

658
00:54:56,845 --> 00:54:59,585
It's the same as if you killed her.

659
00:54:59,585 --> 00:55:02,285
So, you should've left her when I told you to leave her.

660
00:55:02,285 --> 00:55:04,655
No matter how stupid you are, I'm sure you knew this much.

661
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:06,105
Cut!

662
00:55:06,105 --> 00:55:07,605
It's too much crying, no?

663
00:55:07,605 --> 00:55:10,465
One more time. Let's go one more time.

664
00:55:14,975 --> 00:55:17,005
Bring me the tear stick.

665
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:23,505
I said bring me the tear stick! You heard me, right?

666
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:26,445
Oh, okay. The tear stick...

667
00:55:29,915 --> 00:55:34,095
I mean, it's not like I requested something difficult.

668
00:55:34,095 --> 00:55:36,825
How come he can't do something in between?

669
00:55:37,745 --> 00:55:41,995
He takes so much money home per episode.

670
00:55:41,995 --> 00:55:45,085
He even failed to show up last time.

671
00:55:45,085 --> 00:55:47,055
He's so sly.

672
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:50,215
I think he tends to look down on me!

673
00:55:50,215 --> 00:55:52,885
But still, he's a good actor.

674
00:55:52,885 --> 00:55:56,615
From now on, I'll work only with a rookie like Lee Jae Yong who listens well.

675
00:55:56,615 --> 00:56:00,765
Am I shooting with someone so high and mighty or something?

676
00:56:02,955 --> 00:56:05,565
So noisy.

677
00:56:06,365 --> 00:56:08,815
I'll go and take a break.

678
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:12,485
Oh, sure.

679
00:56:19,395 --> 00:56:21,465
Bro, are you okay?

680
00:56:22,525 --> 00:56:23,825
Do you have something for a headache?

681
00:56:23,825 --> 00:56:26,095
Yes, wait a minute.

682
00:56:35,345 --> 00:56:37,020
(054-8911-4455)

683
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,485
Hello.

684
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:49,305
Oh, yes, hello.

685
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:55,465
Daddy! It looks delicious.

686
00:56:55,465 --> 00:56:58,835
Yoo Ha, let's go over there and eat.

687
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:01,895
(Ti Aspetto)

688
00:57:09,395 --> 00:57:13,155
It looks like your business is not doing that well.

689
00:57:17,415 --> 00:57:19,875
For the village's harmony and unification,

690
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:24,025
why don't you prepare the village festival this time?

691
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,685
That's right.

692
00:57:26,685 --> 00:57:30,875
People will throw a feast to celebrate Seong Yoon's return.

693
00:57:32,045 --> 00:57:34,625
Why? Do you not want to do it?

694
00:57:37,805 --> 00:57:40,985
No, I'll do my best.

695
00:57:40,985 --> 00:57:43,495
All right.

696
00:57:43,495 --> 00:57:45,755
Here. This is the money for ingredients.

697
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,985
- Thank you.
- Sure.

698
00:57:51,025 --> 00:57:54,015
Do they think this joke of money will be enough?

699
00:57:54,015 --> 00:57:55,755
It's okay.

700
00:58:05,685 --> 00:58:10,125
Grandma Kim likes potato pancakes.

701
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,645
Shall I make potato pancakes as well?

702
00:58:11,645 --> 00:58:13,825
Of course!

703
00:58:16,255 --> 00:58:17,625
Okay.

704
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,625
Did you come home late last night after going to Seoul?

705
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22,155
You look tired.

706
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:24,415
I didn't come home late.

707
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:27,135
But you look like you didn't sleep enough.

708
00:58:29,485 --> 00:58:31,465
My daughter!

709
00:58:31,465 --> 00:58:34,555
Your mom is here!

710
00:58:34,555 --> 00:58:37,635
That town office work,

711
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:39,625
are you the only one who works over there?

712
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:41,615
The overtime pay is great!

713
00:58:41,615 --> 00:58:47,245
Also, I must work harder beforehand if I want to attend your open class.

714
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:52,705
Did she do her homework?

715
00:58:57,115 --> 00:58:58,615
I heard you two already met!

716
00:58:58,615 --> 00:59:00,945
Then I don't have to say much, right?

717
00:59:00,945 --> 00:59:05,215
Hello, Auntie. It's our first time seeing you in person after only seeing on video calls.

718
00:59:05,215 --> 00:59:08,405
Hello! It's so good to see you, Yoo Ha!

719
00:59:09,485 --> 00:59:12,815
Ta-da! This is a present for you.

720
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:15,035
I don't know if you'll like it.

721
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:17,705
It's so cute!

722
00:59:19,145 --> 00:59:21,170
Should we have dinner all together after closing the shop?

723
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,900
She's staying over at my place tonight and leaving tomorrow.

724
00:59:23,905 --> 00:59:27,925
I have to prepare the food for the feast.

725
00:59:27,925 --> 00:59:30,095
But that's next week.

726
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:34,225
I have to prepare it in advance, still.

727
00:59:36,975 --> 00:59:40,905
Do you want me to help you with that? I have nothing to do now.

728
00:59:44,175 --> 00:59:47,005
Both of you are making everyone awkward as well.

729
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:49,445
Why don't you wear your backpack? Let's go home, Yoo Ha.

730
00:59:49,445 --> 00:59:52,365
Let's go, let's go.

731
00:59:53,515 --> 00:59:57,195
Are you not coming with us? Come.

732
00:59:57,195 --> 00:59:58,575
Open the door carefully!

733
00:59:58,575 --> 01:00:01,535
Bye. I'll see you tomorrow!

734
01:00:06,948 --> 01:00:11,348
(Seo Joon)

735
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:18,843
(Do not open this)

736
01:00:24,967 --> 01:00:26,727
(Are you really going to open this?)

737
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:33,050
(Are you trying to regret it?)

738
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:50,660
(Han Ji Woo)

739
01:02:01,336 --> 01:02:03,050
I'm here!

740
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,335
Unni!

741
01:02:04,335 --> 01:02:07,669
Why do you have something on your face already?

742
01:02:07,669 --> 01:02:09,919
But are they really throwing this for me?

743
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:14,419
I think so. When my dad came to town, they didn't do anything for him.

744
01:02:14,419 --> 01:02:17,149
He always gets scolded.

745
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:21,659
But am I doing this right?

746
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:23,049
Oh, shit!

747
01:02:23,049 --> 01:02:24,709
I'll do this.

748
01:02:24,709 --> 01:02:26,889
Why don't you go and grind some potatoes for me?

749
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:30,714
Okay. Yoo Ha, please pretend you didn't hear what I said earlier.

750
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:32,694
Don't worry.

751
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:41,049
I'm pretty good at cooking, though.

752
01:02:44,259 --> 01:02:47,119
You didn't like cooking before.

753
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,869
No, I like it a lot now. I cook every meal at home.

754
01:03:01,859 --> 01:03:05,769
But is it okay to put cheese on top of potato pancakes?

755
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,769
You are so stubborn!

756
01:03:11,769 --> 01:03:16,019
Also, Dad, why don't you do it kindly to people with this opportunity?

757
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:20,729
"Hello, sir. You are so awesome!"

758
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:23,869
Repeat after me.

759
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:25,989
No, it's okay.

760
01:03:32,389 --> 01:03:37,209
"Hello, sir. You are so awesome."

761
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:42,759
Just focus on cooking.

762
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:46,289
That's why I said I wouldn't do it.

763
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,019
Why? You were pretty good at it.

764
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:50,419
She's totally like her mother.

765
01:03:51,789 --> 01:03:54,309
What is this? Is this a pizza?

766
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:58,429
I put some cheese and pepperonis on top of the potato pancakes.

767
01:03:58,429 --> 01:04:01,699
But if you try this, it'll be tasty...

768
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:03,999
I should just take off the potato pancake part and eat it.

769
01:04:03,999 --> 01:04:07,079
Why did you play around with food so much?

770
01:04:14,189 --> 01:04:16,689
This has some of my work in it, too!

771
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:18,029
Don't lie to me!

772
01:04:18,029 --> 01:04:19,479
What? Do you want to die?!

773
01:04:19,479 --> 01:04:21,069
What she said is true.

774
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,259
Yoo Ha, you worked hard.

775
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:24,659
Okay, everyone!

776
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:29,449
Today, we have a lot to celebrate, so I asked all of you to gather.

777
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,749
Our ancestors looked after our village,

778
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:35,909
so every rice paddy and field was harvested great evenly.

779
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:38,249
Also, as you all know well,

780
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:42,909
the eldest grandchild of the Jeong family who made a great contribution to our village,

781
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:44,879
Ms. Jeong Seong Yoon.

782
01:04:44,879 --> 01:04:48,139
What was it... A famous place in America!

783
01:04:48,139 --> 01:04:52,389
That a... Anyway!

784
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,569
She's working as a team leader of a famous jewelry brand.

785
01:04:54,569 --> 01:04:58,279
And she came to have some rest and teach our children.

786
01:04:58,279 --> 01:05:00,930
She came back to do a lot of great work.

787
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:02,920
Please have a round of applause!

788
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:07,499
Yes, yes.

789
01:05:07,499 --> 01:05:12,199
Also, there's another thing to celebrate big time!

790
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:15,719
Everyone, don't be too surprised.

791
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:18,839
Okay, please come in!

792
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:26,709
Hello, it's nice to meet you all!

793
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:30,189
Kang Seo Joon came to the Dacham Village!

794
01:05:30,189 --> 01:05:32,219
Dacham Village, make some noise!

It's so weird to see someone I thought I'd never get to see in my life so often.

817
01:07:23,687 --> 01:07:26,177
Me or Han Ji Woo?

818
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:28,967
Both of you.

819
01:07:30,877 --> 01:07:35,447
This must be your hometown. Are you taking a break and going back to the States?

820
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:37,067
No.

821
01:07:37,067 --> 01:07:38,637
I won't be going there again.

822
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:41,197
I'll stay in Korea. For the rest of my life.

823
01:07:41,197 --> 01:07:42,907
For the rest of your life.

824
01:07:47,517 --> 01:07:51,167
Where's your bracelet? It should be fixed by now.

825
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:55,077
I put it aside for a moment. Why?

826
01:07:55,777 --> 01:07:59,067
I was wondering where I saw that bracelet.

827
01:07:59,067 --> 01:08:04,037
I had seen it in Han Ji Woo's old picture.

828
01:08:04,727 --> 01:08:08,037
Is it like a couple bracelet?

829
01:08:09,187 --> 01:08:12,117
It was the first piece of jewelry I'd ever made.

830
01:08:12,117 --> 01:08:16,187
So, it's quite meaningful to me.

831
01:08:20,057 --> 01:08:23,337
- I took that picture for him.
- Gosh...

832
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:25,957
You don't seem too talented at taking photos.

833
01:08:26,927 --> 01:08:29,357
I'm sure there were other good pictures.

834
01:08:29,357 --> 01:08:32,427
Oh, I guess you didn't see them?

835
01:08:32,427 --> 01:08:34,647
Yes.

836
01:08:34,647 --> 01:08:39,077
The TV commercial you mentioned last time. I heard they're highly satisfied internally.

837
01:08:39,077 --> 01:08:44,427
Of course, I'd have to confirm the last one.

838
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:47,217
So, if you guys broke up,

839
01:08:47,217 --> 01:08:53,377
isn't it a proper manner not to wear anything that's couple related?

840
01:08:53,377 --> 01:08:58,957
As for that manner, it matters when people know it's a couple bracelet.

841
01:08:58,957 --> 01:09:01,607
That's why I don't wear it.

842
01:09:01,607 --> 01:09:04,617
- Kind of sort of thanks to you.
- I see.

843
01:09:04,617 --> 01:09:10,547
It was so perfect. So I broke it at such perfect timing!

844
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:13,827
As expected of Kang Seo Joon. It broke just in time— Gosh...

845
01:09:13,827 --> 01:09:14,847
Are you all right?

846
01:09:14,847 --> 01:09:18,417
Gosh. Are you okay?

847
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:22,707
- If you're comfortable in English, you should continue in English with me...
- No thanks.

848
01:09:22,707 --> 01:09:25,407
I'm perfectly comfortable right now.

849
01:09:27,687 --> 01:09:29,377
All right then.

850
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:36,737
She's not easy.

851
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:40,377
She's a tough one.

852
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:49,807
I'm not following you. I'm just going my way.

853
01:09:49,807 --> 01:09:51,567
Don't worry.

854
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,227
What a nice spacious car!

855
01:09:54,227 --> 01:09:57,957
I feel sorry for him. He looks rich, too.

856
01:09:57,957 --> 01:09:59,577
What the heck is that?

857
01:09:59,577 --> 01:10:01,397
As you said,

858
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:04,557
I asked him to prepare some food for the party. He did a good job.

859
01:10:04,557 --> 01:10:09,447
Right? His problem is that he gives way above and beyond when given a task.

860
01:10:09,447 --> 01:10:13,357
Everyone here said that it was delicious.

861
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:17,477
You're walking too slow. We'll go ahead.

862
01:10:17,477 --> 01:10:19,527
Please move aside.

863
01:10:19,527 --> 01:10:21,887
Please step aside.

864
01:10:25,417 --> 01:10:29,177
They should move over when there's a car coming. Geez...

865
01:10:34,937 --> 01:10:37,137
Okay. Wow...

866
01:10:37,137 --> 01:10:40,497
What is it now? Is he playing around in someone else's front yard?

867
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:41,947
Hey, you're here.

868
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:43,387
Chief says this is the perfect spot.

869
01:10:43,387 --> 01:10:45,077
That's right. He's your friend.

870
01:10:45,077 --> 01:10:48,037
I already talked to Mr. Lee at the real estate office and the owner.

871
01:10:48,037 --> 01:10:51,767
Go in and do what you need to do. Let's respect each other's privacy.

872
01:10:51,767 --> 01:10:54,217
- Top Star, show me around.
- Oh, shall we?

873
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:57,787
- If you look inside, it's the latest model.
- Okay.

874
01:10:57,787 --> 01:10:58,877
Let's go in, Yoo Ha.

875
01:10:58,877 --> 01:11:02,107
The SBC variety show, "I Want to Take a Break."

876
01:11:02,107 --> 01:11:06,557
We'll look into why restaurants in the countryside have gone out of business.

877
01:11:06,557 --> 01:11:10,707
- So what neighborhood are we in today?
- Actually, I wanted to go inside of that, too.

878
01:11:10,707 --> 01:11:13,057
- It looked nice.
- My goodness...

879
01:11:13,057 --> 01:11:15,617
Is it because he's rich?

880
01:11:15,617 --> 01:11:20,447
Anyway, Han Ji Woo... he must have a headache.

881
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:26,327
No. Did he save the nation in his previous life?

882
01:11:26,327 --> 01:11:29,007
What are you saying? What are you going to wear tomorrow, Mom?

883
01:11:29,007 --> 01:11:30,517
You know...

884
01:11:30,517 --> 01:11:35,907
The pink blouse I bought last time and a black skirt. What do you think?

885
01:11:35,907 --> 01:11:37,597
Dressed up subtly.

886
01:11:37,597 --> 01:11:39,487
Fine. Wear whatever you want.

887
01:11:39,487 --> 01:11:44,037
You know, it'd be bad if I'm too pretty. Don't you think?

888
01:11:44,037 --> 01:11:46,377
Come on. Just come on time.

889
01:11:46,377 --> 01:11:48,907
It's at 1:00 p.m. Tie my hair up for me tomorrow, too.

890
01:11:48,907 --> 01:11:51,757
I got it. I already set it all up.

891
01:11:51,757 --> 01:11:54,877
They'll let me go even if I don't take the afternoon off. Isn't that good?

892
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:55,957
Really?

893
01:11:55,957 --> 01:11:58,757
That's right, my daughter!

894
01:11:59,497 --> 01:12:00,957
What are you watching?

895
01:12:00,957 --> 01:12:03,317
I have to watch my drama now.

896
01:12:04,327 --> 01:12:07,857
Give me the remote control! The remote!

897
01:12:10,107 --> 01:12:11,957
So cold.

898
01:12:25,577 --> 01:12:27,587
What? Is something the matter?

899
01:12:27,587 --> 01:12:29,547
Open the door.

900
01:12:34,947 --> 01:12:36,827
What?

901
01:12:39,437 --> 01:12:41,677
Are you really going to stay here like this?

902
01:12:41,677 --> 01:12:43,827
As you can see, it's pleasant.

903
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:48,037
If you can't sleep out of worry for me, I'll oblige and sleep in your house.

904
01:12:49,486 --> 01:12:53,437
I'm going to live here for the rest of my life.

905
01:12:53,437 --> 01:12:56,447
I'll be fine here alone without any worries.

906
01:12:56,447 --> 01:12:59,087
So, don't interfere.

907
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:03,337
I'm just borrowing your front yard. What do you mean by interfere? Don't overreact.

908
01:13:05,167 --> 01:13:06,837
Okay.

909
01:13:06,837 --> 01:13:09,657
Do everything you want to do before you go.

910
01:13:09,657 --> 01:13:12,147
Though I don't know how long you'll last.

911
01:13:16,097 --> 01:13:19,637
Yeah, right! Like you'll live a good life like this!

912
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:39,207
♫ Are you ready to face all the things we regret ♫

913
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:47,657
♫ Hey, you. Are you ready to say all the things we never said ♫

915

- Mom!
- I'll be back! See you later!

923
01:14:57,757 --> 01:15:00,627
Split your hair in three parts.

924
01:15:00,627 --> 01:15:03,027
It's better if they're the same amount.

925
01:15:03,027 --> 01:15:07,457
Calmly, the part that is furthest to the right...

926
01:15:10,293 --> 01:15:16,000
(Kang Seo Joon Accident)
(Kang Seo Joon Stepping down)

927
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:43,280
Something simple. Give me something like Caprese salad.

928
01:15:46,549 --> 01:15:50,259
We're neighbors. You can afford to give me a meal.

929
01:15:51,829 --> 01:15:54,099
Did you get in trouble?

930
01:15:54,099 --> 01:15:55,779
What are you talking about?

931
01:15:55,779 --> 01:15:57,419
It's not just once or twice.

932
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:00,679
You're not working and you continue to stay here.

933
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:02,799
I was wondering if there were more articles to be published.

934
01:16:02,799 --> 01:16:06,529
I slept so well last night. First time in a year.

935
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:10,219
Make me some food. I want to enjoy food for the first time in a year, too.

936
01:16:10,219 --> 01:16:11,899
I don't want to. I'm out of ingredients.

937
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:15,599
You don't even have customers. What do you mean, out of ingredients?

938
01:16:16,759 --> 01:16:20,649
I guess you had no problem eating, sleeping, and living well.

939
01:16:20,649 --> 01:16:22,569
But not me.

940
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:26,209
I came here so I can live. So what?

941
01:16:26,209 --> 01:16:29,489
Give me some time. That's not hard to do.

942
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:39,239
He drove four hours in the middle of the night and drove another four hours back?

943
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:41,499
What kind of joke is that? How can he act in that condition?

944
01:16:41,499 --> 01:16:44,489
Hey, Baek Ho Min, tell me. Can he act well?

945
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:46,239
Can he act with the right feelings?

946
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:49,349
His acting was good.

947
01:16:49,349 --> 01:16:52,499
- His condition looked great.
- What?

948
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:57,239
How was his mood?

949
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:00,139
He seemed better than before.

950
01:17:02,549 --> 01:17:05,199
What a pervert. Right? He has to be a pervert.

951
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,839
Why does he like being treated badly?

952
01:17:07,839 --> 01:17:11,539
You know how he has to get something out of his system if he's curious about it.

953
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:15,619
- Is it because Han Ji Woo is by his side?
- Whatever!

954
01:17:18,519 --> 01:17:20,829
Let's go to Espresso Three Shots.

955
01:17:22,651 --> 01:17:26,361
I just wonder if his illness is going to get worse at this rate.

956
01:17:27,156 --> 01:17:29,986
He doesn't take medicine anymore and is better now.

957
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:38,339
So, why are you so cold with me?

958
01:17:40,259 --> 01:17:45,989
I'm your ex just like her. So why are you cold with me, but not her?

959
01:17:45,989 --> 01:17:49,689
Do you still have lingering feelings for me or for her?

960
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:55,639
You keep bringing up uncomfortable conversations like this all the time.

961
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:00,539
Okay, then I won't.

962
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:02,109
Okay?

963
01:18:05,809 --> 01:18:07,269
I said I won't.

964
01:18:07,269 --> 01:18:09,469
What are you doing? Answer the phone.

965
01:18:17,769 --> 01:18:20,159
- Yes, Ti Aspetto.
- Oh, it's Da Kyeong.

966
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,129
Why are you picking up now?

967
01:18:22,129 --> 01:18:25,099
Oh, sorry. What's wrong?

968
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:29,359
It's a day for parents to observe class today, but I couldn't make it because the county mayor came by out of the blue.

969
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:33,249
I was wondering if Yoo Ha is upset. Could you go to the school to get her, by chance?

970
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:36,339
All right. I'll go.

971
01:18:37,309 --> 01:18:40,479
Excuse me, we have coupons.

972
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:43,839
- Pardon?
- Gosh!

973
01:18:43,839 --> 01:18:47,773
Here are the coupons! You said you'd give me 50% off.

974
01:18:47,773 --> 01:18:49,509
That's right. Welcome.

975
01:18:49,509 --> 01:18:50,989
How about sitting over there?

976
01:18:50,989 --> 01:18:53,089
- Oh, good, good.
- Come in, come in.

977
01:18:53,089 --> 01:18:56,149
- Oh, my.
- Come in, come in.

978
01:18:59,309 --> 01:19:00,949
You found me again.

980
01:19:03,409 --> 01:19:06,819
(By Seo Joon)
I heard something about Ongshimi (sushi) here.

981
01:19:06,819 --> 01:19:10,739
Correct. This place is famous for Ongshimi and gnocchi.

982
01:19:10,739 --> 01:19:15,079
Three gnocchi it is. Wait just a moment, please.

983
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:26,479
I must look so cool you are speechless.

984
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:28,609
What do you want, really?

985
01:19:28,609 --> 01:19:31,039
Nothing, but what school like this has no students?

986
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:33,739
Because it's in a rural area.

987
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:37,619
What's wrong with your hair today? Who was fighting with you?

988
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:41,179
- Or did you sleep soundly?
- Hey, kid.

989
01:19:41,179 --> 01:19:43,209
What's wrong with you?

990
01:19:43,209 --> 01:19:45,209
Wait for me.

991
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:47,609
Hey, why are you walking so fast?

992
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:49,689
Are you mad about what I said?

993
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:51,179
I'm sorry.

994
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:53,539
You don't know anything about me.

995
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,739
Even if you're a celebrity, someone sent you.

996
01:19:55,739 --> 01:19:59,839
They're not here, so she sent you, Kang Seo Joon.

997
01:19:59,839 --> 01:20:02,239
Hey, celebrities have ears too.

998
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:05,539
Your mom wanted me to go.

999
01:20:05,539 --> 01:20:10,179
When Han Ji Woo was in the middle of something important,

1000
01:20:10,179 --> 01:20:12,539
- suddenly there was a call.
- Stop!

1001
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:14,579
Stop talking.

1002
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:18,069
I know how you feel.

1003
01:20:18,069 --> 01:20:20,409
I know how it feels when your parents don't show up to the class observation.

1004
01:20:20,409 --> 01:20:22,939
Wait, wait, wait!

1005
01:20:22,939 --> 01:20:26,739
Okay. It's my treat. Okay?

1006
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,989
No price limit.

1007
01:20:31,879 --> 01:20:35,309
(Buheung Store)
(Means abundantly rich)

1008
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:40,699
I can't believe such a great store like this is still around.

1009
01:20:40,699 --> 01:20:42,409
Yoo Ha, have you seen that drama?

1010
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:45,109
Was it on before you were born?

1011
01:20:45,109 --> 01:20:49,279
Choose everything from here to there. I'll buy you everything.

1012
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:51,689
I'll pay all at once.

1013
01:20:51,689 --> 01:20:54,229
- You're Kang Seo Joon, right?
- Yes.

1014
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:56,449
My goodness. I'm totally your fan. Amazing!

1015
01:20:56,449 --> 01:20:58,959
Aren't these the sunglasses that you wear a lot?

1016
01:20:58,959 --> 01:21:01,759
Yes, that's right.

1017
01:21:01,759 --> 01:21:03,309
Wow, I can't believe I get to meet you here.

1018
01:21:03,309 --> 01:21:05,679
I'm so sorry, but could I have your autograph?

1019
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:10,279
- Oh, sure.
- When would I ever get to see you out in the boonies?

1020
01:21:11,289 --> 01:21:13,249
- Your name is?
- It's Shin Ki Won.

1021
01:21:13,249 --> 01:21:15,609
- Shin Ki Won...
- Yes.

1022
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:16,879
Thank you so much!

1023
01:21:16,879 --> 01:21:18,719
Please let's take a picture, too.

1024
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,799
- A picture? Sure.
- Yes, please look over here.

1025
01:21:20,799 --> 01:21:23,679
- Take off your sunglasses.
- Oh, the sunglasses.

1026
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,229
One, two, three. Click!

1027
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:27,739
Gosh, thank you!

1028
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:28,969
- Thank you.
- It looks good!

1029
01:21:28,969 --> 01:21:32,609
- Thank you!
- Did you pick them out?

1030
01:21:32,609 --> 01:21:34,459
Yoo Ha...

1031
01:21:36,449 --> 01:21:38,389
Han Yoo Ha.

1032
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:46,239
Yoo Ha!

1033
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,119
Han Yoo Ha!

1034
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:51,279
Don't play around!

1035
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:54,379
Yoo Ha! Han Yoo Ha!

1036
01:21:55,159 --> 01:21:57,029
Yoo Ha!

1037
01:22:39,209 --> 01:22:42,109
(I'm leaving the house.)

1038
01:22:42,109 --> 01:22:45,219
Mic check! Han Yoo Ha.

1039
01:22:45,219 --> 01:22:48,159
Anyone who saw 9-year-old Han Yoo Ha,

1040
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:50,299
- please tell me, the Village Chief...
- Han Yoo Ha!

1041
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:53,239
- ...or Han Yoo Ha's mother, Han Da Kyeong.
- Yoo Ha!

1042
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:55,429
Please let us know!

1043
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,139
I'll repeat it one more time.

1044
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,759
Han Yoo Ha. If anybody saw Han Yoo Ha—

1045
01:22:59,759 --> 01:23:01,839
- Han Yoo Ha!
- Han Yoo Ha!

1046
01:23:01,839 --> 01:23:03,969
Han Yoo Ha!

1047
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:07,129
Yoo Ha...

1048
01:23:07,129 --> 01:23:08,949
It'll be okay.

1049
01:23:12,699 --> 01:23:15,109
She would've not gone to places like this, right?

1050
01:23:20,299 --> 01:23:22,009
Did you hear that?

1051
01:23:22,009 --> 01:23:23,889
Yes.

1052
01:23:23,889 --> 01:23:26,359
Maybe she's here.

1053
01:23:26,359 --> 01:23:29,627
What if she's here somewhere scary like this alone?

1054
01:23:29,627 --> 01:23:32,777
Yoo Ha! Han Yoo Ha!

1055
01:23:43,689 --> 01:23:46,059
Let's go around that way.

1056
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:51,509
Yoo Ha! Han Yoo Ha!

1057
01:23:53,899 --> 01:23:55,859
Can you get on all fours? I'll step on you and go up there.

1058
01:23:55,859 --> 01:23:58,839
Or do you want to climb up? I can get on the ground.

1059
01:23:58,839 --> 01:24:00,549
She's not here.

1060
01:24:00,549 --> 01:24:02,809
But we should still check.

1061
01:24:02,809 --> 01:24:06,189
No matter how much she acts like an adult, she's still a child.

1062
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:08,339
It'll be scary for her to be alone for a long time.

1063
01:24:08,339 --> 01:24:09,549
Why don't you get on the ground?

1064
01:24:09,549 --> 01:24:11,159
That was a cat sound.

1065
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:12,429
What?

1066
01:24:12,429 --> 01:24:15,759
How can a child cry like that? It's not Yoo Ha's sound.

1067
01:24:17,239 --> 01:24:19,559
But still, we should check.

1068
01:24:26,949 --> 01:24:29,019
Seriously.

1069
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:33,959
See? It's a cat.

1070
01:24:36,199 --> 01:24:40,709
Is it because I said her hair was weird?

1071
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:43,079
Is that why she disappeared?

1072
01:24:49,929 --> 01:24:52,959
Don't think about it too much. Let's go look at other places.

1073
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:58,339
Let's take a break for a bit.

1074
01:25:05,139 --> 01:25:07,749
You are going to collapse!

1075
01:25:09,819 --> 01:25:12,519
Why don't you drink some water first?

1076
01:25:15,089 --> 01:25:20,129
The police and every villager are looking for her now.

1077
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:25,549
She must have been so heartbroken...

1078
01:25:45,839 --> 01:25:47,569
Han Yoo Ha!

1079
01:25:47,569 --> 01:25:50,329
You! Han Yoo Ha!

1080
01:25:50,329 --> 01:25:51,949
Do you really want to get in trouble?

1081
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:54,569
If you were not going to come, you should've not said you'd come!

1082
01:25:54,569 --> 01:25:57,819
Even so! How can you do this?

1083
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,769
Mom, I hate you!

1084
01:26:03,229 --> 01:26:05,659
I'm sorry...

1085
01:26:07,909 --> 01:26:10,929
I'm so sorry...

1086
01:26:10,929 --> 01:26:14,099
I'm so sorry, Yoo Ha...

1087
01:26:17,249 --> 01:26:19,599
Thank goodness.

1088
01:26:19,599 --> 01:26:21,499
It's all good.

1089
01:26:21,499 --> 01:26:23,609
Mom...

1090
01:26:23,609 --> 01:26:25,789
Yoo Ha!

1091
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:27,989
Han Yoo Ha!

1092
01:26:28,849 --> 01:26:32,309
We looked around everywhere. Let's go back.

1093
01:26:33,339 --> 01:26:36,119
Do you think something might've happened to her?

1094
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:37,859
Nothing would've happened.

1095
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,209
Also, nothing should've happened.

1096
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,579
Seriously...

1097
01:26:43,579 --> 01:26:47,569
Because of someone, I really hate leaving only with a note.

1098
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:50,879
We found Yoo Ha. She was at home.
(Jeong Seong Yoon)

1099
01:26:50,879 --> 01:26:56,049
And this village is unnecessarily large. Where did she go in the middle of the night?

1100
01:26:56,049 --> 01:26:59,379
Why are all these Han family people in this town making trouble?

1101
01:26:59,379 --> 01:27:02,899
Yoo Ha! Han Yoo Ha!

1102
01:27:02,899 --> 01:27:05,119
Aren't you hungry?

1103
01:27:07,829 --> 01:27:10,549
How can you be hungry at a time like this?

1104
01:27:10,549 --> 01:27:14,889
You're so worry-free. Are you trying to tease me?

1105
01:27:17,559 --> 01:27:19,709
They found Yoo Ha.

1106
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:24,349
- What?
- I just got a text that they found Yoo Ha.

1107
01:27:25,789 --> 01:27:27,749
She was at home the whole time.

1108
01:27:31,459 --> 01:27:33,309
That's a relief.

1109
01:27:34,509 --> 01:27:39,019
How can you have no emotions at a moment like this, too?

1110
01:27:39,019 --> 01:27:41,529
You're amazing, indeed.

1111
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:45,799
Everything is relative.

1112
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:50,309
If you didn't act like that, I would've been like you.

1113
01:27:51,139 --> 01:27:53,119
You are good at words.

1114
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:55,359
Let's sit here for a bit.

1115
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:59,399
I'm tired.

1116
01:28:17,609 --> 01:28:23,899
How can you be so honest with everything?

1117
01:28:28,989 --> 01:28:31,339
Because of it, I can't ignore you.

1120

Hello.

1121
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:50,991
Mr. Han Ji Woo? I contacted you earlier.

1122
01:31:50,991 --> 01:31:54,820
I'm Kim Jong Seong PD from Countryside Restaurant.

1123
01:31:55,661 --> 01:31:58,381
I never got any contact.

1124
01:31:58,381 --> 01:32:03,131
I got an appointment after calling.

1125
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:07,700
We talked with Ms. Han Yoo Ha.

1126
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,800
Han Yoo Ha?

1127
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:15,780
I told them to come. Do a good job.

1128
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,890
You should have told me.

1129
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:21,660
But if I told you, you wouldn't have done it. And I'm not stopping by later.

1130
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:23,800
Why?

1131
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:27,030
Someone came to pick me up.

1132
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:29,220
Who?

1133
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:32,820
Dad. No, Mr. Han.

1134
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,300
Yes, why?

1135
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,420
What's this all of a sudden?

1136
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:40,040
I got permission from Han Da Kyeong. You know I owe her.

1137
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,490
Work hard. Bye!

1138
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,180
Is it good?

1139
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:48,760
Here.

1140
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,180
What should we do?

1141
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:00,680
Our production is screwed.

1142
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,200
I told them to check it carefully.

1143
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,530
She was an elementary schooler.

1144
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,880
I'm not getting scolded, right? I told you I'd buy you yummy things.

1145
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,230
Mister, keep it a secret. Then nobody knows.

1146
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:29,820
But what kind of call did you have with Han Ji Woo?

1147
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:32,020
I don't know. There's something like that.

1148
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:34,540
It's out of my hands now.

1149
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:38,060
Your hair looks cool.

1150
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:43,840
I don't know how long it'll go, but they did it for me.

1151
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,980
Spicy?

1152
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:51,520
If they're too busy to do it for you, come to me. I'm good at it.

1153
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,590
It's fine, hair isn't that important.

1154
01:33:56,810 --> 01:34:00,260
You know, family are all like that.

1155
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:03,830
Try not to take them for granted. Then you'll feel better.

1156
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:11,070
Mom and dad love me unconditionally?

1157
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:12,330
Throw that thought away.

1158
01:34:12,330 --> 01:34:16,750
Of course, your mom probably loves you.

1159
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,580
She's great.

1160
01:34:19,893 --> 01:34:22,613
What's that mean?

1161
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:28,720
What I mean is, "A peaceful family is a happy family."

1162
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,500
Just forget that thought for a moment.

1163
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:39,330
Well... It's not like your family becomes peaceful because of your efforts alone.

1164
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:44,000
Life is alone. If you think like that, it's comfortable.

1165
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,280
But, Mister,

1166
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,080
aren't you busy?

1167
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:53,400
Even if you're sorry, you don't have to spend so much time with me.

1168
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,080
You must know now,

1169
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,680
but the reason you're playing with me

1170
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,040
is because I don't want to be alone.

1171
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:04,680
Let's play for a long time doing fun things.

1172
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:07,890
What should we do? Play house?

1173
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:09,860
I'll give you some tea.

01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,530

He's not doing it?

1186
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:10,350
It was all good, but this ring isn't just a band.

1187
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:13,680
The point is that it was coated in special metal.

1188
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:17,320
But this line doesn't show up very well, so it's a shame.

1218
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:04,820
You agree?

1219
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:11,050
What's "like this"?

1220
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:16,810
Eating together sometimes, sleeping together sometimes...

1221
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:22,721
You're not that type of person.

1222
01:39:22,721 --> 01:39:27,981
I don't know what "that type" means, but I think I am.

1223
01:39:30,886 --> 01:39:33,130
You think you are?

1224
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:36,270
Are you? Tell me clearly.

1225
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:45,480
I am... if that's what you want.

1226
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,850
What did people call that?

1227
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:49,900
A partner?

1228
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:55,400
Why?

1229
01:39:55,400 --> 01:40:00,870
It must be hard to eat in the trailer. Eat here.

1230
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:03,000
You can sleep here if you want, too.

1231
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:12,850
But this is a bit salty.

1232
01:40:12,850 --> 01:40:16,170
- You put a lot of salt in at once, right? Instead of a little at a time.
- Stop.

1233
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,070
Stop with that.

1234
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,560
Stop with what?

1235
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:31,500
Am I really so little to you?

1236
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,360
I'd rather you tell me I made a mistake. I didn't want to hear you say that, so all day—

1237
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:45,920
Answer me.

1238
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:52,280
You acting like this, ending it so messily... Are you okay with it?

1239
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:58,090
If you're going to act, do it properly until the end.

1240
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:02,490
You just weren't honest.

1241
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:05,510
Or you didn't want to be.

1242
01:41:07,530 --> 01:41:09,490
I'm not going to believe anything you say.

1243
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:14,030
Think whatever you want.

1244
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,540
You always did that.

1245
01:41:18,690 --> 01:41:23,000
But... even in the future,

1246
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,380
I don't want to be your partner.

1247
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:35,280
Okay, let's do that, then.

1248
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:39,320
Every night, 11:00 p.m., here. How's that?

1249
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:48,020
Don't say that again.

1250
01:41:48,926 --> 01:41:50,816
I'm leaving.

1251
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:09,990
You bitch, did you finish talking?

1252
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,540
Bitch? Shut up, Emily!

1253
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:13,720
Shut up! Shut your mouth, Sarah!

1254
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,660
Emily, Sarah, stop.

1255
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:17,330
Enough!

1256
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:30,360
Whatever.

1257
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,300
Everyone should go.

1258
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:35,990
I don't like English either.

1259
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:53,590
Do you want to drink?

1260
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:56,890
Yes. Can you make me a drink?

1261
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:05,840
You ignored me earlier. This neighborhood sure is welcoming.

1262
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:10,500
I usually can't pass by lonely-looking people.

1263
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:11,960
Who said I'm lonely?

1264
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:13,660
Thanks.

1265
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:16,780
What are you doing on Saturday?

1266
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:21,090
- Why?
- If you're free, do you want to do something—

1267
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:22,570
Wait, wait.

1268
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:24,280
Wait.

1269
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,510
What is this?

1270
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:29,940
Is this entire neighborhood like this?

1271
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:33,960
Let's say you're "American-minded."

1272
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:38,450
What about Han Ji Woo? Did he really learn an Italian mind while cooking?

1273
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:41,270
Look, I'm sorry. I'm a bit good-looking

1274
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:42,610
and I may have been born under a lucky star,

1275
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:47,390
but I'm... I'm very noble and pure.

1276
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:49,120
I'm sorry, I'm not like this.

1277
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,680
I...

1278
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:54,240
I stopped playing with fire a long time ago.

1279
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,730
Go your own way.

1280
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,540
Go on.

1281
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:05,580
No, I'm sorry too.

1282
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:11,640
Even if I fall down bonking my head with another player while trying to catch a spike by Kim Yeon Koung,

1283
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:17,260
you're not my style.

1284
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,260
You must be a fan.

1285
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:25,470
Well, that could be it.

1286
01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:26,730
You drank a lot.

1287
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:28,040
Stop drinking.

1288
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:30,340
- Just one more.
- Stop, stop.

1289
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:33,860
((Saturday) We're closed for the day due to Young Adult Group matters.
- Han Ji Woo, Ti Aspetto)

1290
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:37,610
- Han Ji Woo, geez...
- The call is not going through. After the beep, you'll be connected to voicemail.

1291
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,120
And there will be a charge.

1292
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:44,720
Hey, why did you do that? Huh?

1293
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:47,310
I really don't get it.

1294
01:44:47,310 --> 01:44:50,480
At my age, must I... Forget it.

1295
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:54,160
Let's just say it never happened. That'd be better.

1296
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:02,270
Are you freaking kidding me? When are we going to clean up all this by ourselves?

1297
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,400
Today's weather sucks, too.

1298
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,770
Daughter, I can't believe this...

1299
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:12,590
♪ It's here! It's here! ♪

1300
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:15,180
♪ It's done! It's done! ♪

1301
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:17,530
♪ It's here, and it's done! ♪

1302
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:19,900
Nice to see you all.

1303
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:23,610
Well, the mood is nice today with this fog and all.

1304
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:27,220
I heard we're doing something good, so I brought a good person with me.

1305
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:31,520
First of all, he's cool, rich, and a good worker.

1306
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:35,690
Hello, I'm Kim Pil Hyun.

1307
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:37,950
Did you tell him to come?

1308
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:38,740
You okay?

1309
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:41,150
We should differentiate work from personal issues.

1310
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:44,950
Seriously. Only if it wasn't for that...

1311
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:51,270
- As expected of CEO Kim! He came in place of his staff member.
- Of all days, Baek Ho Min...

1312
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:54,280
He said he had something important going on today!

1313
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:59,070
Where shall we begin?

1314
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:00,990
Well...

1315
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,210
One, two, three,

1316
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:05,020
four, five...

1317
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:06,130
I was going to lift at the count of five. You do it at three?

1318
01:46:06,130 --> 01:46:08,480
Come on! Lift it!

1319
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:12,310
Please step aside.

1320
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:13,890
Bro, lift it properly!

1321
01:46:13,890 --> 01:46:16,710
A cool person usually lifts more.

1322
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:19,780
♫ It's done! It's done! ♫

1323
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:20,940
♫ It's here, and it's done! ♫

1324
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:22,290
Let's work hard.

1325
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:23,950
Gosh, so hard. So hard...

1326
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:26,760
Hey, you should lift something like that over there.

1327
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:29,690
♫ The real thing is here, the fake one should leave ♫

1328
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:32,370
Wait a minute. There's something on you.|

1329
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:33,340
Give it to me.

1330
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:36,600
♫ Let's fly through this night ♫

1331
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:39,350
Out, out, out.

1332
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,300
Hurry up!

1333
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:41,940
- Eat dinner before you go.
- What?

1334
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:43,740
- Eat dinner before you go.
- Of course, I will.

1335
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:44,820
Eat before you go, okay?

1336
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:46,020
What do you want to eat?

1337
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,640
- Anything is fine.
- Anything is good?

1338
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:48,970
I'll give you this.

1339
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:51,170
Let's go and eat something yummy.

1340
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:55,580
So, are we all eating together?

1341
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:59,240
♫ I smile when I see you ♫

1342
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:03,520
♫ No more worries ♫

1343
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:07,580
Come in.

1344
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:10,840
Thank you all for helping out today.

1345
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:14,270
I didn't prepare that much. But since you came from Seoul and all,

1346
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:16,050
please enjoy!

1347
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:18,520
I'll bring some ice.

1348
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:23,740
Give me some, too.

1349
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:25,530
Drink this.

1350
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:27,360
Thanks.

1351
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,170
You should drink just a little bit.

1352
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:41,100
How long did you two date?

1353
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:43,770
You seem to have a pretty interesting history.

1354
01:47:47,530 --> 01:47:50,650
For about five years, ever since Ji Woo transferred to school.

1355
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:52,280
Oh, five years...

1356
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:55,070
You said you came to Seoul when you were 20 years old.

1357
01:47:55,070 --> 01:47:57,150
I went to school in Seoul.

1358
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:58,920
We went together.

1359
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,150
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1360
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:06,570
So, Seong Yoon, what type of person do you dislike?

1361
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:08,810
People get embarrassed when you ask what their ideal types are.

1362
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:11,760
I'm just curious.

1363
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,790
Inconsiderate people who only think of themselves.

1364
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:17,880
Is that so?

1365
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:21,360
So, what do you think about breaking up by lying low?

1366
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:27,510
I'm sorry...

1367
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:31,600
Don't be sorry. I said it's okay.

1368
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,890
That's not it. I did it on purpose.

1369
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:39,490
Well, I don't know all the details, but

1370
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:44,200
you seem to have your story, but in any case...

1371
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,750
Watch out by saying stuff like "lying low"...

1372
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:48,600
Why? What's wrong with saying "lying low"?

1373
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,380
I'm the one with a broken heart. Why?

1374
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:54,240
Well, it's because... my goodness...

1375
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:57,470
Well, Seong Yoon...

1376
01:48:57,470 --> 01:49:00,830
went "lying low" and that's why they broke up.

1377
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:01,930
You got that?

1378
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:03,200
Eat.

1379
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,200
Please enjoy.

1380
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,540
So, how come you speak so well?

1381
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:11,490
Are you usually a good talker, nine-year-old?

1382
01:49:11,490 --> 01:49:12,890
Well, I'm not sure.

1383
01:49:12,890 --> 01:49:15,800
- I just read books...
- My goodness, my goodness...

1384
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:18,820
I listen to Grandma and Grandpa well.

1385
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,960
You're so cute!

1386
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:26,980
Ji Woo, I heard you turned down appearing on "Countryside Restaurant."

1387
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:28,350
Eat plenty!

1388
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:30,810
How do you know that?

1389
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,980
Seo Joon is doing the special guest MC that day.

1390
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:36,690
What? Why didn't you tell me?

1391
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:38,980
You said you'd do it if I wanted you to do the show.

1392
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:40,150
Do you want some chicken?

1393
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:41,050
Do you like it?

1394
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:43,880
Hey, we're fine if you don't do it.

1395
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,400
But your restaurant could take off. Isn't it a good opportunity?

1396
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,480
Why did you say you didn't want to do it?

1397
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:52,290
Actually, I came all this way to talk to you about that. Me.

1398
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:54,830
Your glass is empty. Let me pour you one...

1399
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:56,610
My god!

1400
01:49:58,550 --> 01:49:59,440
I'm sorry.

1401
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,830
It's okay.

1402
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:02,470
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

1403
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,850
It's okay.

1404
01:50:03,850 --> 01:50:05,840
Clean up. I'll go and get more drinks.

1405
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:08,670
At this hour? From where?

1406
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:10,560
I have some at the restaurant.

1407
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,100
Wait, wait for me. I'll go with you.

1408
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:21,260
Did you get wet a lot?

1409
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:22,880
- It's okay.
- My goodness...

1410
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,990
What do I do...

1411
01:50:48,090 --> 01:50:52,570
So, were you with him when Ji Woo's parents passed away?

1412
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:55,020
I went there for a short time, too.

1413
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:56,970
Really?

1414
01:50:58,470 --> 01:51:01,100
I was with him then, but...

1415
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:05,680
now that I think about it, I might've been too immature.

1416
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:08,540
I don't think I was of much help.

1417
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:13,070
He's gotten so much better thanks to you.

1418
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:21,230
Is Yoo Ha sleeping well?

1419
01:51:21,230 --> 01:51:24,730
She must've been tired. She's totally out.

1420
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:37,470
I think being in a relationship is the hardest.

1421
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:43,050
I guess so.

1422
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:46,260
You must be having trouble in your relationship.

1423
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:48,370
No, I'm not.

1424
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:52,160
I'm happy.

1425
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:57,520
If you're more in love with the person, you just hold it in and continue.

1426
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:02,670
I can tell right away that you're just being loyal.

1427
01:52:02,670 --> 01:52:04,390
- Break up.
- Hey, hey.

1428
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:07,440
Look how comfortable I am right now.

1429
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:12,070
It's really comfortable.

1430
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:14,490
Just don't think about anything and just do it. What about it?

1431
01:52:14,490 --> 01:52:17,720
Do you feel challenged? Am I going too far with this?

1432
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:20,100
I haven't had a drink in a while.

1433
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:28,910
If you have something to say, hurry up and say it here before we go back.

1434
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:36,480
Are you still jealous of Pil Hyun?

1435
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:40,320
You were jealous earlier.

1436
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:44,840
You looked at me when Da Kyeong spilled the drink earlier, too.

1437
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:47,860
You were afraid I'd react to the noise.

1438
01:52:51,361 --> 01:52:53,361
I told you.

1439
01:52:54,191 --> 01:52:56,571
You can think as you like.

1440
01:53:01,505 --> 01:53:05,995
My outfit is like this right now.

1441
01:53:05,995 --> 01:53:08,395
So I know it might sound funny,

1442
01:53:10,255 --> 01:53:15,715
but I'll fix everything you said to me.

1443
01:53:15,715 --> 01:53:17,955
Isn't that going to work for you?

1444
01:53:36,105 --> 01:53:38,525
What can you change?

1445
01:53:41,255 --> 01:53:45,415
I'll sleep and wake up regularly at the same time as you.

1446
01:53:45,415 --> 01:53:47,835
- Also—
- What about when you have a shoot?

1447
01:53:49,095 --> 01:53:53,485
When I have work as well. I'll try my best, so don't worry about it.

1448
01:53:53,485 --> 01:53:56,515
If I was too sensitive to you, I'm also sorry about that.

1449
01:53:56,515 --> 01:54:00,235
I thought about it, and I think it's all because my daily routine is too irregular.

1450
01:54:00,235 --> 01:54:03,365
So if I adjust to your lifestyle, it'll change naturally

1451
01:54:09,445 --> 01:54:11,275
Ji Woo.

1452
01:54:15,315 --> 01:54:17,485
Now, for me...

1453
01:54:19,745 --> 01:54:23,175
I can only think of you when I think about a chef.

1454
01:54:23,175 --> 01:54:26,755
Pasta, Italy, and even the last name Han are all about you for me.

1455
01:54:32,845 --> 01:54:38,725
To fix that we can't go out on a date outside, let's go abroad more often.

1456
01:54:39,655 --> 01:54:41,265
Also...

1457
01:54:42,255 --> 01:54:46,855
I won't ask you to let me squeeze it when you get a blemish on your face.

1458
01:54:46,855 --> 01:54:51,735
I don't have to ask you that. I was just teasing you because you were cute.

1459
01:54:58,165 --> 01:55:02,055
Why are you acting like this? You are making me uncomfortable.

1460
01:55:02,055 --> 01:55:05,045
Do you act pathetic like this when you break up?

1461
01:55:05,045 --> 01:55:09,245
If it's not, are you having trouble believing that a guy like me doesn't like you?

1462
01:55:09,245 --> 01:55:11,945
- Han Ji Woo!
- To me!

1463
01:55:12,875 --> 01:55:15,675
I can't understand why you are acting like this now.

1464
01:55:21,395 --> 01:55:24,115
I can't understand you right now.

1465
01:55:24,115 --> 01:55:26,655
I guess you think...

1466
01:55:26,655 --> 01:55:30,245
I'm a total crazy narcissist who doesn't even think about others at all.

1467
01:55:30,245 --> 01:55:34,195
You do look like that.

1468
01:55:34,195 --> 01:55:37,425
You think you are the main character here as well, don't you?

1469
01:55:38,485 --> 01:55:40,415
Main character?

1470
01:55:41,385 --> 01:55:43,625
Aren't you the main character?

1471
01:55:43,625 --> 01:55:45,545
You hide away as if you are the only sad person in this world.

1472
01:55:45,545 --> 01:55:48,215
You don't think about facing the problem and solving it.

1473
01:55:48,215 --> 01:55:50,605
You have unnecessary great pride.

1474
01:55:50,605 --> 01:55:53,495
And you never tell your real feelings, making other people go crazy!

1475
01:55:53,495 --> 01:55:55,315
That's why!

1476
01:56:00,215 --> 01:56:02,135
I also know that.

1477
01:56:03,355 --> 01:56:06,015
I know that I'm that kind of person.

1478
01:56:08,905 --> 01:56:10,545
I am that kind of person.

1479
01:56:10,545 --> 01:56:12,395
But still...

1480
01:56:13,855 --> 01:56:17,265
- But still, I'm saying I like you.
- But I'm saying I don't like you.

1481
01:56:24,865 --> 01:56:31,095
You didn't do anything wrong to me when we were dating.

1482
01:56:31,095 --> 01:56:32,715
Am I wrong?

1483
01:56:33,705 --> 01:56:36,170
No matter how hard I think about it,

1484
01:56:37,070 --> 01:56:39,550
I don't remember anything you did wrong to me.

1485
01:56:45,695 --> 01:56:48,245
Everything was my issue.

1486
01:57:14,675 --> 01:57:17,275
I was lonely.

1487
01:57:17,275 --> 01:57:18,855
What?

1488
01:57:20,695 --> 01:57:22,655
I was lonely at the time.

1489
01:57:24,685 --> 01:57:26,910
When I was in a relationship with you,

1490
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:31,060
I was lonelier than when I was single.

1491
01:57:34,125 --> 01:57:37,195
Then, why do I have to date you?

1492
01:57:37,195 --> 01:57:39,015
What's the good of it?

1493
01:57:41,465 --> 01:57:43,495
You never told me this.

1494
01:57:47,255 --> 01:57:49,595
Now you know exactly...

1495
01:57:50,555 --> 01:57:53,545
the reason why I don't want to date you again.

1496
01:58:04,375 --> 01:58:06,065
Ji Woo.

1497
01:58:08,235 --> 01:58:10,735
We did have a problem...

1498
01:58:12,525 --> 01:58:15,705
since today was the first time we have yelled and fought with each other.

1499
01:58:16,635 --> 01:58:18,175
That we...

1500
01:58:35,545 --> 01:58:38,025
Let's hurry up and go home.

1501
01:58:38,025 --> 01:58:40,495
Bro, your next schedule is not that far away from here.

1502
01:58:40,495 --> 01:58:42,465
Why don't you just get some rest in this area?

1503
01:58:42,465 --> 01:58:44,615
If you go home, you won't be able to rest for two hours.

1504
01:58:44,615 --> 01:58:47,445
It's okay. I'll go home and rest.

1505
01:58:51,015 --> 01:58:54,575
Yes, Ji Woo. I just finished my shoot.

1506
01:58:54,575 --> 01:58:57,525
If I head home now, it'll take about an hour and a half.

1507
01:58:57,525 --> 01:59:00,495
How is it? Do you think it's interesting?

1508
01:59:02,245 --> 01:59:05,535
The two are finally getting together, so it's a relief. Right?

1509
01:59:05,535 --> 01:59:06,875
Yes.

1510
01:59:20,965 --> 01:59:25,245
Now that I think about it, I did my best for him.

1511
01:59:28,405 --> 01:59:31,135
Happy birthday!

1512
01:59:31,135 --> 01:59:32,545
Thank you so much!

1513
01:59:32,545 --> 01:59:35,875
Oppa, we ordered fried chicken and drinks. Why don't you have some with us?

1514
01:59:35,875 --> 01:59:37,555
I'm really sorry.

1515
01:59:37,555 --> 01:59:41,645
But I have an important plan. You know, I'm dating someone.

1516
01:59:41,645 --> 01:59:42,995
That's right.

1517
01:59:42,995 --> 01:59:45,515
- Oppa, at least take this with you.
- Yes.

1518
01:59:45,515 --> 01:59:50,285
It's because I thought I met someone I'd share the rest of my life with.

1519
01:59:50,285 --> 01:59:52,855
- Order everything you want to eat with this!
- Really?

1520
01:59:52,855 --> 01:59:55,945
But if it's not working out this much,

1521
01:59:57,915 --> 02:00:00,285
we are really not meant to be.

1522
02:00:04,415 --> 02:00:06,885
I guess you went over there and fought again.

1523
02:00:10,845 --> 02:00:12,355
Bro,

1524
02:00:13,215 --> 02:00:15,655
from my perspective,

1525
02:00:15,655 --> 02:00:18,895
you were very devoted to that relationship.

1526
02:00:18,895 --> 02:00:21,570
You rarely joined in drinking with others.

1527
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:23,980
I mean, even after you broke up with him.

1528
02:00:23,985 --> 02:00:26,545
Even though I don't know why you two broke up.

1529
02:00:28,095 --> 02:00:31,695
I mean, you did more than your best.

1530
02:00:31,695 --> 02:00:34,035
But if he's not coming back to you,

1531
02:00:36,165 --> 02:00:38,495
then you are not meant to be.

1532
02:00:39,605 --> 02:00:42,715
I think it's time for you to stop trying.

1533
02:00:42,715 --> 02:00:45,065
Why does it make me feel sad all of a sudden?

1534
02:00:52,185 --> 02:00:54,605
CEO Kim...

1535
02:00:54,605 --> 02:00:56,685
What is it?

1536
02:00:57,755 --> 02:01:00,335
When is the schedule for the Countryside Restaurant shoot?

1537
02:01:01,495 --> 02:01:03,275
That show?

1538
02:01:04,705 --> 02:01:07,555
I think it is on Thursday, two weeks from now.

1539
02:01:11,265 --> 02:01:14,765
Why? Are you also not going to participate?

1540
02:01:15,735 --> 02:01:18,765
I'll do it. I have to do it.

1541
02:01:20,495 --> 02:01:22,335
You surprised me.

1542
02:01:31,335 --> 02:01:33,585
The appearance in the Countryside Restaurant,

1543
02:01:33,585 --> 02:01:36,015
it will be helpful to Han Ji Woo.

1544
02:01:42,495 --> 02:01:44,375
Da Kyeong,

1545
02:01:45,585 --> 02:01:50,105
what kind of person am I, from your perspective?

1546
02:01:50,105 --> 02:01:51,765
You?

1547
02:01:53,655 --> 02:01:57,305
You are a very consistent person to me.

1548
02:01:57,305 --> 02:02:00,495
You are always very put together.

1549
02:02:00,495 --> 02:02:03,185
And you are always competitive.

1550
02:02:06,205 --> 02:02:09,285
I wonder what Ji Woo will think about me.

1551
02:02:11,215 --> 02:02:13,335
Wouldn't he be thinking differently than me?

1552
02:02:13,335 --> 02:02:16,725
That time was a tough time for him and you.

1553
02:02:16,725 --> 02:02:22,495
You were going to go to college with a volleyball scholarship, but you got injured and couldn't go.

1554
02:02:22,495 --> 02:02:27,055
And Han Ji Woo lost his parents at that time.

1555
02:02:27,055 --> 02:02:30,565
It was a hard and challenging time.

1556
02:02:33,415 --> 02:02:37,085
So I want him to look at me differently now.

1557
02:02:37,085 --> 02:02:38,605
But because I'm different from that time,

1558
02:02:38,605 --> 02:02:42,030
I wonder if he feels foreign to me.

1559
02:02:42,705 --> 02:02:44,595
- Hey.
- Yes?

1560
02:02:44,595 --> 02:02:49,965
Yoo Ha called Han Ji Woo her dad the whole time until now.

1561
02:02:49,965 --> 02:02:51,945
- Really?
- Yes.

1562
02:02:51,945 --> 02:02:55,415
But I guess she thought his private life was promiscuous,

1563
02:02:55,415 --> 02:02:58,205
and she started to call him Mr. Han.

1564
02:02:59,525 --> 02:03:02,855
It's so funny.

1565
02:03:03,975 --> 02:03:06,045
I don't know.

1566
02:03:06,045 --> 02:03:08,845
I guess in this world, you can miss someone

1567
02:03:08,845 --> 02:03:12,845
even if you broke up with them.

1568
02:03:13,515 --> 02:03:18,545
I don't want to see my ex at all. If anything, I want him to just die.

1569
02:03:18,545 --> 02:03:21,655
He didn't take any responsibility.

1570
02:03:21,655 --> 02:03:26,745
I mean, he was totally fine when his own daughter called him an uncle.

1571
02:03:26,745 --> 02:03:28,545
That's outrageous.

1572
02:03:28,545 --> 02:03:30,295
Should I say something to him?

1573
02:03:30,295 --> 02:03:32,475
It's fine.

1574
02:03:32,475 --> 02:03:36,725
My parents also gave up on him.

1575
02:03:36,725 --> 02:03:39,005
Let's go to sleep now.

1576
02:03:45,838 --> 02:03:51,368
Now that I think about it, you and Ji Woo didn't change at all.

1577
02:03:52,048 --> 02:03:54,978
I feel like I'm the only one who changed so much.

1578
02:03:56,518 --> 02:03:59,728
To me, you didn't change at all as well.

1579
02:03:59,728 --> 02:04:02,648
- Really?
- Yes, you girl!

1580
02:04:02,648 --> 02:04:04,378
"You girl."

1581
02:04:04,378 --> 02:04:06,898
I haven't heard that in a while.

1582
02:04:06,898 --> 02:04:10,318
I still can't get used to you speaking in a Seoul dialect. It makes me cringe.

1583
02:04:10,318 --> 02:04:11,508
Why?

1584
02:04:11,508 --> 02:04:13,208
What do you mean "why"?

1585
02:04:13,208 --> 02:04:16,138
Let's get some sleep!

1586
02:04:17,038 --> 02:04:19,708
She said we needed to go to sleep.

1587
02:05:01,978 --> 02:05:03,208
Is anybody home?

1588
02:05:03,208 --> 02:05:05,338
- Who is it?
- Hello.

1589
02:05:05,338 --> 02:05:07,798
It's me, Kang Seo Joon.

1590
02:05:09,558 --> 02:05:13,808
How did you all get the good cards?

1591
02:05:15,778 --> 02:05:18,298
I lost! I lost.

1592
02:05:18,298 --> 02:05:19,938
You are so good at playing this game!

1593
02:05:19,938 --> 02:05:22,338
I think this town needs to change its name to Gamblers Village.

1594
02:05:22,338 --> 02:05:25,758
♫ Now, it's the beginning ♫

1595
02:05:25,758 --> 02:05:27,628
It's ginger tea.

1596
02:05:29,488 --> 02:05:33,458
Sir, why don't you have some hot ginger tea?

1597
02:05:33,458 --> 02:05:35,738
You are such a handsome man!

1598
02:05:35,738 --> 02:05:38,140
You have a good eye for it!

1599
02:05:40,088 --> 02:05:42,608
Yes, please put that one on me.

1600
02:05:42,608 --> 02:05:44,278
Oh, it dropped. Can you put another one on for me?

1601
02:05:44,278 --> 02:05:45,988
Can I put one on you, Yoo Ha?

1602
02:05:45,988 --> 02:05:48,450
I'm wearing this one, so what about this one on you?

1603
02:05:53,437 --> 02:05:55,187
Yoo Ha.

1604
02:05:56,308 --> 02:05:59,038
Does your mom approve of you hanging out with Kang Seo Joon?

1605
02:05:59,038 --> 02:06:03,448
Yes. My mom and Seo Joon are friends now.

1606
02:06:08,938 --> 02:06:14,478
Now, Kang Seo Joon is close with all of the grandmas and grandpas in the town.

1607
02:06:23,408 --> 02:06:27,858
Now that you get groceries from the marketplace, the price went down this much.

1608
02:06:27,858 --> 02:06:29,838
But if your business is still not doing well,

1609
02:06:29,838 --> 02:06:32,228
don't you think there's a problem?

1610
02:06:36,228 --> 02:06:38,888
Should I give out more coupons?

1611
02:06:38,888 --> 02:06:40,988
You didn't like that idea before.

1612
02:06:46,788 --> 02:06:50,018
- Be careful of the door when you're coming in.
- Don't worry. I got it!

1613
02:06:55,398 --> 02:06:56,808
Hello.

1614
02:06:56,808 --> 02:07:00,668
Did you refuse to go on that show or something?

1615
02:07:01,518 --> 02:07:03,138
I heard about it.

1616
02:07:03,138 --> 02:07:06,178
And if this restaurant goes on TV, this area's businesses will all get promoted.

1617
02:07:06,178 --> 02:07:09,988
We can sell more of our persimmons. That's what I heard.

1618
02:07:09,988 --> 02:07:12,468
The thing is...

1619
02:07:12,468 --> 02:07:15,168
You have to do the show.

1620
02:07:17,558 --> 02:07:19,608
Why are you not saying anything again?

1621
02:07:19,608 --> 02:07:23,378
Forget about it. Why don't you make us some food to recover from a hangover?

1622
02:07:23,378 --> 02:07:25,628
And don't forget to agree to go on the show. Okay?

1623
02:07:25,628 --> 02:07:29,888
Going on TV shows looks hard, but I heard it's nothing.

1624
02:07:29,888 --> 02:07:31,558
I went on a show when I was young.

1625
02:07:31,558 --> 02:07:34,898
That went well and...

1626
02:07:38,528 --> 02:07:41,308
- Yes, Ho Min.
- You need to go on the road now. Don't you?

1627
02:07:41,308 --> 02:07:43,088
I'm on my way. Don't worry about me.

1628
02:07:43,088 --> 02:07:45,178
Are you already at the filming site?

1629
02:09:29,916 --> 02:09:31,116
Now, finally!

1630
02:09:31,116 --> 02:09:34,516
A countryside restaurant that no one knows, let's make a hit project!

1631
02:09:34,516 --> 02:09:38,506
It's the 100th episode of the Countryside Restaurant!

1632
02:09:38,506 --> 02:09:40,976
Finally, that time came! It's the 100th episode.

1633
02:09:40,976 --> 02:09:42,346
Yes, that's right.

1634
02:09:42,346 --> 02:09:44,576
So to celebrate this special day,

1635
02:09:44,576 --> 02:09:48,316
we invited a very special guest.

1636
02:09:48,316 --> 02:09:50,546
It wasn't easy to have this guest with us today.

1637
02:09:50,546 --> 02:09:52,276
I'm also a big fan of his.

1638
02:09:52,276 --> 02:09:54,096
I'm really looking forward to today's guest.

1639
02:09:54,096 --> 02:09:56,556
Then we'll introduce him right away!

1640
02:09:56,556 --> 02:09:58,956
- When he does, everything hits the jackpot.
- Jackpot!

1641
02:09:58,956 --> 02:10:00,386
He's very handsome.

1642
02:10:00,386 --> 02:10:03,556
- And he's good at acting!
- Method acting.

1643
02:10:03,556 --> 02:10:05,666
And his personality is great, too!

1644
02:10:05,666 --> 02:10:07,836
Actor Kang Seo Joon!

1645
02:10:08,826 --> 02:10:11,486
It's nice to meet you.

1646
02:10:11,486 --> 02:10:14,776
- You brighten up the studio!
- Thank you! But the studio was bright already.

1647
02:10:14,776 --> 02:10:18,926
- He's really handsome! A total celebrity!
- He's very humble, too!

1648
02:10:18,926 --> 02:10:21,316
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you for having me.

1649
02:10:21,316 --> 02:10:23,916
- Let me say hello to the viewers.
- Yes! Please say hello.

1650
02:10:23,916 --> 02:10:27,736
Hello, everyone. As you know, I'm Kang Seo Joon. I'm happy to meet you!

1651
02:10:27,736 --> 02:10:30,016
Welcome!

1652
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:31,926
Thank you so much.

1653
02:10:31,926 --> 02:10:35,436
The restaurant we are going to introduce to you today

1654
02:10:35,436 --> 02:10:39,956
is an Italian restaurant that a young owner runs by himself in the countryside.

1655
02:10:39,956 --> 02:10:42,956
I heard Kang Seo Joon has a connection with the owner here.

1656
02:10:42,956 --> 02:10:44,586
Yes. Two years ago,

1657
02:10:44,586 --> 02:10:47,576
he came out on my V-log for a minute.

1658
02:10:47,576 --> 02:10:50,916
- I watched that! The egg roll kimbap!
- Yes, you're right. The egg roll kimbap.

1659
02:10:50,916 --> 02:10:55,016
You two had great chemistry in that video.

1660
02:10:55,016 --> 02:10:58,376
Yes, we did have great chemistry.

1661
02:10:58,376 --> 02:11:00,146
It's so good to see him again.

1662
02:11:00,146 --> 02:11:02,386
Then, shall we go together right now and try the food?

1663
02:11:02,386 --> 02:11:04,286
- Shall we?
- Yes, let's go.

1664
02:11:04,286 --> 02:11:06,336
Enjoy!

1665
02:11:08,946 --> 02:11:10,706
Hello!

1666
02:11:10,706 --> 02:11:13,226
- Hello.
- Wow, this restaurant!

1667
02:11:13,226 --> 02:11:14,446
It's so pretty!

1668
02:11:14,446 --> 02:11:17,726
- I think it's a renovated Hanok.
- It's very trendy these days!

1669
02:11:17,726 --> 02:11:19,246
Shall we sit here?

1670
02:11:19,246 --> 02:11:22,566
Hello, it has been a while. Hasn't it?

1671
02:11:23,566 --> 02:11:26,986
You look very stiff. Don't be too nervous.

1672
02:11:26,986 --> 02:11:28,986
I guess he got nervous since it's been a while for him to be in front of a camera.

1673
02:11:28,986 --> 02:11:31,146
- Please relax.
- Yes, please relax.

1674
02:11:31,146 --> 02:11:34,446
And please make two dishes that you are most confident about.

1675
02:11:35,776 --> 02:11:37,926
It's nice here. I'm surprised to see this kind of restaurant in the countryside.

1676
02:11:37,926 --> 02:11:40,186
We can see a green field out from here.

1677
02:11:40,186 --> 02:11:42,816
- It's quiet and nice.
- The view is beautiful.

1678
02:11:42,816 --> 02:11:44,636
The field view.

1679
02:11:52,552 --> 02:11:55,152
You're making carbonara right now, right?

1680
02:11:55,152 --> 02:11:57,942
I really love carbonara.

1681
02:11:57,942 --> 02:11:59,512
It looks good.

1682
02:12:05,902 --> 02:12:07,622
He doesn't hesitate.

1683
02:12:07,622 --> 02:12:09,032
He's an expert.

1684
02:12:09,032 --> 02:12:12,662
- And he's a good cook.
- Is he?

1685
02:12:16,702 --> 02:12:20,272
He's got high quality if you look at his skill.

1686
02:12:33,102 --> 02:12:36,282
Carbonara and osso buco.

1687
02:12:37,342 --> 02:12:39,902
Osso buco?

1688
02:12:39,902 --> 02:12:42,442
What's osso buco?

1689
02:12:46,522 --> 02:12:48,472
What do you think, Kang Seo Joon?

1690
02:12:48,472 --> 02:12:51,832
I knew he was a good cook, but it's much better than I thought.

1691
02:12:51,832 --> 02:12:54,172
Tastes like a high-end restaurant.

1692
02:12:55,612 --> 02:12:57,442
It's delicious.

1693
02:13:02,362 --> 02:13:05,300
The food tastes perfect,

1694
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:08,102
but it's not marketable.

1695
02:13:08,102 --> 02:13:11,990
I think so, too. The menu is too difficult.

1696
02:13:12,752 --> 02:13:14,822
Have you thought of doing some fusion?

1697
02:13:14,822 --> 02:13:17,392
Like putting cheese on potato pancakes?

1698
02:13:19,482 --> 02:13:24,242
I wanted to keep the identity of an Italian restaurant.

1699
02:13:25,032 --> 02:13:29,102
The identity of an Italian restaurant?

1700
02:13:29,102 --> 02:13:32,982
First of all, the restaurant name is too hard.

1701
02:13:32,982 --> 02:13:37,342
People don't look up meanings diligently.

1702
02:13:37,342 --> 02:13:38,562
- That's right.
- I mean...

1703
02:13:38,562 --> 02:13:41,060
People have to remember it to come back.

1704
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:43,930
You don't know what it means, either. Right?

1705
02:13:45,952 --> 02:13:48,112
Why did you name it like that?

1706
02:13:51,482 --> 02:13:53,582
It means that I'm waiting for a guest.

1707
02:13:53,582 --> 02:13:56,502
That's right! Ti Aspetto.

1708
02:13:56,502 --> 02:14:00,082
It means waiting for someone.

1709
02:14:00,082 --> 02:14:03,942
Even though it has a good meaning, you don't remember it. It's too hard.

1710
02:14:03,942 --> 02:14:07,462
And you have to have profit in business.

1711
02:14:07,462 --> 02:14:12,802
As for this osso buco, it's braised veal shanks.

1712
02:14:13,472 --> 02:14:15,230
Not only is this unfamiliar,

1713
02:14:15,230 --> 02:14:19,570
but it also doesn't suit a countryside village where traditional Korean food is appropriate.

1714
02:14:22,392 --> 02:14:26,342
How about giving up some of your stubbornness?

1715
02:14:27,052 --> 02:14:30,292
Or go work at a hotel and forget this place.

1716
02:14:30,292 --> 02:14:33,002
Kang Seo Joon, you're being pretty harsh.

1717
02:14:33,002 --> 02:14:35,922
First, rather than ingredients that are too expensive

1718
02:14:35,922 --> 02:14:38,482
or the best-grade ingredients...

1719
02:14:38,482 --> 02:14:41,942
I wonder if it's going to be a repeat of what it was like before.

1720
02:14:41,942 --> 02:14:45,482
It's not the same as then. We're not losing anything.

1721
02:14:45,482 --> 02:14:48,792
You're right. As Se-Seo Joon said,

1722
02:14:48,792 --> 02:14:51,712
it should help stimulate the economy in this area.

1723
02:14:51,712 --> 02:14:56,042
Right. But if we could help it, they shouldn't show the faces of the people in the area.

1724
02:14:56,042 --> 02:15:00,762
Just like it happened before, the cameras are here and they're saying some strange things.

1725
02:15:00,762 --> 02:15:06,312
I said I'd take a look at the whole thing before it's aired. So don't worry.

1726
02:15:09,352 --> 02:15:11,802
It's not his fault, though.

1727
02:15:11,802 --> 02:15:15,052
His parents are the problem. Isn't that right?

1728
02:15:15,052 --> 02:15:17,902
I don't know about this. Geez...

1729
02:15:17,902 --> 02:15:19,782
Let's go.

1730
02:15:19,782 --> 02:15:21,592
Are you okay with today's shoot, Director?

1731
02:15:21,592 --> 02:15:27,832
Yes. The shoot was fun and it went well, but...

1732
02:15:27,832 --> 02:15:30,382
- Yes...
- By chance,

1733
02:15:30,382 --> 02:15:34,440
does Kang Seo Joon and Han Ji Woo not get along?

1734
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:37,232
Why do you ask? Did something happen?

1735
02:15:37,232 --> 02:15:40,162
No. It's not that. I was just wondering...

1736
02:15:40,162 --> 02:15:42,532
I just felt it in the air.

1737
02:15:45,882 --> 02:15:47,832
Excuse me for a moment.

1738
02:15:50,102 --> 02:15:51,762
Yes?

1739
02:15:51,762 --> 02:15:55,312
Pardon? Passed the first level?

1740
02:16:02,212 --> 02:16:03,942
Mr. Han!

1741
02:16:03,942 --> 02:16:07,542
Yoo Ha, be careful! Ji Woo!

1742
02:16:07,542 --> 02:16:08,772
Hello.

1743
02:16:08,772 --> 02:16:10,842
Look at this.

1744
02:16:10,842 --> 02:16:12,902
Hey, we were going to look at it only by ourselves.

1745
02:16:12,902 --> 02:16:14,422
Who cares?

1746
02:16:14,422 --> 02:16:16,222
Look at it.

1747
02:16:17,572 --> 02:16:19,742
Seong Yoon is amazing.

1748
02:16:19,742 --> 02:16:23,252
I made this bracelet when I was 20.

1749
02:16:23,252 --> 02:16:26,402
It's very meaningful to me.

1750
02:16:26,402 --> 02:16:31,642
It's like a treasure box that stores my life from back then.

1751
02:16:33,752 --> 02:16:38,172
The shoot went well, right? You were busy today, so I spent the day with Yoo Ha.

1752
02:16:38,172 --> 02:16:40,242
I had fun!

1753
02:16:41,162 --> 02:16:43,282
We'll go now.

1754
02:17:03,602 --> 02:17:06,892
Don't get too close to the villagers.

1755
02:17:11,392 --> 02:17:14,512
You have nothing to lose by being careful.

1756
02:17:17,112 --> 02:17:18,862
No, I do.

1757
02:17:39,702 --> 02:17:42,322
- It's your mom!
- Mom!

1758
02:17:42,322 --> 02:17:45,442
Thank you so much!

1759
02:17:45,442 --> 02:17:48,222
I got so worried because Han Ji Woo was shooting today.

1760
02:17:48,222 --> 02:17:49,582
Don't mention it.

1761
02:17:49,582 --> 02:17:52,862
I had so much fun thanks to her. Right, Yoo Ha?

1762
02:17:52,862 --> 02:17:57,962
Yeah. I got to see various perspectives from various people.

1763
02:17:59,342 --> 02:18:00,752
Good night, Seong Yoon.

1764
02:18:00,752 --> 02:18:02,102
Good night.

1765
02:18:02,102 --> 02:18:03,892
Gosh, look at her acting all cutesy.

1766
02:18:03,892 --> 02:18:06,272
She's just like you.

1767
02:18:06,272 --> 02:18:08,282
Your interview got released today.

1768
02:18:08,282 --> 02:18:12,372
The Village Chief was telling everyone about your interview.

1769
02:18:12,372 --> 02:18:13,922
Here.

1770
02:18:16,452 --> 02:18:17,852
Do you still like that?

1771
02:18:17,852 --> 02:18:21,572
Of course. There are no better cookies than these.

1772
02:18:21,572 --> 02:18:25,172
Han Ji Woo doesn't like those. Did you know that?

1773
02:18:26,512 --> 02:18:28,412
He doesn't like sweets.

1774
02:18:28,412 --> 02:18:31,752
His taste in food could've changed, too.

1775
02:18:34,032 --> 02:18:37,642
I'll recommend you a route to your home.

1776
02:19:12,772 --> 02:19:15,122
Do you remember this?

1777
02:19:15,122 --> 02:19:18,252
It used to be our favorite cookie.

1778
02:19:18,252 --> 02:19:20,592
The kids used to tease us.

1779
02:19:26,182 --> 02:19:30,752
But I heard you don't like sweets.

1780
02:19:32,152 --> 02:19:36,182
It's not that I don't like them, I just...

1781
02:19:36,182 --> 02:19:40,712
You can be honest with me. We're not in a relationship now.

1782
02:19:42,682 --> 02:19:47,412
Unlike when we were in high school, now that we're grown-ups,

1783
02:19:47,412 --> 02:19:50,952
I couldn't meet people unless I reached out to them.

1784
02:19:52,152 --> 02:19:56,362
Actually, I wanted to talk to you a lot after I got here, too.

1785
02:19:56,362 --> 02:19:59,702
I asked you to meet me using my interview as an excuse.

1786
02:19:59,702 --> 02:20:03,382
I thought I should tell you about the bracelet.

1787
02:20:09,232 --> 02:20:11,102
By chance...

1788
02:20:12,042 --> 02:20:16,282
do you remember what I told you right before we broke up?

1789
02:20:19,982 --> 02:20:22,702
The last text you sent me?

1790
02:20:23,662 --> 02:20:25,152
Yeah.

1791
02:20:26,442 --> 02:20:27,892
Yeah.

1792
02:20:29,072 --> 02:20:30,962
I remember.

1793
02:20:31,957 --> 02:20:35,977
You said not to forget you until I was happy.

1794
02:20:37,742 --> 02:20:40,962
You said you'd wish for my misery for the rest of my life.

1795
02:20:43,372 --> 02:20:45,752
You do remember everything.

1796
02:20:45,752 --> 02:20:50,162
I'm really sorry about that. I must've been crazy.

1797
02:20:50,162 --> 02:20:52,922
I regretted that right away. I'm so sorry.

1798
02:20:52,922 --> 02:20:57,660
I said so many terrible things. That, too...

1799
02:20:58,322 --> 02:21:00,582
I'm sorry.

1800
02:21:00,582 --> 02:21:04,562
I'll sincerely apologize at this time.

1801
02:21:06,402 --> 02:21:08,602
It's okay.

1802
02:21:08,602 --> 02:21:10,920
That could happen.

1803
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:12,660
I understand.

1804
02:21:15,892 --> 02:21:18,310
Even though someone is by my side,

1805
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:22,400
there are times I need someone else.

1806
02:21:29,642 --> 02:21:31,702
Back then, you know...

1807
02:21:35,152 --> 02:21:40,122
because you were always by my side,

1808
02:21:41,112 --> 02:21:45,082
I wasn't lonely, I felt warmth...

1809
02:21:45,082 --> 02:21:47,072
I was well.

1810
02:21:48,612 --> 02:21:52,992
While I was dating you, I was able to focus on cooking.

1811
02:21:52,992 --> 02:21:55,602
I think I owe it all to you.

1812
02:21:58,592 --> 02:22:00,262
Thanks.

1813
02:22:02,292 --> 02:22:04,192
And...

1814
02:22:08,142 --> 02:22:10,742
I couldn't be like that for you.

1815
02:22:15,052 --> 02:22:16,772
I'm sorry.

1816
02:22:18,652 --> 02:22:20,202
Sorry.

1817
02:22:25,242 --> 02:22:28,390
I guess...

1818
02:22:29,170 --> 02:22:32,840
my heart was breaking back then.

1819
02:22:34,172 --> 02:22:38,422
You know how it is sometimes.

1820
02:22:38,422 --> 02:22:40,602
I didn't do anything right.

1821
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:45,172
It's been bothering me all along.

1822
02:22:45,172 --> 02:22:47,522
Thanks for being understanding.

1823
02:22:48,702 --> 02:22:52,462
We're talking nine years?

1824
02:22:52,462 --> 02:22:55,292
We're just talking about something that happened more than nine years ago.

1825
02:22:56,122 --> 02:22:57,932
I know.

1826
02:23:01,932 --> 02:23:07,012
I've been thinking about you a lot all this time.

1827
02:23:14,972 --> 02:23:16,742
I've been...

1828
02:23:20,742 --> 02:23:22,832
thinking about you a lot, too.

1829
02:23:31,642 --> 02:23:35,912
Did you miss me, too?

1830
02:23:40,382 --> 02:23:44,082
Ji Woo also had a special love.

1831
02:23:44,082 --> 02:23:47,552
He had more heartrending love...

1832
02:23:48,402 --> 02:23:50,452
than me.

1833
02:23:51,982 --> 02:23:54,694
Think about it. When 2040 comes,

1834
02:23:54,694 --> 02:23:57,270
I'll get Best Actor in a leading role from the Academy Awards.

1835
02:23:57,270 --> 02:23:59,832
And you'll be the chef of a really famous restaurant

1836
02:23:59,832 --> 02:24:02,070
that people can't even go to without an appointment.

1837
02:24:02,070 --> 02:24:06,990
And think about it. We'll build a cabin on a mountain like that.

1838
02:24:06,990 --> 02:24:10,670
We'll make coffee in the morning together. How does that sound?

1839
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:16,070
Why are you not saying anything? Think about it!

1840
02:24:16,070 --> 02:24:18,592
I don't know. I can't imagine it that well.

1841
02:24:18,592 --> 02:24:22,360
Oh, really. You really do have S for the Myers-Briggs test.

1842
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:25,500
Aren't you excited just thinking about our future?

1843
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:31,530
I don't know. Don't we have to go there to find out?

1844
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:45,390
At that time, I didn't know that was how Ji Woo felt.

1845
02:25:06,024 --> 02:25:07,790
I've been...

1846
02:25:09,740 --> 02:25:11,860
thinking about you a lot, too.

1847
02:25:20,694 --> 02:25:24,934
Did you miss me, too?

1848
02:25:32,814 --> 02:25:36,434
I wanted to talk to you.

1849
02:25:46,864 --> 02:25:48,790
Then,

1850
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:52,120
can I wear this around?

1851
02:25:54,604 --> 02:25:56,964
It's a couple bracelet...

1852
02:25:56,964 --> 02:25:58,850
but for me,

1853
02:25:58,850 --> 02:26:02,310
it keeps me motivated

1854
02:26:02,310 --> 02:26:04,670
to work harder.

1855
02:26:11,364 --> 02:26:16,404
If I don't wear it, it wouldn't be a couple bracelet.

1856
02:26:16,404 --> 02:26:18,464
It would be okay then.

1857
02:26:23,634 --> 02:26:25,324
Right.

1858
02:26:26,844 --> 02:26:28,724
I agree.

1859
02:26:51,604 --> 02:26:53,424
I lost.

1860
02:26:55,174 --> 02:26:57,210
Take care of yourself.

1861
02:26:58,084 --> 02:27:00,150
I'm sure you will.

1862
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:03,970
Don't get sick, either.

1863
02:27:05,234 --> 02:27:07,384
I'm sure you wouldn't be hurting anyway.

1864
02:27:53,664 --> 02:27:57,964
Yes. By chance, is there a taxi going to Seoul right now?

1865
02:28:21,814 --> 02:28:26,070
Sometimes I remembered that time,

1866
02:28:26,070 --> 02:28:28,510
and remembered that friend.

1867
02:28:46,724 --> 02:28:48,484
- Hey, Ji Woo.
- Yeah.

1868
02:28:48,484 --> 02:28:49,904
I finished my shoot.

1869
02:28:49,904 --> 02:28:51,954
It'll take about an hour and a half if I leave now.

1870
02:28:51,954 --> 02:28:54,494
Okay. Got it.

1871
02:28:54,494 --> 02:28:56,864
- I'm hanging up.
- Okay.

1872
02:29:03,994 --> 02:29:08,194
I didn't know what it was, but I struggled with guilt. I was confused.

1873
02:29:13,994 --> 02:29:16,164
What were you doing?

1874
02:29:16,164 --> 02:29:18,214
I was just here.

1875
02:29:18,214 --> 02:29:19,874
Aren't you hungry?

1876
02:29:19,874 --> 02:29:22,474
I'm okay. I have to leave in two hours.

1877
02:29:22,474 --> 02:29:24,534
I'll get some sleep.

1878
02:29:30,684 --> 02:29:35,200
The more I realized that Kang Seo Joon didn't do anything wrong,

1879
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,390
the more I got confused.

1880
02:29:44,654 --> 02:29:50,644
By chance, could you meet me in front of my place this evening?

1881
02:29:50,644 --> 02:29:52,704
Is something the matter?

1882
02:29:54,404 --> 02:29:59,664
I just feel a little down tonight.

1883
02:29:59,664 --> 02:30:02,274
Oh, sorry. Well...

1884
02:30:02,274 --> 02:30:05,514
I have to practice a little more tonight.

1885
02:30:05,514 --> 02:30:07,764
Is Da Kyeong busy?

1886
02:30:23,404 --> 02:30:27,034
How is it? Do you think it's fun?

1887
02:30:27,034 --> 02:30:30,014
It feels good now that it finally continues, right?

1888
02:30:42,934 --> 02:30:45,164
I have to go to the bathroom.

1889
02:30:55,904 --> 02:30:59,218
(Lee Yoo Rim, actress)
(Missed call)

1890
02:30:59,218 --> 02:31:01,871
(Actress Lee Yoo Rim: Aren't you coming, Oppa? Why do you keep missing these gatherings?

1891
02:31:01,871 --> 02:31:04,664
It's a party. The main star can't miss out. Why don't you pick up?)

1892
02:31:09,794 --> 02:31:13,444
It was my problem all along.

1893
02:31:13,444 --> 02:31:15,461
(The two look at each other. Then they close their eyes slowly.

1894
02:31:15,461 --> 02:31:17,924
Can't tell who made the first move. The two close in on each other and they kiss.)

1895
02:31:17,924 --> 02:31:21,234
Is it that difficult for you to be with me tonight?

1896
02:31:21,234 --> 02:31:23,324
What's the big deal about cooking?

1897
02:31:23,324 --> 02:31:25,944
Why are you working so hard at it?

1898
02:31:28,744 --> 02:31:30,590
Honestly,

1899
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:35,650
I don't understand why you're doing this.

1900
02:31:35,650 --> 02:31:37,324
Understand?

1901
02:31:38,904 --> 02:31:41,850
I live with my family,

1902
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:44,680
even attend university...

1903
02:31:44,684 --> 02:31:49,094
I have my friends. Yet why would I...

1904
02:31:49,094 --> 02:31:51,580
struggle like this, huh?

1905
02:31:51,580 --> 02:31:54,100
You don't get it at all, right?

1906
02:31:57,194 --> 02:32:00,064
Is your knee okay? Let's sit down and talk.

1907
02:32:03,184 --> 02:32:08,864
That's right! I don't understand myself, either. How would you understand me?

1908
02:32:08,864 --> 02:32:13,114
Some might think it's perfectly right for you to be sad and be struggling.

1909
02:32:13,114 --> 02:32:17,074
But I'm the only one who feels this way. It's driving me nuts, too!

1910
02:32:20,944 --> 02:32:24,084
I had no idea I could experience the feelings

1911
02:32:24,084 --> 02:32:28,314
that I have never felt before, despite being close to 30.

1912
02:32:28,314 --> 02:32:30,934
Happy birthday!

1913
02:32:30,934 --> 02:32:32,424
Thank you!

1914
02:32:32,424 --> 02:32:35,084
Oppa, we ordered drinks and chicken. Eat before you go.

1915
02:32:35,084 --> 02:32:37,694
Eat before you go! We finished the shoot.

1916
02:32:37,694 --> 02:32:39,874
Oppa, we're live-streaming. Say hello.

1917
02:32:39,874 --> 02:32:41,314
They're live-streaming right now.

1918
02:32:41,314 --> 02:32:43,254
Happy birthday!

1919
02:32:46,384 --> 02:32:49,140
I was alone,

1920
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:51,840
but Kang Seo Joon was with everyone.

1921
02:32:52,824 --> 02:32:55,274
I hated feeling that way.

1922
02:32:56,734 --> 02:33:00,524
Feeling like I'd be gone if Kang Seo Joon was gone.

1923
02:33:01,504 --> 02:33:04,944
I didn't like the uneasy feeling of being alone.

1924
02:33:07,404 --> 02:33:10,024
I wanted to run away.

1925
02:33:10,024 --> 02:33:15,434
Coming up with nonsensical excuses nonstop.

1926
02:33:15,434 --> 02:33:17,560
It felt like...

1927
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:20,040
that was the only way I could live.

1928
02:33:23,914 --> 02:33:27,844
Do you even know what it feels like to betray?

1929
02:33:27,844 --> 02:33:29,764
Because of that one person,

1930
02:33:29,764 --> 02:33:32,434
you turned us into the police? Huh?

1931
02:33:32,434 --> 02:33:35,404
You fucked us up. So I should fuck you up.

1932
02:33:38,914 --> 02:33:41,234
Whoa, are you okay?

1933
02:33:41,234 --> 02:33:43,314
- Why didn't you move?
- Are you okay?

1934
02:33:43,314 --> 02:33:45,274
- I'm okay. Let's continue.
- Cut!

1935
02:33:45,274 --> 02:33:46,784
What?

1936
02:33:52,064 --> 02:33:53,274
It's really bad.

1937
02:33:53,274 --> 02:33:55,724
Give me a moment. I'll bring him some water.

1938
02:33:57,464 --> 02:34:01,434
- Hey, is there a problem with your actor?
- Pardon?

1939
02:34:01,434 --> 02:34:03,360
His mental issues.

1940
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:07,020
I thought he got all better, did he not?

1941
02:34:07,024 --> 02:34:10,544
It's not just today that he's spoiling the atmosphere on location.

1942
02:34:10,544 --> 02:34:13,244
How are you managing your actor?

1943
02:34:13,244 --> 02:34:17,824
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not saying this to hear you apologize!

1944
02:34:24,044 --> 02:34:26,884
Why are you yelling, Director?

1945
02:34:28,204 --> 02:34:30,024
Can't you see that we're being delayed?

1946
02:34:30,024 --> 02:34:33,544
Pull yourself together quickly and prepare for the shoot!

1947
02:34:36,464 --> 02:34:40,284
I delayed less than you, Director. Didn't I?

1948
02:34:40,284 --> 02:34:41,864
What? "Didn't I"?

1949
02:34:41,864 --> 02:34:44,720
You take twice the time shooting each episode.

1950
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:47,620
Where did you get all the production costs for it?

1951
02:34:47,620 --> 02:34:48,964
You, bastard!

1952
02:34:48,964 --> 02:34:50,424
Bro...

1953
02:34:51,674 --> 02:34:53,544
Jae Won, you speak.

1954
02:34:53,544 --> 02:34:57,164
Do you think that I take too long?

1955
02:34:57,164 --> 02:34:59,724
What the hell is wrong with all of you?

1956
02:35:00,584 --> 02:35:03,604
- Well...
- Jae Won's not the type to think that.

1957
02:35:03,604 --> 02:35:06,564
A rude bastard like me would think that, though.

1958
02:35:06,564 --> 02:35:10,314
Director, let's never see each other ever again.

1959
02:35:10,314 --> 02:35:14,784
But we still have to wrap this up. So, let's do that.

1960
02:35:14,784 --> 02:35:17,594
I don't think I should be here today.

1961
02:35:17,594 --> 02:35:20,094
So I'll finish up here. You're okay with that, right?

1962
02:35:20,094 --> 02:35:22,224
Do you want me to stay longer?

1963
02:35:23,804 --> 02:35:26,244
And, Director...

1964
02:35:27,744 --> 02:35:31,174
you're at the top of this project. You're the head.

1965
02:35:31,174 --> 02:35:35,534
From now on, if you want to talk, speak directly to me.

1966
02:35:35,534 --> 02:35:39,884
The top person to top star, as you know.

1967
02:35:39,884 --> 02:35:43,904
Please talk to me face-to-face. I request that of you.

1968
02:35:43,904 --> 02:35:47,544
And before the shoot starts,

1969
02:35:47,544 --> 02:35:50,294
come with a certain picture in mind.

1970
02:35:54,704 --> 02:35:56,914
Let's go.

1971
02:35:56,914 --> 02:35:58,784
Hey! Damn it!

1972
02:36:06,474 --> 02:36:09,534
- I'll leave now.
- Wait a minute.

1973
02:36:10,534 --> 02:36:13,484
Hello, this is Kang Seo Joon, as you know.

1974
02:36:13,484 --> 02:36:15,704
How have you been?

1975
02:36:15,704 --> 02:36:18,264
I'm live-streaming for the first time in a while.

1976
02:36:18,264 --> 02:36:20,644
I'm taking a break from my shoot.

1977
02:36:20,644 --> 02:36:24,524
I missed you all, so I decided to live-stream.

1978
02:36:25,924 --> 02:36:27,860
As for this...

1979
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:30,400
Are you shocked, everyone?

1980
02:36:30,404 --> 02:36:34,374
This isn't real. Just makeup.

1981
02:36:35,534 --> 02:36:40,074
I won't tell you anymore. It could be a spoiler.

1982
02:36:40,074 --> 02:36:42,414
Did you all eat?

1983
02:36:42,414 --> 02:36:45,494
Of course, I ate. Today, I ate...

1984
02:36:56,364 --> 02:37:00,754
What are you doing? Do you want to come out for a second?

1985
02:37:05,314 --> 02:37:07,344
Do you remember when we were in high school?

1986
02:37:07,344 --> 02:37:09,244
I'm okay.

1987
02:37:10,104 --> 02:37:11,374
I don't think so...

1988
02:37:11,374 --> 02:37:15,314
I think we held hands after dating for 100 days.

1989
02:37:15,314 --> 02:37:17,054
That's how we were.

1990
02:37:17,054 --> 02:37:18,884
Did we?

1991
02:37:22,434 --> 02:37:24,574
Let me know if you're in pain.

1992
02:37:24,574 --> 02:37:26,314
Got it.

1993
02:37:42,524 --> 02:37:45,954
It's so nice to be out, Ji Woo. It's been too long.

1994
02:38:50,264 --> 02:38:51,814
Bro!

1995
02:39:03,034 --> 02:39:04,804
You drank again last night?

1996
02:39:04,804 --> 02:39:07,244
I told you not to barge in here without my permission.

1997
02:39:07,244 --> 02:39:10,454
Then, why don't you pick up the phone? Is it a prop?

1998
02:39:10,454 --> 02:39:12,864
Why don't you pick up?

1999
02:39:12,864 --> 02:39:15,544
Why? I don't have a shoot today.

2000
02:39:15,544 --> 02:39:17,814
Today?

2001
02:39:17,814 --> 02:39:21,154
That's not the problem! You may never have another shoot now!

2002
02:39:28,114 --> 02:39:30,184
You got killed.

2003
02:39:30,184 --> 02:39:33,944
Those thugs killed you off all of a sudden.

2004
02:39:33,944 --> 02:39:37,604
I'm sorry, sir. Are you still drunk? Do you still not get it?

2005
02:39:37,604 --> 02:39:41,394
They fired the main character! That bastard, Director Kim!

2006
02:39:43,974 --> 02:39:45,654
Are you okay?

2007
02:39:48,374 --> 02:39:49,804
Everyone out.

2008
02:39:49,804 --> 02:39:52,114
- Hey.
- Out.

2009
02:39:57,424 --> 02:39:58,864
Bro!

2010
02:40:02,744 --> 02:40:05,944
Bro, are you okay?

2011
02:40:05,944 --> 02:40:07,484
Bro...

2012
02:40:14,374 --> 02:40:17,674
Why are you trembling so much? It's okay.

2013
02:40:17,674 --> 02:40:19,944
It's my fault.

2014
02:40:19,944 --> 02:40:21,604
What?

2015
02:40:21,604 --> 02:40:25,854
Bro and the director argued because of me at the shoot.

2016
02:40:27,654 --> 02:40:30,444
It's okay. It's not your fault.

2017
02:40:30,444 --> 02:40:32,774
Pull yourself together. You can't fall apart, too.

2018
02:40:32,774 --> 02:40:34,974
You have to protect Seo Joon right now.

2019
02:40:34,974 --> 02:40:37,664
You're his manager. Right?

2020
02:40:37,664 --> 02:40:39,064
Yes. It's okay.

2021
02:40:39,064 --> 02:40:40,534
Bro, are you okay?

2022
02:40:40,534 --> 02:40:43,834
Should I call Dr. Yang to come over?

2023
02:40:46,184 --> 02:40:48,574
I'm okay. Just go.

2024
02:40:48,574 --> 02:40:50,504
I'll take care of everything.

2025
02:41:00,814 --> 02:41:03,054
Hello!

2026
02:41:03,054 --> 02:41:04,924
Let's go this way.

2027
02:41:04,924 --> 02:41:07,034
Oh, water! Water's dripping.

2028
02:41:07,034 --> 02:41:09,114
Wow! So many people have come already.

2029
02:41:09,114 --> 02:41:14,024
Hello! Yoo Ha, say hello to everyone. Hello! Hello!

2030
02:41:14,024 --> 02:41:16,464
- Where's Han Ji Woo?
- He hasn't come yet.

2031
02:41:16,464 --> 02:41:19,304
He does love to make the entrance.

2032
02:41:19,304 --> 02:41:22,354
It seems like the majority of people have arrived now.

2033
02:41:22,354 --> 02:41:24,784
Da Cham Village is about to get broadcast.

2034
02:41:24,784 --> 02:41:29,004
So there was an opinion that we should gather all and watch it beforehand.

2035
02:41:29,004 --> 02:41:34,264
As you all know, we have opposed it since the incident in the past.

2036
02:41:34,264 --> 02:41:36,304
But our top star Kang Seo Joon

2037
02:41:36,304 --> 02:41:38,717
spoke to the broadcasting station so that we could watch it

2038
02:41:38,717 --> 02:41:40,724
before it gets aired to check if there are any issues with it.

2039
02:41:40,724 --> 02:41:44,444
That's why we can watch it today.

2040
02:41:44,444 --> 02:41:48,044
Then, I'll play it now.

2041
02:41:48,044 --> 02:41:50,764
But Ji Woo hasn't arrived yet.

2042
02:41:52,514 --> 02:41:55,424
- I'll play it.
- Wait, Village Chief.

2043
02:41:55,424 --> 02:41:57,890
I said Ji Woo hasn't arrived yet.

2044
02:41:58,584 --> 02:42:04,204
I asked Ji Woo to come, so if you can please wait a bit...

2045
02:42:04,204 --> 02:42:06,514
I told him not to come.

2046
02:42:07,574 --> 02:42:10,904
- Why?
- If we watch and say something uncomfortable,

2047
02:42:10,904 --> 02:42:12,474
wouldn't the past stories come up?

2048
02:42:12,474 --> 02:42:15,100
If people speak ill about his parents, he shouldn't be here.

2049
02:42:15,100 --> 02:42:17,780
I was being considerate to him.

2050
02:42:17,784 --> 02:42:22,504
Let me ask you this.

2051
02:42:22,504 --> 02:42:25,444
What are you still so mad about?

2052
02:42:25,444 --> 02:42:27,784
Is it because of that scam incident in the past?

2053
02:42:27,784 --> 02:42:29,444
Is that why you are all still treating him like now?

2054
02:42:29,444 --> 02:42:32,614
You guys don't know about it well since you were young at that time.

2055
02:42:32,614 --> 02:42:34,890
Do you know how many people got scammed?

2056
02:42:34,890 --> 02:42:36,390
And how much money was involved in it?

2057
02:42:36,394 --> 02:42:38,364
That's a case that has already been adjudicated.

2058
02:42:38,364 --> 02:42:39,270
But if you still act like this—

2059
02:42:39,270 --> 02:42:42,530
Who brought that crook into our village?! Wasn't it Mr. Han?

2060
02:42:42,534 --> 02:42:45,384
I'm still infuriated if I think about that time.

2061
02:42:45,384 --> 02:42:48,684
How do we know if they planned the whole thing together?

2062
02:42:48,684 --> 02:42:51,154
I don't know it in detail.

2063
02:42:51,154 --> 02:42:56,754
But I heard Ji Woo's parents worked so hard to pay back all your money until they passed away.

2064
02:42:56,754 --> 02:42:58,644
But do you still want to act like this?

2065
02:42:58,644 --> 02:43:00,424
He's trying hard to live well!

2066
02:43:00,424 --> 02:43:04,474
What kind of resentment do you have for him?

2067
02:43:04,474 --> 02:43:08,194
Why do you keep acting like this to him?

2068
02:43:08,194 --> 02:43:10,634
- Are all the adults really adults?
- What?!

2069
02:43:10,634 --> 02:43:14,664
Your wound is the biggest, and you can't even see others' wounds.

2070
02:43:14,664 --> 02:43:18,034
Do you think anybody can take responsibility?

2071
02:43:18,964 --> 02:43:20,690
We, young people,

2072
02:43:20,690 --> 02:43:25,780
have our own weight that we struggle to carry.

2073
02:43:29,664 --> 02:43:31,454
Da Kyeong.

2074
02:43:46,114 --> 02:43:48,164
I'm sorry.

2075
02:43:48,164 --> 02:43:52,154
I should've not asked you to come back here.

2076
02:43:52,154 --> 02:43:56,184
Why did I run into you in Seoul and bring you all the way here?

2077
02:43:56,184 --> 02:43:59,594
I made you hear things that you didn't have to.

2078
02:43:59,594 --> 02:44:03,284
I'm really sorry.

2079
02:44:05,984 --> 02:44:08,334
It's all thanks to you and Yoo Ha that

2080
02:44:08,334 --> 02:44:11,534
I could've held out until now, so don't say that.

2081
02:44:11,534 --> 02:44:14,844
I'm fine. So don't worry.

2082
02:44:14,844 --> 02:44:16,434
Please don't cry.

2083
02:44:39,664 --> 02:44:42,124
I love you, Bro.
(Ho Min)

2084
02:44:43,124 --> 02:44:45,154
I love you, too.
(CEO Kim)

2085
02:46:00,904 --> 02:46:02,904
What time is it?

2086
02:46:03,604 --> 02:46:05,034
Let's just comb your hair today and go.

2087
02:46:05,034 --> 02:46:07,084
Okay.

2088
02:46:07,084 --> 02:46:08,204
Have a seat.

2089
02:46:08,204 --> 02:46:11,014
You have to go out soon. Why are you turning on the TV?

2090
02:46:11,014 --> 02:46:13,624
The Countryside Restaurant is on TV.

2091
02:46:13,624 --> 02:46:16,874
You're right. It'll air tonight.

2092
02:46:16,874 --> 02:46:20,734
The restaurant we will introduce to you today is run by a young chef.

2093
02:46:20,734 --> 02:46:24,884
It's an Italian restaurant he runs by himself in a rural village.

2094
02:46:25,964 --> 02:46:28,864
There's no hesitation in his move.He's a great chef! (Perfec-tion)

2095
02:46:28,864 --> 02:46:31,374
Just looking at his skill, he's an excellent chef.
(Countryside Restaurant)

2096
02:46:31,374 --> 02:46:33,624
I heard Kang Seo Joon has a connection with the owner here.
(Countryside Restaurant)

2097
02:46:33,624 --> 02:46:36,234
He came out on my V-log for a minute.
(Countryside Restaurant)

2098
02:46:36,234 --> 02:46:38,744
You two had great chemistry in that video.
(Actually, he had a connection with Seo Joon?)

2099
02:46:38,744 --> 02:46:40,904
Yes, we did have great chemistry.

2100
02:46:40,904 --> 02:46:44,864
Hello, it has been a while.
(Countryside Restaurant)

2101
02:46:44,864 --> 02:46:48,184
Not only is this unfamiliar, but it also doesn't suit a countryside village where traditional Korean food is appropriate.

2102
02:46:48,184 --> 02:46:51,084
I wanted to keep the identity of an Italian restaurant.

2103
02:46:51,084 --> 02:46:55,504
The menu is too difficult. Have you thought of doing some fusion?

2104
02:46:55,504 --> 02:46:58,934
How about giving up some of your stubbornness?

2105
02:46:58,934 --> 02:47:02,004
Or go work at a hotel and forget this place.

2106
02:47:02,004 --> 02:47:04,124
Kang Seo Joon, you're being pretty harsh.

2107
02:47:04,124 --> 02:47:06,964
(Furious Wok Movement)

2108
02:47:10,464 --> 02:47:12,964
It was fun.
(The Countryside Restaurant episode with Kang Seo Joon was so much fun!)

2109
02:47:12,964 --> 02:47:15,584
(He's very stubborn, but he's very handsome, too!)

2110
02:47:15,584 --> 02:47:17,034
(Finally, we figured out who he was.)

2111
02:47:17,034 --> 02:47:18,934
Is it a relief?

2112
02:47:19,774 --> 02:47:23,044
We have to film the solution episode of the Countryside Restaurant anyway.

2113
02:47:23,044 --> 02:47:24,549
So if he goes out and shoots that one,

2114
02:47:24,549 --> 02:47:27,354
wouldn't his getting kicked out of that drama be covered?

2115
02:47:36,294 --> 02:47:38,724
Hello?

2116
02:47:38,724 --> 02:47:40,824
It's been a while, Baby.

2117
02:47:40,824 --> 02:47:42,384
I'm sorry.

2118
02:47:42,384 --> 02:47:43,334
What are you sorry for?

2119
02:47:43,334 --> 02:47:45,154
The article will come out soon.

2120
02:47:45,154 --> 02:47:48,964
I wanted to stop it on my end, but I couldn't do it.

2121
02:47:54,434 --> 02:47:57,124
Yes, it's TB Entertainment.

2122
02:47:57,124 --> 02:48:00,324
There's nothing we can tell you at the moment.

2123
02:48:00,324 --> 02:48:01,604
No, we also have to check.

2124
02:48:01,604 --> 02:48:04,604
We also have to check about it.

2125
02:48:07,844 --> 02:48:11,874
Mr. Han!

2126
02:48:21,149 --> 02:48:25,260
(Kang Seo Joon is taking off from "When the Gangster Loves." There's a suspicion of his "specific phobia" relapse.)

2127
02:48:32,526 --> 02:48:34,386
Please, have some.

2128
02:48:37,546 --> 02:48:41,876
As you know, there is a lot of talk internally.

2129
02:48:42,666 --> 02:48:46,306
We are also just salary men.

2130
02:48:46,306 --> 02:48:48,860
You two, the producer and writer, are the ones to make the decision.

2131
02:48:48,860 --> 02:48:51,370
I heard it hit the highest viewing rate.

2132
02:48:51,376 --> 02:48:53,446
We'll get ready for the article to be released.

2133
02:48:53,446 --> 02:48:57,026
Honestly, it's not like he committed a crime. It's a health issue.

2134
02:48:57,026 --> 02:48:58,496
That's right.

2135
02:48:58,496 --> 02:49:02,656
But the question is if that's true.

2136
02:49:02,656 --> 02:49:07,506
If there's a rumor of discord and our show gets in trouble before it airs, it'll be a problem.

2137
02:49:07,506 --> 02:49:12,716
Also, Actor Seo Joon doesn't have to come out on the solution episode.

2138
02:49:12,716 --> 02:49:15,886
You said you wanted him to be on it before!

2139
02:49:17,856 --> 02:49:23,246
We think it'll make a headline if he's on the show.

2140
02:49:29,656 --> 02:49:32,036
I'm TB Entertainment's CEO, Kim Pil Hyun.

2141
02:49:32,036 --> 02:49:35,746
I'll make sure there is no noise. Why don't you trust me and give it a try?

2142
02:49:36,636 --> 02:49:38,376
Okay?

2143
02:49:56,836 --> 02:49:58,676
Hello!

2144
02:50:01,246 --> 02:50:02,866
Welcome.

2145
02:50:02,866 --> 02:50:05,506
I think this was the seat where Kang Seo Joon sat.

2146
02:50:05,506 --> 02:50:07,326
Let's sit here, then.

2147
02:50:09,516 --> 02:50:11,446
It's your first time here, right?

2148
02:50:11,446 --> 02:50:13,086
We are—

2149
02:50:13,086 --> 02:50:15,106
Hello!

2150
02:50:17,736 --> 02:50:19,616
Welcome.

2151
02:50:20,676 --> 02:50:24,206
Our restaurant's recommendations are Rigatoni Ragu pasta,

2152
02:50:24,206 --> 02:50:29,036
squid ink risotto, sirloin steak, and Goulash.

2153
02:50:29,036 --> 02:50:33,166
- It's a spicy Hungarian stew—
- Table for two, please!

2154
02:50:34,676 --> 02:50:37,276
It's really good!

2155
02:50:37,276 --> 02:50:39,636
The taste is excellent!

2156
02:50:43,176 --> 02:50:45,586
Thank you for the food.

2157
02:50:48,166 --> 02:50:50,006
It's delicious!

2158
02:50:50,786 --> 02:50:53,506
Welcome. Table for two?

2159
02:51:10,816 --> 02:51:13,616
If you don't come out, I'll just barge in!

2160
02:51:21,386 --> 02:51:22,806
What is it again?

2161
02:51:22,806 --> 02:51:25,116
I said I'm fine.

2162
02:51:29,406 --> 02:51:31,326
What were you up to?

2163
02:51:32,416 --> 02:51:34,236
I was working out.

2164
02:51:37,226 --> 02:51:38,896
Why did you come? I don't have any schedule.

2165
02:51:38,896 --> 02:51:42,456
Don't worry. I sorted out everything.

2166
02:51:42,456 --> 02:51:45,586
The Countryside Restaurant's recent episode was a great hit.

2167
02:51:45,586 --> 02:51:48,336
You should go on the solution episode for that restaurant as well.

2168
02:51:49,646 --> 02:51:51,786
Are you asking me to go there again?

2169
02:51:51,786 --> 02:51:53,626
- Are you joking with me?
- Why?

2170
02:51:53,626 --> 02:51:57,216
You have to show that you are totally fine!

2171
02:51:58,616 --> 02:52:00,596
But it's true.

2172
02:52:00,596 --> 02:52:04,116
I did have a relapse. It's true, so why?

2173
02:52:05,406 --> 02:52:07,366
It says that's correct.

2174
02:52:08,056 --> 02:52:13,156
Bro, that's not the reason why you are taking off from the show.

2175
02:52:13,156 --> 02:52:16,596
These broadcasting punks... Forget about it.

2176
02:52:17,746 --> 02:52:20,576
You can show that you overcame and are doing well.

2177
02:52:20,576 --> 02:52:23,496
Then it'll all pass as well. You told me this before.

2178
02:52:23,496 --> 02:52:25,756
This is the chance.

2179
02:52:26,536 --> 02:52:28,916
I'm not going. I can't go.

2180
02:52:32,816 --> 02:52:36,486
Also, please don't barge into my place like this anymore.

2181
02:52:38,376 --> 02:52:41,096
I don't have time to be lonely because of you guys.

2182
02:52:44,836 --> 02:52:46,706
Isn't that a good thing?

2183
02:52:48,136 --> 02:52:50,006
Please go now.

2184
02:52:55,296 --> 02:52:57,066
Yes, Baby.

2185
02:52:57,066 --> 02:52:59,376
I wanted to call you just now—

2186
02:53:06,106 --> 02:53:08,066
About Han Ji Woo?

2187
02:53:08,686 --> 02:53:10,736
This time it's Han Ji Woo?

2188
02:53:10,736 --> 02:53:12,096
Village Chief!

2189
02:53:12,096 --> 02:53:13,686
- Village Chief.
- Village Chief!

2190
02:53:13,686 --> 02:53:15,066
Village Chief?

2191
02:53:15,066 --> 02:53:18,226
- What is it?
- What's wrong with you, seriously?

2192
02:53:18,226 --> 02:53:21,416
What about it? What are you saying from this early in the morning?

2193
02:53:21,416 --> 02:53:23,786
Chief, there's this commotion going on. Do you have any idea?

2194
02:53:23,786 --> 02:53:27,336
Of course, he has an idea. Didn't someone here spread a weird rumor?
(Countryside Restaurant's handsome Chef Han Ji Woo, the friend of Kang Seo Joon, turned out to be a conman's son?!)

2195
02:53:27,336 --> 02:53:28,806
What are you talking about it?

2196
02:53:28,806 --> 02:53:31,216
Who would do that in our village?

2197
02:53:31,216 --> 02:53:33,656
But, Chief, this article is a lie!

2198
02:53:33,656 --> 02:53:35,946
Yes! This is a lie!

2199
02:53:35,946 --> 02:53:38,646
Now that his business finally started to do well.

2200
02:53:39,616 --> 02:53:41,066
Village Chief,

2201
02:53:41,066 --> 02:53:43,136
I'll call the reporter right now. Is that okay with you?

2202
02:53:43,136 --> 02:53:45,196
Of course! Go ahead and call.

2203
02:53:45,196 --> 02:53:47,946
It wouldn't be someone from our village.

2204
02:53:47,946 --> 02:53:50,546
Somebody in Seoul might have leaked it.

2205
02:53:50,546 --> 02:53:53,966
Do you think that makes sense? Who in Seoul knows about this?

2206
02:53:53,966 --> 02:53:55,806
How do I know that?

2207
02:53:55,806 --> 02:53:58,026
Are you sure you didn't say anything?

2208
02:53:58,026 --> 02:54:00,056
There's nothing!

2209
02:54:01,636 --> 02:54:03,056
Yes, Reporter Kim!

2210
02:54:03,056 --> 02:54:06,566
I'm Jeong Seong Yoon. I did an interview with you before.

2211
02:54:40,546 --> 02:54:47,450
(Ti Aspetto)
(Open)

2212
02:55:00,116 --> 02:55:03,176
Mr. Han, I'll stay with my mom today.
(Yoo Ha)

2213
02:55:03,176 --> 02:55:07,046
Hang in there! The truth will come out.
(Yoo Ha)

2214
02:55:37,516 --> 02:55:39,836
Isn't this crazy? Out of the blue?

2215
02:55:39,836 --> 02:55:42,406
Why would they attack Han Ji Woo?

2216
02:55:42,406 --> 02:55:45,206
It's #1 on every search engine.

2217
02:55:45,206 --> 02:55:48,476
It's driving me nuts. Are they going to film the show as it was scheduled?

2218
02:55:48,476 --> 02:55:50,836
This is not true, though!

2219
02:55:52,366 --> 02:55:54,166
Baby!

2220
02:55:54,996 --> 02:55:56,736
It's been a while, Ho Min.

2221
02:55:56,736 --> 02:55:58,376
How are you?

2222
02:55:58,376 --> 02:55:59,866
Shall I leave you two alone?

2223
02:55:59,866 --> 02:56:02,326
Yes, bye!

2224
02:56:02,326 --> 02:56:04,506
Why was it so hard for me to see you until now, Baby?

2225
02:56:04,506 --> 02:56:08,306
When does that solution episode of Countryside Restaurant air?

2226
02:56:09,836 --> 02:56:11,996
The shooting is in three days.

2227
02:56:11,996 --> 02:56:16,186
The broadcasting will happen two weeks after the filming.

2228
02:56:17,626 --> 02:56:20,266
Did you come here to help me when you are very busy?

2229
02:56:20,266 --> 02:56:23,876
Yes. Can you see my dark circles?

2230
02:56:24,816 --> 02:56:28,616
Then the show didn't get canceled yet.

2231
02:56:28,616 --> 02:56:30,326
No.

2232
02:56:31,536 --> 02:56:35,136
- Should I make you an espresso with three shots?
- I already drank one.

2233
02:56:35,976 --> 02:56:39,946
Kang Seo Joon also needs that show to be aired. Right?

2234
02:56:39,946 --> 02:56:41,646
Right.

2235
02:56:42,826 --> 02:56:46,306
Didn't your parents also know Ji Woo's parents?

2236
02:56:47,806 --> 02:56:50,896
There's an entertainment reporter, Reporter Kim.

2237
02:56:50,896 --> 02:56:55,476
The one who did an interview with Ji Woo's friend, Ms. Jeong Seong Yoon, told me.

2238
02:56:55,476 --> 02:56:59,476
That reporter said that conman and Ji Woo's father

2239
02:56:59,476 --> 02:57:02,736
were colleagues who worked together in TB Group.

2240
02:57:04,426 --> 02:57:07,096
Tell me everything that you know.

2241
02:57:08,436 --> 02:57:11,926
Ji Woo moved to a rural village in Haseong when he became a high school student with his family.

2242
02:57:11,926 --> 02:57:15,936
- This is Mr. Yoon.
- Oh, you are Ji Woo.

2243
02:57:15,936 --> 02:57:17,606
- Hello.
- I heard a lot about you.

2244
02:57:17,606 --> 02:57:21,346
How is your life away from Seoul City? Is it comfortable?

2245
02:57:21,346 --> 02:57:23,126
You raised your son very well.

2246
02:57:23,126 --> 02:57:24,976
I don't know that well.

2247
02:57:24,976 --> 02:57:27,746
But he was a friend of Ji Woo's father.

2248
02:57:29,006 --> 02:57:30,836
I guess you didn't know about it!

2249
02:57:30,836 --> 02:57:34,666
- If you lose, you better buy makgeolli for us.
- Of course, I should buy it!

2250
02:57:34,666 --> 02:57:37,336
You can't take that back!

2251
02:57:39,796 --> 02:57:42,376
I guess you went through a hard time.

2252
02:57:42,376 --> 02:57:44,746
It's okay now.

2253
02:57:44,746 --> 02:57:47,536
So for just ten years from now on,

2254
02:57:47,536 --> 02:57:50,686
if you put 300,000 every month, you'll get 500 million won.

2255
02:57:50,686 --> 02:57:55,666
Just trust me and put 300,000 every month. And on the date I told you,

2256
02:57:55,666 --> 02:57:58,136
put in all of the big chunk of money you have.

2257
02:57:58,136 --> 02:58:00,186
Then it'll double the price. It's something like that.

2258
02:58:00,186 --> 02:58:03,756
- Is it okay to trust that?
- Mother! I can hear you.

2259
02:58:03,756 --> 02:58:06,316
You'll make this son sad if you don't trust me.

2260
02:58:06,316 --> 02:58:08,976
You can trust me. I'll make you all rich!

2261
02:58:08,976 --> 02:58:11,496
I heard then that one of his colleagues

2262
02:58:11,496 --> 02:58:15,296
started insurance work with their friend's recommendation.

2263
02:58:15,296 --> 02:58:17,836
What did I do wrong?

2264
02:58:17,836 --> 02:58:21,356
- As a result, Ji Woo's father indeed introduced him to the village.
- I can't do it!

2265
02:58:21,356 --> 02:58:24,076
What's wrong with you? Can't you trust me?

2266
02:58:24,076 --> 02:58:27,466
But taking the insurance was an individual's choice.

2267
02:58:27,466 --> 02:58:30,096
Hey, Yoon Jeong Hoon!

2268
02:58:30,096 --> 02:58:32,006
Jeong Hoon!

2269
02:58:32,006 --> 02:58:33,556
The culprit had already gotten arrested.

2270
02:58:33,556 --> 02:58:37,636
So it's a total rumor! There's no need to even respond to this.

2271
02:58:37,636 --> 02:58:40,756
It all comes out if you look up a little bit.

2272
02:58:40,756 --> 02:58:43,466
Who wants to know about the truth these days?

2273
02:58:43,466 --> 02:58:46,676
If it's fun on the surface, they just trust it and forget about it.

2274
02:58:46,676 --> 02:58:51,496
Baby, it makes me feel bad.

2275
02:58:51,496 --> 02:58:53,956
Before Ji Woo's parents passed away,

2276
02:58:53,956 --> 02:58:56,746
they came to my family and asked to lend them money.

2277
02:58:56,746 --> 02:58:59,256
They wanted to pay back the debt of the Da Cham Village people.

2278
02:59:01,216 --> 02:59:04,026
But they passed away on that day in a car accident.

2279
02:59:06,056 --> 02:59:09,566
I don't know! It feels like everything is my fault.

2280
02:59:09,566 --> 02:59:13,546
Even the Countryside Restaurant show. Who would've known things would go this way?

2281
02:59:14,436 --> 02:59:16,956
What bastard said this, seriously?!

2282
02:59:17,816 --> 02:59:20,946
First, organize these previous materials and send them to the broadcasting station.

2283
02:59:20,946 --> 02:59:22,396
So that they don't cancel the show.

2284
02:59:22,396 --> 02:59:25,616
It's an important work for both Han Ji Woo and Kang Seo Joon.

2285
02:59:26,316 --> 02:59:29,816
- This must have hurt Ji Woo again.
- Do you think he would've not known about this?

2286
02:59:29,816 --> 02:59:34,066
- What?
- Han Ji Woo would've seen this coming.

2287
02:59:34,066 --> 02:59:36,506
What are you talking about?

2288
02:59:36,506 --> 02:59:38,866
I don't know, but I feel like it.

2289
02:59:38,866 --> 02:59:40,656
I don't know the reason.

2290
02:59:40,656 --> 02:59:44,236
But he always thinks about the worst possible thing first.

2291
02:59:45,696 --> 02:59:49,646
By the way, are you not keeping in touch with Ji Woo?

2292
02:59:49,646 --> 02:59:52,936
You guys were close to each other. Why don't you contact him again?

2293
02:59:52,936 --> 02:59:55,306
The relationship between him and I was over a long time ago.

2294
02:59:55,306 --> 02:59:57,636
If we don't keep in touch, that's it.

2295
02:59:58,936 --> 03:00:01,766
I'll get going. I have some news to cover.

2296
03:00:05,696 --> 03:00:08,166
I ordered some fried chicken, so eat first before returning to work.

2297
03:00:08,166 --> 03:00:10,346
- Thank you, Baby.
- You don't have to walk out with me!

2298
03:00:10,346 --> 03:00:13,576
It was so good to see you today. Bye!

2299
03:00:17,276 --> 03:00:18,746
Yes, Producer.

2300
03:00:18,746 --> 03:00:21,116
I was about to call you.

2301
03:00:22,666 --> 03:00:24,796
That is really not true.

2302
03:00:24,796 --> 03:00:26,856
If you look up a little bit, it all comes out.

2303
03:00:26,856 --> 03:00:29,056
(There was something ominous about his face.)

2304
03:00:29,056 --> 03:00:31,916
(A conman's son??)

2305
03:00:31,916 --> 03:00:34,956
(Didn't he open the restaurant with that money??)

2306
03:00:34,956 --> 03:00:37,916
(Don't stay close to Kang Seo Joon.)

2307
03:00:37,916 --> 03:00:40,056
(Why not? It's two peas in a pod.)

2308
03:00:53,316 --> 03:00:56,836
Ji Woo, we'll resolve it, so don't cancel the filming.
(Kim Pil Hyun)

2309
03:00:56,836 --> 03:00:59,376
It's necessary work for Seo Joon Hyung as well.
(Kim Pil Hyun)

2310
03:01:03,676 --> 03:01:05,506
Hello.

2311
03:01:05,506 --> 03:01:07,786
Is this place up for business?

2312
03:01:07,786 --> 03:01:10,116
Why is it so dark in here?

2313
03:01:11,136 --> 03:01:13,146
- The thing is...
- First of all!

2314
03:01:13,146 --> 03:01:15,686
Why don't you make us something?

2315
03:01:15,686 --> 03:01:18,576
Bring us your most confident dish.

2316
03:01:23,316 --> 03:01:25,936
Let's go inside!

2317
03:01:25,936 --> 03:01:28,816
Can we also have something absolutely delicious?

2318
03:01:28,816 --> 03:01:30,856
Please give us the authentic Italian dish.

2319
03:01:30,856 --> 03:01:32,656
I want "Aglio e Olio"!

2320
03:01:32,656 --> 03:01:34,866
I'll have the same one as her.

2321
03:01:34,866 --> 03:01:36,650
But why did you make it so dark in here? Turn on the light.

2322
03:01:36,650 --> 03:01:38,350
Otherwise, ghosts will come out!

2323
03:01:38,356 --> 03:01:40,826
- Why? It has a nice ambiance.
- What ambiance?

2324
03:01:40,826 --> 03:01:44,086
What are you waiting for?

2325
03:01:44,086 --> 03:01:47,746
We didn't make that article go out.

2326
03:01:47,746 --> 03:01:50,276
Whoever that bastard is, we won't stand still if we catch them.

2327
03:01:50,276 --> 03:01:52,886
What was that? False information?

2328
03:01:52,886 --> 03:01:55,816
- Spreading false information!
- Yes! With that accusation,

2329
03:01:55,816 --> 03:01:57,776
I'll make them go to jail.

2330
03:02:07,286 --> 03:02:11,156
Yes, let's find the culprit and send them to prison!

2331
03:02:11,156 --> 03:02:13,156
Yes, so don't worry.

2332
03:02:13,156 --> 03:02:15,666
Let's enjoy the food first.

2333
03:02:15,666 --> 03:02:19,426
I had the food here with Seo Joon before.

2334
03:02:19,426 --> 03:02:22,216
It was delicious! What should I eat today?

2335
03:02:22,216 --> 03:02:25,276
- Do you want me to recommend you something?
- "Aglio e Olio" is delicious, Village Chief.

2336
03:02:25,276 --> 03:02:26,956
Is that so?

2337
03:02:40,366 --> 03:02:41,626
What if he doesn't come out?

2338
03:02:41,626 --> 03:02:43,536
You just have to drag him out!

2339
03:02:43,536 --> 03:02:45,856
Do you know how much I begged the producer?

2340
03:02:45,856 --> 03:02:48,146
We'll resolve the issue in time.

2341
03:02:48,146 --> 03:02:50,156
So go to Bro's place and check if he's awake.

2342
03:02:50,156 --> 03:02:52,266
I'll check and call you back.

2343
03:02:52,266 --> 03:02:53,846
Okay.

2344
03:02:55,186 --> 03:02:56,926
I have to pack my stuff.

2345
03:02:56,926 --> 03:02:59,586
And I have to bring back the camping car, too.

2346
03:02:59,586 --> 03:03:01,496
Bro.

2347
03:03:01,496 --> 03:03:03,746
I don't know if you know about this.

2348
03:03:03,746 --> 03:03:06,246
Actually, there's another issue that came out about Han Ji Woo.

2349
03:03:06,246 --> 03:03:08,096
I'm aware of it.

2350
03:03:54,556 --> 03:03:56,836
- It's here.
- Hello!

2351
03:03:56,836 --> 03:03:58,316
It took me some more time since it snowed.

2352
03:03:58,316 --> 03:04:00,126
It's okay.

2353
03:04:04,016 --> 03:04:07,296
Village Chief, my girlfriend is a very awesome reporter.

2354
03:04:07,296 --> 03:04:10,136
- Okay.
- I know it's a bit tight,

2355
03:04:10,136 --> 03:04:13,516
but we have something to do in collaboration.

2356
03:04:13,516 --> 03:04:16,706
- Coke?
- No, not the drink.

2357
03:04:16,706 --> 03:04:20,446
You and I have work to do together.

2358
03:04:20,446 --> 03:04:21,966
Okay.

2359
03:04:23,396 --> 03:04:26,476
Okay, the Countryside Restaurant solution team, let's go inside.

2360
03:04:27,406 --> 03:04:28,816
Did you practice a lot?

2361
03:04:28,816 --> 03:04:30,406
Hello!

2362
03:04:30,406 --> 03:04:33,226
Your face turned gaunt!

2363
03:04:34,416 --> 03:04:36,966
Let's see the menus you have developed during that time.

2364
03:04:36,966 --> 03:04:40,826
It's fusion menus. Why don't you have a seat here, Mr. Kang Seo Joon?

2365
03:04:42,036 --> 03:04:44,066
I'm very excited.

2366
03:04:52,136 --> 03:04:54,966
It's soybean paste pasta, Chamnamul risotto,

2367
03:04:54,966 --> 03:04:57,666
and potato pizza pancake.

2368
03:04:57,666 --> 03:05:00,516
The menu changed drastically!

2369
03:05:00,516 --> 03:05:01,866
(Seo Joon, please do the taste review first!)

2370
03:05:15,756 --> 03:05:17,576
How is it?

2371
03:05:17,576 --> 03:05:19,746
What about putting some cream in this dish?

2372
03:05:19,746 --> 03:05:21,806
The soybean paste taste is so strong right now.

2373
03:05:21,806 --> 03:05:25,036
So it feels like you put pasta noodles in soybean paste stew.

2374
03:05:25,036 --> 03:05:29,946
Kang Seo Joon, you are good at remarking!

2375
03:05:29,946 --> 03:05:32,070
Excuse me!

2376
03:05:32,836 --> 03:05:34,376
Hello.

2377
03:05:34,376 --> 03:05:35,836
I'm the Village Chief of this village.

2378
03:05:35,836 --> 03:05:39,956
I heard that our Ji Woo is shooting a show today.

2379
03:05:39,956 --> 03:05:41,806
So I brought some yogurt for everyone!

2380
03:05:41,806 --> 03:05:43,626
Thank you so much!

2381
03:05:43,626 --> 03:05:46,056
This is mine. Then, good luck with the filming!

2382
03:05:46,056 --> 03:05:47,436
Yes, have a nice day!

2383
03:05:47,436 --> 03:05:49,336
Ji Woo, fighting!

2384
03:05:49,336 --> 03:05:52,386
- Have a nice day!
- Good luck!

2385
03:05:52,386 --> 03:05:53,956
Wow, you are famous!

2386
03:05:53,956 --> 03:05:55,646
We got so many yogurts.

2387
03:05:55,646 --> 03:05:58,696
Excuse me, hello!

2388
03:05:58,696 --> 03:06:02,746
Our Ji Woo likes this dried persimmon.

2389
03:06:02,746 --> 03:06:06,506
- Thank you.
- Ji Woo, you picked all these persimmons, remember?

2390
03:06:06,506 --> 03:06:08,426
Why don't you share this with the staff?

2391
03:06:08,426 --> 03:06:11,416
And use some in your cooking, too. Okay?

2392
03:06:11,416 --> 03:06:15,876
Kim Sun Ja Persimmons, fighting!

2393
03:06:19,276 --> 03:06:20,406
It's funny.

2394
03:06:20,406 --> 03:06:22,336
I got an idea.

2395
03:06:22,336 --> 03:06:26,636
What if we make specific dishes using local produce?

2396
03:06:26,636 --> 03:06:28,046
For example,

2397
03:06:28,046 --> 03:06:33,376
using this, can be this grandma's dried persimmon salad. That kind of way.

2398
03:06:34,366 --> 03:06:37,346
It suits well with our program's purpose.

2399
03:06:37,346 --> 03:06:39,156
Why don't you consider that?

2400
03:06:40,766 --> 03:06:42,776
Hello.

2401
03:06:42,776 --> 03:06:44,496
Why did you bring so much apple juice?

2402
03:06:44,496 --> 03:06:46,656
Also, aren't those peppers?

2403
03:07:09,416 --> 03:07:11,306
Are you okay?

2404
03:07:17,376 --> 03:07:19,656
Just do one thing.

2405
03:07:21,616 --> 03:07:24,726
Don't worry about me. Focus on yourself.

2406
03:07:27,756 --> 03:07:29,296
All right.

2407
03:07:39,806 --> 03:07:43,360
You said it puts you in danger if you stay by my side.

2408
03:07:43,360 --> 03:07:45,680
You were right.

2409
03:07:45,686 --> 03:07:49,276
That's why my parents left me, too. Right?

2410
03:07:51,306 --> 03:07:53,956
You also experienced something you didn't have to, because of me.

2411
03:07:53,956 --> 03:07:55,796
But...

2412
03:07:58,346 --> 03:08:00,656
you shouldn't get hurt once you've left me.

2413
03:08:01,566 --> 03:08:03,696
You said it wasn't true.

2414
03:08:04,896 --> 03:08:07,576
Why are you sitting back when it wasn't true?

2415
03:08:08,856 --> 03:08:11,620
Stop crouching down.

2416
03:08:11,620 --> 03:08:13,730
Live properly.

2417
03:08:27,856 --> 03:08:31,456
So, he really told you to leave?

2418
03:08:31,456 --> 03:08:33,596
Yes. He said he's got one last thing to do—

2419
03:08:33,596 --> 03:08:36,056
What's there for him to do?

2420
03:08:36,056 --> 03:08:39,106
Han Ji Woo and Seo Joon, both of them...

2421
03:08:39,106 --> 03:08:40,546
They didn't look good.

2422
03:08:40,546 --> 03:08:43,266
Whatever! I don't want to hear it!

2423
03:08:43,266 --> 03:08:45,236
CEO—

2424
03:08:46,806 --> 03:08:50,586
I have... I have something to say to you.

2425
03:09:29,226 --> 03:09:30,506
Yes, Dad.

2426
03:09:30,506 --> 03:09:35,076
I saw the article. You said you were okay, but are you sick again?

2427
03:09:35,076 --> 03:09:36,260
Don't worry, I'm fine.

2428
03:09:36,260 --> 03:09:39,250
How can I not worry about you when you're sick?

2429
03:09:39,256 --> 03:09:42,956
Do you have to make your parents worry when we live far away?

2430
03:09:42,956 --> 03:09:46,836
This is nothing to me, so please don't worry.

2431
03:09:46,836 --> 03:09:50,696
Don't you know people will come at you crazy when there's an issue?

2432
03:09:50,696 --> 03:09:54,306
You know we got harassed so much that we had to move this far away without you.

2433
03:09:55,966 --> 03:09:57,136
Dad.

2434
03:09:57,136 --> 03:09:59,076
Yes?

2435
03:09:59,076 --> 03:10:00,486
Did you eat?

2436
03:10:00,486 --> 03:10:01,976
Your mom and I ate something.

2437
03:10:01,976 --> 03:10:04,616
You should go to see the doctor, Seo Joon.

2438
03:10:04,616 --> 03:10:07,546
And be careful not to have more weird rumors.

2439
03:10:07,546 --> 03:10:09,196
Can't you ask me if I ate anything—

2440
03:10:09,196 --> 03:10:11,546
If we knew things would go this way, we wouldn't have let you become an actor.

2441
03:10:11,546 --> 03:10:14,266
I'm really regretting it right now.

2442
03:10:15,756 --> 03:10:16,906
At least I made a lot of money.

2443
03:10:16,906 --> 03:10:18,660
What?

2444
03:10:18,660 --> 03:10:21,750
How can you talk about money at this moment? When did we ask you for that?

2445
03:10:21,750 --> 03:10:24,646
I have to go filming, so I'll hang up now. Don't worry about me too much.

2446
03:10:24,646 --> 03:10:27,206
Seo Joon. Kang Seo Joon!

2447
03:10:46,073 --> 03:10:47,853
Want a drink?

2448
03:10:51,543 --> 03:10:56,823
TB Entertainment CEO went to the village chief and the villagers and told them everything.

2449
03:10:59,813 --> 03:11:01,713
Thanks.

2450
03:11:01,713 --> 03:11:03,863
I didn't do anything.

2451
03:11:08,463 --> 03:11:11,143
Kang Seo Joon made you feel lonely, huh?

2452
03:11:15,323 --> 03:11:20,193
After I went off the grid with you, I went to the States and started dating someone right away.

2453
03:11:20,933 --> 03:11:24,683
When I first went to the States, my situation felt so unstable.

2454
03:11:24,683 --> 03:11:28,353
I wondered if the guy would get sick of me because I was so obsessed.

2455
03:11:28,353 --> 03:11:30,893
I worried a lot about it.

2456
03:11:30,893 --> 03:11:36,213
But he's the one who started getting obsessive over me.

2457
03:11:36,213 --> 03:11:39,300
I had found what I wanted to study, so I was studying hard.

2458
03:11:39,300 --> 03:11:41,850
I had so many places I wanted to go, too.

2459
03:11:44,493 --> 03:11:47,413
And I thought about you a lot then.

2460
03:11:48,483 --> 03:11:54,780
"Oh, it's not true that Han Ji Woo didn't love me."

2461
03:11:55,373 --> 03:11:58,823
They say you never know until you experience things yourself.

2462
03:11:59,943 --> 03:12:06,033
So, that's when I stopped praying for your misery.

2463
03:12:11,093 --> 03:12:15,353
I'm sorry for realizing too late.

2464
03:12:17,653 --> 03:12:20,033
I didn't say all this for you to feel bad.

2465
03:12:25,183 --> 03:12:27,463
It's a good thing.

2466
03:12:27,463 --> 03:12:32,063
It means there are more people you can understand.

2467
03:12:43,843 --> 03:12:45,823
Kang Seo Joon...

2468
03:12:48,393 --> 03:12:51,333
already feels it and knows it all.

2469
03:12:54,233 --> 03:12:56,703
He even expresses that through his acting.

2470
03:13:06,463 --> 03:13:12,773
So, do you still hope that he just gets it?

2471
03:13:17,353 --> 03:13:21,103
But this time, I think it will be too tough for Kang Seo Joon.

2472
03:13:23,673 --> 03:13:26,480
You came back here,

2473
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:30,640
so you can get back with Kang Seo Joon again.

2474
03:13:32,623 --> 03:13:34,740
If not...

2475
03:13:35,630 --> 03:13:38,610
oh, if not...

2476
03:13:39,993 --> 03:13:42,753
you tried to end it all.

2477
03:13:44,133 --> 03:13:48,303
Did you go on TV knowing all this already?

2478
03:13:56,273 --> 03:13:58,913
See?

2479
03:13:58,913 --> 03:14:03,913
I dated you for five years. But I don't get this one this time.

2480
03:14:12,843 --> 03:14:18,393
I left my relationship with him to flow on its own.

2481
03:14:19,913 --> 03:14:24,023
As I have always done, I was being defensive.

2482
03:14:25,443 --> 03:14:31,443
Because a year with Kang Seo Joon was enough for me.

2483
03:14:32,213 --> 03:14:38,303
He would remain in my life forever even if I was together with him only for that long.

2484
03:14:39,613 --> 03:14:43,563
For him, I'd be someone who'd go away in a year.

2485
03:14:49,153 --> 03:14:52,583
Although I wished that weren't the case...

2486
03:14:52,583 --> 03:14:56,273
Perhaps I wished that Kang Seo Joon would suffer immensely...

2487
03:14:57,093 --> 03:14:59,693
I hid behind the wall once again.

2488
03:15:37,613 --> 03:15:41,923
Ji Woo, where are you? You turned your phone off.

2489
03:15:43,553 --> 03:15:47,333
Ji Woo, please don't go.

2490
03:15:48,753 --> 03:15:52,793
Han Ji Woo, where are you? What are you up to?

2491
03:15:52,793 --> 03:15:55,483
Did I really mess up?

2492
03:15:55,483 --> 03:15:57,553
Let's talk things out.

2493
03:15:58,753 --> 03:16:02,523
I really loved being with you.

2494
03:16:04,903 --> 03:16:07,550
Merry Christmas!

2495
03:16:07,550 --> 03:16:10,700
It's Christmas day today. What are you doing?

2496
03:16:10,703 --> 03:16:12,843
I'm by myself.

2497
03:16:15,883 --> 03:16:18,793
I just heard a knock.

2498
03:16:21,133 --> 03:16:25,243
I ran out thinking it was you. But it wasn't.

2499
03:16:27,943 --> 03:16:31,473
I'm so bored and lonely being alone.

2500
03:16:39,213 --> 03:16:41,563
Should I move?

2501
03:16:41,563 --> 03:16:44,353
Would I feel better if I moved?

2502
03:16:46,173 --> 03:16:49,403
I wonder why you left me.

2503
03:16:49,403 --> 03:16:55,243
But I wonder if you're doing okay.

2504
03:16:56,323 --> 03:16:58,983
I really hope you're doing okay.

2505
03:17:00,973 --> 03:17:03,043
You're doing well, right?

2506
03:17:07,843 --> 03:17:09,913
Happy birthday, Ji Woo.

2507
03:17:09,913 --> 03:17:14,510
Eat lots of yummy food. Don't cook today. Eat out.

2508
03:17:15,303 --> 03:17:20,283
I wish I could hug you today. Just once.

2509
03:18:11,908 --> 03:18:14,498
Yes, Ji Woo?
- Yes.

2510
03:18:14,498 --> 03:18:17,858
Seo Joon is not picking up his phone. Is he there?

2511
03:18:17,858 --> 03:18:20,278
He has an interview to do.

2512
03:18:20,278 --> 03:18:22,758
Didn't he go up to Seoul?

2513
03:18:22,758 --> 03:18:25,348
He told us that he'd come up tomorrow.

2514
03:18:39,838 --> 03:18:42,700
(Exclusive | Kang Seo Joon had an on-site attitude controversy, "A burdensome actor. We've always had to put him on a pedestal.")

2515
03:18:45,718 --> 03:18:49,968
(Dad: Don't forget to go to the hospital! Please let your mom and dad live peacefully.)

2516
03:18:49,968 --> 03:18:54,068
- What are you doing over there?
- What are you doing outside? It's cold!

2517
03:18:55,238 --> 03:18:57,618
Did you see Kang Seo Joon by any chance?

2518
03:18:57,618 --> 03:18:59,448
I saw him earlier.

2519
03:18:59,448 --> 03:19:01,958
When? Did he say anything about where he was going?

2520
03:19:01,958 --> 03:19:06,778
He didn't say anything about that, but he asked me if I went hiking with you.

2521
03:19:06,778 --> 03:19:08,968
He asked if you went hiking with Han Ji Woo?

2522
03:19:08,968 --> 03:19:12,808
Yes. So I told him we usually went to Yongjin Mountain.

2523
03:19:12,808 --> 03:19:17,018
What's going on? His car is also not here, so he must have gone to Seoul.

2524
03:19:18,628 --> 03:19:20,918
Do you want some fried chicken—

2525
03:19:23,868 --> 03:19:26,728
It would've been a problem ifHan Ji Woo had come to eat this with us.

2526
03:19:26,728 --> 03:19:28,668
There's only one chicken.

2527
03:19:28,668 --> 03:19:31,048
Please! Why are you saying it like that?

2528
03:19:31,048 --> 03:19:34,418
I mean, if he agreed to come earlier, I would've bought two chickens.

2529
03:19:34,418 --> 03:19:36,698
But it's too late now.

2530
03:19:38,658 --> 03:19:43,018
So I'm saying my baby can eat as much as you want!

2531
03:19:43,018 --> 03:19:46,908
This cartilage part is delicious! So don't forget to eat this part, too.

2532
03:19:46,908 --> 03:19:49,588
Yes, sure.

2533
03:19:53,648 --> 03:19:59,158
But I wonder what happened for his eyes to look that scary?

2534
03:20:08,958 --> 03:20:11,818
Da Kyeong...

2535
03:20:11,818 --> 03:20:14,078
Da Kyeong!

2536
03:20:17,258 --> 03:20:20,218
It's okay. It's okay.

2537
03:20:20,218 --> 03:20:22,468
Since it has been five years,

2538
03:20:22,468 --> 03:20:25,508
I thought I would win.

2539
03:20:25,508 --> 03:20:28,498
I thought old memories would win...

2540
03:20:28,498 --> 03:20:31,018
But I lost.

2541
03:20:31,018 --> 03:20:33,088
Because of Han Ji Woo,

2542
03:20:33,088 --> 03:20:38,078
I studied hard and did my best to excel...

2543
03:20:38,078 --> 03:20:43,008
I tried so much to come back in perfect shape!

2544
03:20:47,458 --> 03:20:50,028
Doing because of someone is not important.

2545
03:20:50,028 --> 03:20:53,698
What's important is that we came all this way.

2546
03:20:53,698 --> 03:20:55,678
You did great. Okay?

2547
03:20:55,678 --> 03:20:57,938
So please don't cry.

2548
03:21:12,918 --> 03:21:15,198
You cooked this completely.

2549
03:21:16,918 --> 03:21:18,988
I told you to make the pan hot first,

2550
03:21:18,988 --> 03:21:20,638
close the lid, and turn off the heat. Then it'll come out half-cooked yolks—

2551
03:21:20,638 --> 03:21:23,728
Forget about it. Please don't say it anymore.

2552
03:21:23,728 --> 03:21:26,018
You promised not to criticize me anymore.

2553
03:21:29,128 --> 03:21:32,748
Okay, I won't do it.

2554
03:21:32,748 --> 03:21:35,198
Are you done cooking now?

2555
03:21:35,198 --> 03:21:37,938
It's healthier to eat this way.

2556
03:21:47,805 --> 03:21:53,935
When you are angry or embarrassed and don't want to talk, you start organizing.

2557
03:21:54,805 --> 03:21:57,715
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

2558
03:21:58,735 --> 03:22:01,063
I'm not mad.

2559
03:22:01,063 --> 03:22:04,763
Don't lie to me. You are angry right now.

2560
03:22:12,979 --> 03:22:20,207
I-Is it so hard to hang... your clothes in the same direction?

2561
03:22:21,568 --> 03:22:24,098
I'm not angry about that. I can fix it, too!

2562
03:22:24,098 --> 03:22:27,620
But... I'm saying this because it's not just once.

2563
03:22:27,620 --> 03:22:29,920
You can adjust that on your own.

2564
03:22:37,026 --> 03:22:39,476
- What is it?
- I'm saying I'm sorry.

2565
03:22:39,500 --> 03:22:41,480
- Stop it.
- I'm sorry!

2566
03:22:41,480 --> 03:22:44,360
- Even so...
- Okay, okay.

2567
03:22:47,700 --> 03:22:50,020
Okay, D chord.

2568
03:22:50,020 --> 03:22:51,970
Try it. I taught you this before.

2569
03:22:51,970 --> 03:22:53,720
This is the D chord.

2570
03:22:54,840 --> 03:22:56,390
And G chord.

2571
03:22:59,140 --> 03:23:01,100
Let's try it now.

2572
03:23:01,100 --> 03:23:03,310
Get ready.

2573
03:23:03,310 --> 03:23:05,570

It's perfect right now.

2585
03:23:58,700 --> 03:24:01,850

- Please stop it.

Look over there.

03:24:31,750 --> 03:24:32,970

You can wear this on your finger,

03:24:46,010 --> 03:24:51,030
and sometimes you can put it on a necklace like this.

2600
03:24:53,150 --> 03:24:57,140
Also, I have one more gift for you.

2601
03:24:57,140 --> 03:24:59,980
- Another one?
- Come out with me. It's outside.

2602
03:24:59,980 --> 03:25:02,950

Let me not wear it for once!

2605
03:25:13,620 --> 03:25:15,110
I think it'll look great on you. Just try it once.

2606
03:25:15,110 --> 03:25:18,240
Just once. Please!

2607
03:25:20,050 --> 03:25:23,280
♫ The way you are looking at me ♫

2608
03:25:23,280 --> 03:25:26,180
It really looks good on you!

2609
03:25:26,180 --> 03:25:28,060
It really does.

2610
03:25:28,060 --> 03:25:31,620

2611
03:25:31,620 --> 03:25:40,150

♫ You and I are twinkling ♫

2614
03:26:20,690 --> 03:26:22,560
I want to try it.

2615
03:26:30,600 --> 03:26:32,350
So...

2616
03:26:33,510 --> 03:26:37,680
what is it you want to say?

2617
03:26:37,680 --> 03:26:39,240
So what I want to say is—

2618
03:26:39,240 --> 03:26:43,370
Say it. Look into my eyes and say it.

2619
03:26:49,500 --> 03:26:53,090
Ji Woo, you're so charming.

2620
03:26:54,270 --> 03:26:55,890
Was I really bad?

2621
03:26:55,890 --> 03:26:58,810
You think that was good? Let's just eat.

2622
03:26:58,810 --> 03:27:00,700
That's why I said I don't want to do it.

2623
03:27:00,700 --> 03:27:02,490
I'll save this.

2624
03:27:02,490 --> 03:27:04,100
No. I said no.

2625
03:27:04,100 --> 03:27:07,250
Please... It's just so cute.

2626
03:27:07,250 --> 03:27:09,220
- Don't do this.
- You look really good on the screen.

2627
03:27:09,220 --> 03:27:11,510
Ji Woo, I think you should be an actor.

2628
03:27:11,510 --> 03:27:12,550
You said I can't act.

2629
03:27:12,550 --> 03:27:14,920
I think you'd be good in campus genres.

2630
03:27:14,920 --> 03:27:17,840
Don't tease me. You said I suck.

2631
03:27:17,840 --> 03:27:19,710
It looks like you're wearing a school uniform.

2632
03:27:19,710 --> 03:27:21,890
You tape it.

2633
03:27:21,890 --> 03:27:23,650
I'll record.

2634
03:27:23,650 --> 03:27:27,010
From now on, you practice alone.

2635
03:27:38,968 --> 03:27:40,878
Don't.

2636
03:27:51,930 --> 03:27:53,780
Kang Seo Joon!

2637
03:27:53,780 --> 03:27:56,090
Yoo Ha, eat a lot.

2638
03:27:56,090 --> 03:27:59,610
My favorite food is chicken.

2639
03:27:59,610 --> 03:28:03,190
She's always asking me to buy chicken.

2640
03:28:03,190 --> 03:28:05,130
Excuse me.

2641
03:28:07,540 --> 03:28:09,320
- Yes, Seong Yoon.
- Yes, Reporter Kim.

2642
03:28:09,320 --> 03:28:14,140
I checked the IP address of where the rumor post originated, and it's Dacham Village.

2643
03:28:14,140 --> 03:28:18,370
Then it means the possibility of the person being one of the villagers is likely.

2644
03:28:18,370 --> 03:28:22,520
Yes. I think you could make the matter worse by pressing charges.

2645
03:28:22,520 --> 03:28:26,510
(Controversy on Kang Seon Joon's attitude on location, "Stressful actor... always had to be at his beck and call")
I said no. Kang Seo Joon isn't like that.

2646
03:28:26,510 --> 03:28:29,290
We'll conduct an interview soon—

2647
03:28:29,290 --> 03:28:33,640
So, I'm saying, we'll make our statement.

2648
03:28:33,640 --> 03:28:37,590
It's late right now! Don't we get to rest at night?

2649
03:28:41,950 --> 03:28:43,410
What?

2650
03:28:43,410 --> 03:28:45,760
I said you can go home.

2651
03:28:47,420 --> 03:28:48,720
Hurry up and go home.

2652
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:50,430
Hurry up and go. It's okay.

2653
03:28:50,430 --> 03:28:52,810
That's not it...

2654
03:28:52,810 --> 03:28:57,180
CEO, I'm sorry to say this in the middle of all this, but

2655
03:28:57,180 --> 03:28:59,650
I have something to say.

2656
03:28:59,650 --> 03:29:03,150
What? What's wrong now?

2657
03:29:03,150 --> 03:29:04,980
What is it?

2658
03:29:05,920 --> 03:29:09,310
I must tell you this by tomorrow.

2659
03:29:11,350 --> 03:29:16,830
Actually, I got an offer to be an idol.

2660
03:29:16,830 --> 03:29:18,810
Two months ago.

2661
03:29:19,750 --> 03:29:20,970
What?

2662
03:29:20,970 --> 03:29:23,330
D. C. H.

2663
03:29:23,330 --> 03:29:24,900
Could it be a person's initials?

2664
03:29:24,900 --> 03:29:28,680
Which last name starts with a "D"? Surname Do?

2665
03:29:28,680 --> 03:29:31,750
But no one in our village has the surname of Do.

2666
03:29:31,750 --> 03:29:35,740
Or CH could be one syllable.

2667
03:29:35,740 --> 03:29:38,910
Do Choon?

2668
03:29:41,150 --> 03:29:44,130
But I don't think the elders would've used the internet, though.

2669
03:29:44,130 --> 03:29:46,340
Isn't it like this?

2670
03:29:47,280 --> 03:29:50,500
DCH is Dacham Elementary ID.

2671
03:29:50,500 --> 03:29:55,670
My ID is also dch280102.

2672
03:29:55,670 --> 03:29:58,140
There are so many similar IDs, though.

2673
03:29:58,140 --> 03:30:01,020
Then what does this "28" mean?

2674
03:30:02,280 --> 03:30:04,350
2-8. What does 28 mean?

2675
03:30:04,350 --> 03:30:07,020
The year you enter the school.

2676
03:30:07,020 --> 03:30:10,140
The year you enter school?

2677
03:30:10,140 --> 03:30:13,580
Then what's this "shin-con-dot-con"?

2678
03:30:13,580 --> 03:30:16,830
Yoo Ha, you said there aren't that many classmates in your class, right?

2679
03:30:16,830 --> 03:30:18,890
There are five of us.

2680
03:30:18,890 --> 03:30:23,330
But none of my friends would do that.

2681
03:30:25,710 --> 03:30:28,720
But we should still let them know about this clue. You never know.

2682
03:30:28,720 --> 03:30:33,510
It could be someone who works at Dacham Elementary or someone connected to the school.

2683
03:30:33,510 --> 03:30:35,460
Give me a hair tie.

2684
03:30:40,470 --> 03:30:42,580
Well, fine. You're...

2685
03:30:44,430 --> 03:30:48,810
pretty handsome, and you look like an idol.

2686
03:30:50,790 --> 03:30:55,180
But did you always want to do it?

2687
03:30:56,840 --> 03:31:00,480
I was actually interested in it.

2688
03:31:03,150 --> 03:31:07,290
You were always clubbing. No wonder...

2689
03:31:08,210 --> 03:31:10,280
I see.

2690
03:31:11,560 --> 03:31:14,700
You were dancing your heart out at Seo Joon's birthday party.

2691
03:31:14,700 --> 03:31:16,570
Your moves were different.

2692
03:31:16,570 --> 03:31:19,930
Fine. I see. That's what happened.

2693
03:31:19,930 --> 03:31:21,770
You've been missing a lot lately, saying you were busy with something.

2694
03:31:21,770 --> 03:31:25,950
That's right. That's what happened.

2695
03:31:25,950 --> 03:31:28,500
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

2696
03:31:28,500 --> 03:31:31,070
Why should you be sorry?

2697
03:31:31,070 --> 03:31:32,730
It's fine.

2698
03:31:32,730 --> 03:31:36,370
I'll be fine. I'm just a little disappointed.

2699
03:31:36,370 --> 03:31:38,800
It's such an important matter.

2700
03:31:40,990 --> 03:31:42,200
I'm sorry.

2701
03:31:42,200 --> 03:31:43,940
It's okay.

2702
03:31:43,940 --> 03:31:49,870
Never mind. I feel bad that I couldn't pay more attention to you.

2703
03:31:59,490 --> 03:32:00,540
Hello.

2704
03:32:00,540 --> 03:32:05,020
I'm just calling to discuss Ji Woo's incident.

2705
03:32:05,020 --> 03:32:08,220
Rather than us handling it on our own, you said you know people in the press.

2706
03:32:08,220 --> 03:32:10,830
Dot-con. What's sin-con-dot-con?

2707
03:32:10,830 --> 03:32:12,410
Sin-con-dot-con is...

2708
03:32:12,410 --> 03:32:16,710
So, you know sin-con-dot-con?

2709
03:32:16,710 --> 03:32:18,470
That's a phrase used in video games.

2710
03:32:18,470 --> 03:32:20,510
"Sin's control, got control."
(Sin here, pronounced "shin," means god/deity)

2711
03:32:20,510 --> 03:32:24,190
Sin's control, got control...

2712
03:32:24,190 --> 03:32:26,500
- Scared me.
- Geez...

2713
03:32:26,500 --> 03:32:28,540
No way!

2714
03:32:30,340 --> 03:32:32,280
- Yoo Ha, what is it? What is it?
- What?

2715
03:32:32,280 --> 03:32:34,090
Kang Seo Joon!

2716
03:32:34,947 --> 03:32:36,887
Kang Seo Joon!

2717
03:33:10,120 --> 03:33:11,890
What the heck?

2718
03:33:18,370 --> 03:33:19,860
What?

2719
03:33:20,910 --> 03:33:22,590
Han Ji Woo!

2720
03:33:22,590 --> 03:33:24,460
Hey!

2721
03:33:24,460 --> 03:33:25,650
Hey, Han Ji Woo!

2722
03:33:25,650 --> 03:33:27,580
Wh-What's going on?

2723
03:33:27,580 --> 03:33:30,280
Han Ji Woo, are you pulling my leg?

2724
03:33:32,410 --> 03:33:34,020
I don't have a cell phone.

2725
03:33:34,020 --> 03:33:37,030
911...

2726
03:33:41,010 --> 03:33:43,090
I'm okay.

2727
03:33:44,290 --> 03:33:46,660
Call other people.

2728
03:33:46,660 --> 03:33:49,540
They think you went missing. They're all worried about you.

2729
03:33:49,540 --> 03:33:52,170
They could've already called the police.

2730
03:33:57,960 --> 03:34:00,510
DCH!

2731
03:34:03,120 --> 03:34:08,080
Come on out. Hey, you!

2732
03:34:08,080 --> 03:34:14,510
Hey, sweetie. I'm just calling to tell you about what the reporter said.

2733
03:34:14,510 --> 03:34:17,670
Yeah, yeah. I'm not bothering you, am I?

2734
03:34:19,270 --> 03:34:22,170
So, you knew about it already?

2735
03:34:22,170 --> 03:34:23,880
Yeah.

2736
03:34:25,700 --> 03:34:29,760
By chance, do you have time next week? No, huh?

2737
03:34:29,760 --> 03:34:32,470
No, huh?

2738
03:34:32,470 --> 03:34:34,990
I keep asking while you're so busy, huh?

2739
03:34:43,990 --> 03:34:45,950
It's all soggy.

2740
03:34:47,390 --> 03:34:50,120
Why did you bother coming out all the way here?

2741
03:34:53,700 --> 03:34:56,290
- I—
- I'm sorry, but...

2742
03:34:56,290 --> 03:34:58,200
I'd like you to leave.

2743
03:34:58,200 --> 03:35:00,190
I want to be alone.

2744
03:35:11,310 --> 03:35:15,880
I didn't toss the ring and the necklace.

2745
03:35:17,380 --> 03:35:21,290
I couldn't. I didn't toss them but buried them over there.

2746
03:35:24,960 --> 03:35:26,680
So...

2747
03:35:28,370 --> 03:35:30,570
I threw them away already, though.

2748
03:35:32,290 --> 03:35:34,290
We're finished.

2749
03:35:35,640 --> 03:35:42,210
You're not going to say you realized everything now, so to take you back. Right?

2750
03:35:42,210 --> 03:35:44,140
No way...

2751
03:35:46,390 --> 03:35:49,300
And what else? Just because you came here,

2752
03:35:49,300 --> 03:35:53,850
you're not thinking that I'd take you back. Right?

2753
03:35:56,510 --> 03:35:59,160
There's got to be an end to being so pathetic, you know.

2754
03:36:00,390 --> 03:36:07,090
Well, people who put in their best don't have any regrets.

2755
03:36:09,650 --> 03:36:11,530
You have nothing to say, huh?

2756
03:36:16,800 --> 03:36:20,420
Leave then. Don't disrupt my rest.

2757
03:36:28,220 --> 03:36:29,970
Sorry.

2758
03:36:45,690 --> 03:36:49,010
(Apple Popcorn)

2759
03:36:53,410 --> 03:36:56,790
Geez... what time is it?

2760
03:37:00,360 --> 03:37:02,400
10:00 a.m.

2761
03:37:07,010 --> 03:37:09,000
Oh, it's Saturday today. Right?

2762
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:11,940
Yeah, don't worry.

2763
03:37:11,940 --> 03:37:14,370
I got so scared.

2764
03:37:14,370 --> 03:37:19,420
But shouldn't we tell Han Ji Woo that we caught the culprit?

2765
03:37:21,570 --> 03:37:24,110
Where is he...

2766
03:37:25,490 --> 03:37:28,890
Han Ji Woo...

2767
03:37:30,460 --> 03:37:33,630
The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to voicemail after the beep.

2768
03:37:33,630 --> 03:37:35,500
What the heck?

2769
03:37:37,790 --> 03:37:42,490
(Ti Aspetto | Italian Restaurant | Closed)

2770
03:38:04,100 --> 03:38:08,040
My break is over.

2771
03:38:11,960 --> 03:38:14,760
Ji Woo, I told you to come in and wait.

2772
03:38:14,760 --> 03:38:17,160
Where the hell were you?

2773
03:38:29,450 --> 03:38:32,800
So, first of all, did you see the article?

2774
03:38:32,800 --> 03:38:35,510
I saw it. We can just ignore it.

2775
03:38:35,510 --> 03:38:37,090
Let it go. It's not the first time.

2776
03:38:37,090 --> 03:38:38,770
What?

2777
03:38:38,770 --> 03:38:41,130
Can't you see how tired I am? Hurry up and leave.

2778
03:38:41,130 --> 03:38:43,150
Let's talk later.

2779
03:38:45,050 --> 03:38:47,320
You said not to sit back.

2780
03:38:48,100 --> 03:38:51,450
Why are you sitting back when it's not true?

2781
03:38:56,050 --> 03:39:00,000
I'm sorry, but it's true.

2782
03:39:01,880 --> 03:39:03,260
Let's do an interview.

2783
03:39:03,260 --> 03:39:04,930
I don't want to.

2784
03:39:04,930 --> 03:39:07,670
Kang Seo Joon, let's do an interview.

2785
03:39:07,670 --> 03:39:09,430
I said I don't want to!

2786
03:39:09,430 --> 03:39:12,070
Leave, both of you.

2787
03:39:14,070 --> 03:39:18,030
Leave. I mean it.

2788
03:39:20,590 --> 03:39:22,800
Did you decide to be a baby now?

2789
03:39:22,800 --> 03:39:25,400
Who was that? Yoo Ha?

2790
03:39:25,400 --> 03:39:28,300
She wouldn't even be acting like you, Bro!

2791
03:39:29,440 --> 03:39:30,910
Do you know this?

2792
03:39:30,910 --> 03:39:34,870
Baek Ho Min! That jerk is... Forget it! Forget it!

2793
03:39:34,870 --> 03:39:36,820
I'm leaving.

2794
03:39:41,930 --> 03:39:43,700
How about you?

2795
03:39:44,470 --> 03:39:47,840
I'll stay for now.

2796
03:39:49,310 --> 03:39:52,290
It's the end of the world.

2797
03:39:52,290 --> 03:39:56,750
Going back and forth from Gyeongsang-do to Seoul.

2798
03:39:56,750 --> 03:39:59,540
Why all the trouble?

2799
03:41:39,170 --> 03:41:41,590
- Hello, CEO.
- Get in.

2800
03:41:42,570 --> 03:41:45,230
Did your audition go well?

2801
03:41:46,390 --> 03:41:48,120
Yes.

2802
03:41:50,090 --> 03:41:54,500
It feels strange sitting in here, CEO.

2803
03:41:54,500 --> 03:41:57,500
Why? You'll soon be sitting in the back.

2804
03:41:58,690 --> 03:42:01,960
Open the glove compartment.

2805
03:42:05,280 --> 03:42:06,770
The white one.

2806
03:42:06,770 --> 03:42:09,240
- This?
- Yeah.

2807
03:42:10,540 --> 03:42:12,950
Your severance pay will be paid separately.

2808
03:42:12,950 --> 03:42:16,430
You'll have trouble making money in the future. Take that for now.

2809
03:42:17,660 --> 03:42:20,210
Don't get scared, man.

2810
03:42:20,210 --> 03:42:21,750
CEO.

2811
03:42:21,750 --> 03:42:24,450
Let's just be on equal footing.

2812
03:42:24,450 --> 03:42:26,410
Call me Jack.

2813
03:42:26,410 --> 03:42:29,530
My English name is Jack.

2814
03:42:31,980 --> 03:42:35,030
I'm sorry I couldn't pay attention to you all this time.

2815
03:42:36,370 --> 03:42:39,210
No. I should've done a better job.

2816
03:42:39,210 --> 03:42:42,450
Hey, you did a really great job.

2817
03:42:42,450 --> 03:42:47,060
Seo Joon's previous manager went home in three hours and 45 minutes.

2818
03:42:49,720 --> 03:42:50,840
Let's go.

2819
03:42:50,840 --> 03:42:54,970
Let's eat something yummy. I'm feeling down.

2820
03:42:56,740 --> 03:42:58,820
Good luck, Ho Min...

2821
03:42:58,820 --> 03:43:00,960
wherever you go.

2822
03:43:50,000 --> 03:43:51,720
Sorry.

2823
03:43:53,050 --> 03:43:55,640
I didn't know the door would open.

2824
03:43:57,160 --> 03:44:01,110
I think I stunk, so I went and took a shower.

2825
03:44:01,110 --> 03:44:06,060
We didn't get to eat, so I was going to cook for you with this.

2826
03:44:06,060 --> 03:44:07,870
Who do you think you are?

2827
03:44:09,580 --> 03:44:11,580
Why would you cook?

2828
03:44:24,590 --> 03:44:31,300
I went so far away, but...

2829
03:44:33,140 --> 03:44:38,440
if I typed in your name on the internet, I could find out what you were up to right away.

2830
03:44:39,940 --> 03:44:43,390
I kept seeing you around Seoul, so I ran away.

2831
03:44:44,910 --> 03:44:47,370
But it was the same in the end.

2832
03:44:55,670 --> 03:44:58,340
I'll stop running away now.

2833
03:45:11,580 --> 03:45:13,400
As for me,

2834
03:45:17,010 --> 03:45:20,100
if you keep pushing me away,

2835
03:45:21,360 --> 03:45:23,130
I can't...

2836
03:45:25,620 --> 03:45:28,580
continue after you as you did.

2837
03:45:28,580 --> 03:45:30,540
To where you are.

2838
03:45:34,390 --> 03:45:37,740
What? Is this a threat?

2839
03:45:38,600 --> 03:45:40,390
No.

2840
03:45:41,490 --> 03:45:43,360
It's a request.

2841
03:45:50,420 --> 03:45:52,680
Please hug me.

2842
03:46:22,924 --> 03:46:30,010
♫ By my side, I hear the wind blow ♫

2843
03:46:31,874 --> 03:46:37,924
♫ Close my eyes, I feel you there ♫

2844
03:46:45,934 --> 03:46:47,904
When I'm having a hard time,

2845
03:46:50,624 --> 03:46:52,944
you said you would come to me.

2846
03:47:17,454 --> 03:47:24,174
♫ Just take my hand and then you'll find ♫

2847
03:47:24,174 --> 03:47:25,834
Okay.

2848
03:47:26,604 --> 03:47:27,824
I'm here.

2849
03:47:27,824 --> 03:47:33,900
♫ A sky full of stars will light your way ♫

2850
03:47:35,334 --> 03:47:38,564
♫ All of your days ♫

2851
03:47:38,564 --> 03:47:41,724
I saw all the texts.

2852
03:47:41,724 --> 03:47:44,924
I was a coward. I'm sorry.

2853
03:47:44,924 --> 03:47:48,374
♫ Be your galaxy ♫

2854
03:47:48,374 --> 03:47:52,934
Are you going to hide like that again?

2855
03:47:55,534 --> 03:47:58,214
Are you going to make me anxious again?

2856
03:48:05,154 --> 03:48:08,584
You should've erased your old number.

2857
03:48:08,584 --> 03:48:11,694
Why did you keep it and see all the texts unnecessarily?

2858
03:48:11,694 --> 03:48:15,044
I'm sorry...

2859
03:48:15,044 --> 03:48:17,714
I wanted you to call me.

2860
03:48:21,204 --> 03:48:23,104
What was it...

2861
03:48:23,104 --> 03:48:27,524
Team Leader Jeong. What about her? I thought you hadn't gotten over her yet.

2862
03:48:27,524 --> 03:48:30,384
I heard everything. You said you thought of her even when we were dating.

2863
03:48:30,384 --> 03:48:33,374
I'm sorry. At that time...

2864
03:48:33,374 --> 03:48:37,454
I just said it more meanly because I felt sorry for you.

2865
03:48:37,454 --> 03:48:40,734
I had never felt that way before, so I misunderstood.

2866
03:48:43,664 --> 03:48:46,794
You said you were lonely when you were with me.

2867
03:48:46,794 --> 03:48:49,644
Then it'll be the same if we start dating again.

2868
03:48:49,644 --> 03:48:52,344
After my parents passed away,

2869
03:48:52,984 --> 03:48:57,414
I think I was afraid to become happy by myself...

2870
03:48:58,544 --> 03:49:00,664
It's just...

2871
03:49:01,504 --> 03:49:07,584
I'm not used to it myself as well, so I was confused.

2872
03:49:22,234 --> 03:49:24,694
In front of you,

2873
03:49:26,914 --> 03:49:30,304
I really can't be arrogant even if I want to be.

2874
03:49:31,294 --> 03:49:35,084
Please stop your habit of planning what to wear in advance.

2875
03:49:35,084 --> 03:49:39,004
That's a habit of Team Leader Jeong. So please don't do it.

2876
03:49:39,604 --> 03:49:43,324
Just erase every trace of her. Okay?

2877
03:49:44,874 --> 03:49:47,004
Okay.

2878
03:49:47,004 --> 03:49:49,734
Then, you, too...

2879
03:49:49,734 --> 03:49:55,094
Please stop talking on the phone with other people often, and don't smile at others.

2880
03:49:55,094 --> 03:49:58,274
I get jealous a lot. So please stop doing it.

2881
03:49:58,274 --> 03:50:01,284
What? You pretended you were fine.

2882
03:50:01,284 --> 03:50:04,154
I had been holding it down until now.

2883
03:50:04,154 --> 03:50:09,344
I thought it might harm your work if I said so.

2884
03:50:17,744 --> 03:50:19,994
Okay, I got it.

2885
03:50:21,064 --> 03:50:24,014
I won't do anything that you don't like me to do.

2886
03:50:24,774 --> 03:50:27,514
Are you a baby?

2887
03:50:27,514 --> 03:50:30,804
Why are you just crying without telling me?

2888
03:50:45,194 --> 03:50:47,654
I dug this up from where I buried it.

2889
03:51:07,674 --> 03:51:09,744
Don't you need to eat?

2890
03:51:09,744 --> 03:51:13,044
You didn't eat anything the whole day.

2891
03:51:13,044 --> 03:51:15,494
Is food important at this moment?

2892
03:51:16,864 --> 03:51:18,564
I missed you...

2893
03:51:19,604 --> 03:51:22,704
I missed you a lot.

2894
03:51:22,704 --> 03:51:25,004
I missed you more.

2895
03:51:25,004 --> 03:51:27,594
Even when I'm looking at you, I miss you.

2896
03:51:29,064 --> 03:51:30,864
I love you.

2897
03:51:32,144 --> 03:51:34,414
I love you, too.

2898
03:51:34,414 --> 03:51:36,354
I love you so much.

2899
03:52:11,984 --> 03:52:13,844
Did you sleep okay?

2900
03:52:20,334 --> 03:52:24,214
- We've been separated for a year.
- Stop it.

2901
03:52:24,214 --> 03:52:26,984
- But it feels like I saw him yesterday.
- Please stop it.

2902
03:52:26,984 --> 03:52:29,474
We just went around to come back.

2903
03:52:32,984 --> 03:52:34,914
Are you doing okay?

2904
03:52:37,454 --> 03:52:41,044
It's my first time, so it's not easy.

2905
03:52:41,714 --> 03:52:45,414
You have to work on social media. Everybody looks at stuff through that.

2906
03:52:45,414 --> 03:52:47,334
I will.

2907
03:52:49,374 --> 03:52:52,884
What about Yoo Ha? Did you call her?

2908
03:52:52,884 --> 03:52:55,164
Yes, I called her.

2909
03:52:56,254 --> 03:52:57,654
Is it not good?
(Ti Aspetto)

2910
03:52:57,654 --> 03:53:01,124
- What if you add some emojis?
- Which one?

2911
03:53:01,124 --> 03:53:05,074
(We are taking a break.)
(Ti Aspetto (Mr. Han))

2912
03:53:08,734 --> 03:53:11,404
What the heck is he doing? It's been a week.

2913
03:53:11,404 --> 03:53:14,434
I know! My goodness.

2914
03:53:14,434 --> 03:53:17,114
When is he going to come back?

2915
03:53:17,114 --> 03:53:18,954
Do you miss Mr. Han?

2916
03:53:18,954 --> 03:53:23,274
A little bit. But I only need you, Mom.

2917
03:53:24,024 --> 03:53:28,644
I'm the happiest person in the world, all thanks to you!

2918
03:53:28,644 --> 03:53:31,464
I love you, my baby!

2919
03:53:42,954 --> 03:53:45,814
Will you stop working and play with me?

2920
03:53:45,814 --> 03:53:49,104
Give me one second. I'm almost done.

2921
03:53:50,604 --> 03:53:53,344
Please stop working and play with me.

2922
03:53:53,344 --> 03:53:56,194
One second. I'll finish it right away.

2923
03:53:56,194 --> 03:53:58,384
Let's play!

2924
03:54:05,764 --> 03:54:09,474
I get it. I'll stop working right now.

2925
03:54:14,494 --> 03:54:17,004
Tell me you love me.

2926
03:54:17,004 --> 03:54:19,504
- Again?
- Yes.

2927
03:54:25,844 --> 03:54:27,554
I love you.

2928
03:54:30,654 --> 03:54:32,474
One more time.

2929
03:54:35,274 --> 03:54:37,284
- Again?
- Yes.

2930
03:54:38,244 --> 03:54:40,654
I love you.

2931
03:54:40,654 --> 03:54:42,804
Good job!

2932
03:54:42,804 --> 03:54:45,824
Please express your feelings a lot. Okay?

2933
03:54:47,884 --> 03:54:49,794
Look at your chubby cheeks.

2934
03:54:50,404 --> 03:54:52,464
You are so cute.

2935
03:54:52,464 --> 03:54:54,484
Let me bite your cheek just once.

2936
03:54:59,124 --> 03:55:00,984
One more time.

2937
03:55:20,624 --> 03:55:22,974
You are ten minutes late!

2938
03:55:22,974 --> 03:55:26,184
Han Yoo Ha, how have you been?

2939
03:55:27,544 --> 03:55:30,864
Do you know how much I waited for you to come?

2940
03:55:30,864 --> 03:55:32,544
It seems like you didn't wait for me that long.

2941
03:55:32,544 --> 03:55:34,344
How was your grandmother's house?

2942
03:55:34,344 --> 03:55:37,754
That's not the point. I've got the news that I need to be complimented!

2943
03:55:37,754 --> 03:55:39,734
What to be complimented?

2944
03:55:59,974 --> 03:56:02,654
Oh, you are finally picking up your phone.

2945
03:56:02,654 --> 03:56:04,694
I guess you found your phone.

2946
03:56:04,694 --> 03:56:07,554
Yes, it's good to hear from you, CEO Kim.

2947
03:56:08,624 --> 03:56:11,224
Are you not going to do the interview?

2948
03:56:11,224 --> 03:56:14,904
Does it make a difference if I do the interview? It's a subjective matter anyway.

2949
03:56:14,904 --> 03:56:17,044
- Isn't it?
- What?!

2950
03:56:17,044 --> 03:56:19,164
I'm sorry.

2951
03:56:21,524 --> 03:56:23,764
I just did it without any thoughts.

2952
03:56:23,764 --> 03:56:25,874
I'm so sorry.

2953
03:56:27,724 --> 03:56:30,584
I don't want to go to the police.

2954
03:56:31,244 --> 03:56:33,994
I don't want to go to jail and eat rice with beans.

2955
03:56:33,994 --> 03:56:36,524
I don't like beans!

2956
03:56:36,524 --> 03:56:39,394
Please don't report me.

2957
03:56:40,134 --> 03:56:42,004
Please don't cry.

2958
03:56:42,004 --> 03:56:44,604
I won't report you. Okay?

2959
03:56:44,604 --> 03:56:48,654
But what you did is bad, Chae Ho.

2960
03:56:48,654 --> 03:56:51,274
You just uploaded writing on the internet,

2961
03:56:51,274 --> 03:56:54,714
but that can make someone suffer for the rest of their lives.

2962
03:56:54,714 --> 03:56:57,534
- Understood?
- Yes.

2963
03:56:57,534 --> 03:56:59,854
I'm so sorry.

2964
03:57:03,644 --> 03:57:06,444
I'll go now. Don't be too harsh on him.

2965
03:57:11,964 --> 03:57:15,674
I saw you pooping on the street yesterday.

2966
03:57:16,324 --> 03:57:18,294
What? When?

2967
03:57:19,364 --> 03:57:21,894
I didn't do that.

2968
03:57:21,894 --> 03:57:23,704
Does that make you feel unfair?

2969
03:57:26,244 --> 03:57:29,324
Have this. Think of it as a deadly poison for the criminal.

2970
03:57:35,904 --> 03:57:38,404
You know what that poison means, right?

2971
03:57:39,394 --> 03:57:42,034
Oh, goodness.

2972
03:57:42,034 --> 03:57:46,754
Don't tell your mom that I gave you a deadly poison.

2973
03:57:46,754 --> 03:57:48,444
Understood?!

2974
03:57:57,784 --> 03:57:59,344
Why did you design the movement flow like this?!

2975
03:57:59,344 --> 03:58:02,604
It's getting delayed all because of you!

2976
03:58:02,604 --> 03:58:04,644
How can you make schedules like this!

2977
03:58:04,644 --> 03:58:06,714
I'm sorry, sir.

2978
03:58:06,714 --> 03:58:08,314
Take a five-minute break.

2979
03:58:08,314 --> 03:58:10,054
I said, take a five-minute break!

2980
03:58:10,054 --> 03:58:12,344
She's coming this way, now!

2981
03:58:14,594 --> 03:58:16,844
What is going on?!

2982
03:58:17,554 --> 03:58:18,834
You know me, right?

2983
03:58:18,834 --> 03:58:20,364
What is it?

2984
03:58:20,364 --> 03:58:24,084
When I worked as an entertainment reporter, I got a scandal about your show,

2985
03:58:24,084 --> 03:58:28,614
but you begged me to wait until the end of the show so much that I waited for you.

2986
03:58:30,454 --> 03:58:32,244
Yes, yes. You're right.

2987
03:58:32,244 --> 03:58:34,964
When Kang Seo Joon and your director were fighting,

2988
03:58:34,964 --> 03:58:36,944
not just Kang Seo Joon's manager here,

2989
03:58:36,944 --> 03:58:40,264
but there was more than 20 staff, including stylists and everybody.

2990
03:58:40,264 --> 03:58:43,944
Do you think every one of them will stay quiet about it?

2991
03:58:45,274 --> 03:58:49,004
I know that you worked the hardest to fix the complicated schedule.

2992
03:58:49,004 --> 03:58:52,204
Honestly, I don't know if the show will fail or not.

2993
03:58:52,204 --> 03:58:54,894
I'll do anything from now on.

2994
03:58:54,894 --> 03:58:57,774
But before I do so, I came here to tell you this.

2995
03:58:57,774 --> 03:59:01,084
There's an anonymous report.

2996
03:59:01,704 --> 03:59:05,074
Baby, since we are here,

2997
03:59:05,074 --> 03:59:07,834
there's a very delicious noodle place around here.

2998
03:59:07,834 --> 03:59:09,914
- Why don't we eat together before going?
- I'm sorry.

2999
03:59:09,914 --> 03:59:13,024
I have to go now for my next schedule.

3000
03:59:13,024 --> 03:59:15,824
I can have dinner tomorrow! How does that sound?

3001
03:59:15,824 --> 03:59:19,654
- You will cancel that again.
- I won't do it this time!

3002
03:59:21,634 --> 03:59:24,264
Yes, this is Reporter Lee Yoon Seul.

3003
03:59:24,264 --> 03:59:26,184
I'll get going first!

3004
03:59:28,554 --> 03:59:30,234
Bye.

3005
03:59:42,234 --> 03:59:45,464
(HOMIN)
(Assistant Director Kim Yoon Jeong: I'm talking with Ho Min and his staff. We were so used to the bad environment that we didn't even know it was bad. I'm sorry.)

3006
03:59:45,464 --> 03:59:48,734
Jack! I got this text.

3007
03:59:57,774 --> 03:59:59,514
The world is really...

3008
03:59:59,514 --> 04:00:02,044
It's still a good place to live.

3009
04:00:03,884 --> 04:00:06,344
It's a happy place, right?

3010
04:00:08,124 --> 04:00:09,814
Ho Min!

3011
04:00:09,814 --> 04:00:11,764
Ho Min, did you go home?

3012
04:00:13,884 --> 04:00:16,034
I miss you, Ho Min.

3013
04:00:20,664 --> 04:00:23,284
At least I should stay healthy.

3014
04:00:23,284 --> 04:00:25,844
I think I'm the healthiest one.

3015
04:00:27,594 --> 04:00:29,664
It's great!

3016
04:00:37,674 --> 04:00:39,054
I...

3017
04:00:39,054 --> 04:00:41,984
After solving all my past issues,

3018
04:00:41,984 --> 04:00:45,150
I finally got the courage to go to you.

3019
04:00:46,894 --> 04:00:49,834
- The future I'll be spending with you,
- Are you home?

3020
04:00:49,834 --> 04:00:53,104
- now I can picture it clearly.
- I ran here.

3021
04:00:53,104 --> 04:00:55,444
I missed you.

3022
04:00:55,444 --> 04:00:56,724
What's going on with you?

3023
04:00:56,724 --> 04:00:59,574
Just stay like that for me.

3024
04:00:59,574 --> 04:01:02,894
♫ Tearing now, you are so beautiful ♫

3025
04:01:02,894 --> 04:01:05,484
♫ Shout out loud to my star ♫

3026
04:01:05,484 --> 04:01:11,974
♫ I'm always reaching for you, baby ♫

3027
04:01:11,974 --> 04:01:15,334
It's soybean paste pasta, Chamnamul risotto, and potato pizza pancake.
(Countryside Restaurant)

3028
04:01:15,334 --> 04:01:17,494
What if we use local produce

3029
04:01:17,494 --> 04:01:19,584
and make dedicated special dishes?
(Cooking with local villagers' produce?!)

3030
04:01:19,584 --> 04:01:22,244
For example,

3031
04:01:22,244 --> 04:01:25,124
using this can be this Grandma's dried persimmon salad.
(Grandma's dried persimmon salad! As expected, Kang Seo Joon!)

3032
04:01:25,124 --> 04:01:27,694
Excuse me!

3033
04:01:27,694 --> 04:01:31,034
I heard that our Ji Woo is shooting a show today.
(Village Chief came out)

3034
04:01:31,034 --> 04:01:32,884
So I brought some yogurt for everyone!

3035
04:01:32,884 --> 04:01:35,764
- Thank you so much!
- Ji Woo, fighting!

3036
04:01:35,764 --> 04:01:37,474
(Did you watch the latest episode of Countryside Restaurant??)
(I heard everything was a rumor. He must have suffered a lot.)

3037
04:01:37,474 --> 04:01:40,834
(The original rumor spreader of the Countryside Restaurant's Chef Han Ji Woo apologized?)

3038
04:01:40,834 --> 04:01:43,234
(The real culprit got caught a long time ago...)

3039
04:01:43,234 --> 04:01:46,404

♫ I'll be there. So what? So what? ♫

3042
04:01:54,354 --> 04:01:58,714
(Hello, I'm the Assistant Director of the show "When the Gangster Loves." I want to tell you the truth about the incident with Actor Kang Seo Joon.)

3043
04:01:58,714 --> 04:02:03,210
♫ Oh, I'll be there. So what? So what? ♫

3044
04:02:04,194 --> 04:02:07,124
(Hello, this is Lee Jae Won. I'm also finally disclosing the truth.)

3045
04:02:07,124 --> 04:02:11,014
("When the Gangster Loves" disclosed it was a false scandal... They switched the director out!)

3046
04:02:17,694 --> 04:02:19,364
Ji Woo.

3047
04:02:37,014 --> 04:02:38,684
Wow... Han Ji Woo, no way...

3048
04:02:38,684 --> 04:02:40,724
The visuals are so good!

3049
04:02:40,724 --> 04:02:42,374
Try it.

3050
04:02:42,374 --> 04:02:45,634
Just looking at it, with my idea and your cooking skills,

3051
04:02:45,634 --> 04:02:47,804
there's no way it can taste bad.

3052
04:02:48,764 --> 04:02:50,994
Eat a lot.

3053
04:02:52,754 --> 04:02:54,704
- Try it.
- Eat up.

3054
04:02:54,704 --> 04:02:56,964
Eat a lot.

3055
04:02:58,474 --> 04:03:01,384
It looks like it'll taste good, but

3056
04:03:01,384 --> 04:03:06,034
our combination is a bit...

3057
04:03:06,034 --> 04:03:08,194
Why? Is there a problem?

3058
04:03:08,194 --> 04:03:10,294
That's right. Is there a problem?

3059
04:03:10,294 --> 04:03:13,734
As you know, it's not like we fought with each other.

3060
04:03:18,814 --> 04:03:21,424
It's really delicious, don't worry.

3061
04:03:23,784 --> 04:03:27,604
Hey. It's good, wow!

3062
04:03:30,854 --> 04:03:32,714
You're spilling.

3063
04:03:35,014 --> 04:03:36,294
This. What is this?

3064
04:03:36,294 --> 04:03:38,444
- This is amazing.
- This... What is this?

3065
04:03:38,444 --> 04:03:41,874
- Cream cheese and nuts.
- Yoo Ha, how is it?

3066
04:03:41,874 --> 04:03:44,864
It's good. It's a success!

3067
04:03:46,464 --> 04:03:48,454
How is this hairstyle?

3068
04:03:48,454 --> 04:03:50,004
It's good.

3069
04:03:50,004 --> 04:03:52,510
Let's eat fruit.

3070
04:03:52,510 --> 04:03:53,960
Here.

3071
04:03:53,964 --> 04:03:56,384
You're leaving now?

3072
04:03:56,384 --> 04:03:58,524
Yes, I have to go back to my regular life.

3073
04:03:58,524 --> 04:04:01,564
I got some rest thanks to you.

3074
04:04:01,564 --> 04:04:03,004
You made a good choice.

3075
04:04:03,004 --> 04:04:05,794
What would you do in this countryside anyway?

3076
04:04:07,494 --> 04:04:10,054
Head back safely. And live well in Seoul, too.

3077
04:04:10,054 --> 04:04:12,134
I'm going to spend another week here first.

3078
04:04:12,134 --> 04:04:14,994
Oh... okay.

3079
04:04:14,994 --> 04:04:16,904
Ah! Goblin ears!

3080
04:04:16,904 --> 04:04:19,164
It's weird!

3081
04:04:19,164 --> 04:04:21,454
- Oh, really?
- Then, what about this style?

3082
04:04:21,454 --> 04:04:24,404
He's really a person that shines.

3083
04:04:25,824 --> 04:04:27,134
What about this?

3084
04:04:27,134 --> 04:04:28,704
That's right.

3085
04:04:28,704 --> 04:04:33,234
Our Yoo Ha shines quite a lot.

3086
04:04:34,444 --> 04:04:36,524
You can stop now. Come and have some fruit!

3087
04:04:36,524 --> 04:04:38,044
Okay.

3088
04:04:38,044 --> 04:04:40,034
Should we go eat some fruit?

3089
04:04:42,144 --> 04:04:43,824
Let's go!

3090
04:04:51,734 --> 04:04:54,904
Are we going to stop dating after one or two years?

3091
04:04:55,544 --> 04:04:58,704
What? What does that mean?

3092
04:05:02,144 --> 04:05:05,994
Don't keep going back and forth tirelessly and just work in Seoul.

3093
04:05:07,114 --> 04:05:09,834
We can see each other on Monday's and Tuesday's.

3094
04:05:10,634 --> 04:05:13,414
I'll take those days off at the restaurant.

3095
04:05:13,414 --> 04:05:17,764
Really? I thought you said you would never take days off.

3096
04:05:17,764 --> 04:05:23,094
I can go to Seoul, too. We need to live joyfully.

3097
04:05:23,094 --> 04:05:27,464
Oh, I don't know. I'm still going to come when I miss you.

3098
04:05:27,464 --> 04:05:30,004
I'm telling you this because I knew you would say that.

3099
04:05:39,774 --> 04:05:45,024
The fact that we're opposites, I admit it.

3100
04:05:47,544 --> 04:05:49,974
You asked me.

3101
04:05:49,974 --> 04:05:55,104
Why I want to date you even if I knew we were such opposites.

3102
04:05:57,354 --> 04:06:02,254
To you, I was caught, when we had only met for two days

3103
04:06:02,254 --> 04:06:06,164
that my mind was hurting at one point.

3104
04:06:10,074 --> 04:06:12,390
But it was comfortable.

3105
04:06:13,020 --> 04:06:15,810
Getting caught from the beginning.

3106
04:06:17,094 --> 04:06:20,814
And acting as if that was nothing,

3107
04:06:20,814 --> 04:06:25,774
and you being considerate of me and whether or not I would get hurt...

3108
04:06:29,644 --> 04:06:32,414
I guess that's why I like you so much.

3109
04:06:36,584 --> 04:06:41,124
If I said these words that I've never said to anyone else before to you,

3110
04:06:42,304 --> 04:06:47,504
then I thought I wouldn't be able to let you go and that's why I haven't been able to say them to you.

3111
04:06:49,144 --> 04:06:51,644
But now that won't happen.

3112
04:06:56,274 --> 04:07:02,854
When Kang Seo Joon first started acting and started his second drama,

3113
04:07:02,854 --> 04:07:05,444
he suffered from severe depression

3114
04:07:05,444 --> 04:07:08,684
and had to act like a boy who committed suicide.

3115
04:07:10,064 --> 04:07:14,284
In a busy filming environment and with the indifference of adults,

3116
04:07:14,284 --> 04:07:17,124
he was left alone.

3117
04:07:20,594 --> 04:07:25,434
And he gained a memory he could never forget in his life.

3118
04:07:36,824 --> 04:07:39,590
Back then, I should have just cried and gotten angry,

3119
04:07:40,930 --> 04:07:43,850
maybe even resent at least one person.

3120
04:07:47,884 --> 04:07:49,864
It's okay.

3121
04:07:51,384 --> 04:07:53,544
Now you have me.

3122
04:08:12,024 --> 04:08:16,164
Instead of that, I like this better.

3123
04:08:18,104 --> 04:08:21,284
How is your cheek so squishy?

3124
04:08:21,284 --> 04:08:23,744
You are so cute, my baby.

3125
04:09:18,654 --> 04:09:19,824
Hey, Han Ji Woo!

3126
04:09:19,824 --> 04:09:22,454
You left your phone!

3127
04:09:24,284 --> 04:09:27,344
Oh, Yoo Ha's mom! What is she doing not watching Yoo Ha?

3128
04:09:35,444 --> 04:09:39,014
- Now, it's my turn.
- No, no. I want to do it.

3129
04:09:40,894 --> 04:09:41,904
Come here.

3130
04:09:41,904 --> 04:09:44,964
I'll do it for you.

3131
04:09:44,964 --> 04:09:46,574
I want to do it for you!

3132
04:09:46,574 --> 04:09:50,064
In this world, there are no perfect people

3133
04:09:50,064 --> 04:09:52,564
or even perfect love.

3134
04:09:54,384 --> 04:09:59,304
It's just going on with a loving heart

3135
04:09:59,304 --> 04:10:01,804
and making compromises with understanding.

3136
04:10:01,804 --> 04:10:05,674
So? Keep talking.

3137
04:10:06,964 --> 04:10:13,154
Instead of with my pride, I should honestly talk about my feelings and learn from them.

3138
04:10:14,724 --> 04:10:20,134
That's the method of love I've learned thanks to you.

3139
04:10:21,674 --> 04:10:24,594
♪ I'm here, I'm here now ♪

3140
04:10:24,594 --> 04:10:26,854
- Here.
- What is it?

3141
04:10:26,854 --> 04:10:28,584
It came out.
("When the Gangster Loves" - Episode 15 -)

3142
04:10:31,894 --> 04:10:35,424
By the way, how's Ho Min doing?

3143
04:10:35,424 --> 04:10:39,674
I don't know. I guess his agency is not even giving him a cell phone.

3144
04:10:41,234 --> 04:10:45,714
We really don't know what's going to happen in our lives, right?

3145
04:10:47,884 --> 04:10:49,244
How can you laugh right now?

3146
04:10:49,244 --> 04:10:52,554
I can't help but laugh!

3147
04:10:54,354 --> 04:10:56,604
Cut! Okay!

3148
04:10:56,604 --> 04:10:59,034
Let's move on to the next setting!

3149
04:11:00,094 --> 04:11:01,834
How was it, Director?

3150
04:11:01,834 --> 04:11:04,050
It was wonderful. It was perfect!

3151
04:11:04,050 --> 04:11:05,914
- Can I see it?
- Do you want to see it?

3152
04:11:05,914 --> 04:11:08,014
Play it for him, please.

3153
04:11:12,164 --> 04:11:14,950
- Look at this part.
- Your acting is great, Jae Won! It came out great!

3154
04:11:14,950 --> 04:11:18,094
- I think Jae Won will get the best new actor award.
- Oh, please.

3155
04:11:18,094 --> 04:11:20,214
- Ji Woo.
- How's your filming going?

3156
04:11:20,214 --> 04:11:22,174
It's going well. Did you eat today?

3157
04:11:22,174 --> 04:11:24,314
Yes, I did.

3158
04:11:24,314 --> 04:11:27,584
- What about you?
- I ate, too. I had a tuna kimbap.

3159
04:11:27,584 --> 04:11:29,034
Good.

3160
04:11:29,034 --> 04:11:31,604
- Are you going to work?
- Yes, I have to go out now.

3161
04:11:31,604 --> 04:11:33,074
Aren't you cold?

3162
04:11:33,074 --> 04:11:34,564
No.

3163
04:11:35,499 --> 04:11:38,089
I miss you. I'll go to see you tomorrow.

3164
04:11:38,089 --> 04:11:39,169
I have a day-off tomorrow.

3165
04:11:39,169 --> 04:11:41,039
I'll see you soon.

3166
04:11:50,899 --> 04:11:55,099
(Welcome to Dacham Village, where it's always full of joy!)

3167
04:12:37,839 --> 04:12:41,519
I think I got good at cooking now. Don't you think so?

3168
04:12:44,019 --> 04:12:46,089
You got better than before.

3169
04:12:46,089 --> 04:12:49,389
You are saying it as if it's not true.

3170
04:12:49,389 --> 04:12:51,459
No, you've gotten better.

3171
04:12:51,459 --> 04:12:52,649
You are doing great.

3172
04:12:52,649 --> 04:12:56,039
- You are good at cooking.
- There are people here.

3173
04:12:56,039 --> 04:12:57,519
Aren't you all hungry? What do you want to eat?

3174
04:12:57,519 --> 04:12:59,949
I'm happy with anything.

3175
04:13:01,749 --> 04:13:04,479
Please give me something delicious, something not like egg roll kimbap.

3176
04:13:04,479 --> 04:13:07,419
We've come out this far in a while.

3177
04:13:09,579 --> 04:13:11,809
You got so skinny, by the way!

3178
04:13:11,809 --> 04:13:13,919
You should eat more.

3179
04:13:13,919 --> 04:13:15,199
Is your agency making you starve?

3180
04:13:15,199 --> 04:13:16,909
A little bit for me to get in shape.

3181
04:13:16,909 --> 04:13:18,989
Who's making you starve? Who's your agency's CEO?

3182
04:13:18,989 --> 04:13:22,759
It's Jang Jae Eun, right? I'll call them, so eat as much as you want from now.

3183
04:13:22,759 --> 04:13:25,589
You should just focus on me.

3184
04:13:25,589 --> 04:13:28,349
There's no other actor taking care of you more than me.

3185
04:13:28,349 --> 04:13:32,459
- Exactly.
- You look pretty cool today. That coat is nice.

3186
04:13:32,459 --> 04:13:34,289
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes, it's cool like a cheetah.

3187
04:13:34,289 --> 04:13:35,439
It's good.

3188
04:13:35,439 --> 04:13:37,849
Not a cheetah, but it has its own feeling. It's good.

3189
04:13:37,849 --> 04:13:40,939
Ho Min looks great, too. All of you look great.

3190
04:13:40,939 --> 04:13:43,459
-You look more amazing.
- Of course, I know about that.

3191
04:13:43,459 --> 04:13:45,259
- You look the best.
- That's correct, too.

3192
04:13:45,259 --> 04:13:48,809
But there's someone who looks more handsome these days.

3193
04:13:50,569 --> 04:13:52,509
- Please don't.
- Okay, okay.

3194
04:13:52,509 --> 04:13:55,069
Don't go overboard.

3195
04:13:55,069 --> 04:13:57,209
Is this all?

3196
04:14:00,059 --> 04:14:03,889
I know it's rural here, but you are not wearing a face mask again. Will you be okay?

3197
04:14:03,889 --> 04:14:06,099
I'll be fine.

3198
04:14:06,099 --> 04:14:08,039
I don't care if anybody notices me.

3199
04:14:08,039 --> 04:14:09,839
I mean...

3200
04:14:11,589 --> 04:14:14,769
This handsome face of Kang Seo Joon.

3201
04:14:14,769 --> 04:14:17,699
I'm worried that people all over the world will know about it.

3202
04:14:19,259 --> 04:14:21,169
You've become so shameless.

3203
04:14:21,169 --> 04:14:22,849
Why?

3204
04:14:22,849 --> 04:14:24,739
I love it.

3205
04:14:24,739 --> 04:14:27,709
- I'm saying it because I love it.
- I love it, too.

3206
04:14:28,559 --> 04:14:30,029
I'll go dump this.

3207
04:14:30,029 --> 04:14:32,339
- No, give that trash bag to me. I'm used to dumping it.
- Let me do it.

3208
04:14:32,339 --> 04:14:34,499
- Just one time.
- No, Kang Seo Joon!

3209
04:14:34,499 --> 04:14:36,319
Kang Seo Joon, you crossed the line.

3210
04:14:36,319 --> 04:14:37,979
Seo Joon, please.

3211
04:14:46,819 --> 04:14:52,679
I lack the American mindset, so I don't think I can wish you two to be happy.

3212
04:14:52,679 --> 04:14:57,499
And for your information, this is the next season's main product that I got inspired by you two.

3213
04:14:58,279 --> 04:15:00,059
Then I'll keep it short.

3214
04:15:01,519 --> 04:15:05,179
Without any last goodbyes,

3215
04:15:05,179 --> 04:15:07,889
Seong Yoon left for Seoul.

3216
04:15:07,889 --> 04:15:11,399
She only left behind the bracelets that she made for us.

3217
04:15:11,399 --> 04:15:14,539
How is it? Do you like the bracelet?

3218
04:15:14,539 --> 04:15:16,579
- Yes.
- Seong Yoon made this.

3219
04:15:16,579 --> 04:15:18,539
I think she made it amazingly.

3220
04:15:18,539 --> 04:15:20,979
Oh, you think she made it amazingly?

3221
04:15:20,979 --> 04:15:25,589
But where did you put that matching bracelet you had before?

3222
04:15:26,769 --> 04:15:28,789
Why are you coughing all of a sudden?

3223
04:15:28,789 --> 04:15:30,369
It's cold. Let's go inside.

3224
04:15:30,369 --> 04:15:33,069
I'm asking you. Where did that matching bracelet go?

3225
04:15:33,069 --> 04:15:35,159
Stop coughing! Don't play around with me.

3226
04:15:35,159 --> 04:15:37,499
Let's talk inside.

3227
04:15:37,499 --> 04:15:40,699
You buried it, didn't you? You buried it in the mountain like before, right?

3228
04:15:40,699 --> 04:15:43,949
- No, I didn't.
- Then, where is it?

3229
04:15:43,949 --> 04:15:45,579
- Let's go inside and talk.
- Wait, wait!

3230
04:15:45,579 --> 04:15:49,259
No, from now on, look at me.

3231
04:15:49,259 --> 04:15:51,599
This necklace. Right?

3232
04:15:51,599 --> 04:15:55,229
This necklace, and now wear this bracelet, too.

3233
04:15:56,179 --> 04:15:59,819
I have to work in the kitchen and get water on my hand a lot.

3234
04:15:59,819 --> 04:16:00,849
So it's not good for me to wear something on my hand.

3235
04:16:00,849 --> 04:16:02,769
No, you can just take it off when you are working!

3236
04:16:02,769 --> 04:16:04,899
I'll wear the bracelet on my day off,

3237
04:16:04,899 --> 04:16:07,229
and I'll wear the necklace when I'm working. Okay?

3238
04:16:07,229 --> 04:16:09,479
No, you should wear both of them.

3239
04:16:09,479 --> 04:16:10,899
- I can't...
- No, wear both of them.

3240
04:16:10,899 --> 04:16:13,729
Wear both of them, please!

3241
04:16:13,729 --> 04:16:16,679
Then, should I put this on your necklace as well?

3242
04:16:16,679 --> 04:16:18,719
- No, no.
- Let's try it on.

3243
04:16:18,719 --> 04:16:20,369
Let's try the bracelet that Jeong Seong Yoon made for us.

3244
04:16:20,369 --> 04:16:21,859
I don't want to.

3245
04:16:27,549 --> 04:16:30,679
Let's try it!

3246
04:16:41,259 --> 04:16:42,859
Did you gain some weight?

3247
04:16:42,859 --> 04:16:45,219
You are eating a lot while you are cooking, aren't you?

3248
04:16:45,219 --> 04:16:47,319
- Are you okay?
- Wait, my back...

3249
04:16:47,319 --> 04:16:48,299
Are you okay?

3250
04:16:48,299 --> 04:16:50,689
- My back is important.
- Does it hurt?

3251
04:16:50,689 --> 04:16:53,059
I'll massage you. Let's go inside.

3252
04:16:55,019 --> 04:16:59,209
A star has its own homeostasis to glow.

3253
04:16:59,209 --> 04:17:03,929
But if the universe disappears, the star wouldn't be able to exist anymore as well.

3254
04:17:13,439 --> 04:17:15,789
Seong Bin, good morning.

3255
04:17:15,789 --> 04:17:17,739
Did you sleep okay?

3256
04:17:17,739 --> 04:17:19,999
Yes, I slept fine.

3257
04:17:20,779 --> 04:17:22,339
What's going on?

3258
04:17:23,929 --> 04:17:25,599
It's a surprise.

3259
04:17:25,599 --> 04:17:27,569
Really?

3260
04:17:27,569 --> 04:17:29,659
- But...
- Why don't we get on the road?

3261
04:17:29,659 --> 04:17:31,859
I'll be your special road manager just for today.

3262
04:17:31,859 --> 04:17:35,019
Then I have to work hard and wrap it up quickly.

3263
04:17:35,019 --> 04:17:37,469
Be careful.

3264
04:17:37,469 --> 04:17:39,949
- Put your seat belt on.
- Did you tell this to Pil Hyun?

3265
04:17:39,949 --> 04:17:42,839
I did. Here's your water.

3266
04:17:42,839 --> 04:17:45,949
- Okay, I'll start driving now.
- Okay.

3267
04:17:50,289 --> 04:17:53,509
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

3268
04:17:53,509 --> 04:17:54,809
I'm fine.

3269
04:17:54,809 --> 04:17:56,959
- Are you okay? I'll get on the road now.
- Can you drive it?

3270
04:17:56,959 --> 04:17:59,619
Of course.

3271
04:17:59,619 --> 04:18:01,459
Wait, one second.

3272
04:18:06,169 --> 04:18:09,649
It's difficult for anybody when you suddenly drive a big car.

3273
04:18:11,289 --> 04:18:14,019
That Jaguar didn't get hurt before, did it?

3274
04:18:16,179 --> 04:18:17,429
Isn't this cold for you?

3275
04:18:17,429 --> 04:18:19,559
I'm okay.

3276
04:18:19,559 --> 04:18:21,440
Wait.

3277
04:18:21,440 --> 04:18:24,540
I saw this corny handkerchief a lot from somewhere.

3278
04:18:25,339 --> 04:18:28,449
It's an old one. I got it from Pil Hyun.

3279
04:18:28,449 --> 04:18:31,359
Pil Hyun gave it to you? When?

3280
04:18:31,359 --> 04:18:33,429
At my parents' funeral,

3281
04:18:33,429 --> 04:18:37,559
somebody handed this to me, saying he saw me crying.

3282
04:18:39,989 --> 04:18:41,429
Why did you ask?

3283
04:18:42,929 --> 04:18:46,489
I just didn't feel right throwing this out.

3284
04:18:46,489 --> 04:18:48,639
Wait.

3285
04:18:48,639 --> 04:18:50,489
What's wrong?

3286
04:18:50,489 --> 04:18:53,419
So that time when you had the funeral.

3287
04:18:55,669 --> 04:18:58,459
Then this is definitely mine!

3288
04:18:59,939 --> 04:19:03,709
- What are you talking about?
- Wow, I got goosebumps.

3289
04:19:03,709 --> 04:19:05,509
I guess we were really meant to be together.

3290
04:19:05,509 --> 04:19:08,069
What are you saying? Please explain it to me.

3291
04:19:08,069 --> 04:19:09,799
It's crazy.

3292
04:19:14,279 --> 04:19:17,479
I wanted to find my universe.

3293
04:19:17,479 --> 04:19:19,969
I gave this to you at that time.

3294
04:19:21,569 --> 04:19:24,849
What? Don't lie to me.

3295
04:19:24,849 --> 04:19:30,239
Inside my dark heart, a small star turned on its light.

3296
04:19:30,239 --> 04:19:31,409
I'm not lying.

3297
04:19:31,409 --> 04:19:34,180
At that time, I saw a boy in a school uniform crying,

3298
04:19:34,180 --> 04:19:37,660
so I handed this handkerchief to him.

3299
04:19:37,660 --> 04:19:41,359
♫ Your cheeks are getting blushed ♫

3300
04:19:41,359 --> 04:19:44,869
I found my own universe.

3301
04:19:46,349 --> 04:19:48,369
You heard it from Kim Pil Hyun, didn't you?

3302
04:19:48,369 --> 04:19:51,569
No. How can I hear something when I saw this handkerchief just now?

3303
04:19:51,569 --> 04:19:53,879
I'm really telling you the truth.

3304
04:19:55,179 --> 04:19:56,339
It doesn't make any sense. I can't trust you.

3305
04:19:56,339 --> 04:19:59,539
I really did give a handkerchief to you at that time.

3306
04:19:59,539 --> 04:20:02,679
Pil Hyun handed it to you, and that's how you got it. It's correct.

3307
04:20:02,679 --> 04:20:04,029
- Is it true?
- It's true!

3308
04:20:04,029 --> 04:20:05,529
- I'm driving right now!
- Look at me. Is it really true?

3309
04:20:05,529 --> 04:20:06,879
Yes, it's true!

3310
04:20:06,879 --> 04:20:09,369
It's true! Please, stop it!

3311
04:20:09,369 --> 04:20:10,579
Are you sure?

3312
04:20:10,579 --> 04:20:13,699
Where are you grabbing? Really, it's true!

3313
04:20:13,699 --> 04:20:19,379
♫ It means I love you ♫

3314
04:20:24,199 --> 04:20:26,829
With all our stories in it.

3315
04:20:26,829 --> 04:20:28,349
♫ I hope every day that's touching you ♫

3316
04:20:28,349 --> 04:20:29,869
To my star.

3317
04:20:29,869 --> 04:20:35,199
(Thank you so much for watching "To My Star 2" until now.)

3318
04:20:35,199 --> 04:20:37,249
If you are not going to wear the bracelet, give it to me.

3319
04:20:37,249 --> 04:20:39,199
No, no.

3320
04:20:39,199 --> 04:20:41,399
♫ And your pretty hand that is holding at me ♫

3321
04:20:41,399 --> 04:20:43,039
(The production team would like to thank everyone for their generous support during the shoot of "To My Star 2.")

3322
04:20:43,039 --> 04:20:47,589
♫ I don't want to let them go ♫

3323
04:20:47,589 --> 04:20:50,229
♫ It means I love you ♫

3324
04:20:50,229 --> 04:20:51,949
Please stop it!

3325
04:20:51,949 --> 04:20:53,539
Are you okay?

3326
04:20:53,539 --> 04:20:55,849
Stop the nonsense!

3327
04:20:55,849 --> 04:20:57,829
Please stop your nonsense!

3328
04:20:57,829 --> 04:20:59,889
We will!

3329
04:21:00,759 --> 04:21:05,400
♫ Won't be the same as yours ♫

3330
04:21:08,149 --> 04:21:11,090
♫ I want to say it to you ♫

3331
04:21:13,029 --> 04:21:16,819
♫ Will you look into my eyes? ♫

3332
04:21:16,819 --> 04:21:18,429
Wait!

3333
04:21:22,179 --> 04:21:26,125
♫ At this moment, when I'm looking at you ♫

3334
04:21:26,125 --> 04:21:28,489
♫  I hope every day that's touching you  ♫

3335
04:21:28,489 --> 04:21:32,759
♫ Won't be erased ♫

3336
04:21:34,499 --> 04:21:37,429
♫ The way you are looking at me ♫

3337
04:21:37,429 --> 04:21:41,459
(We dedicate "To My Star 2" to the late Hwang Seon Hwan.)

3338
04:21:41,459 --> 04:21:44,539
♫ I don't want to let them go ♫

3339
04:21:44,539 --> 04:21:48,260
By the way, Baby. I just thought about it,

3340
04:21:48,260 --> 04:21:51,450
so why did we break up?

3341
04:21:52,429 --> 04:21:56,399
I don't know. I don't remember it.

3342
04:21:56,399 --> 04:21:58,149
♫ You and I are twinkling ♫
