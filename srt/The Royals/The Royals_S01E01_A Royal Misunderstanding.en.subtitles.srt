1
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,750
Do not overthink this, Sophia.

2
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,791
It's just a board meeting.
You've done this a million times.

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,500
We have a solid pitch.
Our numbers also make sense.

4
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,750
Sophia Kanmani Shekhar,

5
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:30,416
you're the CEO
of the best hospitality start-up.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,750
You've got this, Sophia.

7
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,375
You've got this.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,916
-Open this please.
-I can't, ma'am.

9
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,291
There's a VIP shoot going on.

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,000
So? This is a public beach.

11
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, but the public isn't allowed here
right now. It's a VIP shoot. So, sorry.

12
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,583
-Hello. Come in.
-We are going for a take.

13
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,375
Yes, yes.

14
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:02,083
All right, let's make some
beach magic happen!

15
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,791
Smile!

16
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,708
Chin up!

17
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,458
Soft and nice.

18
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,666
Okay, walk towards me.

19
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:30,500
Turn to the left.

20
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,333
Let's play with the ocean breeze.

21
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,958
Guys, where is our lock up?

22
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,750
-Calm down, calm down.
-Oh, shit!

23
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,208
-Coffee!
-Stand back. Stand back! Everyone…

24
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,833
Okay, okay.

25
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,541
Hey!

26
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,041
Calm down.

27
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,166
Coffee!

28
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,625
Sir! Aviraaj sir!

29
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,750
Sir! Please come back!

30
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,666
Sir!

31
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,041
Sophia ma'am!

32
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,166
Sophia ma'am!

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,250
I mixed up your meeting time.
It is right now.

34
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,208
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Ma'am, you took off.

35
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,375
-Keertana! Shit!
-I couldn't keep up, ma'am.

36
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,333
Ma'am, your clothes?

37
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,875
-No, I don't have time to change.
-Sorry, ma'am.

38
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,458
How could you mix up the time, Keertana?

39
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,750
It looks so unprofessional.

40
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,083
-Okay? Okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

41
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,125
Okay.

42
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,375
Hi.

43
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,458
Oh, come on, Sophia!

44
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,333
Don't tell me your cardio
is more important than this meeting.

45
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,750
You know there's no better time
than the time I get with my board,

46
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,708
especially when it's about
the future of my company.

47
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,958
So, let's get right into it.
The Royal B&B.

48
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,875
There's nothing like this in the market.

49
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,666
We'll break-even within three years.
And just instinctively--

50
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,166
It'll take at least four years.

51
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,208
Since when did you
start playing safe, Zubin?

52
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,666
That's not called playing safe.

53
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,625
I dream with my eyes open.

54
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,833
And the numbers
are right in front of your eyes.

55
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,416
1.25 crore within quarter two--

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,875
No, no. One second, Sophia.
This business of yours,

57
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,833
The Royal B&B…

58
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,250
where the customers are gonna stay
with a royal family in their palace…

59
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,041
-Who's your target?
-The common man.

60
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,041
A common man who can't even afford it!

61
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,208
And the initial investment is high

62
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,250
-while the returns are low.
-Exactly.

63
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,375
You should focus on WorkPotato.

64
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,083
He's absolutely right.
And Kunal gets it. Kunal?

65
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,416
Zubin, I hear all of you and trust me--

66
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,416
Till now, y'all have had absolute trust
on Kunal and my judgement.

67
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,250
And let's be real, all of us
have made quite a profit out of it.

68
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,208
So, I humbly request my board

69
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,666
to please let me do my work.

70
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,333
I really know how to run my company.

71
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,708
Sophia and I believe

72
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,833
that The Royal B&B can take us to the
most profitable league of hospitality.

73
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,916
Our business plan
and projections are in front of you.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,958
Let's meet tomorrow. Till then, let our
CEO enjoy her big award in Sri Lanka.

75
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,000
-Good idea.
-Sophia?

76
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,083
-Sure.
-Cool.

77
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:29,416
And the Entrepreneur of the Year award
goes to Sophia Kanmani Shekhar,

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,791
the CEO and Co-Founder of WorkPotato,

79
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:36,041
a successful start-up that has changed
the B&B game in the hospitality business.

80
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:40,500
…to my co-founder Kunal Mehta,
our WorkPotato family,

81
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,500
and all my investors.
This is just the beginning.

82
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,916
Sophia?

83
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,083
-Oh, my God. Stunning!
-Sameera!

84
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,625
Congratulations! And so well deserved.

85
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,708
Thank you. It's been a while.

86
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,500
So, how's life
with Raghanis' fat paycheck?

87
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,041
No complaints. It's amazing.

88
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,500
-You look great. I can see.
-Thank you.

89
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,958
Listen, I heard
that your board is blocking you.

90
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:17,750
Your brilliance needs a new address.
Raghanis. We're happy to invest in you.

91
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't pamper me yet, Sameera.

92
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,333
Let me work for it a bit.

93
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,416
All right. Enjoy your evening.
You deserve it. Yeah?

94
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,458
-Thank you. I'll see you.
-Okay, bye. I'll see you.

95
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,625
-Ms. Kashyap!
-Oh, hi. Coming!

96
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,916
-Sameera, hi. Can I speak to you?
-Seriously?

97
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,916
Sophia, hi. Quick question.

98
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,625
Is it true that your board
is not supporting you?

99
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,291
Can I get a comment on that?

100
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,583
Hi, Nandini ma'am. Such nice curls.

101
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,708
-Ma'am just got an important call.
-Okay.

102
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,625
Ma'am's really important.
I'm really important.

103
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,875
You are important too,
but she's getting an important call.

104
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,416
We must leave importantly.
It's the Bombay Stock Exchange, ma'am.

105
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,541
The market's crashing.

106
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,416
Ma'am, that was Nandini Jagtap.
Top business journalist.

107
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,458
-Really?
-She overheard you and Sameera.

108
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,166
-She was trying to get a scoop.
-No way!

109
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,333
Yes way, ma'am. That's what I'm here for.

110
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,083
The business of business journalism
is dirty business.

111
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,333
In the name of the most enthusiastic
member of this squad.

112
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,916
-Cheers!
-One second.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,708
Your parents would've been so proud
if they were alive today.

114
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,708
What happened? Why aren't you smiling?

115
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,083
-What?
-Cheers!

116
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,583
Relax, don't stress yourself.

117
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,791
Alright, Grandma.

118
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,333
By the way, where's Grandpa?

119
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,458
How's his knee pain?

120
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,291
-Clearly, you had the most fun day.
-What did you say?

121
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,291
-…is not required.
-Just like a tail.

122
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,625
-Went in there…
-What are you saying?

123
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,333
Look, I'm super strong…

124
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,458
-I ran away? Excuse me.
-Your horse ran.

125
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,375
-I can't hear you--
-Ma'am.

126
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,000
-Yes?
-No video calls allowed at the bar.

127
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,250
-What?
-It disturbs the customers.

128
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,375
I… Listen I'm sorry…

129
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm disturbing your customers?

130
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,875
And what about them?

131
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,416
-That's our VIP section, ma'am.
-So?

132
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,791
-I can't say anything to them.
-Carry on.

133
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,666
-I'm sorry.
-Enjoy your award.

134
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,791
-Darling?
-Grandma, one second.

135
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,541
I'll call you back.

136
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,250
Sorry, ma'am, you are not allowed there.

137
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,041
Because that's the VIP section? I know.

138
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,250
You can't stop me. You know that, right?

139
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,208
Hey, runner girl.

140
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,125
-Excuse me?
-Horse guy.

141
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,625
Hi. Hi.

142
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,208
I just came over to say

143
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,875
that we can listen to everything
you guys are saying, loud and clear.

144
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,250
And, obviously, all of you are VIPs,

145
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,000
so if your private conversations
remain private, that'll be great, right?

146
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:39,083
So, could you please
just keep your volume…

147
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,250
Yeah? Thanks.

148
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,250
Whatever.

149
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,083
-Let's just sit.
-Excuse me.

150
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,333
-Yeah?
-You didn't tell me your name.

151
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,125
Runner girl?

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,583
Fair play. Listen, I'm sorry.
My friends and I often get out of control.

153
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,416
If I was in your place, I would also…

154
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,000
-So, I get it.
-It's okay.

155
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:08,166
By the way, because of you,
I got into a tiff with Coffee.

156
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,333
-Who?
-Coffee, my horse.

157
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,500
On the beach.

158
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,916
Coffee said that on the beach, you…

159
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,625
Yeah.

160
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,208
-So, you…
-I did.

161
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,500
I told him you wouldn't do
something like that.

162
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,125
But it still broke his heart.

163
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,375
I mean, I know
you're a lot faster than him,

164
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,125
but his heart weighs four kilos.

165
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,541
You know what?

166
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,166
Tell Coffee that I'm sorry.

167
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,708
Really?

168
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,291
There you go.

169
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,125
Coffee, I'm with runner girl.

170
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,958
She's saying sorry.

171
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,041
No, I can't say that. Okay, hold on.

172
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,958
He says he's ready to forget everything,

173
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,250
so long as you buy him a drink.

174
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,083
But… what does Coffee drink?

175
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,833
MOM

176
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,125
I think you should get it.

177
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,500
Yes, Mom?

178
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,041
Kunal, it's Nandini's job
to look for scoops.

179
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,750
I didn't tell her about the board.

180
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,416
Kunal, do you think I'm stupid?

181
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,500
No, I'm not coming to Morpur.

182
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,208
What do you mean, why? You know this.

183
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,583
And calling me repeatedly
won't change that.

184
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,166
Oh, it's my responsibility?

185
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,625
Kunal, you know how she is.

186
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,041
Mom, I'm tired of repeating myself.
I'm not interested in Motibagh.

187
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,875
Who's running away from responsibilities--

188
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,000
What? I'm out.

189
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,041
Somewhere important.

190
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,083
Of course, my life
in New York is a big deal.

191
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,083
Mom, I'm a living, breathing adult.

192
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,875
I can take my own decisions.
You should focus on yours.

193
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,083
Then don't take the calls, man.

194
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,458
Go to bed. It's late.
It's not good for your health.

195
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,375
Bye-bye.

196
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,583
Good night.

197
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,833
Hi.

198
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,125
-So?
-You okay?

199
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,750
Yeah.

200
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,583
Shall we?

201
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,291
Ouch!

202
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,250
-Sorry. You okay?
-It's okay. Yeah.

203
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,291
Lights? I mean whatever you prefer.

204
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,500
No, I'm cool.

205
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,875
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

206
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,791
-I think, off, yeah? Okay.
-I don't… Yeah.

207
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,208
I think this is it.

208
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,041
-My hair.
-Sorry. Sorry.

209
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,666
Just…

210
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,708
Sorry.

211
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,708
-I'm so sorry…
-Maybe this was a bad idea?

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,500
-Do you just wanna chill for a bit. Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah. Okay.

213
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,375
I was just not feeling it.

214
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,791
What do you mean, you were not feeling it?

215
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,458
You're not my type.

216
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,541
Yeah. Weird.

217
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,500
It's okay. You don't like perfection.

218
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,375
Actually, I don't like arrogance. Yeah.

219
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,541
Arrogance?

220
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,166
The arrogance that makes you a "VIP."

221
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,208
Okay, so you not being a VIP
is my fault now?

222
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,125
No. But you being loud

223
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,125
and attention-seeking

224
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,791
is definitely your fault.

225
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,458
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize
that you go to bars to meditate.

226
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,208
And I didn't realize
that you're so jobless.

227
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,583
Now I know, you're omniscient.

228
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,750
-That's right.
-Any other superpowers?

229
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,208
Hard work, focus, self-reliance.
Have you ever heard of these?

230
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,250
Have you always been so uptight?

231
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,833
When was the last time you eased up?

232
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,416
You know, only the privileged
can afford to ease up.

233
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,458
I have responsibilities.

234
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,625
The only responsibilty you took
is to ruin my evening.

235
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,791
Go, change the world.

236
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,875
I am changing the world. At my own accord.
But what are you doing?

237
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,000
How long are you gonna live off
your father's inheritance?

238
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,750
At least I don't live
in a fool's paradise.

239
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,666
I may be entitled,
but I'm not foolish or a show-off.

240
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,666
I'd rather be foolish than a spoiled brat.

241
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,583
You know what?
You've really ruined my mood.

242
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,791
And you really fucked up my evening.

243
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,333
-So, just leave.
-Gladly.

244
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,416
-Good.
-People say it, and I finally saw it.

245
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Money can't buy class.

246
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,458
Yeah, but it can
definitely buy a VIP section.

247
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,416
Go fuck yourself.

248
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,333
-I'll do it better than you!
-Well, you're gonna have to.

249
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,500
Psycho!

250
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,333
Why the fuck do you do this, Sophia?

251
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,833
Just…

252
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,791
Nandini. Hi. Sophia.

253
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,500
I wanted to tell you
something confidential.

254
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:19,666
Sameera has shown
a lot of interest in my next venture,

255
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,666
and I'm actually considering it.

256
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,541
Pankaj-sa, book a morning flight.

257
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,791
Tell Mom
her responsible son is coming home.

258
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,416
Greetings, Hukum.
Here's this week's schedule.

259
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,125
The lawyer is here.

260
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,375
Hukum.

261
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,666
-Greetings, Mom.
-God bless you.

262
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,041
Greetings, Hukum.

263
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,958
-Let's begin.
-Let's give it a few more minutes.

264
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,250
He'll be here soon.

265
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,541
-Pankaj.
-Yes?

266
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,500
-Did he board the flight?
-Yes, Hukum.

267
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,458
How long will you indulge him, Mom?

268
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,458
And then you complain
about him being irresponsible.

269
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,250
We've been waiting for six months.

270
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:48,500
It's only right to wait for your brother
for your father's will reading, Diggy.

271
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,958
Family's important.

272
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,541
Okay, then, where's Jinnie?

273
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,708
I have an announcement to make.

274
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,375
Thanks to Rousseau,

275
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,958
from now on… Wait for it…

276
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,083
I'll be vegan.

277
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,000
But last month,
you both were devouring laal maas.

278
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:04,916
That was Ryan.

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,083
And I broke up with him years ago.
This is the new guy, Rousseau.

280
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,958
Sounds like true love, Jinnie.

281
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,500
-Hukum.
-Greetings.

282
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,916
-Hukum.
-Hukum is here.

283
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,083
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

284
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,166
-Fizzy!
-How are you, Girdhari-sa?

285
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,541
Hey.

286
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,541
Hey, Jinnie-bunny.

287
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,458
How are you?

288
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,083
-Mom.
-God bless you.

289
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,791
Be on time for once, Fizzy.

290
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,666
-Your Highness.
-God bless you.

291
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,875
Where is Maji?

292
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,833
You just need to think of Maji,

293
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,083
and she shall appear!

294
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,291
You look stunning.

295
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,750
Lovely to see you, beta.

296
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,208
-Please, have a seat.
-Thank you.

297
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,291
Oh, and I almost forgot.

298
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,916
-Tell me.
-It was there… Ah-ha!

299
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,708
Voilà!

300
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,875
Edibles! Gummies!

301
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,166
-Wow!
-It's the right one, right?

302
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,250
-This is so irresponsible.
-Thank you so much!

303
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,208
-Customs could've arrested you.
-Who gets arrested for gummy bears?

304
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,375
I have fools all around me.

305
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,541
-May we please begin?
-Yes.

306
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,583
Six months after
the demise of the Maharaja,

307
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,541
here's a list of his current properties.

308
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,333
Dad's properties are anyway
all listed on Wikipedia.

309
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,750
Please let's skip this part.

310
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,958
"I, Yuvanath Singh,
being of sound mind and body,

311
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,000
bequeath my assets as below.

312
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,583
I leave my Sheet Mahal
to my daughter, Divyaranjini.

313
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,416
The Sukoon Mansion
goes to my wife, Padmaja.

314
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,708
Fateh Mansion goes to my son, Aviraaj.

315
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,750
And the Shikaar Fort to Digvijay.

316
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,166
Maji sahiba will retain the north wing
of Motibagh as long as she's alive,

317
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,916
and Padmaja will retain the west wing.

318
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,458
My agricultural land assets are to be
divided equally between my three children.

319
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,625
What's agricultural assets?

320
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,375
My Rolex watches
are to be given to Girdhari.

321
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:13,958
I leave the throne of Morpur,
and responsibility of Motibagh Palace,

322
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,375
on the condition that it must remain
part of Morpur family estate,

323
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,458
to my son Aviraaj."

324
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,000
One second.

325
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,083
Wait a minute. I think you are mistaken.

326
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,208
There's a letter too.

327
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,833
"Dear Fizzy,

328
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,500
Diggy, and…

329
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,416
-Jin--"
-Give it to me. I'll read it.

330
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,583
Here.

331
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,416
"Dear Fizzy, Diggy, and Jinnie,

332
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,875
you may not understand my decisions,

333
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,666
but they come
from a place of love for you.

334
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,416
Still, if they've hurt you,

335
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,166
please forgive me.

336
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,708
Love, Your Dad."

337
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,250
-Wow!
-Oh, Pickles.

338
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,625
I mean, wow, this is fantastic.

339
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,708
Calm down, Diggy.

340
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,041
I have no interest in the place anyway.
You can have it.

341
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,125
Wow. You're so kind.

342
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,708
Why did you stop? Continue reading.

343
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,625
Okay.

344
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:30,875
"I leave my monetary assets to Maurice."

345
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,416
-Maurice?
-Maurice?

346
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,416
Maurice?

347
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,500
-Maurice?
-Maurice?

348
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,666
I need the monetary assets.
I have big plans.

349
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,000
Hang on.

350
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,875
Who is this Maurice?

351
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,750
How would I know?

352
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,291
-Only your dad would know that.
-Okay.

353
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,458
Dad, who is Maurice?

354
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,000
Dad? I wonder why he isn't answering.

355
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,041
-Fizzy!
-That's right, he's dead!

356
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,000
-Fizzy!
-Fizzy!

357
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,166
-What's wrong with you?
-Stop it!

358
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,333
You're out of line, Fizzy!

359
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,333
Fine, I'll stop it.
But what are we to do about this now?

360
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,333
Let's find Maurice and take them to court.

361
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,625
No one from this family is going to court.

362
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,250
If this is your father's decision,

363
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,416
we will respect it.

364
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,791
And I'll find out

365
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:27,875
who this Maurice is.

366
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,500
It's just a matter of money.

367
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,208
We still have the land.

368
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,916
We have a roof over our heads, the sky,

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,625
butterflies, the wind,
animals, we have it all.

370
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,666
Be grateful no disaster befell us.

371
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,583
I'm sorry, I forgot to mention the debts.

372
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:54,958
What?

373
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,916
Yes. Morpur family is under a lot of debt.

374
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,250
Debt?

375
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,708
Okay, I'm out.

376
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,708
Fizzy!

377
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,291
Fizzy!

378
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,208
-Fizzy!
-He's gone.

379
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,708
-Paddy!
-Maji!

380
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,375
What's going on, Paddy?

381
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,208
I think Zubin will finally
have to accept our offer now.

382
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,166
Is the shortlist ready?

383
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,875
What do you want? Twelve months?

384
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,000
Ideally. But…

385
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,458
I can manage in six months also…

386
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,583
Come on, Sophia, not again.
We're sticking to 12.

387
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,458
-That's the minimum we need. Okay?
-Okay, okay.

388
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,666
Just to clarify,

389
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,416
Sophia did get an informal offer.

390
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,041
But how this news got out,
absolutely no clue.

391
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,250
When this informal offer
turns formal, let's talk then.

392
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,833
Zubin, you started your first company
with 20,000 rupees.

393
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:55,041
Today, it's an international
market leader. Why?

394
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,916
Because of your vision.

395
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,375
The same vision
that him and I trust so much.

396
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,750
And now it's your turn, Zubin,
to show trust in us.

397
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,083
Okay, I get it.

398
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,125
Come to the point. What's the timeline?

399
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,208
Eighteen months.

400
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,458
Can we please be a little realistic?

401
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,583
Okay.

402
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,541
-Twelve.
-Yeah.

403
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,500
-Twelve's fine.
-Twelve months for a pilot test?

404
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,750
You know that it needs at least 12 months.

405
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,583
You know it better than anybody
in this room

406
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,041
-that the least--
-Six.

407
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,166
Six months. Not a day more.

408
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,041
We'll do it.

409
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,125
Six months.

410
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:31,916
Yeah.

411
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,541
-Okay.
-Okay.

412
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,541
It's difficult, but we'll do it.

413
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,708
Okay.

414
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,583
-Okay.
-And if this fails,

415
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:44,625
WorkPotato must return
the entire seed money of this project.

416
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,166
With interest.

417
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,125
-That's a little extreme, okay?
-Deal.

418
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,208
Deal.

419
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,541
Deal, Ms. Shekhar.

420
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,083
Guys, I know we're short on time.

421
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:06,750
But if anyone can pull it off,
that's my team.

422
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,208
You know the drill.

423
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:11,625
Keertana, is the list
of royal palaces ready?

424
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,041
-Ready, ma'am.
-With their family details.

425
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,250
-It'll be done, ma'am.
-Okay, good.

426
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,708
Niki, our pitch deck
has to be kickass, guys.

427
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,500
-Of course.
-We can't take any chances.

428
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,416
On it, Soph.

429
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,000
Kunal, we must find a place within a week
and lock the deal with the family.

430
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,875
-Yeah.
-We only have five months

431
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,875
-until we launch, guys.
-Okay.

432
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:29,875
Within five months,

433
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:35,333
accommodations, renovations,
design, staffing, testing must be locked.

434
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:39,000
Once the rooms are ready,
then we focus on our USP.

435
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,500
One that makes us stand out
from other palace hotels.

436
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:46,083
A special royal experience
curated for the common man.

437
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,166
The Royal B&B.

438
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,875
-Sounds great, Soph.
-That's it.

439
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:52,083
After that, we launch our pilot.

440
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:55,875
Okay, guys, step one.
Let's select our royal palace.

441
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,750
Niki, did you cross-check
the pitch deck properly?

442
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,708
-Chill, Soph, everything is in place.
-Okay, good.

443
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,916
I love it!

444
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,250
What was the horse guy's name?

445
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,625
What a stunning palace, Niki!

446
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,333
Was he hot?

447
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,583
We're here to work.
Shall we focus on that?

448
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,000
You're upset. So he was hot.

449
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,250
No, he wasn't hot.

450
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,000
He was bloody annoying.

451
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:21,458
What did the horse guy even do?

452
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,041
Well, he did nothing!

453
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,208
And that's why we're here.

454
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,291
We believe that until now, our palaces
haven't been used the way they should be.

455
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,166
They all come with the promise
of a royal experience,

456
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,375
but deliver the same old
regular hotel experience.

457
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,041
Maharani ji, Maharaja ji,

458
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,541
we understand that the USP of this place

459
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,416
is the art, culture,
history and the people here.

460
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,666
At The Royal B&B,

461
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,208
a commoner will be able
to meet the royalty up close.

462
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,750
They will be able to come here,
stay with you,

463
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,541
and learn what
"Yes, Hukum" actually means.

464
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,333
Sounds wonderful to me.

465
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:57,250
Ms. Shekhar, we're in.

466
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:58,666
That's great.

467
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:02,583
We just have a few inputs.

468
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:09,750
No, Kunal, this is not gonna be possible.
We have to find an alternative.

469
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,750
Soph, it's a small compromise.

470
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,833
They won't be here,
but the palace will be ours.

471
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,833
The launch is in less than six months.

472
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,666
And we won't get a better palace.

473
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,083
Without a royal family,

474
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,750
we'll be like any other palace hotel.

475
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,500
The Royal B&B's ethos

476
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,833
is that we're promising the common man
an experience of living with royalty.

477
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,125
How will we manage that?

478
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,500
We need an alternative. Okay?

479
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,416
-Okay.
-Okay!

480
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,875
It was already difficult to manage
Motibagh's expenses, Bhabhi-sa.

481
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,916
now we'll have to manage the debts too.

482
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,958
Because of electricity cuts,

483
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:48,958
my weed babies
are also wilting in the heat.

484
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,166
Poor babies.

485
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,458
Not once did he think

486
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,541
how I'll handle it all by myself.

487
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,666
Relax. Take a deep breath.

488
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,958
And chill, Paddy.

489
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:15,041
Do you have a plan yet?

490
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:19,041
Your Pickles left us in a pickle.

491
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:23,083
Now, we'll have to look for ways
to even pay for groceries.

492
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:26,916
And before even one
of my three children disappears,

493
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,125
the new heir must be crowned.

494
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,875
Paddy, I meant you!

495
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,500
What are you going to do?

496
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:37,875
What do you mean?

497
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,791
I was never a romantic,

498
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,375
but I believe

499
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:45,000
that loving your children,

500
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:48,083
and grieving your dead husband

501
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:52,708
shouldn't be the only things a woman does.

502
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,875
Live a little, Paddy.

503
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,458
Your husband is dead,

504
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,500
not you!

505
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:19,875
Dad, you must stay here for my birthday.

506
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:23,375
Sorry, Fizzy, I can't attend the party.

507
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:28,083
But I have a gift for you, son,
and you'll love him.

508
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,291
You're the only thing that Dad did right.

509
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,500
I missed you a lot,

510
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,375
my old friend.

511
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,791
You only missed Khan, Hukum?

512
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,291
Not me?

513
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:51,958
Rafiq chacha.

514
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,208
How are you?

515
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,583
I'm very happy now that I've seen you.

516
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:01,208
I missed you a lot.

517
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,250
But I didn't get any hiccups.

518
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,916
Now how would I know about your hiccups?

519
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,291
We didn't get to meet last time either.

520
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,833
You left soon after the funeral.

521
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:22,625
-Onions, salt, duck, curd.
-Hukum.

522
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:31,500
When he was out wasting our money
in the name of modelling,

523
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:35,083
I was here, handling all the
royal responsibilities by myself.

524
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,500
-Hukum.
-I'm the fool.

525
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,875
Hukum.

526
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,208
Sorry.

527
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:45,208
I work to maintain the palace,

528
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,791
so he can go around
partying irresponsibly?

529
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:47,750
Hukum.

530
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,916
Then why am I still here?
I should take off too.

531
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,625
What did I get in return? Nothing.

532
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:59,250
If I was out enjoying my life
instead of following my Dad's word,

533
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,250
then maybe…

534
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,333
just maybe, he would've considered me
worthy of this palace.

535
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:06,833
For now, I wonder if even this duck curry
is worthy of lunch at this palace.

536
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,500
It's duck curry, Hukum.

537
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,208
No, just the salmon for me, Girdhari-sa.
Thank you.

538
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,833
Mom,

539
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,333
I'm sorry.

540
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,541
I shouldn't have said all that.

541
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,666
Don't worry,

542
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,208
we'll find a solution before I leave
for New York. We're all here.

543
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,583
No one is going to New York.

544
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,541
Why aren't you having the duck curry?

545
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:50,583
Duck curry.

546
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,958
No, thanks.

547
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:54,208
How can I not, Mom?
My life is in New York.

548
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,208
Your life is here, Fizzy.

549
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:58,333
And how long will I handle
all this by myself?

550
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:01,000
In fact, I should go away to New York.

551
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,166
It's a light preparation. No extra fats.

552
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,958
-Try it.
-I'm okay. Thank you.

553
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:07,791
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

554
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,875
Mom, I'm serious.

555
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,458
All right. You may leave.

556
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,375
No one cares about me anyway.

557
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,416
You know what? All of you should leave.

558
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,250
I'm right here. Can no one ever see me?

559
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,791
I see you.

560
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:25,125
I also see
that you're no longer vegan, huh?

561
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:28,125
How about dealing
with the issue at hand first?

562
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:29,833
Do any of you here

563
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:33,250
have any bright ideas
to save us from Dad's parting gift?

564
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,208
Sell Motibagh.

565
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,583
-What?
-What?

566
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,083
We're not selling Motibagh.

567
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:41,958
Mom, Motibagh's walls and customs,

568
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,416
both are ancient and obsolete.

569
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:48,000
Before it crumbles
and takes us down with it, let's sell it.

570
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,416
What you're mocking is our home.

571
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,875
And Dad loved this palace.

572
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:54,625
Dad loved his palace for sure,

573
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:56,083
but didn't care much about our future.

574
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,958
As if you care about our future.

575
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,958
What about us being stuck in the past
for the last six months, thanks to you?

576
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,958
His will couldn't even be read
in your absence.

577
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,125
Correct. That's the right approach.

578
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,666
Be sentimental about the past,
and stay clueless about the future.

579
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,708
You are the one who's clueless.

580
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:12,166
Can we please discuss the present first?

581
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,750
Absolutely. And presently,

582
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:19,083
the duck curry is fantastic.
It's delicious!

583
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,833
Girdhari, compliments to the chef.

584
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:27,000
Tell him to always be this cheerful
and content while cooking for us.

585
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:33,833
Let's think of a way to save Motibagh.

586
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:36,208
Did you find out anything
about that Maurice?

587
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:38,291
I'm trying.

588
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,833
It's not like I have a magic wand

589
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,166
that I can wave, and find out everything.

590
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,625
Stop pressurizing me.

591
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,166
I found someone.

592
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,916
Who knows Maurice?

593
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,416
No. Someone who can save us.

594
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,000
A company.

595
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,083
What are you waiting for? Call them.

596
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,125
Diggy, call them. Now!

597
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,791
I'm at lunch.

598
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:09,083
-That is good.
-I knew it!

599
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:19,625
Soph, thank God we got Motibagh Palace
at such short notice.

600
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,166
I'm surprised they accepted our deal
even without a pitch.

601
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,291
Beautiful.

602
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:32,541
Soph.

603
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,125
What!

604
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:38,791
Fuck.

605
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:44,166
Man, this is worse
than the profile pics on dating apps.

606
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,666
That's what happens
when you don't keep up with the times.

607
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,666
We'll have to rework the budget, guys.

608
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,458
This is a disaster, Kunal.

609
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,791
Maharaja of Morpur
passed away six months ago.

610
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,458
His son handles everything now.

611
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,708
-What's his name?
-Maharaja Digvijay Singh.

612
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,333
Soph?

613
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,791
We'll handle it together.

614
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,250
This "we'll handle it together" stunt
you guys pull

615
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,791
complicates the matter for me.

616
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,625
And I won't be able to handle it again.

617
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,416
Greetings, Hukum.

618
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
-Greetings.
-Namaste.

619
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:16,458
-Heartiest welcome to Motibagh Palace.
-Thank you.

620
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:19,000
This is the royal dining hall.

621
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,666
And please remember

622
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,666
to greet the elders of the royal family
with a namaste only.

623
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,166
But if they extend their hands…

624
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,125
only then shake hands.

625
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:33,333
Madam, please don't touch the walls.
These painted walls are very antique.

626
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,000
-Not touching.
-Okay.

627
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,958
This is the royal darbar hall.

628
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,875
Every Maharaja of Morpur,
generation after generation,

629
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,375
has ruled from this throne.

630
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,458
She's so pretty.

631
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,541
Madam, please don't sit there.

632
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,291
-I am so, so sorry.
-Keertana, come here.

633
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,125
Keertana, you can't sit there.

634
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,541
And the window you see up there--

635
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,000
Girdhari ji,
we've seen enough of the palace.

636
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,875
Can we please meet the Maharaja now?

637
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:07,833
I'm sorry, but it'll be some time
before Hukum can meet you.

638
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,916
-But it's already been an hour!
-It's okay. It's okay, Kunal.

639
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,083
-That's fine, Girdhari ji. Let's go.
-Please.

640
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,875
-Is that him?
-Yes.

641
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:16,250
-Hukum.
-Hello.

642
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:18,166
-Hello, Digvijay. How are you?
-Welcome.

643
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,291
-Pleasure.
-Hi.

644
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,666
Sorry I kept you waiting.

645
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,875
That's absolutely fine.

646
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,833
Girdhari ji knows the palace well.

647
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:27,208
Of course. He has been with Motibagh
since before I was born.

648
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,208
Hukum.

649
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,791
So, Digvijay, shall we discuss
the terms of the deal?

650
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:34,833
Sure. I understand your terms and numbers.

651
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,041
You have six months till launch. Correct?

652
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,583
-Yes.
-Yes, but we want to make it clear

653
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:43,208
that this will neither be a boutique hotel
nor host any celebrity weddings.

654
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,708
We want complete--

655
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,625
-We…
-Soph, you were saying?

656
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,250
Yeah… that…

657
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,875
We need complete creative control.

658
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,208
-Yeah.
-That should be doable.

659
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,416
Let's go inside and discuss the details.

660
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,166
But, overall, that works for us.

661
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,250
So, Your Highness, finalised your deal?

662
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:22,875
My brother, Aviraaj.

663
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:25,541
Kunal Mehta, CEO, WorkPotato.

664
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,958
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

665
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,083
I'm the CFO. Ms. Shekhar is the boss.

666
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,416
My apologies, Ms. Shekhar.

667
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,833
The Maharaja is forgiven.
Sophia Shekhar. CEO, WorkPotato.

668
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,333
Actually…

669
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:45,333
-There's been a misunderstanding.
-The CEO is forgiven.

670
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:59,083
Aviraaj Singh, Maharaja of Morpur.

671
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:10,500
-Okay. Shall we?
-Yeah, sure.

672
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,750
Soph.

673
