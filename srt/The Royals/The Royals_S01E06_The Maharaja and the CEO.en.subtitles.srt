1
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,291
I would love to do this again.

2
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,083
But do you wanna try something else
next time?

3
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,291
Like what?

4
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,250
A date?

5
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:14,791
No.

6
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,333
No, I didn't say date.

7
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:21,000
We can talk. Like, normal conversations
between two regular people.

8
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,583
Why? Do you want to go on a date?

9
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,541
No.

10
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,041
Not at all.

11
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,250
Talking sounds good.

12
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,208
-When? Today?
-Hmm.

13
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:37,083
-And, no Maharaja talk, no CEO talk.
-Not at all.

14
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,666
Just normal conversations
between two regular people. Right?

15
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,416
Stop it.

16
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,541
Stop it! Our main launch is in three days.

17
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,791
So what--

18
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,916
I'll show you the carpet samples tomorrow.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,458
-Yeah, sounds good.
-Yeah?

20
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,291
-Yeah. Okay.
-Okay.

21
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,791
Girdhari ji?

22
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,541
Rani-sa would like to see you.

23
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,416
-Right now?
-Yes.

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,666
Okay.

25
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,750
Welcome back, Kunal sir.

26
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,166
Sorry for being late.

27
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,708
We'll have to postpone
The Royal B&B's launch.

28
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:20,958
-What?
-Why?

29
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,708
Rani-sa, the launch is in three days.

30
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,041
And the preparations are done.

31
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,041
Akshaya Tritiya is in three days.

32
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,125
This is the most auspicious time
in the last 15 years.

33
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:35,250
And that's why Aviraaj
will be crowned in three days.

34
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,750
What about our launch, Rani-sa?

35
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,291
The invites have been sent out.

36
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,125
We're ready to go. We're ready.

37
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,958
And I don't think you understand how big
of a problem it is for us, Rani-sa.

38
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,291
We really need your help.

39
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,791
You don't understand, Sophia…

40
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:53,458
that a Maharaja gets crowned
only once in a lifetime.

41
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,041
And so does our launch.

42
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,416
But a lot happens with the coronation.

43
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,625
Ideally, more than
40 royal families come over.

44
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,666
People from far and wide attend it.

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,583
But unfortunately, the situation is such

46
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,125
that Fizzy's coronation won't be as grand.

47
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,000
Even so, it should be memorable.

48
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,625
Rani-sa, what if we organize the launch

49
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,666
and Aviraaj's coronation on the same day?

50
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,791
-Okay.
-No, no!

51
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,208
I think it's a great idea.

52
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,000
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

53
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,083
Right? And you know what?

54
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,250
The Royal B&B will take care
of half the expenses.

55
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,708
Invite everyone you want.

56
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,958
Make it grand.

57
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,208
This date is auspicious
for start a new business too.

58
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,333
It's great!

59
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,833
So, what kind of launch is it going to be?

60
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,791
One befitting Morpur's grandeur.

61
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,416
-That's right.
-Fifty biggest hospitality influencers

62
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,250
and top media reporters will be there.

63
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,500
If we give front row seats
to the influencers,

64
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,291
Aviraaj's name will become
a household name.

65
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,958
This is gonna be big. We will make it big.

66
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,125
Just trust us.

67
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,083
Okay.

68
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,666
-Great.
-Great.

69
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,791
-And Sophia…
-Yes?

70
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,500
When will you tell Aviraaj?

71
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,250
What?

72
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,000
Kunal.

73
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,000
Hi.

74
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,125
Hi.

75
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,833
I know I shouldn't have taken such
a big decision without consulting you,

76
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,125
but at that moment, it felt right and…

77
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,208
You know how I am and…

78
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,791
I'm really sorry.

79
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,458
Soph, your decision was absolutely right.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,291
It's a great idea.

81
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,416
-Really?
-Yeah.

82
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,541
And… Zubin?

83
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,625
I'll handle him.

84
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,833
Focus on the launch.

85
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,375
Kunal, we haven't spoken in a while.

86
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,666
I really miss us.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,125
Shall we go out for dinner?

88
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,166
Yeah.

89
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,000
I was thinking about it too.

90
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,500
After the launch?

91
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,750
Yeah. Sure.

92
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,666
Thank you.

93
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,916
I'll see you.

94
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,875
Kunal, funders are really excited.

95
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,541
They want to meet you. So, dress sharp.

96
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,625
I can't make it.

97
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,708
You haven't told her yet.

98
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,125
Kunal, why don't you be upfront with her?

99
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,541
She'll respect you more for it.

100
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,041
You like Sophia, so it--

101
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,583
I don't like Sophia.

102
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,291
Yeah, right, and I'm the Queen of England.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,416
We can't meet again.

104
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,291
-We made a mistake once--
-Twice.

105
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,291
Twice.

106
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,083
Don't call those
love-filled moments a mistake.

107
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,541
We've made a mistake twice.

108
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,416
But not anymore.

109
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,000
The way…

110
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,666
you're getting prettier by the day…

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,791
It's not because of overthinking.

112
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,375
Don't try to butter me up.

113
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,208
I don't want to hurt Aviraaj.

114
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,833
And who's gonna make my heart happy?

115
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,500
It's already crazy about you…

116
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,250
Fine.

117
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,125
If you…

118
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,875
really want to crush my heart,
I won't say anything.

119
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,666
If not…

120
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,583
I'll wait for you in my suite.

121
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,583
Are you here for a date or to talk?

122
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,041
Your dress is definitely here for a date.

123
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,291
Aviraaj, I want to talk to you.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,375
Yeah, I know. Normal conversations
between two regular people.

125
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,458
Let's start with school.

126
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,250
So, I used to be a backbencher.

127
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,333
-But I was totally--
-Actually, it's about work. You…

128
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,500
You think we could stop the music?

129
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,708
Your coronation is in three days.

130
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,958
-I'm not joking.
-Okay.

131
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,041
No, really, I'm serious.

132
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,333
That's why Rani-sa asked for me today--

133
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,208
Whoa, absolutely the fuck not.

134
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,708
Look,

135
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,333
I know this makes you
really uncomfortable, Aviraaj,

136
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,958
and I promise you only our launch
was planned on that day.

137
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,208
But Rani-sa insisted

138
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,958
-that it's auspicious--
-Don't listen to my mother.

139
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,916
Please.

140
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,750
Okay? Focus on your launch.

141
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,125
Forget about the coronation.

142
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,791
But, Aviraaj, think about it.
This could be…

143
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
This could be so great for us.

144
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,125
You're already the Maharaja.
So, honestly, it's just a formality.

145
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,083
This is not just a formality.

146
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,125
This formality can change lives.

147
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,625
I need time.

148
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,125
I'm not ready.

149
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,500
Okay.

150
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,458
Okay.

151
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,416
If you're not ready, I'll…

152
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,041
I'll find a solution.

153
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,125
Okay?

154
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:32,875
So…

155
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,458
Where were we? School.

156
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,416
-Sadly, I was a topper at school.
-Wait a second.

157
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,875
Why did you agree so easily?

158
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,458
If you're insisting, it must be important.

159
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,916
And honestly, Aviraaj…

160
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,041
I don't wanna push you.

161
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,458
No, clearly, this coronation ceremony
happening on launch day

162
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,208
is important for you.

163
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,666
Isn't it?

164
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,875
Then wait for some time.

165
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,458
I can't push the launch date, Aviraaj.

166
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,666
It was decided months in advance and…

167
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,250
honestly, I don't want to either.

168
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,875
Why? Why does it have to be in three days?

169
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,375
So, I don't want you
to get weird about this…

170
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,000
Aviraaj, it's my parents'
death anniversary in three days.

171
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,125
It took me years to gather the courage…

172
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,875
to do something new on that day.

173
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,041
It's probably really silly, but…

174
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,958
I want to do it.

175
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:10,875
So…

176
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,125
I can't change the date.

177
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:20,958
Look, I…

178
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,416
I told you don't get weird about it,
because if you do…

179
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,083
-I'll feel weird too--
-In three days, huh?

180
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,041
Yeah.

181
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,291
Okay.

182
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,583
Let's do it.

183
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,333
-No.
-Yeah.

184
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,500
-No.
-The whole thing, let's do it.

185
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,750
The coronation and all.

186
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,375
Aviraaj, you don't want to, and I…

187
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,291
don't want you to do anything
that you don't feel like.

188
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,250
It's fine.

189
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,250
I wanna do it.

190
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,875
You're right. It's just a formality.

191
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,125
Okay.

192
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,750
Sorry, I messed up the date--

193
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,375
-What did you mess up?
-What did I mess up?

194
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,791
-You said "date."
-Date, huh?

195
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,875
We've been paired up
for the next round of Gastronautics.

196
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,500
That's why I'm letting you
practice, Dilip. Okay?

197
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,833
-Wait a second. What are you doing?
-What?

198
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,333
-Is this a wrestling ring?
-Then--

199
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,000
You're wrestling with it. Move!

200
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:56,916
Hey.

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,750
Knead it gently, man. Massage it.

202
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,208
-Okay, I'll do it. I will.
-Do it then.

203
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,500
Like this.

204
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,125
Like this.

205
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,583
Like this…

206
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,750
Are you getting late?

207
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,041
No, I just need to get to Morpur.

208
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,750
Are you from Morpur?

209
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,125
-Yes.
-Where in Morpur?

210
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,166
Moti…

211
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:19,875
bagh.

212
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,041
Motibagh.

213
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,416
Palace?

214
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,583
Yes.

215
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,208
You sneak!

216
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,958
Do you work there?

217
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,625
I'm a dishwasher there, that's all.

218
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,833
Can you take me there some day?

219
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,750
Even my mother is not allowed there.

220
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,000
Then you're not allowed here. Move.

221
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,250
-What happened?
-Move!

222
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,083
-What happened?
-Move.

223
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,708
Fine.

224
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,750
It's difficult,

225
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,833
but I'll try.

226
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,416
I am not promising anything. I'll ask.

227
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,666
Massage it.

228
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,666
-Massage it.
-Yeah.

229
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:11,041
In 1870, the jewelers of Lucknow
made this head ornament.

230
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:15,333
It's not just a piece of jewelry,
it represents Morpur's history.

231
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,958
The diamonds and the lotus flowers
engraved on it

232
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,708
represent the power and glory
of the Maharaja.

233
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:24,875
It was last adorned
by Maharaja Yuvanath Singh himself.

234
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:30,541
The peacock engraved on this ornament
represents the arrival of the new Maharaja

235
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,791
who will always be there
for Morpur and its citizens.

236
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:40,125
Our last Maharaja Yuvanath Singh's
elder son, Aviraaj Singh…

237
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,000
Be careful, Hukum.

238
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,500
Sorry. Sorry.

239
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,333
Mom, can we do the rest tomorrow? Please.

240
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,708
Is everything okay between you two?

241
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,791
Yes.

242
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,750
Excuse me.

243
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,583
-Pankaj-sa.
-Yes.

244
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,291
Hukum, your achkan looks great.

245
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,958
It's not an achkan, it's a problem.

246
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,958
Hukum, after the ceremony tomorrow,

247
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,875
this sword and case
will also be handed over to you.

248
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,041
Besides that,
the Maharaja will bathe 108 times.

249
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,875
If you wish, you may use
this sword on me right now.

250
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,458
-What are you saying, Hukum!
-Hukum.

251
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:49,958
Yes?

252
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
What is it, Rafiq chacha?

253
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,125
He's not eating and he's vomiting.

254
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,208
-Since when?
-This morning, Hukum.

255
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,750
And you're telling me now?

256
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,500
It started out of nowhere, Hukum.

257
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,041
Khan must get the best treatment.

258
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,750
-Sure.
-Am I making myself clear?

259
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,875
-I don't care about the expenses.
-Sure, Hukum.

260
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,583
You'll be fine, Khan.

261
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:23,666
A HISTORICAL MOMENT FOR MORPUR,
MAHARAJA AVIRAAJ SINGH TO BE CROWNED SOON!

262
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,166
TO GRACE THE THRONE,
COMES MAHARAJA AVIRAAJ

263
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,250
Today, Rajasthan's Morpur city

264
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,833
will reverberate with loud cheers
for the Maharaja

265
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,625
Late Maharaja Yuvanath Singh's elder son,
Prince Aviraaj Singh,

266
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,583
will receive the honor
of wearing the crown of Morpur.

267
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,708
Darling,

268
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,083
are you okay?

269
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,291
I'm okay.

270
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,666
All the best, darling.

271
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,583
It's a very important day of your life.

272
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,916
All the best, darling.

273
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,125
Yeah.

274
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:17,333
Fizzy, the position of a Maharaja
comes with loneliness.

275
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,541
Does it mean
you must push your family away?

276
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,000
It's an age-old tradition of Morpur

277
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,958
that all the royal families of the region
and the citizens of Morpur

278
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,375
gather here to witness
the coronation of the Maharaja.

279
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,500
This time, The Royal B&B
has added to the grandeur of this ceremony

280
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,583
by inviting social media influencers
and the guests.

281
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,583
-All hail the Maharaja!
-All hail the Maharaja!

282
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,583
-All hail the Maharaja!
-All hail the Maharaja!

283
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:27,791
The Royal B&B is a dream
my co-Founder Kunal Mehta and I

284
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,333
dreamt of together.

285
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:33,666
Today, all of you,
the hospitality influencers

286
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,208
will witness a spectacle here.

287
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,041
A once-in-a-lifetime event.

288
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,541
The coronation of Morpur's Maharaja.

289
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,500
-Wow!
-Great.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,583
And along with that,

291
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,333
you'll witness our dream come true.

292
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,958
From today, The Royal B&B is yours.

293
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,875
And now, we're open for bookings.

294
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:06,583
I do want to bore you
with the business details,

295
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,833
but Kunal is worried
that you will all disappear in no time.

296
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,500
Until then, enjoy Morpur's fresh air.

297
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,041
Enjoy this special experience.

298
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,166
And, please, Gram the hell out of us.

299
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,125
Yeah!

300
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,875
Lot of stories, lot of boomerangs please.

301
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,166
Please enjoy this royal experience.
And please tag The Royal B&B.

302
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,833
I'll check.

303
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,208
Oh, my God!

304
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,666
Sophia has outdone herself.

305
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,625
It's so beautiful.

306
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,708
Diggy, let's go find Fizzy.

307
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,041
Enjoy your life, Paddy.

308
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:04,083
But make sure
to always keep up the appearances.

309
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,833
Greetings, Dhondi Maharaja.

310
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,500
Greetings. How are you?

311
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,750
I'm fine. Glad to meet you.

312
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,833
What's the matter, Dhondi Sahab?

313
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,958
Your eye seems to be
twitching a lot today.

314
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,833
No. It's…

315
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,666
Greetings, Rani-sa.

316
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,916
…just…

317
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,291
expressing its desires.

318
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,666
You seem to have forgotten…

319
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,791
that you don't wink at a Maharani,

320
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,083
but lower your gaze.

321
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,500
Please forgive my folly.

322
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:53,833
But my Paddy was singing a different tune
when we were making those two mistakes.

323
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,291
Stay in your limits.

324
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,083
Limits?

325
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,708
Now you're gonna teach me my limits?

326
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,625
You seem to be forgetting, Rani-sa,

327
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,208
I'll own this palace soon.

328
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,958
Have you lost your mind?

329
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,833
This is Morpur's Maharaja's palace.

330
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,666
Who is my daughter's fiancé.

331
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,208
That's where you're mistaken.

332
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:32,875
Why?

333
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,958
I see.

334
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,250
So, they found out about us.

335
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,791
Or should I tell them?

336
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,875
-Are you trying to threaten me?
-How can I dare to?

337
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,250
I'm just making a deal.

338
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,958
Rani-sa,

339
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,416
I'm so sorry to interrupt
but do you know where Aviraaj is?

340
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,375
I've given the medicine to Khan, Hukum.

341
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,666
It may take…

342
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,708
an hour to take effect, Hukum.

343
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,166
But…

344
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:32,708
But?

345
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,166
But if there's no improvement,

346
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,041
-we may have to let Khan go--
-You may leave.

347
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,958
-But, Hukum…
-Didn't you hear me?

348
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,833
Hukum.

349
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,000
Rafiq chacha,

350
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,583
-no one is allowed to touch Khan.
-Yes, Hukum.

351
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:10,125
Aviraaj, I know a really good vet.
We'll call him.

352
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,916
Everything will be fine. Okay?

353
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,416
I told you…

354
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:15,916
everything changes.

355
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,958
Coronation is not just a formality.

356
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,125
I said it.

357
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,708
You didn't pay heed to it.

358
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,416
That's not fair, Aviraaj.

359
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,666
I only requested you.
This was completely your decision.

360
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,333
-This is not okay--
-He died.

361
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,250
Aviraaj…

362
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,750
Khan is alive.

363
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:35,916
Listen to me.

364
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,583
-I'm listening.
-You're not.

365
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,708
-I am listening to you, Aviraaj.
-Listen…

366
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:42,333
-Will you listen to me for a second?
-Okay.

367
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,791
Okay, calm down. I'm listening to you.

368
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,375
He died.

369
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,500
And I couldn't do anything.

370
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,375
He left without meeting me.

371
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,791
Aviraaj.

372
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,625
Aviraaj…

373
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,583
He's… He's with you, Aviraaj.

374
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,041
He's in you. You are him.

375
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,291
How's he in me?

376
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,750
He's dead!

377
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,208
When he was alive, I left!

378
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:24,791
What's the point now?

379
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:29,291
You get it now, Aviraaj.

380
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,208
Finally, you've understood everything.

381
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:37,833
You're here, you didn't run away, did you?

382
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,250
You didn't, did you?

383
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,125
You did not do what's easy.
I didn't do what's easy!

384
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,875
I have the biggest launch of my career
planned today, Aviraaj!

385
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:50,250
It's tough for me to do this on this day.

386
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,500
And I'm only doing it for them.

387
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,958
I'm doing it for my Mom and Dad.
Just like you are!

388
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:57,666
You're doing this for yourself,

389
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,083
not for them!

390
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,041
You…

391
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:11,541
really think
that I'm doing this for myself?

392
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,208
You know what's funny?

393
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,625
I was doing this for you.

394
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:35,416
Fizzy?

395
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,791
Did you run away again? Fizzy!

396
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:45,375
Hello?

397
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:19,041
Cement this traitor into the wall!

398
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:23,041
Stop! Even the traitors in Morpur
are treated with kindness under my rule.

399
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,333
Kindness?

400
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,000
All hail Maharaja Digvijay!

401
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,583
All hail King Digvijay!

402
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,583
All hail Emperor Digvijay!

403
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:32,708
Fizzy!

404
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,583
Fizzy!

405
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,625
What's wrong, Fizzy?

406
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,833
Oh, God.

407
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:53,791
What happened, Fizzy?

408
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,833
Huh? Did you eat something wrong?

409
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,041
What happened?

410
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:14,583
Okay, okay. Relax.

411
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,208
Relax.

412
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,458
I can't do it.

413
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:22,833
What?

414
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:25,000
-I can't do it.
-What?

415
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,583
Dad died, Diggy.

416
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,791
-This crown killed him!
-Fizzy.

417
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,791
The crown is worn
just on the outside, Fizzy.

418
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,958
Something was eating up Dad on the inside.

419
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:51,958
You own it.

420
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,875
-No, I can't. You stop this!
-Get up!

421
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:56,041
I can't do it.

422
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,458
-Get up.
-I can't do it, Diggy!

423
00:28:58,541 --> 00:28:59,875
I can't--

424
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,666
What the fuck, dude?

425
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,958
That felt really good.

426
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,333
Okay, now that you're awake…

427
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,291
Come on.

428
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:11,875
Come on.

429
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,708
I can't do it. I can't.

430
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:19,458
-I can't do it.
-You can.

431
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:22,416
And you will, because you have to.

432
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:35,625
Fizzy, you were born for this.

433
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,750
You're the eldest son of this family.

434
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,916
Everyone loves you.

435
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,250
I've seen it.

436
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:52,583
There are thousands gathered outside
from every corner of Morpur,

437
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,750
and they are here only for you.

438
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,041
For the Maharaja.

439
00:29:58,708 --> 00:29:59,791
That's you.

440
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,583
So, believe me when I say, you got this.

441
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,541
Come on now.

442
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:10,666
Okay?

443
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,750
-And I'm here for you.
-Okay.

444
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:16,958
Don't stress.

445
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,791
And I know without a shadow of a doubt,

446
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,416
Dad would've been so proud of you today.

447
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:25,333
Okay?

448
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:28,375
Okay.

449
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,000
Go, wash your face. You look silly.

450
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,291
Hello?

451
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,458
How would I know the name on his ID?

452
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,583
-Please…
-How long have you worked here?

453
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,041
There he is.
Dilip, tell them that you know me!

454
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,166
Hukum.

455
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,333
Hukum?

456
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,833
-Hukum, do you know her?
-Yes.

457
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,500
Molshri, you didn't give me a heads-up.

458
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:56,375
Look, Dilip, or whatever your name is,

459
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:59,583
don't ever call me,
or I'll tell the Gastronautics officials.

460
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,166
-that you're a fraud.
-Hold on.

461
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,583
-You're mistaken.
-And I don't want to get disqualified!

462
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,625
Maharaj. Maharaja!

463
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,041
I'll drop you back home.
Please come inside.

464
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,125
I'll manage!

465
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,250
-Hukum.
-I'm not the Maharaja!

466
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,625
-Hukum.
-What?

467
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,750
This achkan belongs to Maharaja Aviraaj.

468
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:19,375
I know!

469
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,125
-Sophia.
-Hi.

470
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,583
-Nandini, hi.
-Congratulations.

471
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,916
Thank you so much. I hope
Keertana is taking care of you.

472
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,875
-Of course. Don't worry about it.
-I'm glad.

473
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:31,875
-Okay, listen.
-Yes?

474
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,708
Can I get an exclusive interview
with you after the ceremony?

475
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:36,333
Sorry, Nandini, not today.

476
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,833
Kunal and I are really busy,
but I promise you, tomorrow.

477
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,791
Greetings, sir.

478
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:45,250
What happened? Did I say something wrong?

479
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:48,750
No, you didn't, but you lied.

480
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:50,791
What?

481
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:54,750
I mean, how can Kunal
give an interview with you

482
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,458
when he's quitting your company?

483
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,791
Okay, I'm getting a call.
I'll talk to you later. Okay?

484
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,875
So, you're alive.

485
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,000
Then why aren't you answering my calls?

486
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,625
Sorry to disappoint.

487
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,833
Ayesha, we should…

488
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,083
We should talk.

489
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:50,625
We will.

490
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:54,541
But after the coronation ceremony.
Everyone's waiting for you.

491
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:56,333
Come with me.

492
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:59,416
Hang on.

493
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,208
Ayesha…

494
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,291
Sophia and I…

495
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,291
hooked up.

496
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:15,958
It's fine.

497
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:17,625
Come on.

498
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,458
One second.

499
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,833
Doesn't it bother you?

500
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:28,583
You guys hooked up.

501
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,083
Big deal.

502
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:33,291
Affairs don't have a future.

503
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
But we do.

504
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,916
Therefore, we need to move on.

505
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:39,791
Let's go.

506
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:42,583
Why did you attend the ball that night?

507
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:46,708
Are you all right?

508
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,958
Are you scared of adulting?
Do you need help?

509
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:55,791
Don't worry about me.
Just answer my question please.

510
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,375
Why did you come that night?

511
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,208
Because if I have to be a queen,

512
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,333
I'd better find a king
who will live happily in New York.

513
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:10,041
So I can run Dhondi Hospitality
the way I want.

514
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,833
You don't have any attachment
to Motibagh anyway.

515
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,208
Then what's the problem?

516
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,416
Your ideology.

517
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,958
We don't have a future, Ayesha.

518
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,000
And you do with Sophia?

519
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:30,208
She knows that you always run from Morpur,

520
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,541
from the people…

521
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,541
From yourself.

522
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:39,000
-Or is she as screwed up as you?
-You don't know Sophia.

523
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,791
And don't even try to figure her out.
She is nothing like you.

524
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,291
She can't be like me even if she tries to.

525
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,208
She's just a commoner…

526
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,125
Maharaja.

527
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,500
Please leave, Ayesha.

528
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,583
Pankaj-sa!

529
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:55,791
Hukum.

530
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,958
Please escort her to her car.

531
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,416
Thank you, Pankaj-sa.

532
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,666
I will manage.

533
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,375
Greetings, Maharaja.

534
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,125
I see.

535
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,833
So these are Morpur's etiquettes.

536
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,666
Maharaja has a message for you.

537
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:41,625
Princess Ayesha
is ready to leave with you.

538
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:47,833
So the son has decided
to act up like his mother.

539
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:49,250
Dhondi Sahab,

540
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,583
you are talking
about the Maharaja of Morpur.

541
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:57,041
Watch your words.

542
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:00,041
Say another wrong word,

543
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:03,500
and you'll be kicked out
in a very wrong way.

544
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,291
You better think again, Rani-sa.

545
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,541
Messing with me will cost you dearly.

546
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,375
Then I'll manage with something cheap.

547
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,750
I don't have money anyway.

548
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,041
Shall we?

549
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:44,541
Kunal,

550
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,583
are you joining Sameera?

551
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,333
-Just give us a minute.
-Oh, my God, Kunal.

552
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:54,125
When were you going to tell me?

553
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,750
I was going to. Trust me.

554
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,333
When, Kunal? I heard it from Nandini.

555
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,875
This is not the place or the time.

556
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,166
-I'll talk to you--
-Then when?

557
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,583
After the launch? Or were you waiting
for a press conference?

558
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:06,583
What is she offering you?

559
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,958
Sellout bonus? She's doubling your stocks?

560
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,541
Or a private jet? What is it?

561
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:11,583
She values me.

562
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,333
And I don't value you, right?

563
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,583
Fuck you, Kunal.

564
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,500
Fuck you!

565
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,000
Zubin's asking me to stay back too.

566
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,125
Zubin what?

567
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,125
You should know that I turned him down.

568
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,000
But Zubin also wants me to be the CEO.

569
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,916
The heir to Morpur throne,

570
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,625
late Maharaja Yuvanath Singh's son,

571
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,416
Prince Aviraaj Singh is here

572
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,333
at his grand coronation ceremony
to ascend the throne

573
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:05,000
with his people as his witness.

574
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:10,333
Welcome, O our King

575
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:15,666
You rule this land

576
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:20,291
Amidst the drums and trumpets

577
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:27,375
We welcome you
All hail our King

578
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,625
Welcome, O our King

579
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:37,666
You rule this land

580
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:42,250
Amidst the drums and trumpets

581
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:47,250
All hail our King

582
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,875
-All hail the Maharaja!
-All hail the Maharaja!

583
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:10,458
All hail Maharaja Aviraaj!

584
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,833
-All hail the Maharaja!
-All hail the Maharaja!

585
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:14,250
All hail Maharaja Aviraaj!

586
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,666
-All hail the Maharaja!
-All hail the Maharaja!

587
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,625
All hail Maharaja Aviraaj!

588
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,541
All hail our King

589
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:42,125
All hail our King

590
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,916
All hail our King

591
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,625
All hail our King

592
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:52,958
The pride and prestige of our King
Our King is our pride

593
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:57,833
Our King is loved by all
Our King is our pride

594
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:03,500
The pride and prestige of our King
Our King is our pride

595
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:08,958
Our King is loved by all
Our King is our pride

596
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:13,833
The pride and prestige of our King
Our King is our pride

597
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:19,333
Our King is loved by all
Our King is our pride

598
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:25,166
The pride and prestige of our King
Our King is our pride

599
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,958
Our King is loved by all
Our King is our pride

600
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:44,666
Hi, Sophia. How's the launch going?

601
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,750
Zubin, did you offer
the CEO's position to Kunal?

602
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,583
It was the board's decision, Sophia.
I can't do anything on my own.

603
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,250
Bullshit, Zubin.

604
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,833
You've always been trying to kick me out.

605
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,583
Why would I kick you out
of your own company?

606
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:04,750
Unless you're unable to run the company.

607
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,958
How is that, Zubin?

608
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,333
Everything is fine. See it for yourself!

609
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:10,916
What is the fucking problem?

610
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,291
What exactly is your definition
of "fine," Sophia?

611
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:18,416
Your deliverables, timelines
keep changing.

612
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,416
You don't get along with your clients.

613
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,125
Your team is unhappy with you.

614
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,375
I already told you, Sophia…

615
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,708
Not every founder can be a good CEO.

616
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:28,875
But the CEO of your choice is leaving.

617
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,291
What are you gonna do now?

618
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,166
I'll find someone else.

619
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,541
Zubin, we had a deal.

620
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:38,541
I told you that if I failed, I'd quit.
Then why are you doing this?

621
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:42,416
Why wait till you fail
when we can save our investment?

622
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,125
Zubin, this is my company,
and I'm going to fight tooth and nail

623
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,291
to make sure the votes swing towards me.

624
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,875
-You wait and--
-The board wants you to resign.

625
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:53,000
We have a majority.

626
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,125
Six to three.

627
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,125
-All hail…
-The Maharaja!

628
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,541
-All hail…
-The Maharaja!

629
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:48,208
-All hail…
-The Maharaja!

630
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,291
-All hail…
-The Maharaja!

631
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,458
-All hail…
-The Maharaja!

632
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:45,541
Hukum.

633
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,583
Hukum. Greetings, Hukum.

634
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,958
We couldn't find Ms. Shekhar anywhere.

635
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:53,791
But Khan is much better now.
You can visit him.

636
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,041
Fizzy,

637
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,416
Morpur is yours from today.

638
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,666
And I wanted you to get this letter
after you become the Maharaja,

639
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:13,791
because I've taught you
how a Maharaja must conduct himself.

640
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:20,291
I told you that being a Maharaja
comes with loneliness.

641
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,958
But today, I must tell you

642
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:25,666
that because of that,
you must choose your own path.

643
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:28,375
You must find your love.

644
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,083
Without love, we are weak.

645
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:32,333
Even a King.

646
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:36,375
I listened to people
and forgot to listen to my heart.

647
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,125
I lived a fake life.

648
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,000
But one day, out of the blue,

649
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:45,541
life lead me to my strength, my love.

650
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,375
I was wrong, Fizzy.

651
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,125
A Maharaja can also have desires,

652
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,000
and the name of your father's love is…

653
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:54,583
Maurice.

654
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,250
