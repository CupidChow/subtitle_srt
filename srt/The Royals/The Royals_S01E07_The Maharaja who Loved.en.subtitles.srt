00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:32,000
The person you are calling
is not answering. Please--

2
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:32,916
Darling.

3
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,541
Sophia.

4
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,041
Darling.

5
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:43,708
Fizzy,

6
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,458
you must choose your own path.

7
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,583
You must find your love.

8
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,833
Because love is the biggest force
in this world.

9
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,958
-Hukum, left.
-Smile please. Thank you.

10
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,250
Aviraaj.

11
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,041
Maharaja ji, left please.

12
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,666
The person you're calling
is not answering.

13
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,000
You kicked me out of the ball,

14
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:36,416
but I would love to have you
at my new film's premiere in Mumbai.

15
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,458
Hukum.

16
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,791
You look happy.

17
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,000
But why do you look sullen?

18
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,333
Mom,

19
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,125
are you really happy?

20
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,208
I mean…

21
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,125
you've been lonely for a long time.

22
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:01,958
Dad's no more.

23
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,583
But…

24
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,291
you have a life to live, you know.

25
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,416
And…

26
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,166
it's just a phase.

27
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,041
This period, it'll pass.

28
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,833
Were you listening to ghazals?

29
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,750
-No.
-Did Dhondi sahab say something to you?

30
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,458
-Dhondi?
-Yes.

31
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,458
No. Why? Did Ayesha say something to you?

32
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,166
No, not at all.
Why would she say anything to me?

33
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,041
Mom, Dad was in love with Maurice.

34
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,916
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,875
I'm so sorry.

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,125
I found one of his letters.

37
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,666
He wrote it in this.

38
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,958
I'm sorry, Mom.
I know this is not easy for you.

39
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,208
I've read it many times.

40
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,875
I still don't understand…

41
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,625
how…

42
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,500
For so many years, how could he…

43
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,416
He should have told you.

44
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,416
You okay, Mom?

45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,416
Mom?

46
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,125
Leave me alone for some time.

47
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:58,375
Padmaja, if you have any objections,
you can tell me.

48
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,333
I won't be offended.

49
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,583
-Do you have any objections?
-No, not at all.

50
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,583
We'll be husband and wife for namesake.

51
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,166
Yes.

52
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,000
And we are doing this
just to save name anyway.

53
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,666
There won't be any restrictions on you.

54
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,041
You may do anything you like.

55
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,708
I desperately need a friend right now.

56
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,583
There won't be love in this marriage,

57
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,916
but there can be friendship.

58
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,375
Absolutely.

59
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,291
We'll be each other's confidante.

60
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:40,916
Sounds good?

61
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,791
It's a small problem, Your Highness.

62
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,791
Until a future CEO joins,

63
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,125
Keertana and our new team
will handle the work of The Royal B&B.

64
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,666
We won't give you a chance to complain.

65
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,166
It's fine, but I still don't understand
why Ms. Shekhar quit.

66
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,375
This news will be out soon.

67
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,958
Actually, Sophia didn't quit,

68
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:08,916
she was fired by the board.

69
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,791
But I assure you,

70
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,500
our new team understands
the vision of The Royal B&B,

71
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,833
-and we--
-Excuse me.

72
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,375
-Keertana.
-Yes, sir?

73
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,750
What is The Royal B&B's vision?

74
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,166
I mean…

75
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,291
You?

76
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,750
Vision, Your Highness…

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,791
The Royal B&B's premium customers--

78
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,125
No. You?

79
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,041
-Royalty's glamorous lifestyle--
-No.

80
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,666
Sir, people are envious.

81
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,416
-Whatever they--
-They're gonna run the company?

82
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,833
We'll run it, Your Highness,
the company board.

83
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,666
Okay. Over to you then.
The question remains the same.

84
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,500
With all due respect,

85
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,291
I don't think I need to explain
The Royal B&B's vision to you.

86
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:11,208
Don't you think you need to understand
The Royal B&B's vision?

87
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,958
Because it's not your vision,
it's Sophia's.

88
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,500
And she didn't care about
the premium customers, or the glamour,

89
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,958
or making people envious.

90
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,125
She was trying to bring
the royals and the commoners closer.

91
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,583
That was her intention.

92
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,791
Her vision. Her dream.

93
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,208
She wasn't trying to deck up Motibagh,

94
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,208
she was trying to understand it.

95
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,791
And that's why we were working with her.

96
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,500
Actually, as far as I remember,
you weren't happy with Sophia's ways.

97
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:41,958
Anyway…

98
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,125
your contract is with my company,

99
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,125
not with the CEO.

100
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,416
We'll take your input, but of course,

101
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,333
the final decision will be ours.

102
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,416
If that's how it's gonna be,
here's my final decision.

103
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,666
I'd like to terminate the contract
with immediate effect.

104
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,041
I would suggest
you consult with your lawyers first.

105
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,083
You'll be hearing from us.

106
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,291
Hey.

107
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,291
Jinnie,

108
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,208
Khan is feeling better now.

109
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,333
What's with the attitude?

110
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,958
Jinnie, what else could I have done?
I was out of options.

111
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,208
-Fizzy--
-Fizzy!

112
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,208
Fizzy!

113
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,916
-Fizzy!
-What are you screaming for?

114
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,708
-You terminated the contract.
-What the fuck are you doing?

115
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,333
You terminated the contract!

116
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,500
Have you lost it? Yes, I did! So what?

117
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,458
You're so fucking selfish!

118
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,875
Guys, what the fuck?

119
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,416
-What the fuck is wrong with you--
-Fizzy!

120
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,375
-What are you doing?
-How could you that? You're an idiot!

121
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,583
What are you guys doing?

122
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,875
Fizzy!

123
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,333
Get off me!

124
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,250
Guys!

125
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,166
How could you?

126
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,458
You're gonna kill him--

127
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,875
You canceled the contract!

128
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
I am your brother!

129
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,833
Shit!

130
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,416
Come on! Take that!

131
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Stop!

132
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,958
-Stop it, Diggy!
-It's fucking horseshit, man!

133
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,083
-Where are you going?
-Get up!

134
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,708
-Enough!
-Let go of me!

135
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,583
Let go of me, Jinnie!

136
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,625
Come here, you idiot!

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,833
You fool!

138
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,750
Just stop! Just--

139
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,125
-Jinnie!
-Fuck! Are you okay?

140
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,291
-Jinnie--
-Don't touch me, fuckers!

141
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,916
-I'll get some ice for you.
-Shut the fuck up.

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,416
-You're fine.
-Shut the fuck up!

143
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,791
I said, shut the fuck up!
So, shut the fuck up!

144
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,333
Why don't you guys ever listen?

145
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,958
I've been reduced to an invisible third
wheel here, just because of you fuckers!

146
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,458
But now just do the fuck up!

147
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,666
And when I'm talking, sit the fuck down.

148
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,625
Are you legs hurting? Stand up!

149
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,208
What is this?

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,875
It's nothing, Jinnie.

151
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,750
-Don't read it!
-Move!

152
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,041
Jinnie, no! Jinnie!

153
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,750
Jinnie, don't read that. Jinnie!

154
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,375
A Maharaja can also have desires,

155
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,291
and the name of your father's love is…

156
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,416
Maurice.

157
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,083
Fizzy.

158
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,541
Was Dad gay?

159
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,000
Yup.

160
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,875
Dad was gay.

161
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,208
I don't understand…

162
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,333
-What if Mom finds out?
-I told her.

163
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,500
I mean, come on,

164
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,333
she would've found out eventually.

165
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,916
How could she not know for 25 years?

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,958
Mom is an expert at running from problems,
so, just watch.

167
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,708
How can she run away from this?

168
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,625
And where will she run to?

169
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,666
You're going to Mumbai?

170
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,791
I'm going to Mumbai, Rambha, not Mars.

171
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,500
But there's so much going on here.

172
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,958
And your children?

173
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,500
Tell my children, Lilypad won't be
available for a few days.

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,875
Hukum!

175
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,750
Come back!

176
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,791
Let's find Maurice.

177
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,750
-No.
-He has our money.

178
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,666
He has Dad's money that Dad left to him.

179
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,916
She's right.

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,333
If that's what Dad wanted…

181
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,875
I just… I wish Dad told me.

182
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,041
Then I could have told him that…

183
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,291
that I'm like him.

184
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,541
Niki and I aren't just friends.

185
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,541
Jinnie.

186
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,875
Jinnie!

187
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,166
-Jinnie, I love you.
-Yes, Diggy.

188
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,500
-I love you.
-Huh?

189
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,041
I love you.

190
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,625
I… Why didn't you tell us sooner?

191
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,291
He means,

192
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,000
thank you for trusting us.

193
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,291
Yes.

194
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,625
It's not easy to talk about these things.

195
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,833
-Right, Diggy?
-Yes, correct.

196
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,458
Thank you for telling us.

197
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,291
Okay, Diggy.

198
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,708
Fizzy.

199
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,250
Jinnie.

200
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,333
It's not easy,
but I also want to tell you something.

201
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,041
-Diggy, I always knew.
-I…

202
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,750
-I fucking knew it!
-I always knew it.

203
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,916
-I know it from the beginning.
-You didn't…

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,958
Knew it.

205
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,875
That makes so much sense!

206
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,791
-Yeah.
-I'm not gay. I'm not.

207
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,458
No? You always said,
"Motibagh is my bride."

208
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,833
He always ditched pretty girls
and went on boys' hunting trips.

209
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,083
-Guys, that--
-Boys' hunting trip…

210
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,166
Wait a minute. Let me speak.

211
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,500
-Boys' hunting trip!
-Boys' hunting trip!

212
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,291
I'm adventurous, not gay.

213
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,041
Please.

214
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,208
I like cooking.

215
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,416
I like cycling.

216
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,125
You make club sandwiches twice a year.

217
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,583
-That doesn't mean you're a chef.
-What an anti-climax.

218
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,291
-What was that?
-That duck curry…

219
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,791
-Yeah?
-…that you all loved?

220
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:04,958
I made it.

221
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,041
That achari gosht, me.

222
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,500
Anjeer rabdi, me.

223
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,583
Gulabi halwa. Hara Jamun.

224
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,708
All me!

225
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,500
-That was delicious.
-Thank you.

226
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,583
-Dude, you made that?
-Yes!

227
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,041
-That is insane.
-That's amazing, Diggy.

228
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,333
And now I'm a semi-finalist
in Gastronautics.

229
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,208
Wow!

230
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,000
Wow! That's amazing!

231
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,708
Yeah, that's awesome.

232
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,500
What is Gastronautics, guys?

233
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,958
When astronauts in space high-five…

234
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,750
It's not a space thing, it's "gas."

235
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,333
-It's not a gas thing.
-It's a gastr--

236
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,541
It's like a gastric…

237
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,291
-It can't be--
-No, correct, correct.

238
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,208
-It's a gas…
-Absolutely.

239
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,583
-It's like a gas--
-Shut up!

240
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,625
Shut up!

241
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,416
It's UK's biggest cooking competition.

242
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,166
People from Canada to New Zealand
watch this show.

243
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,541
And now I'm in it.

244
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,625
-You're in it?
-I'm in it.

245
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,125
Congratulations!

246
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,500
-Oh my God, Diggy, you're a star!
-Yeah.

247
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,666
What a day.

248
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,625
So,

249
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,916
you've canceled the deal.

250
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,416
Only a miracle can save us now.

251
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,833
A miraculous girl.

252
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,500
What?

253
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,375
We need Sophia's help.

254
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,416
But she's not answering my calls, so…

255
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,083
I'll have to go to Mumbai to meet her.

256
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,458
Gastronautics' semi-finals
are also in Mumbai.

257
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, and so is Niki.

258
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,958
-So is Niki!
-Yeah.

259
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,583
Mumbai.

260
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,375
Mumbai.

261
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,666
-Are we doing this?
-Yeah. We're doing it.

262
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,500
-Yeah.
-Pankaj-sa!

263
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,541
Can't we even afford
business class tickets?

264
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,250
She called me a fraud. Imagine!

265
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,666
And threatened to tell everyone
at Gastronautics that I'm a fraud.

266
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,083
How do I talk to her?

267
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,000
I've told you, like, a million times
in three hours

268
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,750
to just call her and say sorry.

269
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,041
Did Niki take your call?

270
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,333
No. She lost her job,
I'm really worried about her.

271
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,666
This is us.

272
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,083
Sorry.

273
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,541
Hold my bag. Idiot.

274
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,250
We just had a fight.

275
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,791
Let's keep a gap.

276
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,250
-Meditate.
-Center yourself.

277
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,875
Center yourself.

278
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,250
I'm glad you're amused.

279
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,875
So, what's the plan?

280
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,250
I mean…

281
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,416
Step one, find Sophia.

282
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,875
Step two…

283
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,791
give her updates about The Royal B&B.

284
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,416
Step three, convince her to fight Zubin.

285
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,250
Step four, stop fighting your feelings.

286
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,500
It's pointless, Fizzy.

287
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,041
Remember Dad's experience.

288
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,541
He said, "Listen to your heart."

289
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,208
And take out the EarPods.

290
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,541
See, you're obviously into her.

291
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,291
Yeah, or would you sit
in the middle seat of economy class?

292
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,375
-No chance.
-Never.

293
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,291
-Ever.
-Never.

294
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,208
-Never.
-Ever.

295
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:27,916
He agreed!

296
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,791
What's the point of me agreeing to it?

297
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,875
She's not even answering my calls.

298
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,000
You said this to Diggy countless times,
then why don't you get it?

299
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,666
-Hypocrite!
-Just go and say sorry to her.

300
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,333
And, "I love you--"

301
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,916
Woah, okay! Stop being so dramatic.

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,458
I like her. I don't love her.

303
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,500
Yeah, say, "I love you."

304
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,833
Yes, Pankaj-sa.

305
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,166
-Greetings, Hukum.
-We've already boarded, make it quick.

306
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,041
-Zubin sent us a legal notice.
-When?

307
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,250
This morning.

308
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,000
Then call the lawyers.

309
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,791
-Yeah. Keep me updated, please.
-Yes, Hukum.

310
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,000
-Hurry, the flight will take off soon.
-Yes, Hukum.

311
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,916
-Okay, bye.
-What happened?

312
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,666
Zubin has sent a notice.

313
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,583
He wants access to Motibagh.

314
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,083
Access?

315
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,666
Six months. Not a day more.

316
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,625
Deal.

317
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,291
By testing the royal experience,
we'll end up an event management company.

318
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,958
I'm not interested in anyone else.

319
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,125
I've never met anyone like you.

320
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,333
I told you the coronation
is not just a formality.

321
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,250
Sophia, the board wants you to resign.
We have a majority.

322
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,000
We're still dealing with your
"nothing happened"! Don't you see it?

323
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,291
Where's your fucking objectivity?

324
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,958
Darling, we'll run out of water.

325
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,875
Saw the headlines
in the business section today?

326
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,458
"No love lost in this B&B."

327
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,041
Look, the Maharaja
also terminated his contract with Zubin.

328
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,666
Kunal, I know this is unexpected,
and I'm sorry for that,

329
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,750
but I must talk to her.
Otherwise, I wouldn't bother you.

330
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,166
-I have no idea.
-You've no idea?

331
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,875
You must know something, Kunal.

332
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:15,250
I'm sorry I surprised you,
but if it wasn't urgent--

333
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,958
Aviraaj, I don't know
what you want me to say,

334
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,666
but if I said I don't know,
it means I don't know. Okay?

335
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,708
-You have no idea where she is?
-Yeah.

336
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,625
Out of thin air?

337
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,625
You were a team until yesterday.
Today, you don't even know her address?

338
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,958
A lot has changed since then, Aviraaj.

339
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,208
Maybe you can't see it.

340
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,416
No, I do see it.

341
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,625
Clearly, you sold your partner off
for this new fancy office.

342
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,958
-I sold her off?
-That's what it looks like, dude.

343
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,750
What about you?

344
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,375
If you could, you would've sold Motibagh

345
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,500
to enjoy decaf latte with
a supermodel in New York. Right?

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,416
-Right?
-Okay, Kunal, sure. Yeah.

347
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,916
I can see it on your face
that she was fired because of you.

348
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,916
She was fired because of you, Aviraaj.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,958
Oh, yeah? Enlighten me.

350
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,708
She never made such mistakes
in the last ten years.

351
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,708
But her judgement got clouded
after she met you.

352
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,666
Right. And you're the messiah
of good judgments, you asshole!

353
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,541
And you're the Maharaja of wisdom,
you fucking brat!

354
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,083
Look, Kunal,

355
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,750
Zubin is preparing
for a hostile takeover of Motibagh.

356
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,791
Only Sophia can save us,
and you know that.

357
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,000
If you know anything, please.

358
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,500
Aviraaj, if I knew where she is,
I would've told you.

359
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:37,958
Trust me.

360
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,708
-Thanks for nothing.
-Take my advice.

361
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,791
If you find her, use your logic.

362
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,708
Keep your romantic feelings aside.

363
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,666
Romantic feelings, really?

364
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,041
What's wrong with everyone?

365
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,416
I'm not in love with Sophia,
but thank you.

366
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,375
Yeah, sure.

367
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,208
And I'm the King of England.

368
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,416
Where's my fucking crown?

369
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,583
Does Niki live here?

370
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,666
Oh, my God!

371
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,166
You're the princess, right?

372
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,958
Your Majesty.

373
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,625
Jinnie?

374
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,583
Bro!

375
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,125
What happened to your arm?

376
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,791
You just left.

377
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,666
Tea?

378
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,916
Of all the champagne brunches
in the world,

379
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,250
she had to walk into mine.

380
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,416
Congratulations.

381
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,500
You thought of me, and here I am.

382
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,458
I thought of you everyday,

383
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,458
but you were busy.

384
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,208
But now I'm free.

385
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,041
Drink?

386
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,291
Please let me go in. I'm here now.

387
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,500
You're late, buddy.

388
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,208
I know, I have a watch.
But ten minutes is not late.

389
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,541
Late is late, buddy.

390
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,875
There's always some wiggle room.
Please let me go in.

391
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,083
My flight got delayed.

392
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,125
-The contest has already started.
-Yeah, but--

393
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,291
How can it start without me?
I'm from team Rajasthan.

394
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,416
Welcome to the Indian edition
of Gastronautics,

395
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,875
where India's best home chefs
will cook the best dishes of the country.

396
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,416
-I almost died. Look at this.
-Be quiet.

397
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,708
-Look!
-Quiet, I said!

398
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,875
-All five teams will make two dishes…
-This Rajasthan kid is here.

399
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,625
I'm sending him in. Just go!

400
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,666
…in which a common ingredient
will play two roles.

401
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,625
Supporting character in one dish,

402
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,458
and main lead in the other.

403
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:08,333
A very well-stocked pantry
is waiting for you.

404
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:13,000
Make sure that your selection
of ingredients is accurate.

405
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,958
-And of course, precision is the key.
-Did your family beat you up?

406
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,208
You could say that.

407
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,958
Your time starts in three…

408
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,166
-Two…
-One.

409
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,500
-Go!
-Go!

410
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,791
Don't come in my way!

411
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,125
-This cauliflower is mine.
-Is your name on it?

412
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,166
-Give it to me.
-No.

413
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,958
It's yours, right? Take it, take it.

414
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,041
I'm so sorry, Hukum.

415
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,541
-What are you doing?
-This is my side.

416
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,083
We're on the same side.

417
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,583
This maybe a pastime for you,
but for me, it's serious.

418
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,375
-It's serious for me too.
-As if.

419
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,541
Well, well, well.

420
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,333
Team Rajasthan, what are you making today?

421
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,166
-Laal maas…
-Baati stir-fry.

422
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,458
Okay. So, what's the common ingredient?

423
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,041
-Wheat flour.
-Flour.

424
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,166
-Flour?
-Interesting.

425
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:11,958
Something strange.

426
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,708
-Thank you.
-All the best.

427
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,041
-All the best.
-Thank you.

428
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,875
Hello, everybody. Listen up!

429
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,333
I'd like you to meet someone from afar,

430
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:28,750
Her Highness, Maharani of Morpur, Padmaja.

431
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:30,875
Hello, ma'am.

432
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,166
Maharaja of Baroda told me about you once.

433
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,416
Okay.

434
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,750
You know, The Crown is my favorite show.

435
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,291
Are those jewels real?

436
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,375
Maharani ji, are you two together?

437
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,666
-Ranjit sir, a picture.
-Yeah, sure.

438
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,666
-Me too.
-Yeah, yeah.

439
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,000
-Can we take a picture?
-Maharani ji, profile please.

440
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,041
Ranjit sir.

441
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:16,208
I don't think we'll qualify
for the next round.

442
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,250
It's my fault.

443
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,625
But I was the one who lied.

444
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,875
And I took out my anger on the food.

445
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,875
You're right.

446
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,250
It's all your fault.

447
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,208
Okay, everyone at your stations, please!
We're ready with the results.

448
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:39,708
I thought winning this competition
will change my life.

449
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,500
But I think Silvermoon Bakery
will always be my life.

450
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:48,083
And three teams have won this round!

451
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:51,750
And they'll go
into the final elimination round.

452
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,041
West Bengal.

453
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,125
Maharashtra.

454
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:02,125
And…

455
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:04,958
Rajasthan.

456
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:08,208
Congratulations, guys!

457
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,500
And the winning team among them
will go to London!

458
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,041
Oh, my God!

459
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,291
To the finals of Gastronautics!

460
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,791
My life has changed, Molshri.

461
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:39,125
And you can take some credit for it.

462
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:46,583
For the first time, people know me
because of my work, not my name.

463
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:49,666
They saw my talent
that I've always been hiding.

464
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:54,416
But not anymore.

465
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,125
Shall we?

466
00:26:58,833 --> 00:26:59,666
Let's go.

467
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:06,416
The project I worked hard on
for six months was shut down.

468
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:10,666
Now there's no one
to give me work or to adopt me.

469
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,083
I've to move on.

470
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,458
There's nothing left in Morpur for me.

471
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,666
Oh, so there's nothing.

472
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,083
Obviously, I didn't mean that.

473
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,875
Jinnie, you're really special to me.

474
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,833
But look around.

475
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,666
This is my life.

476
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,958
Yeah.

477
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,875
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

478
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,625
You know, you can move here.

479
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:51,208
If you want.

480
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,500
And leave my home behind?

481
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,500
I mean, my family
really needs me right now.

482
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:58,291
Yeah.

483
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:05,416
So, listen, do you wanna stay the night?

484
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,291
I could.

485
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,958
Shit, but I need to…

486
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,916
make a call to Fizzy.

487
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,583
He's been looking for Sophia forever.

488
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,083
Best of luck to him.

489
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,041
She's not talking to anyone.

490
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,458
Not even me.

491
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:27,416
Wait a minute.

492
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,791
Do you know where Sophia is?

493
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:30,791
Yeah.

494
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,583
I think you should try that.

495
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:37,458
This is already…

496
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,666
That…

497
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,916
was disgusting!

498
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,458
Disgustingly good.

499
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,625
Well done, Team Rajasthan!

500
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,458
Congratulations!

501
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:39,916
Namaste, India.

502
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,041
We're off to London for the third
and final round of Gastronautics.

503
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:47,708
Where we'll make the best dish
from the region of Rajasthan.

504
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:50,125
I'm Molshri Mittal from Jaipur.

505
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,833
And…

506
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,833
And I'm the Prince of Morpur,
Digvijay Singh.

507
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,875
But you can call me Diggy.

508
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,625
Isn't Her Highness enjoying my party?

509
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,625
Is this not grand enough?

510
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,333
That's not it.

511
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,291
Then…

512
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,041
do you not like the King of Hearts?

513
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,916
This party is grand.

514
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,500
You are amazing too.

515
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,333
But I'm not sure about myself.

516
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,583
What I want to do, what I should do…

517
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:49,875
I have no idea.

518
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:57,958
I've always lived a fake life
in Morpur, Ranjit.

519
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:02,500
I came to you to escape from it,

520
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:06,375
only to see that
you're also stuck in a fake world.

521
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:12,083
But I don't want anything fake now.

522
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:16,291
Neither relationships nor people.

523
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,666
I have no relationship with these people.
I can kick them out right now.

524
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,416
It's not about them.

525
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,791
It's about us.

526
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,583
About you and me.

527
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,291
My husband was a good man.

528
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,583
But he kept
running from himself all his life.

529
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,958
And in the process of supporting him,

530
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,166
I lost myself.

531
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:49,291
For the first time,
I have the opportunity to be myself.

532
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,416
That's why,
before being with someone else,

533
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,666
I want to be with myself.

534
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,208
I hope you understand.

535
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,750
I guess.

536
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:05,750
Do you want an open relationship?

537
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,666
Is it like situationship?

538
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,750
Ask your brother to stop bothering Sophia.

539
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:12,833
He's the reason for this mess.

540
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,041
I know and I agree. And he knows that too.

541
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,208
That's why he's here to fix it.

542
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,541
I won't break my promise.

543
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,000
Oh, my God,
you can break a promise for love, Niki!

544
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,541
And he won't say anything, right?

545
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,333
But Fizzy loves Sophia.

546
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,666
-So?
-So!

547
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,666
So he really wants to fix everything.

548
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,083
I mean, if he fixes everything,
you can come back to Morpur.

549
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:36,208
So, please, Niki, please. Just tell me.

550
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,291
Just tell me.

551
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:45,333
Fuck!

552
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,125
Yes, Pankaj-sa.

553
00:32:58,791 --> 00:32:59,791
Yes, I read it.

554
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:04,416
Tell Zubin's team
I'll meet them tomorrow morning.

555
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:06,916
Yeah, I'm sure.

556
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,750
Hey. Read the news?

557
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:11,791
Just shut up and listen!

558
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,458
I know where Sophia is.

559
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,583
You're with… Okay.

560
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,208
Yeah, yeah…

561
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:20,791
Send me the…

562
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,791
Jinnie, I love you. You're a legend.
You're the best person in my life.

563
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,333
Hold on, I'm gonna-- One second.

564
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,166
Pankaj-sa.

565
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,666
Shit, shit.

566
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:46,250
Sophia darling!

567
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,291
Are you hurt?

568
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,208
What happened, darling?

569
00:33:57,416 --> 00:34:00,041
I was trying to bake a cake for you, but…

570
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,666
It's just a cake, darling.

571
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,500
-Come on, let's bake another one.
-Did you talk to Niki?

572
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,166
And what about Kunal?

573
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,500
Kunal is a good guy.
He'll come back, darling.

574
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:14,291
And that Maharaja,
he quit because you aren't there.

575
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,291
Talk to that Maharaja.

576
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:20,041
Everyone knows him.
He can do something for her.

577
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,416
I can't talk to anyone, Grandma!

578
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:26,791
Neither to Niki nor Kunal or to that…

579
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,583
Look.

580
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,958
All of you are trying to motivate me,

581
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:43,291
but let me be for some time.

582
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:47,125
And please stop telling me
all the time that,

583
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,791
"Darling, you're the best."
Because I'm not the best!

584
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,500
I'm a big failure, Grandma!

585
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,500
-Darling…
-I messed up everything.

586
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:58,416
No, darling.

587
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,833
Don't say that, my dear.

588
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,583
Even with the Maharaja?

589
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:18,875
Do you love him?

590
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:23,750
I'm angry, Grandma,

591
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:28,208
with myself for letting him
distract me from my work.

592
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:32,500
My focus, logic, attention, I…

593
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,541
I lost everything, Grandma.

594
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:43,833
I never let my relationships
come in the way of my work.

595
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:48,208
I never had that luxury, Grandma.

596
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:53,250
You don't have the luxury?

597
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,833
Or are you scared of falling in love?

598
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,833
-My darling…
-Grandpa, your knee! What are you doing?

599
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:06,375
My baby built her career by herself,

600
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,083
without any fear.

601
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,791
Why fear now?

602
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:15,083
If you listen to your heart,
you'll become stronger.

603
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,125
-Yes, gentleman?
-Sir.

604
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,166
Sophia, sir?

605
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,916
Don't go anywhere, okay?

606
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,375
Just don't go anywhere.

607
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,041
Just wait, gentleman!

608
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:41,208
Come.

609
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:47,750
Hi.

610
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,083
Why are you here, Aviraaj?

611
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,666
Zubin is ruining all your hard work.

612
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,500
I don't care.

613
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,875
Motibagh needs you, Soph.

614
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,208
We need you.

615
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:21,333
No one else can save us from this mess.

616
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:25,208
Aviraaj, I can't even save myself,
how will I save you?

617
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,875
The girl that you're looking for,
Aviraaj, is

618
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,875
gone.

619
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,916
Soph, there's nothing you can't do.

620
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,666
I know what your company means to you.

621
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,000
Don't fight for me,

622
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,125
fight for yourself.

623
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:48,833
I've lost everything, Aviraaj.

624
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,791
Please, just leave.

625
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,000
-Soph…
-Please, Aviraaj.

626
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,208
I'm not leaving, Soph.

627
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,166
I'm staying right here.

628
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,333
I've always been running from problems.

629
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:20,875
But not anymore.

630
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,458
And you're responsible for it.

631
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,958
You know, the day you left Motibagh,

632
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,416
I got a letter.

633
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
From my dad.

634
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,291
It wasn't written by a Maharaja.

635
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,291
It was written by my Dad for me.

636
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,333
He wrote…

637
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,416
that he lived a fake life.

638
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:45,291
And then one day, he met his true love.

639
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,000
Maurice.

640
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,666
And in that moment,
there was only one person in this world

641
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,791
with whom I wanted to share this.

642
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:01,291
You.

643
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,166
And if I can understand my Dad today,

644
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,041
it's only because of you.

645
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,875
I love you, Sophia.

646
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,583
I thought it'll be difficult to say this.

647
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,500
But it wasn't.

648
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:24,291
I love you.

649
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,541
I'm in love with you,

650
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,125
Sophia Kanmani Shekhar.

651
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:33,958
If you don't feel the same for me,
it's fine. I…

652
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:36,958
I still love you.

653
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:41,916
Soph…

654
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,375
Soph, don't…

655
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,666
shut me out, Soph.

656
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,250
I'm sorry I just came without a warning.

657
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:56,041
But the girl who taught me
to fight for my loved ones,

658
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,875
can't she fight for herself?

659
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:02,625
I probably failed to understand you, Soph,
but I wanna try.

660
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,416
Just let me in.

661
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,333
I love you, Soph.

662
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,750
And I'm here for you,

663
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,125
if you need me.

664
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:09,625
I love you.

665
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,583
-I think you should take that.
-No.

666
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,583
What happened, Pankaj-sa?

667
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,208
Hukum. Hukum, where are you?

668
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,375
Hukum, come back to Morpur
as soon as you can.

669
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:53,958
Zubin's men are barging into the palace
and taking away the valuables.

670
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,125
Where are you going? Stop.

671
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,041
-Stop. Where are you going?
-Sir, sir.

672
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:59,500
Hey! What's going on?

673
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,416
These are company papers.
You can't take these.

674
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,958
You can't lock it. What are you doing?

675
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:06,625
Move back!

676
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,208
You're looting our estate!

677
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,125
Move!

678
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,166
-Please, move!
-What are you doing?

679
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:13,750
Please behave. This is Rani-sa's room.

680
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:17,375
Girdhari, you should've told me
we're expecting visitors,

681
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:18,708
I would've dressed up.

682
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:21,833
I'm sorry, Hukum,
but we have to vacate the palace.

683
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,583
Vacate?

684
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:25,833
How dare you?

685
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:29,500
I am not going anywhere!

686
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:02,625
