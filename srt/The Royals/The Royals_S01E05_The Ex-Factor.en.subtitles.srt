1
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:17,500
They were too young to die in an accident,
so unfortunate.

2
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,666
The grandparents will take care
of the child now. Poor girl.

3
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,416
Kanmani, won't you come
with Grandpa and Grandma?

4
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,583
I want to go with Mummy and Papa.

5
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,791
I had warned you
that this venture is risky.

6
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,916
The media is laughing at us, Sophia.

7
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,041
Despite such a hefty investment,
right before our main launch,

8
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,416
your Maharaja has disappeared.

9
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,333
This is just a minor setback, Zubin.
We have it under control.

10
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,000
Our pilot trended,
and this last one created a media frenzy.

11
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,666
It's called negative media frenzy, Kunal.

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,000
And till when are you going to be
your CEO's spokesperson?

13
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,083
Please let her clarify.

14
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,291
I'm speaking for myself.

15
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,333
-Kunal, really?
-And I speak for myself.

16
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,208
I take full responsibility
for everything, Zubin.

17
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,916
And I'll fix it too.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,916
I really wish.

19
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,583
But it's won't be that easy.

20
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:18,583
And I, rather we,
don't wish to lose any more money.

21
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,041
And if this upcoming
main launch also fails--

22
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,916
Then I'll resign
from my position as the CEO.

23
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,791
What? Is she serious?

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,208
-Niki--
-Soph,

25
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,791
they got Yuvanath Wing's wall color wrong.

26
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,500
-Niki. Niki!
-And we don't have the budget to fix it.

27
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,416
Yeah, what?

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,916
I'm gonna pick you up at 6:00 am.

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,625
We're going to Alsipur.

30
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,875
I have a great plan to bring
my launch back on track.

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,708
How are you, Salad?

32
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,541
When did you and this wannabe royal
become friends ?

33
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,958
You used to call him
the "Lord of Nowhere."

34
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,333
Since you abandoned me
and moved to New York.

35
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,625
I abandoned you?

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,541
Salad was always there for me.

37
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,416
His presence and his parties
were a welcome distraction.

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,291
Otherwise I was so lonely.

39
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,333
You were lonely?

40
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,458
Without a goodbye or a warning,

41
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,541
you just left suddenly.

42
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,833
Is this how you break up with someone?

43
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:44,916
I am the one who broke up?

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,750
Do you have water stuck in your ears?

45
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,208
Since when did you start
imagining fictional tales?

46
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,125
Fiction?

47
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,500
Okay, come on. Ignore Salad.

48
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,375
And let's have some fun, okay?

49
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,750
I'd gladly ignore him,
if he wasn't wearing this flashy carpet.

50
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,791
Fizzy, don't be mean.
Should I apply some cream?

51
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,125
No, I'm good, babe. Topped up.

52
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,291
-Come on!
-I'm fine, babe!

53
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,000
What is she doing here?

54
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,333
-Ms. Shekhar!
-Mr. Salauddin!

55
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,958
-Salad, if you love me.
-Sure.

56
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,166
I was sure
you wouldn't turn down my invitation.

57
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,541
Welcome and thank you for joining us.

58
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,458
Well, one of our meetings got postponed.

59
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,375
So, here we are!
By the way, that's my colleague, Niki.

60
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,416
Aadaab, Niki.

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,125
-We're quite familiar with each other.
-Yes.

62
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,333
-Really?
-Hi, Salad. Nice dressing.

63
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,708
-You like it, huh?
-She's clearly very funny.

64
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,208
-Welcome, Sophia.
-Sure.

65
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,791
This is my small house
in this vast desert.

66
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,916
You're being humble, eh?
You call this small?

67
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,541
Honestly, after The Royal B&B Morpur,
The Royal B&B Alsipur will be something.

68
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,541
I'd like that too,
but let's discuss work tomorrow.

69
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,125
Today, let me just enthrall you
with my hospitality.

70
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,250
-No, unfortunately, we have to get back--
-Sophia!

71
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,791
You've come to Alsipur.

72
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,000
You can't leave without experiencing
the charms of Alsipur.

73
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,666
I insist it'll be worth your time.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,791
-Sure.
-Okay. Good.

75
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,083
-What happened?
-Soph. Let's go back.

76
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,875
If we knew he'd be here,
we wouldn't have come.

77
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,125
We're here because he's here.

78
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,833
Why? Aviraaj wasn't
even answering your calls.

79
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,833
We need Aviraaj for our main launch

80
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,500
and Zubin is anyway looking for
an opportunity to takeover the company.

81
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not gonna let that happen.

82
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,083
But why are you torturing yourself
by constantly seeing them together?

83
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,083
I'm okay, trust me.

84
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,958
Sophia, come.

85
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,291
Yeah, sure.

86
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,000
I DIDN'T SEE YOU AFTER THE BALL

87
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,500
Just look at him.

88
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,208
I'm so happy…

89
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,791
I'm sure he's clinging on to her
to strike a deal with The Royal B&B.

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,875
Even rocks have more virtue than that guy.

91
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,041
Salad is not clingy.

92
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,000
Salad is a charmer.

93
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,458
Looks like he's interested in her.

94
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,041
What's her name?

95
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,666
Sophia.

96
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,750
Salad is not her type.

97
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,250
I think even she has
better taste than that.

98
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,958
Anyways, screw them.

99
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,666
I'll be taking over
Dad's hospitality business soon.

100
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,583
And maybe,
if you behave yourself this time,

101
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,416
I'll consider you for a partnership.

102
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,791
Partner?

103
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,333
What? You don't want to be partners?

104
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,583
Regardless of what Chef Clinton says,
I have to do this.

105
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,625
I'll prove my worth today, Girdhari-sa.

106
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,500
I believe in you, Hukum.
You will be great.

107
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,250
You have it in you.

108
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,166
All the best.

109
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,083
Thank you.

110
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,208
-Is this your first attempt?
-Next!

111
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,250
Yes, it is.

112
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,583
-Hey, who is that? Where is he going?
-Next.

113
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,875
-Hold on, man.
-Where is he off to?

114
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,791
Excuse me.

115
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,041
-Is this the Gastronautics entry?
-Hello!

116
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,250
How can he cut the line?

117
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,250
-Who is he?
-Where is he going?

118
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,625
Do you think we're waiting for a bus here?

119
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,875
-Get back here.
-We've been in line all morning.

120
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,958
Where are you going?

121
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,708
-Get in line.
-Move to the back.

122
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,583
-Yeah…
-Get in the queue. Come back.

123
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,708
-Back there.
-I'm going.

124
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,208
Hukum, back here.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,833
Most of you have worked hard
for years to reach here,

126
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,541
but to win our hearts,

127
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,458
you have only 60 minutes today.

128
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,291
What's so special about your food

129
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,375
that makes the taste memorable?

130
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,541
To answer this question,

131
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,541
your time starts now!

132
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,208
Hurry, hurry!

133
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,416
Pick up your best ingredients
that suits your recipe.

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
Excuse me. Sorry.

135
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,958
Sorry, sorry. I need to pass.

136
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,000
Thank you.

137
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,958
Damn, we're running out of time.

138
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,916
The pantry shuts in five minutes.

139
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,166
If you miss picking up an ingredient now,
you can't beg, borrow, or steal later.

140
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,375
Will the most royal couple of India
not spend some time with us?

141
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,708
Sophia is my special guest today.
I'm giving her a tour of the fort.

142
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,833
I would like her
to collaborate with Alsipur.

143
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,375
And my aim is to impress you by tomorrow.

144
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm already impressed, Salad.

145
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,291
Oh, I love it.

146
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,250
Hi, Aviraaj.

147
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,875
-Hi. Sophia.
-Ayesha.

148
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,666
Sorry, we couldn't meet
at the Romeo & Juliet ball.

149
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,500
-Right.
-But it was fun.

150
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,958
The media went a little crazy
when they saw the two of us.

151
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,875
-Right.
-You know how it is.

152
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,875
History and all.

153
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,541
But the ball was fantastic. Good job.

154
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,083
Well, I'm glad you had fun.

155
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,208
-I'll be right back.
-Okay, baby.

156
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,208
-Brother Bilal!
-There you are.

157
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,041
-Hi!
-My dear cousin!

158
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,625
-So good to see you.
-After holidaying in the Alps,

159
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,541
he's on a break here in Alsipur.

160
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,500
-And Jinnie!
-Hi.

161
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,541
Everyone knows her.

162
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,458
Jinnie, will this viral
last for three days or longer?

163
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,625
-Bro? Oh, shit!
-Bilal, tissues!

164
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,583
Bro! Are you okay?

165
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,083
Let's go. How about a tour? Come on.

166
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,166
Y'all go ahead. I'll join you.

167
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,500
-Sure?
-Hundred percent.

168
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,041
-Come on, Niki.
-I'll be right there.

169
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,541
Okay, let's go.

170
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,666
-Come on.
-Come on, Salad.

171
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,416
Let me show you my giraffe.

172
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Hi, Aviraaj. I wanted to talk to you.
It's a little urgent.

173
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,166
Watch out.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,833
No, no! No, Fizzy!

175
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,500
No, no, no! Fizzy!

176
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,041
Oh, my God.

177
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,000
Race you to the other side!

178
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,500
Swim, swim!

179
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,458
Your radiance
is like the moon's soft glow.

180
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,541
Greetings.

181
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,500
Greetings.

182
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,500
Rani Sahiba,

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,916
I sincerely believe

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,791
that Yuvanath ji is peaceful
in his heavenly abode.

185
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,083
And I apologize

186
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,000
for not visiting you earlier.

187
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,041
Neither did you come to meet us back then,

188
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,416
nor did you come
for our celebrations this time.

189
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,583
My indignation is justified.

190
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,666
We were Invited.

191
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:24,875
Then disinvited.

192
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,166
And then invited again.

193
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,125
Well, when…

194
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,916
the intentions keep changing,

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,666
one's hesitation is but natural.

196
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,125
By sending Ayesha over,

197
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,416
I tried to make it up at least.

198
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,541
I got to know that my daughter's presence

199
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,750
stirred up some frenzy at the ball.

200
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,416
That's why I'm here.

201
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,000
Actually…

202
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,916
I wanted to apologize in person.

203
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,708
For what?

204
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,500
That night, at the ball,

205
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,666
Aviraaj threw a fit in front of the media.

206
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,125
After what happened that night,

207
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,708
I thought you wouldn't even talk to me.

208
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,791
I wouldn't dare.

209
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,375
No, Rani Sahiba, you're mistaken.

210
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,208
Because

211
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,625
this is actually the right time
to take things forward.

212
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,291
Aviraaj is just unbelievable.

213
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,166
After what happened,

214
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,458
Ayesha and Aviraaj
are together at Alsipur right now.

215
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,583
And they're trying to keep it under wraps

216
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,250
like teenagers.

217
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,666
Maybe we should also learn

218
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,083
to play these games from them.

219
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,125
-We're gonna race down there.
-Okay, go, go!

220
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,416
Fuck it.

221
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,583
How's your day going?

222
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,666
Super!

223
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,208
Is she ignoring you?

224
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,500
Is your Maharaja ignoring you?

225
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,208
He's in a mood.

226
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,666
But I'll handle him.

227
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:19,958
I need a drink.

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,833
The person you're calling is not--

229
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,250
The person you're calling
is not answering.

230
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,625
Please call back later.

231
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,625
The person you're--

232
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,291
Oh, shit!

233
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,583
Sorry, sorry.

234
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,166
Can you please pass me that?

235
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,125
Yeah, sure.

236
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,666
Only 12 contestants will qualify
for the next round in Bombay.

237
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,000
There, you'll be paired up
and six teams will compete.

238
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,166
Fuck!

239
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,250
All the best.

240
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,375
Can someone give me some saffron?

241
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,625
-Come on!
-The next 15 minutes

242
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,833
can change your destiny.

243
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,291
So start plating now!

244
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,500
Of course.

245
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,125
Listen, Kunal, don't get me wrong.

246
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,083
-Yeah.
-Okay? But…

247
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,833
you're really wasting your time
at WorkPotato, buddy.

248
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,875
See, I know Sophia and I
are competitors, but--

249
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,958
Sameera, Sophia and your stories
will never end.

250
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,708
I need tequila for it, not coffee.

251
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,708
I get it. Okay. Listen.

252
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,166
Nobody is denying her abilities,

253
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,541
but she is very impulsive.

254
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,375
And you know it well, Kunal,
that a leader needs…

255
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,041
What's that word? Stability.

256
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,208
A leader needs to be stable.

257
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,333
What are you trying to say, Sameera?

258
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,333
Whatever you want to do,

259
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,583
do it as a CEO.

260
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,541
Lead your own team your way.

261
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,083
And forget about funding,
don't worry about that.

262
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,041
Leave that to me. I'll handle it.

263
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,625
Promise me you'll think about it.

264
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,000
Trust me, the projects that
we're about to work on are really big…

265
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,208
All right, everyone.

266
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:28,375
In five, four, three, two, and one!

267
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,291
Time's up!

268
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,500
Please step away from your stations.

269
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,583
Ready for a surprise?

270
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,500
To judge this round of Gastronautics,

271
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,666
we have with us India's favorite chef.

272
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,208
Please welcome Chef Clinton.

273
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,625
Thank you, Chef.

274
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,541
-Thank you so much. Such a pleasure.
-Good to see you.

275
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,291
-Contestant 512.
-Yes, ma'am.

276
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,208
The presentation is good,

277
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,416
but too many flavors are clashing.
Better luck next time.

278
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,791
Contestant 251.

279
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,916
Looks interesting.

280
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,916
When I got the call from Gastronautics,

281
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,083
I was a little skeptical.

282
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,333
I wondered if the contestants

283
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,875
can bring something new to the table.

284
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,416
I got my answer.

285
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,375
Molshri Mittal,

286
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,375
welcome to round two in Mumbai!

287
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,416
-Thank you, thank you!
-Congratulations.

288
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,041
-Thank you, Chef. Thank you.
-Congratulations.

289
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,208
Contestant 157.

290
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,166
What have you made for us today, Dilip?

291
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,250
Kesari Shorba.

292
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,500
Please tell us about it.

293
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,541
This is a traditional recipe
that I have prepared in my own way.

294
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,625
By using those ingredients

295
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,500
that can withstand
the hot temperatures of our region.

296
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,583
Lentil flour, spices and saffron.

297
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,916
I often tell people

298
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,208
that the only difference
between a home cook and a chef

299
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,416
is fiery passion.

300
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,458
The flaming stove can only cook the food.

301
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,416
But burning passion
is what makes one a chef.

302
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,333
Yes.

303
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:10,958
And today,

304
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,000
this dish…

305
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,458
has a lot of fire within it.

306
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,250
It's pretty well done, Dilip.

307
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,333
The presentation is a little wonky,
but the taste is fabulous.

308
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,916
But, Dilip,
if you want to be a Gastronaut,

309
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,333
you'll have to do lots more.

310
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,750
So, in the next round,
work on your shortcomings.

311
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,666
Yes, Chef.

312
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,583
Congratulations.

313
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,041
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

314
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,375
Ayesha is a perfect girl in every respect.

315
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,166
She's beautiful, smart.

316
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,875
She's your daughter after all.

317
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,500
I'm sure there's no shortage
of marriage proposals for her.

318
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,500
There's no shortage of anything.

319
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,125
Actually, out of my three children,

320
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,291
Ayesha is the smartest.

321
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:24,333
And maybe that's why
she likes Aviraaj so much.

322
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,708
I believe you know

323
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,958
that Morpur has lost its former glory.

324
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:37,583
Rani Sahiba, don't worry,
I know about the debts.

325
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,041
And despite that,

326
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,916
Aviraaj is well known to the world.

327
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,708
People may not know about Morpur,

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,666
but everyone knows Aviraaj.

329
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,541
I am convinced

330
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,333
that once Ayesha and Aviraaj get married,

331
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,000
they'll make Dhondi Hospitality
a global name.

332
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,583
Doesn't this sound like a distant dream?

333
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,791
If we turn this friendship
into a relationship,

334
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,583
then these dreams will surely come true.

335
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,750
You are so sure of yourself?

336
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,958
You should try me.

337
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,083
-Hi.
-Hi.

338
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,666
We really need to talk, Aviraaj.

339
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,250
Forget it, Sophia.

340
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,583
How can I, Aviraaj?

341
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,333
You're avoiding me
because of a misunderstanding.

342
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:09,208
-And I think it's time we talk--
-I think I overreacted that night.

343
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,166
Ayesha and I had to meet sometime, so…

344
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,583
you just made it happen sooner.

345
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,666
Well, I'm glad I could help.

346
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,666
Can we talk about the launch now?

347
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,458
-Aviraaj, it's important for you to be--
-No, that's impossible.

348
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,833
I can't trust you anymore.

349
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:37,458
And you can't expect anything from me.

350
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,875
-So--
-Hey!

351
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,583
Are you ready for a wild night?

352
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,291
Baby, you look so good.

353
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,041
-Oh, hi.
-Hi

354
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,041
You look cute.

355
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,500
-So do you.
-I know.

356
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,083
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

357
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:51,916
Hey.

358
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:59,500
Aviraaj is not even sure
if he wants Morpur or not.

359
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,208
Ayesha also doesn't know

360
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,583
if she wants Aviraaj or not.

361
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,583
Our kids just can't make up their mind.

362
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,166
What they say today
is not what they do tomorrow.

363
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,583
Forget the kids.

364
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,291
Tell me…

365
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,125
what does your heart desire?

366
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,041
What do you want?

367
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:42,041
Another memorable party
hosted by Nawab Salauddin Khan

368
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,000
is ready for you to rock.

369
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,166
Today, my guests will witness

370
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,333
the magic of Alsipur.

371
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,208
This is a celebration
of friendship, love, and the desert.

372
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,208
-Yeah, come on! Come on, everybody!
-Spicy!

373
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,041
Come on.

374
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:58,666
-Don't be shy. It's okay.
-I think I'll skip.

375
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,000
Come on! Trust me, it's all right.

376
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:05,166
Just some fun and games.

377
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,958
Come on! Try it.

378
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:11,291
Ms. Shekhar doesn't understand
the concept of fun and games.

379
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,750
Please teach her.

380
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

381
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,666
One more?

382
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,041
Go for it.

383
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,583
Okay. Let's go!

384
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,291
Do I know that girl?

385
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:30,375
She's been staring at me.

386
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,458
Is she like…
Is she like into me or something?

387
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,208
I don't know. She's been there.

388
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,666
Do I, like, know her?

389
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:39,958
No, no, you don't know her. No.

390
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:49,791
Jinnie!

391
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:51,750
Niki!

392
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,333
Niki, wait. Wait.

393
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,541
I got the message.

394
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,083
But that's not it, I promise.

395
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,291
I know what it is.

396
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,791
What you're doing now,
I did it ten years ago.

397
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,291
It's tough to accept reality. I know.

398
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,000
And I don't want to force you.

399
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,958
But that doesn't mean
that you can treat me like shit, Jinnie.

400
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,166
No. No, that's…

401
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,583
Okay. I'm sorry.

402
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:21,125
What happened between us that night…
I had never done that before.

403
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:24,208
I mean, obviously, I've done it
but, like, with a…

404
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,666
And it terrified me.

405
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,916
You're fearless and great,

406
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,291
and more power to you.

407
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,500
But I don't know if I'm ready for this.

408
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,708
And I don't know why I kissed
that stupid Bilal!

409
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,041
I'm really sorry--

410
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,541
-I'm feeling sick, Fizzy.
-Okay.

411
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:58,791
I can't walk.

412
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,583
Okay.

413
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,416
Thank you.

414
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,625
Carry me.

415
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,166
You're hot.

416
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,166
That's why I say, come to Alsipur 'cause…

417
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,250
Alsipur.

418
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,083
Come on,

419
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,666
Sophia Shekhar.

420
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,875
It's not over.

421
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,416
-Come this way. Come on.
-Stop it.

422
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,250
Come on.

423
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,583
Ayesha, what are you doing?

424
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,500
Hold me properly, Fizzy.

425
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,583
Just come.

426
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,833
Wow, Hukum.

427
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,125
This is fantastic.

428
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,416
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

429
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,333
Thanks for coming with me, Girdhari-sa.

430
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,291
One day, I'll come to your house and cook
something special for your family.

431
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,750
You're welcome to come home, Hukum,
but there's no one else there.

432
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,291
You all are my family.

433
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,208
Sometimes I feel

434
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:32,125
that you are the only family I have.

435
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,625
Cheers.

436
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,625
Okay, Ash, you're good. Yeah, let it out.

437
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,333
Okay, okay.

438
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,833
-Hold my hair.
-I'm holding it.

439
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:05,958
You're spoiling it.

440
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,000
Should I hold them or…

441
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:10,208
-You're spoiling my hair, Fizzy.
-Okay. Just…

442
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,875
Okay, let it out.

443
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:15,875
Again!

444
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,083
Take it off, Salad.

445
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,250
Take it off! Come on!

446
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,666
-You like this.
-I love it.

447
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,541
I don't like losing.

448
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:30,875
Nor do I.

449
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,041
This game I don't mind losing.

450
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,041
Your deal.

451
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:37,500
Come on.

452
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:40,708
Wait a second.

453
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,250
If I lose again…

454
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,458
then let the real games begin.

455
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,458
You know what?

456
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,750
I think we should call it a night.

457
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:03,541
Yeah.

458
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,916
Niki and I have to leave tomorrow,

459
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,666
and I'm very drunk.

460
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,583
I'm very tired.

461
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,625
And I had so much fun.

462
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:14,500
Thank you, Salad.

463
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,541
I thought my dreams will come true

464
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:19,666
But He likes to play games

465
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,291
I thought my dreams will come true

466
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,875
But He likes to play games

467
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,125
Though I'm by the river

468
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,041
I'm left thirsty

469
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,166
Quenching your thirst

470
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:39,541
Will make it complex and bold

471
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:41,875
Put on your shirt

472
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,250
Else you'll catch a cold

473
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:48,125
May I ask you something?

474
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,583
Why did you come to Alsipur?

475
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,083
To discuss plans with you.

476
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,916
With me or with Aviraaj?

477
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,375
Mine and Aviraaj's discussions never end.

478
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,333
Our launch is fast approaching,

479
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:11,208
so I thought maybe it's a great time
for us to discuss The Royal B&B Alsipur.

480
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:16,250
Do you know what's common between us?

481
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,166
-What is it, Salad?
-Ambition.

482
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Right.

483
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,166
Morpur doesn't value you.

484
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,666
But I do.

485
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,583
That's why I'm asking you
to plan something else.

486
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,000
-What do you mean?
-I mean…

487
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,750
Ayesha is managing Dhondi Hospitality now.

488
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:42,958
So?

489
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,458
When she gets married to Aviraaj,

490
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,208
which company…

491
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:52,583
do you think
Motibagh will do business with?

492
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,583
Yes, but,

493
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:01,125
Aviraaj has signed a contract with us.
And honestly,

494
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,875
they don't have enough money
to end this contract. So…

495
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,500
But the Maharaja of Dhondi does.

496
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:13,083
Yeah, but it…

497
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:16,041
It just doesn't make
any good business sense, so…

498
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,125
Business sense? Sophia, business sense?

499
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,666
Who cares about the business?

500
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,041
We exist because of our image.

501
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:28,000
And for Morpur, is Dhondi a bigger name

502
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:29,958
or Sophia Shekhar?

503
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,583
Since you've stepped
into the world of the royals,

504
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:35,500
you should know our inner truth as well.

505
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,583
We cover the torn parts of our clothes,

506
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:42,000
with bejeweled gold robes.

507
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:58,666
You okay?

508
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,291
Please don't leave, Fizzy.

509
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:10,083
Stay with me for some time.

510
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,416
Okay.

511
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,291
Sleep.

512
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:21,333
We finally met after so long.

513
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,125
Imagine,

514
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,791
if your mother hadn't called,

515
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,541
we would've never met.

516
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:35,125
Mom?

517
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,791
My mom called you?

518
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,208
Ash, you said my mom called you?

519
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:42,791
Yeah.

520
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,416
She wants us to get married.

521
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,916
Even I know it now…

522
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,375
that we deserve each other.

523
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:58,625
And our families deserve each other.

524
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:04,083
And you still love me, I know it.

525
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:05,666
-Ayesha…
-You love me, no?

526
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,583
It's okay. Sleep now. Lie down.

527
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:09,750
Just rest.

528
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,791
When did my mom call you?

529
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,333
Tell me.

530
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,708
After those idiots
disinvited us from the ball.

531
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,791
I know it's crazy, right?

532
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,250
But it's okay,

533
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:35,458
because Paddy aunty
invited us to the ball again.

534
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,416
So, it's all good.

535
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:13,666
I take full responsibility
for everything, Zubin.

536
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,166
And I'll fix it too.

537
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:16,666
I really wish.

538
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:18,916
But it won't be that easy.

539
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,625
And I, rather we,
don't wish to lose any more money.

540
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,166
And if this upcoming
main launch also fails--

541
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,291
-Sophia.
-Then I'll resign

542
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,875
from my position as the CEO.

543
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:29,458
Sophia, I'm coming in.

544
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,875
Hang on, don't do that. Let me help you.

545
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:41,958
I've got this.

546
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,041
-I'm okay--
-One second.

547
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:43,958
-I'm okay, Aviraaj!
-I'm doing it.

548
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:44,958
-I said I can do it!
-I'll do it, Sophia.

549
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,250
I'll do it. Just let me do it.

550
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,583
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

551
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:53,666
It's fine.

552
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,250
Sophia, I want to talk to you.

553
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,291
But I don't want to!

554
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,583
My patience is over.

555
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:09,500
I don't have the patience
to fight everyone, to fight you!

556
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:14,791
Okay, I'm not here to fight.
I just wanna talk. That's it.

557
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,708
Now you want to talk to me?

558
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:17,916
Now?

559
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,041
I've been calling you for days.

560
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:23,541
I was running behind you all day
like a bloody stalker.

561
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:26,500
And you kept saying, "Not now, Sophia!"

562
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,583
Now I don't want to talk to you!

563
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:30,250
You know what? I feel like

564
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,083
everyone is up in arms against me!

565
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:36,791
My board is trying
to take over my company, Aviraaj!

566
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:40,458
My company! My company,
for which I have sacrificed everything!

567
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,208
I had no friends. I took no vacations.

568
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:45,958
I had no family.
No personal life! Nothing at all!

569
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:49,333
And I've become so pathetic
that no one answers my calls now.

570
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,958
Not Diggy, not Kunal! And you?

571
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,666
You're not even ready
to talk to me, Aviraaj!

572
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,041
I'm here, Sophia.

573
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:57,750
Now you're here.

574
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,125
Really?

575
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,500
If you're here, why do I feel

576
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:05,750
that I have to do everything
without you, Aviraaj?

577
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:09,791
I thought you're upset with me
because of Ayesha.

578
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,500
Then why is Ayesha here with you?

579
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,791
Why is she with you?

580
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,916
-Let me explain.
-No! I don't need an explanation, Aviraaj!

581
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:26,041
I'm so done with you
treating me like a bloody hobby!

582
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:28,791
You're interested today, but not tomorrow.

583
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,458
You'll dance with me today,
but not tomorrow.

584
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,666
I'm done! And you know what? I get it.

585
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,333
-If Princess Ayesha is with you…
-I understand.

586
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,708
-…why would you be interested…
-Okay.

587
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,125
-…in a commoner like me?
-Okay.

588
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,500
-I'm listening.
-No, you're not!

589
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,333
Okay, Sophia, just shut up!

590
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:43,375
Shut up. Please.

591
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,458
I know you had disinvited Ayesha.

592
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:53,250
It doesn't matter
because you didn't believe me.

593
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,791
Sorry. I'm sorry.

594
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,791
I should've believed you.
I didn't. I'm sorry.

595
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,708
I'm not interested in Ayesha.

596
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,416
I'm not interested in anyone else.

597
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,500
I've never met anyone like you.

598
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,125
