1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,041
Hey, yo, listen up!

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,791
Who taught you how to drive?

3
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:19,791
You suck!

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,333
You're gonna lose, dude!

5
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,791
Buckle up!

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,916
I'll fucking get you, bro!

7
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:29,958
Fuck you!

8
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,500
You brat!

9
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,083
Fuck you right back!

10
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,291
And that's how--

11
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,416
-Dude, what the hell?
-Gotcha, Fizzy!

12
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:07,333
I never imagined that Fizzy Morpur's car
would kiss my car's bumper.

13
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:10,708
Very funny. And I never imagined that I'll
have to drive Dhruv Dholpur's old junk.

14
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,416
-Whatever.
-Dump that piece of shit!

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,666
-Yeah, bro!
-You were amazing!

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,000
-Blame the fucking car. Y'all saw, right?
-Oh, he was amazing?

17
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,875
-What a fucking race.
-Oh, I see how it is.

18
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,791
You're back early, Hukum.

19
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,500
Actually, The Royal B&B's work
is in progress.

20
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,291
It's best if you use
the south entrance, Hukum.

21
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,458
-I don't know. Let's check.
-Guys, we'll take that entry.

22
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,416
Come on.

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,083
Girdhari-sa.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,083
Thank you.

25
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,458
We are doing another royal experience?
Wasn't polo successful, ma'am?

26
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,916
Polo was great, Keertana,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,166
but only Aviraaj
got publicity from it, not us.

28
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,916
I really hope
the Romeo-Juliet ball changes that.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,583
-We really need some positive PR.
-Okay, ma'am.

30
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,541
The royals and commoners.

31
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,166
The king and his subjects.

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,916
Common folk and the royal family.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,166
-Keertana.
-Yes, ma'am.

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,791
-You realize it's an important event?
-Yes, ma'am.

35
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,875
-Which you can handle.
-Thank you, ma'am.

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,250
Did you Google translate this speech?

37
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,250
Is it that obvious, ma'am?

38
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:13,125
Keertana, it's a high-profile ball,
which you're gonna host.

39
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,708
Not a qawwali night, so…

40
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,208
-maybe write something original.
-Yes, ma'am.

41
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,875
-Not with the help of AI.
-Yes, ma'am.

42
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,000
What about the RSVPs?

43
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,166
Ma'am, 70% commoners
and 30% royals have confirmed.

44
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,166
Well, what should we call the commoners?
Common, public, or ordinary?

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,333
No.

46
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,250
Just 30% royals confirmed?

47
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:34,625
Keertana, if we only have 30% royals,
who will dance with our guests?

48
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,666
We at least need a 50-50
for this event to be successful.

49
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,833
-And where's the headline-grabbing name?
-Here.

50
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,708
Where's our headline-grabbing name, Kunal?

51
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,083
There's only one person here
who's done the impossible.

52
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,583
The Dhondis have confirmed.

53
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,000
-No way.
-Yeah.

54
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,666
-No way!
-Yeah.

55
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,083
Well done, partner!

56
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,250
Well, at least some good news.

57
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,583
Zubin sir has also confirmed.

58
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,833
Should I count him
as a royal or a commoner?

59
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,333
Is Zubin coming?

60
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,458
-Yes, ma'am.
-Shit.

61
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,000
-Zubin has confirmed?
-Zubin has confirmed.

62
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:11,250
Come what may, we have to bring up
the royal confirmation from 30% to 60%.

63
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,166
This is The Royal B&B's first event
of this scale, guys.

64
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,083
-It has to be a hit.
-Soph, we'll do it.

65
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,083
Ma'am, I have an idea.

66
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,458
No one ever came for my birthdays
because they were jealous of my success.

67
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,416
But in fifth grade, I made a deal
with the most popular girl

68
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,791
that I'll give her my beautiful notes,

69
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,166
and she'll endorse my party in return.
The entire class showed up--

70
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,541
-I'll talk to him--
-I'll do it.

71
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,833
-Let me--
-I'll talk to him.

72
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,291
-Let me talk--
-I'll do it, Kunal.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,416
Keertana, recheck the RSVPs.

74
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,875
Recheck? Again--

75
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,041
Recheck it. Please.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,416
Soph, let me talk to him.

77
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,666
Why? Why can't I talk to him?

78
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,166
You may, but the two of you
don't see eye to eye, right?

79
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,416
That's not true, Kunal.

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,958
I talk to him politely
because I'm a professional.

81
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,208
But he… he's a man-child.

82
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,958
Fine, talk to him, but be cautious, okay?

83
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,875
-I can handle him, okay?
-I know.

84
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,666
Soph.

85
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:06,875
The other day…
I mean, the other night, the text…

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,916
Kunal, actually,
that night, I was a bit…

87
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,500
Actually, let's talk about it later.

88
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,583
-Best!
-Yeah.

89
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,791
-Best.
-Yeah.

90
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,041
-Okay.
-Yeah.

91
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,291
-Yeah, right. You'll see.
-Wow. Very pretty.

92
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,625
-Greetings, Hukum.
-Greetings.

93
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,500
-Actually…
-Not now, Pankaj-sa.

94
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,333
Hukum, it's about tomorrow's
The Royal B&B's Romeo-Juliet Dance--

95
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,083
That's a mouthful. What about it?

96
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,708
You're late for the fittings.

97
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't need fittings.

98
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,333
But Rani-sa insists.

99
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,666
When did she start worrying
about my clothes--

100
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,708
-Come on.
-Okay, look at what's happening.

101
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,875
Who's coming to the ball tomorrow night?

102
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,375
All royal families
have been invited, Hukum.

103
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,416
Like who?

104
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,916
Like Ahilyapur, Shorpur, Vaaniganj.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,041
And?

106
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,541
The Dhondis, Hukum.

107
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,708
Where's Rani-sa?

108
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,875
Will you come to Bombay with me?

109
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,375
Are you crazy?

110
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,416
You drive me crazy, Lilypad.

111
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,333
The King of Cinema's palace
feels desolate.

112
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,416
Rani-sa!

113
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,666
Maharaja Aviraaj is on his way here.

114
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,041
It sounds urgent. I'll see you later.

115
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,500
Mom!

116
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,041
You could've called before coming.

117
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,125
Why are the Dhondis coming tomorrow?

118
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,166
When?

119
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,333
Mom, you're not good at lying,
why do you even try?

120
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,250
Why would I lie?

121
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,083
I'm not coming tomorrow.

122
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,333
Your future depends
on what you do tomorrow.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,583
And what is the problem?

124
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,583
Ayesha is beautiful, cultured, single.

125
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,875
-Here we go.
-She's from a royal family.

126
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,958
She went to Harvard. She plays the sarod.

127
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,125
Is she going to play the sarod
for me everyday?

128
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:02,041
And by the way, Ms. Shekhar
is also beautiful, cultured, single.

129
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,250
She went to IIM.

130
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,041
She loves horses too.
How about I marry her?

131
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,291
You think this is all a joke, don't you?

132
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,333
Do you have any idea
what will happen if The Royal B&B fails?

133
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,041
What will we do?

134
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,375
What more do we sell?

135
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,625
If I have to sell
anything else now, Fizzy,

136
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,541
I'll ask Rambha
to have a beautiful donation box

137
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,625
-installed on the town square in our name.
-Okay…

138
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,541
No, seriously. Fizzy, do you really think

139
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,958
that these friends of yours
are going to stand by you?

140
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,916
They'll disappear in no time.

141
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,916
And you know very well…

142
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,416
that a commoner like Sophia
is no match for you.

143
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,541
So, I'm saying this once again,

144
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,416
pay special attention to Ayesha tomorrow.

145
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,875
You have to make this work.

146
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,791
You know me very well, Mom.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,208
Do you really think Ayesha and I'll work?

148
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,208
You're a Maharaja, Fizzy.

149
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,666
And a Maharaja caters
to his people's desires.

150
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,875
Lilypad!

151
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,625
I'm waiting.

152
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,500
That's…

153
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,291
Shit!

154
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,791
Chicken marinade, please.

155
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,875
-Service at six. Where's the garnish?
-Chef Clinton!

156
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,500
I said mashed potatoes, not diced!

157
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,625
It's a pleasure to meet you, Chef.

158
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,041
Likewise, Your Highness.

159
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,916
-I hope your stay has been comfortable.
-Indeed.

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,041
Amazing.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,083
Chef, a friend of mine is participating
in Gastronautics this year.

162
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,000
If you don't mind,
could you please try one of his dishes?

163
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,958
Looks pretty colorful.

164
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,125
It's Morpur's age-old recipe.

165
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,791
I wish we could serve this
to the guests tomorrow.

166
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,541
You know what? We can.

167
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,500
Did you hear that, Girdhari-sa?

168
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,500
Chef's instructions.
Serve this to the guests tomorrow.

169
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,250
-Of course.
-There you go. Your wish has been granted.

170
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,541
It'll be taken care of.

171
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,250
You're welcome, Chef.

172
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,041
Madam CEO.

173
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,625
Maharaja ji.

174
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,166
So, tell me,

175
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,333
what can I do for you?

176
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,916
We don't have enough confirmations
from the royal families.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,166
So I was wondering

178
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,500
if you could send them
a personal invitation,

179
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,875
maybe that'll help.

180
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,791
Done.

181
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,000
Really?

182
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,416
Yeah.

183
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,583
Anything for The Royal B&B.

184
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,000
I got to know
that the Dhondis are coming tomorrow.

185
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,916
Our relation with the Dhondis are a bit…

186
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,666
complicated.

187
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:47,333
But they've accepted the invitation,
so maybe it's not that complicated?

188
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,458
Will the media be there as well?

189
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,166
Yes.

190
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,208
Then I'm sorry, I won't be able to come.

191
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,541
No, no, no, no!
No, Aviraaj, my event is in 24 hours!

192
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,625
Yeah, and I'll ensure it's a success.

193
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,833
Aviraaj, the guests are expecting
to meet you, not me.

194
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,333
I hope you get that.

195
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,208
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint them.

196
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,333
Why… Why don't you get it?

197
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,500
The cost of the repairs,
the disaster at the polo event.

198
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,166
You think polo was a great success

199
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,750
because 'Shirtless Sultan' was trending,
but it wasn't.

200
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,666
By the time you came to your senses,
half my test audience had left,

201
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,375
and The Royal B&B was completely ignored.

202
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,416
Okay, here's the thing.

203
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,791
Sophia, if I'm seen with the Dhondis
tomorrow, the media will focus only on us.

204
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,666
Not on The Royal B&B.
I'm trying to help you.

205
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,791
Aviraaj,

206
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,666
the launch is in two months.

207
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,333
I'm under tremendous pressure.

208
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,958
My board thinks I'm a complete failure,
and you know what,

209
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,666
I need your co-operation.

210
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,125
Ayesha Dhondi is my ex. All right?

211
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,083
Okay. So?

212
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,291
So?

213
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,541
My mom wants us to get married.

214
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,208
-The union of two great royal families.
-But you don't want that?

215
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,000
Actually, you know what?
This is none of my business.

216
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,000
-No, it's okay.
-I'm truly sorry, I'm just…

217
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,333
I want to have a union, but not with her.

218
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,916
Maybe with another princess then.

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,208
That's what Rani-sa wants.

220
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,666
And honestly, my family's traditions
and customs would be difficult…

221
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,416
-For an ordinary girl?
-…for a commoner girl…

222
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,708
to understand, Sophia.

223
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,875
But I don't believe in that.
I don't believe in a lot of these things.

224
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,083
Yes, but you'll do whatever
is convenient for you.

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,458
It's not convenient for me, Sophia.

226
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:38,250
I'm a king only for namesake.
I can't do what my heart truly desires.

227
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,625
The royals don't want to dance
with the commoners, okay?

228
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,958
So, now you know
why such few royals have RSVPed.

229
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,125
Sophia, I'll try my best to help you,

230
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,750
but no promises. All right?

231
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:56,833
Sure.

232
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,958
And I'll try my best

233
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,166
to help, however I can, with the Dhondis.

234
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,833
Thank you.

235
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,583
And this stays between us. Please?

236
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,375
Of course.

237
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,416
Jinnie.

238
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,291
I'm so sorry.

239
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,875
-You scared me.
-I'm so sorry.

240
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,958
So, what are you planning
to wear tomorrow?

241
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,416
I won't be coming.

242
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,958
I've been attending such dances forever
and I hate these fake evenings.

243
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,916
"Oh, you're so pretty." "You're so nice."
"What's this dress…"

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,625
And then a boring guy asks, "May I?"

245
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,291
A girl could ask too.

246
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,958
And I've to dance with those idiots, so…

247
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,708
No, thank you.

248
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,041
Oh, it's too bad. I had worked hard on it.

249
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,583
I thought we could go together.

250
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,083
Fine, I'll come.

251
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,291
-You will?
-Yeah.

252
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,666
I mean, I've endured
so many of these parties,

253
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,583
what's the harm in one more? Okay!

254
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,291
Bring it--

255
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,041
That's weird. No, side kiss.

256
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,166
-See you.
-See you.

257
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,125
Okay. Bye.

258
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,166
-Bye.
-Bye.

259
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,291
-Bye.
-See you.

260
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,500
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

261
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,500
Bye.

262
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,708
Why are you mourning?

263
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,625
Ayesha Dhondi is coming tomorrow.

264
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,083
So you're going to run off
to New York again. How unpredictable.

265
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,833
Are you planning to elope with her?

266
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,208
Who? Niki? Please.

267
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,416
You know that
"Who? Niki?" is into you, right?

268
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,458
So mature.

269
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,875
-It's obvious.
-Okay, you know what's obvious?

270
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,375
It's obvious that Sophia is into you
and you're into Sophia.

271
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,791
Please go and bug your girlfriend.
I don't have the time for this.

272
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,708
-You go bug your girlfriend.
-What?

273
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,708
-Don't hit me, Fizzy!
-Don't be violent with me.

274
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,666
I'm gonna tell Mumma!

275
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,333
Niki! Where were you?

276
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,416
-I was with Jinnie--
-I don't care!

277
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,250
Aviraaj's ex-girlfriend
is coming tomorrow.

278
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,458
She's a fucking Dhondi! Ayesha Dhondi.

279
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,791
Okay. Is he still into her?

280
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,791
No. In fact, he wants us to disinvite her.

281
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,208
Some royal family drama.

282
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,666
If she comes, he won't be able to.

283
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,125
Okay, so he's definitely still into her.

284
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,500
-Were you checking her out?
-No.

285
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,333
What were you doing then?

286
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,791
-I was checking her out.
-And?

287
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,166
She's okay.

288
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,958
No. No. No!

289
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,791
Bro, she's flawless.

290
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,708
Please.

291
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,291
Soph, if you're my true friend,
you won't uninvite her.

292
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,416
She probably hasn't
lifted a finger in her life.

293
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,958
In other news, Jinnie likes me.

294
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,625
Really? Did she say that?

295
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,291
Some things need not be said.

296
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,208
Anyways, she'll be my date tomorrow.

297
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,625
And does she know that?

298
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,166
Obviously. We aren't
attending a prayer service,

299
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,708
but a Romeo and Juliet ball.

300
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,833
Don't be so sure, Niki.

301
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,750
These royals can fry your brain.

302
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,333
What they say is not what they do,
and they mean something else altogether.

303
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:13,333
By the end of it, all they want is
an old-school prince or princess.

304
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,333
And you know what?

305
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,958
They don't even want
to dance with the likes of us.

306
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,708
What are you upset about?

307
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,041
About all the fake Romeos
and fraud fucking Juliets!

308
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,958
I didn't want you to hear about it
from someone else.

309
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:42,666
Fizzy, I've thought
long and hard about it.

310
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,208
And trust me,

311
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,416
it won't change anything between us.

312
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:49,958
I promise.

313
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,291
Why did you get married
if you wanted to get divorced?

314
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,291
Fizzy, it's just a separation.

315
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,208
And this is between your mother and me.

316
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,083
This isn't just about the two of you.

317
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,041
Diggy, Jinnie, me…

318
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,666
Think about us!

319
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,208
Actually, you don't care.

320
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,541
You do whatever you like.

321
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,166
It doesn't matter what a Maharaja wants,

322
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,500
we do…

323
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,791
what the people want.

324
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,000
The chandeliers are here,
but not the lights. Turn them on.

325
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,750
I said light. Not kite!

326
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,708
He wants to fly a kite. Yes.

327
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,000
You didn't get any of the 500 candles
Niki ma'am ordered. I'll get you waxed!

328
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,875
I asked you to move it
but it's still here--

329
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,041
-Calm down!
-I'll calm down, ma'am…

330
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,041
-Here…
-You're getting the flowers now?

331
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,375
The bulbs of the chandelier
are still off, guys! What are we gonna do?

332
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,208
Are you sure, Soph?

333
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,208
We won't make headlines
without the Dhondis.

334
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,041
Kunal, Aviraaj won't come
if the Dhondis are there.

335
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,291
If Aviraaj isn't there,
the royals won't come and…

336
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,958
Okay. Again.

337
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,958
It's tricky, but I'll do it.

338
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,958
-I'm sorry.
-For?

339
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,000
I know how hard you'd worked on it.

340
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,958
-You know what the real hard work is?
-What?

341
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,500
This.

342
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,333
Can you believe it, Kunal?

343
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,833
The royals don't want
to even dance with the likes of us.

344
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,416
It's like they're bloody
stuck in the 19th century.

345
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,625
You know,
the world of royals is fading away,

346
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,666
today entrepreneurs hold more power.

347
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,291
-True.
-It must hurt.

348
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,791
Did he say anything else?

349
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,208
No.

350
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,625
Kunal, I'm sorry about that message.

351
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,750
I'm sorry I didn't reply.

352
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,250
If I reply, will you?

353
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,458
If you do,

354
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,500
so will I.

355
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,458
If you do, so will I.

356
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,875
Unbelievable. We're dying out there,

357
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,916
and the two of you are busy romancing?

358
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,250
Zubin is coming, guys! Have you forgotten?

359
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,958
Romeo, Romeo, wherefore thou art, Romeo?

360
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,333
What are you doing?

361
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,458
I'm here looking for my Romeo.

362
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,583
Guess what? Fizzy thinks this is a date.

363
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,750
He's crazy.

364
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,541
Well, it is a date.

365
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,416
Yeah, I mean,
obviously it is a date, but like…

366
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,583
Like a friend date.

367
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,625
Like a date for friends,
not a date-date, you know.

368
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,291
Fuck.

369
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,625
She's always right.

370
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,666
What?

371
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,541
Look, Jinnie,
Romeo and Juliet were not friends.

372
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,666
And we can't be just friends either.

373
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:32,250
Actually, you know, you should go
to the ball with someone else.

374
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,583
No one has ever rejected me before this.

375
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,791
Unfortunately you don't even know
who is rejecting whom.

376
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,416
Nice dress.

377
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,541
Oh, God, you're such a robot.

378
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,000
Are you dressed for a funeral?

379
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm not letting you
go to the ball like this, bro.

380
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,000
Why? It's so nice.

381
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,291
-For whom?
-For me.

382
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,166
Looks like it.

383
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,875
I'll be your date.

384
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,291
For life.

385
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,250
-Greetings.
-Princess!

386
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,958
Princess! Turn back please.

387
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,958
Sir, right. Sir, this way please.

388
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:04,875
Hukum.

389
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,125
Greetings.

390
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,625
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sophia Shekhar and Kunal Mehta.

391
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,291
You look amazing.

392
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,958
I said you look amazing.

393
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,500
-Zubin?
-He's here.

394
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,666
And the Dhondis?

395
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,166
Of course not here, Soph. Relax.

396
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,458
You know we make a great team, right?

397
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,875
We do, don't we?

398
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,666
Hello.

399
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:55,875
Hello, there.

400
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,083
Today, Sophia reminded me of the night

401
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,708
when I met Indranath for the first time.

402
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,666
Our first dance.

403
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,958
And Motibagh was lit up just like this.

404
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,958
And I looked…

405
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,500
equally beautiful.

406
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,416
Maharaja of Morpur

407
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,250
and Rajmata Bhagyashri Ma Sahiba
are making their entrance.

408
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,166
Zubin, I'm glad you could make it.

409
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,916
-Looking lovely.
-Thank you.

410
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,583
-So are you.
-So are you.

411
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,583
I love this.

412
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,583
Well, 82% test audience results,

413
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,541
22% gross profit margin,

414
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,416
14% projected net profit

415
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,791
to The Royal B&B.

416
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:34,958
What do you think?

417
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:39,416
I think you converted the room disaster
into an opportunity in no time.

418
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,875
Congratulations for that.

419
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,250
But I think,

420
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:47,375
by only testing royal experiences,
we'll end up an event management company.

421
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,708
We're more than that. The Royal B&B
is nothing without the rooms.

422
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,208
I think your decision
about the Bharmars was a little impulsive.

423
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,791
Otherwise, you would've been
testing both today.

424
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,541
Nevermind.

425
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,041
Let's focus on the event for now.

426
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,250
We'll take this up tomorrow.

427
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,083
Have a good evening.

428
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,125
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

429
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,875
I will kill him, Kunal. I'll kill him.

430
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,041
We'll do it together.

431
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:17,500
The Nawab of Alsipur, Salauddin Khan
is making his entrance.

432
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,416
-Salad!
-Salad!

433
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,416
Hey, you look so hot!

434
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,916
-Oh, my God, you look amazing!
-Hi.

435
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,291
-Hello, ladies. Come on.
-What is this outfit!

436
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,250
-Salad.
-Hello.

437
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,583
How are you doing, man?

438
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,166
Good to meet you. How are you?

439
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,666
-Salad.
-The prodigal son returns.

440
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,958
-Welcome back.
-How are you?

441
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,375
How's Alsipur?
Still there or did you sell it?

442
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,708
Come to Alsipur and see it for yourself.

443
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,666
Why not? Please.

444
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:51,583
It's a joyous occasion

445
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,875
for our Maharaja is here

446
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,291
Before he takes off again

447
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,500
hide his passport elsewhere

448
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,583
Immaculate poetry as always, Salad.

449
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,083
You've always been our well-wisher.

450
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,291
But fret not, I'm back.
Now the world will come to Morpur.

451
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,208
Wow.

452
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:13,083
On that note, cheers to The Royal B&B.

453
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,041
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

454
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:26,125
The Prince of Morpur, Digvijay Singh
is making his entrance.

455
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,000
-Let's go?
-Yes, ma'am.

456
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,458
-All the best.
-Thank you.

457
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,000
Hello. Hi.

458
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,791
Good evening, Maji Sahiba,

459
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,125
HRH Maharaja Aviraaj,

460
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,458
Romeos and Juliets,

461
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,250
princes and princesses,

462
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,583
commoner ladies and gentlemen.

463
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:57,708
Tonight, we will try to blur the
difference between royals and commoners.

464
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:01,125
You'll find new friends and dance partners

465
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,791
and you must switch partners
with every new song.

466
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,208
Who knows which Romeo
will find which Juliet.

467
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:12,333
I would like to welcome our special guests
for The Royal B&B's…

468
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:13,583
Romeo and Juliet dance!

469
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,291
Excuse me.

470
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,291
Maji Sahiba and Maharaja Aviraaj,

471
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:20,708
may I please request you
to lead the first dance?

472
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:22,500
May I have this dance?

473
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:25,166
-Yes, of course.
-And joining you on the dance floor

474
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,708
are the founders of The Royal B&B,

475
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,458
Kunal Mehta and Sophia Shekhar!

476
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,291
You must dance well, Fizzy.

477
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,833
Don't go crazy on me.

478
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,083
I don't want to be embarrassed.

479
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,083
I've been dancing to all of your tunes
ever since I returned to Morpur.

480
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,500
That is true. Yes.

481
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:02,125
I'm not used to having
my partner eye another girl.

482
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:03,583
Apologies, Maji.

483
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,458
Eyes only for you from now.

484
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,000
Nawab Salauddin Khan.

485
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,208
But you can call me Salad,
if you like the dressing.

486
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,541
May I have…

487
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,791
The Princess of Morpur, Divyaranjini
is making her entrance.

488
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,500
Absolutely, Mr. Salad.

489
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:33,958
Dance with me.

490
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,666
Sorry, Miss, I'm not here to dance--

491
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,125
I'm the Princess of Morpur.

492
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,833
This is an order, not a request.

493
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:42,916
-Dance with me!
-Okay.

494
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,666
I like your feathers.

495
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,458
Naughty. Wanna pluck one?

496
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:55,125
I hope you're not facing any issues
working with The Royal B&B.

497
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,791
I wouldn't call it an issue,

498
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:02,958
but I think there was a communication gap
leading to some misunderstandings.

499
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:04,875
Okay.

500
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,791
Actually, she's great.

501
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:08,916
Really?

502
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,041
Let's get the caviar out
for plating please.

503
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,375
Hurry it up, guys. Move it!

504
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,416
Chef, why aren't you serving my dish?

505
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,791
Yours or your friend's?

506
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,375
Hurry it up!

507
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,333
Five chickens, come on, pick it up.

508
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,250
Okay, sir.

509
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:38,708
So, will you serve my dish or not?

510
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,041
No.

511
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,916
-Why?
-The paneer is getting cold, pick it up!

512
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,833
Yes, sir.

513
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,375
One more galouti, please.

514
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,291
Coming right up.

515
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,000
Can I become a chef?

516
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,250
No.

517
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,750
But you praised the dish
when you tasted it.

518
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,666
You're a prince.
You get praised all the time.

519
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:08,000
Prince, it's not easy to become a chef.

520
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,333
Yes, presentation is key,
but taste is paramount.

521
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:16,666
Precision, art, science.
Cooking is a combination of all this.

522
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:20,208
A chef's shortcomings
are pointed out repeatedly.

523
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,916
Overtime, he becomes worthy of the praise.

524
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,583
I'm sorry, I'm running behind,
but I wish you all the best.

525
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,583
Maharani Padmaja Devi
is making her entrance.

526
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,041
Lilypad!

527
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:40,541
What are you doing here?

528
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,291
I'm here to surprise you.

529
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:43,625
Good evening, Rani-sa.

530
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:44,791
Are you done?

531
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,916
-You may leave now.
-Greetings.

532
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,666
Promise me you'll come to Bombay.

533
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes, I will. Soon. Now leave.

534
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,166
This is so good.

535
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,083
Get a drink, huh?

536
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,416
It's time to find a new partner.

537
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
Our commoner ladies and gentlemen

538
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,833
may now look
for their princes and princesses.

539
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:05,250
-Go ahead.
-Guys.

540
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,750
We aren't playing statue, guys.

541
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,458
New Romeos and Juliets.

542
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:14,083
Commoners, princes.

543
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,041
Exchange partners.

544
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,708
-I'm getting stressed.
-It's fine. Calm down.

545
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,083
There's no need to be shy.

546
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,250
The music will start soon.

547
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:32,416
That's what I'm talking about!

548
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,375
Maharaja of Morpur, Aviraaj
is heading towards the dance floor

549
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,250
and it looks like he's gonna

550
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,833
dance with my boss.

551
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,166
-May I have this dance?
-She is talented,

552
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,750
gorgeous, fabulous, beautiful!

553
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,625
She's the Entrepreneur of the Year!

554
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,208
Let me tell you a story about her--

555
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,416
Sophia Shekhar!

556
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,416
Well, you've proved

557
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,708
that a commoner girl can do anything.

558
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,666
Commoner girl!

559
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:30,875
Well, you've also proved

560
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,791
that sometimes even a Maharaja
can do as he desires.

561
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:38,041
-Sometimes?
-Sometimes.

562
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,625
She's very lucky
to have a partner like you.

563
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:44,666
Sophia is hardworking,
but she's too impulsive.

564
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:48,500
You… you are sensible.

565
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,833
And that's what makes this work.

566
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,458
Once The Royal B&B is popular--

567
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,208
So, we're gonna be popular now?

568
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,541
What's going on, Jinnie?

569
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:24,041
I'm sorry.

570
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,000
I knew it.

571
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,500
She can't always be right.

572
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,208
Who?

573
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,583
Thank you for today.

574
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:22,583
Thank you for today.

575
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:26,916
Our special guest, the Princess of Dhondi,
Ayesha, is making her entrance.

576
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,125
Oh my God! Ayesha Dhondi is here.

577
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:32,791
Ayesha Dhondi!

578
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,416
Ayesha Dhondi?

579
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,583
Ayesha.

580
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:42,625
Was she invited?

581
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,541
I don't know how this happened.

582
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,875
I promise you, I had disinvited her.
I'm just…

583
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:51,250
Once Ayesha and Fizzy
get together, Rambha,

584
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,125
we won't have to…

585
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,791
mingle like that with these commoners.

586
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:00,166
Hukum.

587
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,625
Sir, I had canceled
Ayesha ma'am's RSVP myself.

588
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,333
Then what the hell is she doing here?

589
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:07,250
I don't know, sir. She might have
called the Maharaja directly.

590
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,666
It's tricky. Sometimes people
are friendly with their exes.

591
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,083
Wait a minute.

592
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,333
Is Ayesha Aviraaj's ex?

593
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:14,375
Yes, sir. I'm friends with my exes too.

594
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,416
They call me, "Where are you?"
"Who're you with?"

595
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,250
I'm like, "Relax. Kunal sir is my boss."

596
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,458
Just let me fix this, yeah?

597
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:20,375
What's gonna happen?

598
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,000
I knew she would show up.
I told you, right?

599
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,500
How can she just show up like this?

600
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,416
-Mr. Mehta.
-Yes?

601
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,208
She looks divine.

602
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,291
What's gonna happen?

603
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,000
May I have a word with you?

604
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,833
-Aviraaj, let me fix this.
-Don't touch me.

605
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,583
Is this how they say hello
in New York, Fizzy?

606
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:54,416
And now, to set the floor on fire,

607
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,416
we'll have a dance
by two beautiful, stunning royals!

608
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,583
Maharaja Aviraaj of Morpur,
and Princess Ayesha of Dhondi!

609
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,375
Wow!

610
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:20,416
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for!

611
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:25,416
The Royal B&B presents
the first exclusive look

612
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,458
of Princess Ayesha and Maharaja Aviraaj.

613
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:32,875
Are they going to be
the most beautiful couple of this world?

614
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:35,041
If they do, it'd be fabulous.

615
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,500
-For all of us.
-Stop it. Stop!

616
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,416
Who asked you to say all this?

617
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,291
Ma'am, Kunal sir asked me to.

618
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:30,833
What was that, Kunal?

619
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:32,958
Our headline.

620
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,166
-What's the problem?
-Kunal, I told you--

621
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,791
That Ayesha Dhondi
is Aviraaj's ex-girlfriend?

622
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,291
Yes, she is. So?

623
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,083
-So you knew?
-Yes, I did.

624
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:46,458
I'm so fucking stupid.

625
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:49,416
He told this to me in confidence--

626
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,333
I'm the co-founder
of this company, goddammit!

627
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,041
Shouldn't you have
taken me into confidence?

628
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,291
You are shouting, Kunal.

629
00:38:58,208 --> 00:38:59,708
I've told you everything.

630
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,041
-Really?
-What's the problem?

631
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:03,083
-Yes!
-What happened at the award event?

632
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,958
-What happened?
-That's what I'm asking you!

633
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,583
-I don't have time for this.
-Don't you fucking run away from this.

634
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,958
Tell me!

635
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:10,958
Fine!

636
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:14,416
I met him there
but I didn't know who he was!

637
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,291
Then I came here and he was here!

638
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,541
But it doesn't matter
because nothing happened, Kunal!

639
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,625
We are still dealing
with your "nothing happened"!

640
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:21,791
Don't you see it, Soph?

641
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,208
-What?
-Where's your fucking objectivity?

642
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:28,500
Don't you dare question my objectivity.

643
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,916
One Zubin is enough in my life
to question my decisions!

644
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,375
Are you fucking serious right now?

645
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,458
I've always stood by you,
even against him.

646
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,750
-So?
-But you know what?

647
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,666
You can't see anyone but yourself, Soph.

648
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,541
And I'm fucking done!
I can't handle it anymore!

649
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:45,708
You know what you can't handle?

650
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:49,750
You can't handle that it's our company,
but I get all the credit, Kunal!

651
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:59,833
I'm… I'm sorry, Kunal.

652
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:01,625
-Fuck you, Soph.
-I'm… Sorry.

653
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:02,750
Fuck you.

654
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,958
Kunal, I really didn't mean it…

655
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:49,500
How do you always find me?

656
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:53,708
I don't look for you,

657
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,416
I know you.

658
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:25,791
