1
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:10,791
Sophia!

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,250
What?

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,750
Aren't you curious to know,
why I'm not going back to New York?

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,000
Because you want to drive me
out of here, right?

5
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,416
Where were you?

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,083
I was…

7
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:29,583
Me too.

8
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,291
Greetings, Hukum.

9
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,041
You won't find time to relax today.

10
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,000
Why is everything wet?

11
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,500
Soph!

12
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,416
Soph!

13
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,458
What's this smell?

14
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,083
It's a shit-fest everywhere.

15
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,791
What?

16
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,541
The main sewage pipe burst.

17
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,625
It is said that God showers his blessings
by breaking through ceilings.

18
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,250
Why are we getting it
through a sewage pipe?!

19
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,000
Did he give us this wing on purpose?

20
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,500
What do we do about the launch now?

21
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,750
We need a plan B right now!

22
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,416
-Sir, your right or mine?
-Lower it a bit.

23
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,125
Sir, your right is my left.

24
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,041
Then?

25
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,833
-Good morning.
-Oh, hello.

26
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,500
-Let's begin.
-Excuse me?

27
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,416
Hukum, here's your
updated schedule for the day.

28
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,375
I gave you Maharaja Aviraaj's by mistake…

29
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:26,708
Apologies, Hukum,
Maharaja Aviraaj is also here, so…

30
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,166
So I only have grooming on my list.

31
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,333
A very good morning,
esteemed ladies and gentlemen.

32
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,291
You are all aware of the connection

33
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,583
between Morpur and polo, and it's history.

34
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,041
But I'd like to share
something personal today.

35
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,666
My father, your Maharaja,

36
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,791
used to tell me that the sport of polo
came from Manipur to Morpur

37
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,000
only because of his great grandfather.

38
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:55,125
But polo became a part of my life
because of Maharaj Yuvanath.

39
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,083
He loved this sport.

40
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:02,333
The inauguration of this historical club
and its young champions

41
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,958
would've made him very proud today.

42
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,291
I extend my gratitude

43
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,333
to Morpur Sports Council
and the Honorable Chief Minister.

44
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,666
I'm glorifying the person
who maligned our family name.

45
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,041
That man happens to be your father, Fizzy.

46
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,833
-Pick your words carefully.
-Greetings.

47
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,625
Well, Dad's dear Maurice
has picked our pockets already.

48
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,583
-Pankaj-sa.
-Hukum?

49
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,916
Has the rent been paid
for my New York apartment?

50
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,125
Hukum, it's a huge amount.

51
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,958
You know that we are…

52
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,416
Why did you stop yourself?
Say what you were gonna say.

53
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,750
We are penniless.
Absolutely broke. Isn't it?

54
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,166
Yes, but the good news is,

55
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,375
after The Royal B&B's media announcement,
we'll get a handsome cheque.

56
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,708
We just need to wrap up
your photoshoot today.

57
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,125
-Photoshoot, today?
-Yes.

58
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,875
How much work are you going
to make me do in a day?

59
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,458
I couldn't go to London,
let me watch the Wimbledon on TV at least.

60
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,333
Watch the highlights later, Fizzy.

61
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,583
Or we might soon
not have cable and Wi-Fi too.

62
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,791
Why not have Diggy do the photoshoot?
He's, kind of, handsome too.

63
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,000
But he's not, kind of, a Maharaja.

64
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,083
That's you.

65
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,125
Not yet.

66
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,333
He's right, Pankaj.

67
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,833
-We shouldn't delay his coronation--
-All right, fine. I'll do it.

68
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,208
But you must do something for me too.

69
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,291
Couldn't Fizzy have asked me
to do something else?

70
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,250
He was a Bollywood superstar, Hukum.

71
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,750
There was a time when he ruled
the hearts and the box office.

72
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,791
Girls still drool over him.

73
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,458
And you'll be paid handsomely
for his film's shoot here, Hukum.

74
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,708
Welcome.

75
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,375
Rani Sahiba!

76
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,125
Rambha. Rani Sahiba…

77
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,583
Rani-sa.

78
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,208
The name is Shroff, Ranjit Shroff.

79
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,666
This would be the perfect mansion
to shoot my next blockbuster.

80
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,166
Mansion?

81
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,916
I think you mean, palace.

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,208
Right, palace.

83
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:19,125
By allowing us to shoot in your palace,

84
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,875
you've turned me into your slave,
Rani Sahiba.

85
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,416
Tea.

86
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,750
So, what kind of film are you making?

87
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,875
Is it a classic?

88
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,208
Like Mughal-E-Azam?

89
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,291
Well, you don't really know
much about me, do you?

90
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,500
I do.

91
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,958
We're royals for namesake.

92
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,875
You're the real king.

93
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,625
King of hearts.

94
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,833
Shristi, you're up first.

95
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,750
You will be the first one to taste
the dish in this round of Gastronautics.

96
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,750
I never imagined that

97
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,791
identifying flavors in-depth
can be so difficult.

98
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:21,375
Always remember that with tasting,
smell is one of our most powerful senses.

99
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,375
As soon as I smelled it,

100
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,500
I realized that it has tomatoes.

101
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,875
It smells of fresh…

102
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,000
All right, next shot! Chair out.

103
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,083
Sometimes you want it in,
sometimes out. I'm on it, sir.

104
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,000
Look in front.

105
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,166
Guys, please closer.

106
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,833
Yeah.

107
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,166
Did you hear?

108
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,333
If I come any closer,
it'll be a little strange.

109
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,250
Lovely.

110
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,458
I was talking
about the Guest Wing, Aviraaj.

111
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,250
The sewage pipe burst.

112
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,291
I'm not a plumber.

113
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,916
Maharaja ji, we need a wing
before the new launch.

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,166
So, if you could help--

115
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,291
Ms. Shekhar, I'm actually trying
to focus on this exercise.

116
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,833
I suggest you do the same.

117
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,875
Please look over here. Here.

118
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,750
Soph, look in front. The camera is here.

119
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,125
You may schedule an appointment
with my ADC, if you like.

120
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,875
Ms. Shekhar, can you put your arm
around His Highness? Or Mr. Mehta?

121
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,583
Soph.

122
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,500
You smudged your lipstick.

123
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,750
Yeah.

124
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,541
I don't like this shirt. It's not me.

125
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,125
Excuse me.
Nothing no one's never seen before.

126
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,333
-Niki.
-Yeah, Soph?

127
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,291
Touch-up.

128
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,083
He was leaving, Niki.

129
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,541
It was all going well,
but then he jammed the brakes on it.

130
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,666
And I did this too.

131
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,375
-Bro!
-I know.

132
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,500
Listen, getting under someone
to get over someone

133
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,541
is the oldest trick in the book.

134
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,750
But when that someone is your best friend,

135
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,041
business partner, and ex…

136
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,333
What're you doing, Soph?

137
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,916
I don't know, Niki. I don't know!

138
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,666
And then? What happened next?

139
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,166
He left me on read.

140
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,333
Stop it.

141
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:39,125
So, one of them replies rudely
and other one doesn't reply at all.

142
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,583
I guess neither of the two
are interested in you.

143
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,666
Perfect!

144
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,125
We need the perfect shot
for The Royal B&B PR.

145
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,458
Yes, ma'am.
But she looks angry in this one.

146
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,666
Next.

147
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:56,958
How about this?

148
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,375
-Shit, Keertana, change. Change. Next.
-Yes, ma'am.

149
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,625
Next.

150
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,041
Okay, next.

151
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,458
-That's the one!
-That's the one!

152
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,750
In sync!

153
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,500
Aviraaj, that reminds me,
we still need to discuss the Guest Wing--

154
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,166
Greetings, Hukum.
It's time for your next meeting.

155
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,250
-Why don't you talk to my ADC--
-Appointment. Yeah.

156
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,500
Excuse me.

157
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,500
Excuse me.

158
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,791
-Pankaj-sa.
-Yes?

159
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,041
-Ensure we get the cheque from them today.
-Hukum.

160
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,750
Rani Sahiba, some king has sent these.

161
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,791
-King?
-King of hearts.

162
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,708
Jinnie!

163
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,666
"The taste of the tea we shared
lingers on."

164
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,208
"I desire to meet you again."

165
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,500
"Please tell me you will?"

166
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,541
"Your ardent admirer, the King of Hearts."
Who is this?

167
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,875
Ranjit Shroff.
He's shooting here at the palace.

168
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,958
So what does the King of Hearts
want to meet you and do this time?

169
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,416
Is this the way to talk to your mother?

170
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Is this the way to talk to the Maharani?

171
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,166
When it comes to Maharani Padmaja,
even the Maharajas forget their manners.

172
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,500
And he's merely a box office king.

173
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,666
He's had a lot of affairs.

174
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,125
Sorry, Mom,
his girlfriends are never over 25.

175
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,333
So?

176
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,083
What's the problem in that?

177
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,416
Nothing.

178
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,791
Hukum, you're quite something.

179
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,791
It won't be easy to get these fittings.

180
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,708
They're all antique.

181
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,625
Plus, this damage.

182
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,625
It's gonna cost a bomb, Soph.

183
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:48,416
And there's water dripping everywhere.

184
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,916
You should know, Soph.

185
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,583
You woke up wet.

186
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,791
Why isn't he giving us a new wing, Kunal?

187
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,250
What is his problem? Just go talk to him.

188
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,500
Don't worry, Soph.
Aviraaj will discuss this tomorrow.

189
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,416
We have a game.

190
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Yes, as far as he's not gaming us.

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,458
Tell me something, Soph.

192
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,208
Why are you annoyed with Aviraaj?

193
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,833
What? No, I'm not.

194
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,125
-Really?
-Really.

195
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,916
Yeah, Soph, tell us.

196
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,958
Did he do something?

197
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,500
He was great on the shoot too. Right?

198
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,875
One second. Are you kidding?

199
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,291
"I don't like this shirt. It's not me."

200
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, he's a Maharaja. He can do that.

201
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,000
Please, Kunal.

202
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,708
And the camera loves him.

203
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,625
Ma'am, Kunal sir is right.
He's got some serious rizz.

204
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,208
So, Aviraaj, about the wing…

205
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,750
So, Ms. Shekhar makes you
do the dirty work, right?

206
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,125
No. We're partners.
We share the responsibilities.

207
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,625
Doesn't it get complicated?

208
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,833
Complicated? Why?

209
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,125
-I mean…
-Oh, you mean… No, no.

210
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,916
We're not dating anymore.

211
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,083
We used to, but not anymore.

212
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,541
Oh, my apologies. I just assumed…

213
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,750
That's fine.

214
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,083
About that wing…

215
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,291
Why don't you use
Maharaja Yuvanath's chamber?

216
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,291
-Are you sure?
-It's mine.

217
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,250
Yeah.

218
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,000
We weren't even allowed to see it.

219
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,541
Well, you're allowed to now.

220
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,500
Maharaja Yuvanath doesn't mind
and neither do we.

221
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,708
Thank you, Aviraaj. This is huge.

222
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,875
Game point, huh?

223
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,083
-Girdhari-sa!
-Hukum.

224
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,583
Please arrange a tour
of Maharaj Yuvanath's chamber for them.

225
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,125
Set?

226
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:36,916
Yeah.

227
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,625
-Game.
-Hukum.

228
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,625
Welcome.

229
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,541
Being the youngest of the family,
with no say in these matters,

230
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:51,625
allow me to welcome you
to my father's grand chambers.

231
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,541
Photos.

232
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,666
Kunal sir, her photos or the palace's?

233
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,000
Shut up, Keertana.

234
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,666
This is the only room
where Dad welcomed his friends.

235
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,958
For meetings and parties.

236
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,208
And feasts. I mean…

237
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,875
Dad used to throw unforgettable parties.

238
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:18,083
Whenever we met Dad's friends,
we felt like life is a fairytale.

239
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,541
It's colorful, and it's fascinating.

240
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,250
Right, Girdhari-sa?

241
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,583
Hukum.

242
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:32,750
Thanks, Jinnie.
I know it's not easy for you, but…

243
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,000
Of course. Thank you.

244
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,625
Our Fizzy was mad about polo.

245
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,291
He was the national champion.

246
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,958
And Dad loved watching him play.

247
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,875
He assumed we're dating each other.

248
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,625
He assumed we're dating each other.

249
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,875
-Who?
-Aviraaj.

250
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,750
Why was he asking about us?

251
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,375
-Of course!
-God knows.

252
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,458
I said yes.

253
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,208
Look at your face.

254
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,958
I think the real artist was Dad.

255
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,625
I mean, just look at this room.

256
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,833
This 350-year-old hand-painted fresco,

257
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,666
and fluted glass from Belgium…

258
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,625
-From Belgium?
-This is from Burma.

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,958
This is incredible, Jinnie.

260
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:32,500
Honestly, it's…
It's all we ever wanted. It's…

261
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,583
so special.

262
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,916
But I can't believe
Fizzy is giving this room to you.

263
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,500
Just promise me
that you won't change it a lot.

264
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,541
I promise.

265
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,875
We'll do everything with utmost love.

266
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,791
Thank you.

267
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,333
Ma'am, ma'am.

268
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:06,916
Ma'am, don't go there.

269
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,166
Hukum.

270
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,208
Are you okay?

271
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,583
-I'm okay.
-Sophia ma'am is okay.

272
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,875
Bro, these Yuvanath wing repairs…
Do we need to rework the budget?

273
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,625
Yes, but Zubin won't increase the budget.

274
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,750
Not the budget,
we'll have to rework our plans.

275
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,500
I need to go for a run, guys.
I need to clear my head.

276
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,708
Shit.

277
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,500
-What is his name?
-Prince.

278
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,791
Aren't the two princes
in the palace enough

279
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,458
that you have one here as well?

280
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,250
Maharaja Yuvanath loved horses.

281
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,833
So does the new Maharaja.

282
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,458
All right, but does he help you out here?

283
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,833
See it for yourself.

284
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,416
Is she…

285
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,750
Yeah.

286
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,083
Our Rani is going to be a mother soon.

287
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,291
Can I help?

288
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,541
Okay.

289
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,791
Rafiq Chacha, the vet will be here soon.

290
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,083
Yes, Hukum.

291
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,000
-More?
-That's all you can grab.

292
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,291
-Sophia.
-Yeah?

293
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,250
It's gonna take some more time.

294
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,583
And it's still raining. So, come, sit.

295
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,375
Better?

296
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:50,875
Yeah.

297
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,291
You're shivering.

298
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,708
I know.

299
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,875
Sophia, I haven't been
to Maharaja Yuvanath's wing for years.

300
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,458
So, I had no idea what condition it is in.

301
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,083
I know.

302
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,375
-Sir, have you tried Cosmopolitan?
-Guys!

303
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,875
-Guys, guys!
-Feel it, sir.

304
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,958
Guys! Polo with The Prince!

305
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,083
That's it! That's the idea.

306
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,041
Slow down. What are you saying?

307
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,958
Let me explain.
We only have five months to go, right?

308
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,416
As per our pilot launch schedule,
our next step should've been…

309
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,541
Accommodations, ma'am. Rooms.

310
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,041
Exactly. B&B of The Royal B&B.

311
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,250
But there's sewage dripping
in the Guest Wing.

312
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:35,083
And our second option, Maharaja Yuvanath's
chamber has damaged walls.

313
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,291
This means, we need more money, more time,
which equals to more delays.

314
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,750
So, we'll have to change the launch date.

315
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,291
-So we're screwed.
-No, we aren't, Kunal.

316
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,041
Why should we waste our time?

317
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,375
Why not pull up our next phase?

318
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:51,083
Let's start testing
our royal experiences, our USP.

319
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,750
And I also think, guys,

320
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,333
that Polo With The Prince
will be a brilliant PR move

321
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,875
The Royal B&B's goal
is to bring royal experiences to people.

322
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,833
And Polo with The Prince is exactly that!

323
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,125
And you know what? He's great with horses.

324
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:09,583
But will he agree?

325
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:13,375
Aviraaj, if we want Sophia to give us
the money, you'll have to play.

326
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,916
No. Absolutely not.

327
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,666
And there's zero chance, so stop trying.

328
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,791
Why? Isn't Morpur's favorite Maharaja

329
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,250
going to shoulder
Morpur's responsibilities?

330
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,208
You've turned this Maharaja
into a royal puppet.

331
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,416
You make me dance to your tune.

332
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:37,083
Who are you trying to punish
by giving up polo, Fizzy?

333
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,875
Yourself? Or him?

334
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,791
These grapes had a purpose.
They were a sommelier's dream.

335
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:59,041
-Yes, Hukum.
-That's what they were born for.

336
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,000
These are the best grapes.

337
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:03,875
Yes, Hukum.

338
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,375
The best.

339
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,208
Amazing.

340
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,875
But if no one had seen their potential…

341
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:16,916
what good would they have been?

342
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,416
Yes, Hukum.

343
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,083
What good would they have been?

344
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,166
They'd be wasted. Rotting away.

345
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,833
As shriveled up raisins.

346
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,625
It's just a game.

347
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,291
No chance.

348
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:53,333
I'd promised myself
that Dad will never see me play again.

349
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,625
He won't see it.
Neither your game nor your anger.

350
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,875
Dad's no more, Fizzy.

351
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,458
It's not just about him, Jinnie.

352
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,625
No matter what I do for this palace,
it's never enough.

353
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,916
I have a life of my own.

354
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
At least you get to do something.

355
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,333
Look at me.

356
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,250
Everyone thinks I'm worthless.

357
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,083
Why?

358
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,500
-Jinnie.
-Yeah?

359
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,000
You're a genius.

360
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,625
You're… welcome.

361
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,666
In fact…

362
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,125
you're a Jinnie-us.

363
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,833
Okay. Thank you.

364
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,916
I have great news, team.

365
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,750
Aviraaj has agreed to play.
Okay, we need to get to work.

366
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:56,166
We'll give some lucky winners a chance
to play polo with the Maharaja.

367
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:01,250
While our special guests, their families,
and commoners of Morpur

368
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,916
enjoy their first taste
of royal experiences at The Royal B&B,

369
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,041
our focus will be
the online publicity of The Royal B&B.

370
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:10,666
We can't screw it up.

371
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,333
This is the best chance
to convert the rooms disaster into a win.

372
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:17,125
Polo with The Prince, here we come!

373
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,291
These look fantastic, Niki. Great job.

374
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,291
Thanks, Kunal.

375
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,708
Soph, it's too good.

376
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,541
Finally, something is going right.

377
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,791
If anyone can handle a crisis well
it's either you or Thalaiva.

378
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm smart as a tack.

379
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,541
-What?
-I know I'm the best.

380
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,625
I agree.

381
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,375
Ma'am, your Tamil is getting better.

382
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,708
Kunal, I messaged you the other night.

383
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:44,500
Guys.

384
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,125
Guys, have you seen this?

385
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,958
The on-ground team has just sent this.

386
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,875
What!

387
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,916
Not just The Royal B&B customers,

388
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,125
we are unable to even fit in the locals.

389
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,500
So many people?

390
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,666
Our Maharaja is playing polo
after a long time.

391
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,041
Hello, everyone.

392
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,458
Welcome to Polo with The Prince,

393
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,958
the very first royal experience
at The Royal B&B.

394
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:21,250
We received about 500 applications.

395
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,958
But you are the lucky draw winners,
so congratulations.

396
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:25,916
Congratulations.

397
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,208
-Limited edition caps.
-Thanks.

398
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,916
Please be careful. No cap.

399
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,916
-I want to play on Prince Aviraaj's team.
-So do I.

400
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,625
-So do I.
-Sir, you are already on his team.

401
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:38,625
-How much for a selfie?
-Seven-fifty rupees--

402
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,375
I'm sure he'll do it for free.

403
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,500
Where is Aviraaj?

404
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,375
He should've been here half an hour ago.

405
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,333
-I don't know, ma'am…
-Maybe call his ADC?

406
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,708
Yes, ma'am. Yes!

407
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,583
Have a great time…

408
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:52,208
-Ma'am, ADC--
-Figure it out, Keertana.

409
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,416
Yes, ma'am. Of course.

410
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,208
-Sir, just one--
-Sir!

411
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,083
Filter. Filter, please.

412
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,666
-Sir, please sign.
-Yes, of course.

413
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,666
-Thank you.
-Side, please.

414
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,000
My queen.

415
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:26,416
Maji-sa.

416
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,916
Jinnie.

417
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:38,500
I see you've gotten back
on the saddle, Paddy.

418
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,458
Bhabhi-sa.

419
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,125
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

420
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,833
-Where the fuck is he?
-I have no idea.

421
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,791
Welcome to The Royal B&B
Polo with The Prince

422
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,083
Sudden Death Charity Event.

423
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,333
This sport is being played
after many years

424
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:57,416
on the historic Motibagh polo ground.

425
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,625
With thundering applause,
please welcome the prince of Morpur,

426
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:05,166
national polo champion,
and your next Maharaja,

427
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,500
His Royal Highness
Aviraaj Singh of Morpur.

428
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:09,416
Fizzy!

429
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,083
What the actual fuck!

430
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:42,791
Jinnie-us,

431
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,291
now you're not the only
worthless one in the family.

432
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,416
Love you, Mom.

433
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,916
To win this game,

434
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,916
only one goal needs
to be scored in four rounds.

435
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,916
And whichever team scores the first goal,
will take home this grand trophy.

436
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:07,208
Let the game begin.

437
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,166
All the best!

438
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,583
And with the kick-off,
the guest team has taken the ball.

439
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:18,666
But what is HH Aviraaj waiting for?

440
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,166
The guest team is moving
towards the goal post swiftly.

441
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,041
Will HH try to stop them?

442
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,166
Well, HH on a final gallop.

443
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,791
Finally overtaking
Rakesh of the guest team.

444
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:31,791
Go, Aviraaj sir!

445
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,041
He's making his way
swiftly towards the goal.

446
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,416
All he needs is a single shot.

447
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,875
-What has HH done?
-Goal!

448
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,833
He hit the ball towards the audience
instead of the goal post.

449
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:51,250
What? Why didn't he score a goal?

450
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,916
-What is he doing?
-I don't know, Soph.

451
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,875
At the end of round one, the score is 0-0.

452
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,875
Round 2, the score is still at 0-0.

453
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:08,875
He's drunk. He's drunk.
That's why he can't score.

454
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,708
But the players are losing interest
in this round

455
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:17,125
because HH has absolutely no interest.

456
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,000
That's not right, right?

457
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:22,000
Soph, The Royal B&B customers
are getting irritated. What's going on?

458
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,750
No, where are you going?

459
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,583
Soph, what will do
if this polo event also fails?

460
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,666
Ma'am, people are leaving.

461
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,166
God… Stop them, Keertana.

462
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,500
-Please come back.
-It's gonna get interesting now. Please.

463
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:39,875
Aviraaj, what do you think you're doing?

464
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:45,333
Is everything a joke to you? Is there
anything that you value? Anything?

465
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,125
We're at the fag end of round two.

466
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:52,250
Neither of the teams have scored yet,
nor is anyone interested in scoring.

467
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,125
He looks sleepy, ma'am.

468
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,458
What are we gonna do?

469
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,875
This is ridiculous, ma'am.

470
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,583
This one is prancing around on a horse,

471
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,500
and the other one
is tucking away Happy Meals.

472
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:03,750
What kind of royals are they?

473
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:06,000
-Please take a seat.
-Please stay.

474
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:09,958
You are amazing, Keertana.
You are amazing!

475
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,583
…after that second pass.

476
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:13,625
Thank you, ma'am.

477
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:23,458
Digvijay, I know
this is really last moment,

478
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,958
but can you please come right away
for a game of polo?

479
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,958
Polo?

480
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,083
-Me?
-Yeah.

481
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,916
-Now?
-Yes, please.

482
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:39,125
The game has been scrappy so far.

483
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,833
People are leaving the ground.

484
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,625
Very good, sir. Very good.

485
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:45,375
You're are acing this commentary. Wow.
Superb! What a great act.

486
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:46,958
May I speak for a minute?

487
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,583
Thank you so much. So nice.

488
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,166
Everybody, are you leaving?

489
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,208
But the match is only about to begin

490
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,208
because the second prince,
Digvijay Singh, is joining us.

491
00:32:55,958 --> 00:33:00,208
In a crafty move,
Sophia ma'am played her trump card

492
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:01,750
by including Digvijay in HH's team.

493
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:04,500
Wow, ma'am, crazy! All hail Sophia ma'am!

494
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,875
Respect, Digvijay sir.
Respect, Sophia ma'am!

495
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:12,166
That's right, ma'am.

496
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:18,041
Crazy! Oh my God!
I've never been to a polo game.

497
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,500
This is the first time!

498
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,833
So, please say it out for me.

499
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,416
Shout out loud, "Prince with Polo!"

500
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,250
Scream out loud, "Prince with Polo!"

501
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,458
Thanks to Sophia ma'am,
Round 3 starts with a bang!

502
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:32,041
And for your information,
Diggy sir's horse's name is Josh.

503
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,541
Prince Digvijay has owned the polo ball
like no guy has ever owned me.

504
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:46,250
And look at this!
HH Aviraaj is back in the game!

505
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,750
Like a tiger riding a horse,

506
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,333
with his brother on the team,

507
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:53,541
it looks like he has found
new interest in the game!

508
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,750
Polo audience, do you know
what's my favorite rom-com?

509
00:33:57,833 --> 00:34:00,916
I'll tell you. The one unfolding
before us, this bromance!

510
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,291
Between HH Aviraaj
and his brother Prince Digvijay Singh.

511
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:08,583
This bromantic pair is fabulous!

512
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:13,333
And it seems impossible to beat them.

513
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,208
The kind of synchronization
they have on today, is rarely witnessed.

514
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,250
After Sachin and Sourav,
this is the best partnership I've seen.

515
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:25,916
Prince Digvijay is tackling the guest team
to make way for his brother

516
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,125
like women can never in a local train.

517
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,000
HH Aviraaj is…

518
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:33,083
He's racing towards the goal post.

519
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:36,166
And…

520
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,125
It's a sixer! Goal!

521
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,000
-Goal!
-Polo goal!

522
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,916
Fizzy!

523
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,833
Yeah!

524
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:50,208
This match seemed
lackluster in the beginning,

525
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:53,458
but Sophia ma'am turned it
into an exciting bromantic adventure.

526
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,875
Thank you, Sophia ma'am.
On behalf of you and me, thank you.

527
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:00,291
Say it after me!
Shout out loud, "Prince with Polo!"

528
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,416
Scream out loud, "Prince with Polo!"

529
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,916
Shout out loud, "Prince with Polo!"

530
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,583
Scream out loud, "Prince with Polo!"

531
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,541
Yeah, yeah…

532
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,166
Tears of joy?

533
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,833
-He's playing again.
-Yes!

534
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:53,208
All hail Maharaj Aviraaj!

535
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:56,125
All hail Maharaj Aviraaj!

536
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:59,333
All hail Maharaj Aviraaj!

537
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:01,916
All hail Maharaj Aviraaj!

538
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,750
All hail Maharaj Aviraaj!

539
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,208
Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much.

540
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:32,958
Appreciate it.

541
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,666
I'll call you back. Yeah.

542
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,166
Learn a few things, Ms. Shekhar.

543
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,083
Your win? That was sheer luck.

544
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:42,458
Like you defeating Coffee
on the beach was sheer luck.

545
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,375
You won't let me live in peace?!

546
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,541
Can you believe this guy?

547
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,083
All he cares about is himself.

548
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,375
I hope it won't cost us.

549
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:21,916
Next.

550
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,208
-Dilip.
-Yeah.

551
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:27,375
Thank you.

552
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,333
What else is left for me, Girdhari-sa?

553
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:41,541
If Morpur and Motibagh belong to him,
then I have the right to live my life too.

554
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:21,541
Fizzy, you can quit on me,
but not the game.

555
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:24,750
I have to.

556
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,375
For me, you and polo are one and the same.

557
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:36,791
Don't let anger
take away your joy and love, son.

558
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:55,083
Yes, Pankaj-sa.

559
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,958
Greetings, Hukum. We received
the cheque from The Royal B&B.

560
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,166
Shall I pay
your New York apartment's rent?

561
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,625
Let's clear Mom's credit card bills first.

562
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:06,958
Yes, Hukum.

563
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,250
There are plenty of hotels in New York.

564
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:11,916
As you wish, Hukum.

565
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,000
-Thank you.
-Hukum.

566
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,791
What do we do about them?

567
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:16,250
Because you're interested in art.

568
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,833
And this artist was your Dad's favorite.

569
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:31,416
Okay, then…

570
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,666
you're stuck.

571
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,916
From today, you're my…

572
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,083
best friend.

573
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:38,500
ZUBIN DARUVALA
FIRST THE ROOMS DISASTER.

574
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:40,708
NOW ONLY THE PRINCE HAS GONE VIRAL
IN THE POLO EVENT.

575
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,375
