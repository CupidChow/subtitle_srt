1
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,083
It's not personal, Sophia.

2
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,250
You had a problem with me, Zubin,

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,208
but you evicted the Morpur family
from their home.

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,916
Of course it's personal.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,500
And you found loopholes in that as well.

6
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:21,250
Using force majeure to get
a 45-day extension from the bank…

7
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,666
That's neat.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,166
But your new plan of a fashion show
fundraiser is not enough.

9
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,041
Neither for Motibagh,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
nor for you.

11
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:35,875
Maybe.

12
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,041
But I won't back down, Zubin.

13
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:44,041
I'll raise 370 crores, come what may.

14
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,125
You just said, it's not personal.

15
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,666
If it's not personal,

16
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,208
come to the fundraiser.

17
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,208
And let's see, who really rules the world.

18
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,458
Maji-sa Hukum, it's me, Pankaj.
Are you okay?

19
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,625
Who is it? Yes, I'm fine.

20
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,291
Is everyone back?

21
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,250
Yes, Hukum, they'll be here soon.

22
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,333
We have to prepare
for the fashion show fundraiser.

23
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,875
Fashion show?

24
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,208
During the restoration,
I tried my best, Aviraaj,

25
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,416
to preserve your Dad's memories for you.

26
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,083
Like it?

27
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,291
How did you do this?

28
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,708
You've got something here…

29
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,958
-Not allowed.
-This isn't allowed either?

30
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,000
These count as manners.

31
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,333
-Right?
-Cute.

32
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,625
Not allowed.

33
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,541
Fair. Rules are rules.

34
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,458
So, no "cute,"

35
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,916
no "aww," nothing.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,125
What about hugs?

37
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,208
Hugs are like handshakes.

38
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,583
No.

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,375
It's just until the fundraiser, Aviraaj.

40
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,416
Yeah, yeah. We have to focus.

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,375
Exactly.

42
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,333
Because a palace without a Maharaja
and a company without a CEO…

43
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,541
would be weird, right?

44
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,833
So…

45
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,500
no hugs.

46
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,250
-No hugs.
-No kisses?

47
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,125
-No kisses.
-No kisses.

48
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,875
Then we shouldn't meet alone.

49
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,208
I don't trust myself.

50
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,958
No!

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,875
Rules.

53
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,375
Rules.

54
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,708
Hukum, Sophia ma'am, problem.

55
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,708
So we'll have to cancel the fundraiser?

56
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,791
I had asked Aviraaj not to cancel
the contract. But no one listens to me!

57
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,916
I'm feeling light-headed.
Get me a glass of water, please!

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,750
-Sure, Rani-sa.
-And whiskey!

59
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,708
-What happened? What's wrong?
-What's happening?

60
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,583
Ma'am, we'll have to disinvite the guests.

61
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,125
Based on the wrongful termination
of the higher management,

62
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,041
we implemented force majeure,

63
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,666
but Zubin's sent us a new notice now.

64
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,333
You can't use The Royal B&B's name now,

65
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,041
and because of non-compete clause

66
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:43,500
you can't launch a new venture
of this nature for one year either.

67
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,208
Sell everything I have. I don't need it.

68
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,791
You won't sell anything.

69
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:54,166
We have The Sukoon Mansion.
Let's sell that.

70
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,958
You are forgetting about Sheet Mahal.
We have that as well.

71
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,750
Diggy, you are forgetting
that Sheet Mahal is mine.

72
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,208
So? Is this the time to make claims?

73
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,541
We are in trouble.
Jinnie, we're all drowning.

74
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,375
-Fine, if you're so worried…
-Hey, guys.

75
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,291
-Jinnie.
-…sell your Shikaar Fort.

76
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,000
-No, I won't. You know--
-Calm down.

77
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,291
-One sec.
-Why can't you do it?

78
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,666
-Not now.
-One second.

79
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,583
You stay out of it.

80
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,166
-Why sell it?
-This is not the time!

81
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,458
-My head!
-Okay! Calm down, everyone.

82
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,041
They can't stop the fundraiser.

83
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:26,541
Okay? Zubin is trying to scare us
and I won't fall for it.

84
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,791
It's all okay.
The fundraiser will go as planned.

85
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,958
Everything is under control.
I just need all of you to trust me.

86
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,500
-Yeah?
-Fine.

87
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,416
It's all good.

88
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,458
-Fine.
-Fine.

89
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,458
Happy now, Diggy? Stupid!

90
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,625
I'll fucking kill him!

91
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,083
-Soph.
-Yeah?

92
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,458
Are you okay?

93
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,541
I knew Zubin will send this notice,
I just didn't expect him…

94
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,166
to send it so soon.

95
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,125
What happens to your company?

96
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,708
If the fundraiser is a success,

97
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,125
then maybe…

98
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,791
I'll get my company back.

99
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,291
"If"? What if it isn't?

100
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,166
We'll handle it then.

101
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,875
No, I mean, what happens to us?

102
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,458
We won't let that happen, right?

103
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,541
Never.

104
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,666
And, also, have you seen us?

105
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,166
Zubin has no idea who he's messing with.

106
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,625
Force majeure.

107
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,250
You're so hot when you talk like that.

108
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,625
Rules.

109
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,625
Why don't we continue working together
after this?

110
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,375
I'll remove the termination clause
from the contract,

111
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,500
then you can never get rid of me.

112
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,500
Maybe not?

113
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,125
We have a lot of work. Come on.

114
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,125
We have a fundraiser to plan, Maharaja ji.

115
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,708
Guys, if we fail to pay back Zubin
within the next 45 days…

116
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,291
we might lose Motibagh forever.

117
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,875
And my company as well.

118
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,500
But, thankfully, you are ready to auction

119
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,291
the heirloom pieces
you inherited over generations,

120
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,416
which is gonna be very helpful.

121
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,750
This fundraiser is our only hope.

122
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,250
But we will do it.

123
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,791
Maurice, this trust fund is our only hope.

124
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:37,208
You know very well that this money
rightfully belongs to my children.

125
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,083
I'm just respecting Pickle's wishes.

126
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,541
That trust fund was set up
for Aviraaj, Digvijay and Divyaranjini.

127
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,708
I thought you're here for the book.

128
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,750
Which book?

129
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,125
My memoir.

130
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,375
I wrote a book on Pickles' and my life.

131
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,208
Who gave you the permission?

132
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,958
As I said, I'm doing this for him.

133
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:34,416
You are doing this because you weren't
allowed to meet him in his final days.

134
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,208
Listen, Padmaja,

135
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,666
before we say something to each other

136
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,708
that we may regret later,

137
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,333
I suggest you leave.

138
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,416
Do not write a word about my children.

139
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,958
That's right, that's right!

140
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,750
Greetings, Hukum. Mr. Mehta is here.

141
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:19,791
What?

142
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,875
He is waiting over there.

143
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,416
Your Highness, my name is Adi Mehta.

144
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,333
I'm a historian. Thanks for your time.

145
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,958
I'm sorry, I can't do this today. I'm…

146
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,583
-Sorry.
-How about tomorrow?

147
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,000
Tomorrow…

148
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,333
I understand your hesitation.

149
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,125
You feel Indian royalty
doesn't get the respect they deserve.

150
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,166
And then suddenly people think of us

151
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,208
when they want us
to become the face of royalty

152
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,750
for magazines, books, and tourism.

153
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,166
That's where I want
to make the difference.

154
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,041
I want everyone to look up to you.

155
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,500
The book I'm writing
is based on the Maharajas

156
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,166
who adopted their heirs.

157
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,041
Just like your grandfather.

158
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,791
You won't be named in the book.

159
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,208
Then what will it be?

160
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,041
Maharaja Maurice.

161
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,791
Maharaja Maurice.

162
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,500
I like it.

163
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,333
I like the name.

164
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,083
He has written a book on the two of them.

165
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,333
What?

166
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,208
It won't be easy,

167
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,416
but it's time to tell them
the truth, Paddy.

168
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,541
You have to do it.

169
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,916
Okay.

170
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,041
Pankaj-sa, if I give you
a three-piece suit

171
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,166
with just a tie and no suit,
what would you do?

172
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,541
Where are the walls of this Shit Mahal?

173
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,041
Bai-sa, it's Sheet Mahal.

174
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,083
And I don't know much about it
because no one ever goes there.

175
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,416
And I downloaded these pictures
from Google, Bai-sa.

176
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,666
So, Dad gave me a property that's in ruins
without even inspecting it?

177
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,833
So, if we lose Motibagh, where will I go?

178
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:34,500
But, Bai-sa, the good news is,
Maharaja left you a large inheritance.

179
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,916
Inheritance? You mean, money?

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,416
-Yes.
-And you're telling me now?

181
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,666
It wouldn't have made a difference anyway.

182
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,708
You'll get the money only after you marry
a boy from a respectable family.

183
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,541
Right. Thank you.

184
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,833
What am I doing here, Niki?

185
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,791
Everything is going to Fizzy and Diggy.

186
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,208
I just inherited ruins
in the name of a palace.

187
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,291
Sheet Mahal is a piece of shit mahal.

188
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,250
Jinnie…

189
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,791
I love you.

190
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,500
And for that mahal of yours,
I'm sorry. I really am.

191
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:12,583
But can we focus
on this palace today? Please.

192
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,250
Yeah, okay.

193
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:20,083
Okay, queen of bad vibes.
Let's talk tonight.

194
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,875
But for now, stop sulking.

195
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,208
I'm not sulking.

196
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,125
Okay, I'm sulking a little but that's
because I don't know what to do, Niki.

197
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,791
Flowers. Check the flower arrangements.

198
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,750
The decorator
can't tell tuberoses from orchids.

199
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,125
-You'll help him?
-Yeah.

200
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,166
Yeah?

201
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,583
Great. I'll see you.

202
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,750
Why are the chairs still here?

203
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,583
And what about the flowers?

204
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,750
Niki, where are you?

205
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,625
Soph, right here.

206
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,708
-Okay. Decor?
-Almost.

207
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,333
-Seating arrangement?
-Check.

208
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,416
-Flowers?
-I asked Jinnie to handle it.

209
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,708
Smart girl.

210
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,666
But, Soph, I think there'll be a shortage
of ground transportation and staff.

211
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,375
Don't worry about it.

212
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,541
-I know exactly who to call.
-Who?

213
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,958
Spicy Salad.

214
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,416
Spicy Salad.

215
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,166
And, listen…

216
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,666
let Aviraaj handle the guest list.

217
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,250
Sophia Kanmani Shekhar

218
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,833
is going to share responsibilities
with the Maharaja? Wow!

219
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,083
Niki, get back to work

220
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,958
and cut the nonsense.

221
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,416
You know what's nonsense? Your rules.

222
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,541
Niki, all of our futures
depend on this fundraiser.

223
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,583
So, I really have to focus. Blinders on.

224
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,958
And this Maharaja…

225
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,166
He's a huge distraction.

226
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,416
She's a huge distraction.

227
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,041
And this fundraiser
is equally important for all of us.

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,500
We have to make this work.
There's no other option.

229
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,291
What do you think? Can you do it?

230
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,208
What else can I do?

231
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,875
And I'll tackle the rest later.
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

232
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,625
What did you do to my brother?

233
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,666
How did this idiot suddenly turn so smart?

234
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,958
Yes, Keertana? No, it's not important.

235
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,583
Zubin and the Dhondis
are planning on collaborating.

236
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,791
Have you seen this?

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,416
-Greetings, Hukum.
-Greetings.

238
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,958
Rani-sa Hukum would like to see you.

239
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,625
Tell me. What's up?

240
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,166
I knew all about your dad and Maurice.

241
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,916
What?

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,958
I knew all about your dad and Maurice.

243
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,416
He told me.

244
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,291
But we decided…

245
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,000
to keep it between the two of us…

246
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,916
Because, before we got married…

247
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,666
we had decided that…

248
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,416
we won't tell anyone about it.

249
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,458
This is not a joke, Aviraaj.

250
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,416
It's the truth.

251
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,166
All these years,

252
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,375
I didn't even talk to him, Mom,

253
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,875
because I thought he broke our family.

254
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,041
Because I thought he hurt you.

255
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,416
But you…

256
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,791
You knew everything.

257
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,875
You…

258
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,333
I didn't mean to hurt you.

259
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,291
Didn't you ever think

260
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,000
that staying away from him
might be hurting me?

261
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,458
Your Dad didn't want me to--

262
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,625
He didn't want a lot of things, Mom.

263
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,250
I thought he didn't want
this marriage either.

264
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,791
Now it all makes sense.

265
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,291
Why he stayed away from home, from you.

266
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
It wasn't wrong.

267
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,041
It was all because he was stuck
in this lavender fucking marriage.

268
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,208
When you don't know everything…

269
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,666
-It was difficult for me too.
-You know what's difficult, Mom?

270
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,583
I can't ask for his forgiveness now
even if I want to.

271
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,125
All my life,
I have to live with this guilt

272
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,041
that I was a bad son.

273
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,666
What's the point in telling me now?

274
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,125
Maurice has written a book.

275
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,958
I don't know what's in it,

276
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,416
how many truths have been revealed in it.

277
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,958
But if everything came to light--

278
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:48,958
That'll be great.

279
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,875
I might finally understand my Dad.

280
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:09,958
Royals.

281
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,041
Their world seems like a fairy tale.

282
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,666
We read about them in our textbooks

283
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,125
or hear about them in stories as kids.

284
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,125
I met them in Morpur.

285
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,875
After stepping into
the premises of Motibagh,

286
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,791
I saw what we see in every household.

287
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,583
A lot of love, family,

288
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,500
affection, and a lot of stories.

289
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:47,125
That's why everything in Motibagh
is not just expensive,

290
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,666
but invaluable.

291
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,583
So, don't hold yourself back
while bidding today.

292
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,416
Take one of Motibagh's stories
back with you.

293
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,583
To begin it all,
let's put our hands together

294
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:05,791
for Rajmata Ma Sahiba Bhagyashree Devi.

295
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,416
On this historical night,

296
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,041
I, Maharaja Aviraaj Singh, Morpur,
welcome all of you.

297
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:24,041
A token from my great-grandmother
Maharani Ahilya Devi's legendary life,

298
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,541
her bridal trousseau.

299
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:30,500
Today, the legend of our family,
Bhagyashree Ma Sahiba is wearing it today.

300
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,958
Motibagh Mahal of Morpur
was built 200 years ago,

301
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,208
but our butler, Girdhari-sa has been
its firm foundation for the last 40 years.

302
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,083
And he's wearing my great-grandfather
Maharaja Randeep Singh's bandhgala today.

303
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,208
Items one to six on our bidding list.

304
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,875
These vintage couture pieces,

305
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,291
watches, jewels,

306
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,583
beautifully and preciously restored

307
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:01,500
by finery couturiers,
Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla.

308
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,416
About 100 years ago,

309
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,041
the princess of Ceylon

310
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,500
gifted this Chantilly lace saree
to the Maharani of Morpur.

311
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:16,083
And my mother, Maharani Padmaja Devi,
looks dazzling in it today.

312
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,333
And she's accompanied by
Maharani's ever-loyal ladies-in-waiting,

313
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,458
and her frank ally
and friend, Rambha Devi.

314
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,041
Make sure the light faders
sync to the pyros.

315
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:51,958
Okay, sir.

316
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,791
And the pyros must light up
together, remember.

317
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,000
Okay.

318
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,083
What's up?

319
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,083
I can't find Jinnie.

320
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,875
What do you mean you can't find Jinnie?

321
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,458
She's supposed to go on stage next.

322
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,000
Let me try.

323
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,791
And here comes our multi-talented
Prince Digvijay Singh…

324
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:29,541
along with Motibagh's pillars of strength,
Rafiq chacha and Pankaj Kamaavat.

325
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,125
What's happening, guys?

326
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,500
Jinnie's gone.

327
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,583
-What do you mean by gone?
-She's not answering her phone.

328
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,166
She's gone.

329
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,166
Fuck!

330
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,500
Who do we give Jinnie's lehenga to?

331
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,541
-Keertana, go, find her.
-Yes, yes.

332
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,125
Shit.

333
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,083
What do we do now?

334
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,625
What?

335
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,791
Sporting the neck piece
crafted by Thewa artisans from 1780,

336
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:54,791
our new Maharaja, Maharaja Aviraaj Singh.

337
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,166
Come.

338
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,791
Soph.

339
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,583
Come with me.

340
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,416
Embellished with pearls and gem stones,

341
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,583
this necklace
is being presented before you

342
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:03,916
by a very special young lady,
Sophia Kanmani Shekhar.

343
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,666
Ma'am!

344
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,916
Welcome back.

345
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,916
I'm sorry, Mom.

346
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,166
I'm sorry.

347
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,666
I kept this huge secret
from you all these years.

348
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,083
No, Mom.

349
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:20,291
Dad didn't want us to know,
what could you have done?

350
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,000
In fact, you had to bear
this weight by yourself.

351
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:26,875
But not anymore.

352
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:30,791
Fizzy…

353
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,250
I…

354
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,791
Mom…

355
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
It's okay.

356
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:43,125
Everything went well today, right?

357
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,958
That's your win.

358
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,666
Our win.

359
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,416
Tonight, you celebrate.

360
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,125
I love you.

361
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:32,208
Salad has made another bid
of 1.2 crores for the Ravi Varma.

362
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:34,666
Okay, great. Next.

363
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:38,500
Gaurav Biyani
bid on the Kashmir princess' necklace,

364
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,000
fifteen crores.

365
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,916
-Are you kidding? What, ma'am!
-What!

366
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,833
Amazing.

367
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:43,916
Okay.

368
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,708
Almost there.

369
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,041
Adi.

370
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:03,750
You know, I never understood

371
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:06,208
why Pickles liked this painting so much.

372
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,166
Do you know why?

373
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,125
Please leave.

374
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,375
Easy, P.

375
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,791
I'm not here to fight.

376
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,375
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

377
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,958
And why should we fight?
Both of us loved him.

378
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,666
Yes, the way we loved him
was different, but…

379
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,000
we loved the same person.

380
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,250
Why are you here?

381
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,875
Whatever I'm doing,

382
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,333
I'm doing for him.

383
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:38,166
He always lived a lie,

384
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,958
it's time to reveal his truth.

385
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,208
His truth and ours.

386
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,541
Not yours.

387
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:51,250
I won't write anything about the children.
You have my word.

388
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:57,125
You know, I never expected

389
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:00,791
to stand here in this room again,
in front of this painting.

390
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,208
He's still here.

391
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,791
My Maharaja.

392
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,416
Our Maharaja.

393
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,625
Thank you, Padmaja,
for preserving all of this.

394
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,500
Thank Sophia.

395
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,416
Stay as long as you want to.

396
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:07,333
Shall we calculate again?

397
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,416
We've done that thrice.

398
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,916
What happens if we can't raise
the full amount?

399
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,250
Maybe…

400
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,708
Nothing's gonna happen till tomorrow, guys

401
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:16,791
We've worked hard today.
Let's just get some rest.

402
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
Yeah?

403
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:22,291
-Ma'am, this--
-Tomorrow.

404
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,291
-Good night, ma'am.
-Good night.

405
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,958
-See you tomorrow.
-Good night.

406
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:27,750
Good night.

407
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,958
Girdhari-sa, leave us alone
for some time, please.

408
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:00,666
I'm sorry, Hukum, but…

409
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:05,250
someone left this letter for you two.

410
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,083
"Miss Shekhar,

411
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,250
you've returned the love I had lost."

412
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:34,291
"The way you've preserved
Yuvanath's memories, for that…

413
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,125
I can never thank you enough."

414
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,916
Aviraaj, I…

415
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,041
think you should read this.

416
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,708
Keep reading.

417
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:54,333
"Aviraaj, your dad
always believed in Fizzy."

418
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:56,958
"And you've proved him right."

419
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,375
"This money was entrusted to me
for the Maharaja of Morpur…"

420
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:11,916
"And, today, I'm handing it back
to the Maharaja of Morpur."

421
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,833
"In return, I'm only taking a painting
as Yuvanath's keepsake."

422
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:45,291
Aviraaj, we don't have to take this.

423
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,791
Hey.

424
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:53,583
We don't have to do this.

425
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:04,541
Yes, we do.

426
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,750
We must.

427
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,583
Are you sure?

428
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:12,500
Yeah.

429
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,250
Yeah I am.

430
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,625
You did it.

431
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You did it.

432
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:40,583
You brought me back from Madurai.

433
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,208
You came to Motibagh.

434
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,500
You asked my name at the bar.

435
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,708
You beat Coffee in the race.

436
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,875
You are such an ass.

437
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,708
You're such a pain in that ass.

438
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,958
You can't see anyone but yourself.

439
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,291
You didn't love anyone but yourself.

440
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,458
-Lights?
-On maybe.

441
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,291
You still think this is bad idea?

442
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,958
Very bad idea.

443
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,666
You won't let me live in peace.

444
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,875
Where were you last night, Jinnie?

445
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,875
At a friend's place.
What does it matter, anyway?

446
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:44,208
After a long time, our family is together.

447
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,708
We fought the case together,

448
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:49,958
won it, and our family got Motibagh back.

449
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,583
Aviraaj has been crowned.

450
00:36:56,416 --> 00:37:00,333
Diggy is finally going
to London for gastritis.

451
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,916
Gastronautics.

452
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,708
He's going to London
for the final round of Gastronautics.

453
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,250
It feels

454
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,583
like finally something good
is happening in our family.

455
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:16,416
Mom, how many times
are you gonna say "family"?

456
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,958
It sounds like a sermon.

457
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:20,541
All your mother is trying to say

458
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:23,875
that Motibagh finally
feels like home again.

459
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,125
Yes.

460
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:28,166
And because all of us are here today,

461
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:32,125
I would like
to discuss something important.

462
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,250
Mom, I'm late for the press conference.

463
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,750
Aviraaj, stay for a few minutes.

464
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:37,875
It's time for my flight. I have to run.

465
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,291
I'll call you from the airport.

466
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,750
-Excuse me.
-Safe travels.

467
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:42,833
-Thank you.
-Safe travels.

468
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:46,833
I've to go, meet a friend too.
So, I'll also take a leave.

469
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,291
-Bye, Mom. Bye, Maji.
-See you.

470
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:02,125
Some other day, Paddy.

471
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:42,291
Shall we discuss our new company
after the press conference?

472
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,750
Let's begin the press conference.

473
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,958
You may present
your questions to Maharaja.

474
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,166
One by one. One by one, please.

475
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,666
Lakshmi ji, your question please.

476
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,708
-I have a question…
-Sir.

477
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:13,041
Greetings. Congratulations
on a successful fundraiser, Sophia ji.

478
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,500
Thank you.

479
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:17,458
Are you planning
on joining WorkPotato again?

480
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:22,791
You'll hear about my next plan
at the right time.

481
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,833
-Maharaji ji. Maharaja ji.
-Ma'am, ma'am.

482
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:26,541
Down the fourth row… Mr. Rajiv.

483
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,291
-Maharaja ji!
-Ma'am, ma'am…

484
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,250
Maharaja ji, a few months back,

485
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,541
you named the public
commoner ladies and gentlemen.

486
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,416
Do you really believe

487
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,666
that a common man
is as special as the royals?

488
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,791
Yes, of course. And now,
I can say this with confidence.

489
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:46,583
Wait, wait.

490
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,291
Did you bring
your entire royal kitchen with you?

491
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,875
Sorry, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

492
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:54,708
If I miss my flight because of your bags,
I'll never forgive you.

493
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,958
It's okay. I got it, I got it.

494
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:07,125
Then Pankaj-sa showed me Sheet Mahal's
pictures, and there was nothing there.

495
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,333
That means, I have nothing.

496
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,458
What can I do?

497
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,666
Sue them.

498
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,500
Sue them?

499
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,833
Sue Fizzy and Diggy?

500
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,083
Yeah.

501
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:27,041
You have equal rights to the property,
just like your brothers.

502
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,208
Or get married.

503
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:36,125
Don't sail on two boats, you'll drown.

504
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:51,875
Hukum, there's something urgent.

505
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,166
Rajiv ji, next question.

506
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,666
Let's keep it going.
Next question, please.

507
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,125
Next question, please.

508
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:02,791
Ma'am.

509
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:04,708
-Maharaja ji!
-Sit down, please. Sit down. Please!

510
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:07,208
Maintain the decorum. Please!

511
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:08,250
-Maharaja ji!
-Maharaja ji!

512
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,625
-I request you, please sit down.
-Maharaja ji!

513
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,458
-Maharaja ji!
-Maharaja ji!

514
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,833
Dilip, what are you doing?
The boarding has started.

515
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,791
Dilip! Boarding.

516
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:37,958
What happened?

517
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,000
-Maharaja ji! Maharaja ji, please!
-Please!

518
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:42,916
-Please.
-One question!

519
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,958
-Please! Please calm down.
-Sir! Sir! Please, one question.

520
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,750
Mr. Vinod. Mr. Vinod.

521
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,083
It's being alleged
that Adi Mehta's latest book,

522
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:53,458
My Maharaja Maurice, mentions
that Maharaja Yuvanath and he were lovers.

523
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,208
Were you aware of this?

524
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:56,333
-Maharaja ji…
-Hukum.

525
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:57,291
Maharaja ji, one question!

526
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,375
No personal questions, please.

527
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:02,541
Reports are that you are
Maharani Padmaja Devi's illegitimate son.

528
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,958
-Is this true?
-What!

529
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,208
Excuse me?

530
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:11,041
Does Morpur's crown belong to
Prince Digvijay and Princess Divyaranjini?

531
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,500
Answer us, please.

532
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,666
We're wrapping up the press conference.
No more questions, please!

533
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,291
Stay seated please!
Please stay where you are!

534
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:21,666
Please stay where you are!
Please! I request you!

535
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,500
The press conference is over!

536
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,791
What happened, Jinnie?

537
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:28,958
Nothing.

538
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,666
Can we do this later, please?

539
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,666
Sorry. Thank you.

540
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,083
Please! No more questions!

541
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:39,083
No more questions! Stay seated, please!

542
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:45,083
Yes, Padmaja. I just read the news.

543
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:49,041
You gave me your word, Adi,
that you'll keep the children out of this.

544
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:52,041
Then how did this news get out?

545
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:56,125
-Maharaja ji…
-Did your family keep this from you?

546
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:04,958
Trust me, Padmaja,
I didn't say anything to anyone.

547
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,416
Answer us!

548
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,250
Out!

549
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,791
Please get out!

550
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,750
Hukum! Hukum, this way, please.
Please come.

551
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:18,666
I have nothing to do with this.

552
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,500
This wasn't me, all right?

553
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:32,416
Did my dear Paddy like my gift?

554
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,291
I had warned you,

555
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,041
messing with me
will cost you dearly, Padmaja.

556
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,500
Move! Step back!

557
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,375
