1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:09,541
Fizzy! Fizzy!

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,041
Why did you have to ask for a pitch?

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:12,833
You compromised our position.

4
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,000
-Compromise?
-Yes!

5
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,500
-Compromise?
-Yes!

6
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,791
You looked desperate.

7
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,916
You put me in charge of Motibagh.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,416
Still want to meddle from New York?

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
It's simple.

10
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,625
Our partners must be competent.

11
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,875
-With a name like Couch Potato--
-WorkPotato!

12
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,625
-WorkPotato!
-That changes everything.

13
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,666
What kind of work
do you think they'll deliver?

14
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,791
-Dude, what are you doing?
-Modelling.

15
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,583
-You are not cut out for modelling.
-Exactly!

16
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,083
Modelling is not my thing.
So, I don't do it.

17
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,083
Running Motibagh palace is not your thing.
So you shouldn't do it.

18
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,916
I had already finalized the deal.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,458
Our lawyers have gone through
their contracts ten times. Ten times!

20
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,458
I want to hear their pitch once.
Just once!

21
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,208
-You want to hear their pitch?
-Yes, I want to hear their pitch.

22
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,333
Fine. Meddle some more.
I'll ask them to come tomorrow.

23
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,750
-Okay.
-You be there!

24
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,833
-Sure.
-On time!

25
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:12,750
What time?

26
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,250
I'll tell you. Good night!

27
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,541
This Maharaja will be a handful.

28
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:20,833
International cover boy.

29
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,666
He's dated Lily, Taylor, Deepika--

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,708
Ma'am, he's a Swiftie!
That's an excellent sign.

31
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,000
He's not just a green flag,
he's a green forest.

32
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,500
I don't care!

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,416
We came here to close this deal,

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,083
and it's shameful that we didn't even know
who the actual Maharaja is.

35
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,208
It's embarrassing, Kunal.

36
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,833
He thinks we're amateurs,
that's why he has asked us for a pitch.

37
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,250
Soph, that's not what they're thinking.
Trust me.

38
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,000
We were under a time crunch,
and we slipped up.

39
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,041
Why are you getting so worked up?

40
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,791
What?

41
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:54,291
Don't overthink about the Maharaja.
Do what do you best.

42
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,500
Focus on the pitch.

43
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,291
-Guys…
-Niki, no.

44
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,666
Fine. Niki, I want to see
the designs once again.

45
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,416
-Keertana, set up an office in my room.
-Yes, ma'am.

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Kunal, fix up the meeting
with Digvijay for tomorrow.

47
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,125
On it.

48
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,875
Let's show this Maharaja,
who really rules the world.

49
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,333
Why did you have to call me at this hour?

50
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,500
-Greetings.
-Greetings, Hukum.

51
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,250
I wanted to show this to you.

52
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,125
Wow, great handwriting, Pankaj-sa.

53
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,541
Thanks for the compliment, Hukum,
but these are bills.

54
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,833
-And what should I do?
-Sign, Hukum.

55
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,041
-Right now?
-Yes.

56
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,125
Can't we do this in a couple of days?

57
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,916
Or you guys do it, please.
I have to wake up early.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,083
I have my friends coming to the airport.
I can't make the ladies wait.

59
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,875
And what about this lady
waiting over here?

60
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,333
For years, Fizzy, I've been waiting,

61
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,125
for you to return
and relieve me of my responsibilities.

62
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,000
Why didn't Dad hand over these bills
to Maurice along with the money?

63
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,291
Speaking of which, did you find him?

64
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,375
Do you see him here?

65
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,083
-Give it to me!
-Here, Hukum.

66
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,375
From the second page. Here.

67
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,416
-This is the electricity bill?
-Yes. After 30--

68
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,708
Electricity bill of 30 lakhs?

69
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,541
Oh, how come?
Don't we light oil lamps here everyday?

70
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,541
This is ridiculous. What is this?

71
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,458
Are we bathing in single malt?

72
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,416
We bathe with water only, Hukum.
This is the water bill of 10 lakhs.

73
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,791
Are we bathing Morpur's peacocks here?
Shut off the fountains!

74
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,500
Gifts? What do you mean, gifts?

75
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,250
The palace gives its guests
special gifts, Hukum.

76
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,250
Worth 1.25 crores?

77
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,666
Yes, pashmina shawls, stoles from Banaras,

78
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,041
exotic dry fruits,
big bottles of single malt.

79
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,166
It's a tradition, Hukum.

80
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,583
Girdhari-sa, henceforth, our guests
shall receive only the gift of memories.

81
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,875
Please.

82
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,833
Are we exporting saffron and almonds?

83
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:33,208
Everyone in the palace drinks
saffron-almond milk.

84
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,458
That's also tradition, Hukum.

85
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,375
Please enjoy it. Please serve only water
to our guests from tomorrow.

86
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,666
Hukum, these are the smaller bills--

87
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,375
Who is buying so many diamonds?

88
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,583
Why is everyone looking at me?

89
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,750
I'm the Maharani of Morpur.

90
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,041
I've got my duties,
but I also have my own interests.

91
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,208
This is also a tradition.

92
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,291
Are there any affordable traditions
in this family?

93
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,583
Why did we get so many paintings
from the museum?

94
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,208
Why are you all questioning
only my interests?

95
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,791
What about your vintage cars?

96
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,125
And your horses. Huge ones.

97
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,041
Don't you dare touch my horses.

98
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,916
Then sell your vintage cars.
They consume too much fuel.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,166
What about your entourage?

100
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,958
It's like you're leading
an election rally.

101
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,000
My staff handles the work here
which none of you can do.

102
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,875
I apologize, Your Highness,
but you'll have to lower your staff.

103
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,708
What's miscellaneous, Jinnie?

104
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,041
I don't buy diamonds like Mom.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,916
I just invest in people
who are precious like diamonds.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,458
-Excuse me?
-Invest in mutual funds, Jinnie.

107
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,250
Your boyfriends
don't even give you any returns.

108
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,500
And, Mom, why do you need
eight ladies to wait on you?

109
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,416
You only have one set of limbs to massage.

110
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,208
I might be a widow, but I'm not dead yet!

111
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,333
Girdhari-sa, you have to…

112
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,625
cut down your staff, please.

113
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,708
Reduce the kitchen staff.
Cooking is not a big deal anyway.

114
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,583
Hukum, they've worked for us for years.

115
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,458
I'm going to bed. Good night.
Please arrange for a car tomorrow.

116
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,791
The cars are gone, Your Highness.

117
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,541
A good Maharaja always leads by example.

118
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,583
So how do I get to the airport then?

119
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,791
-Oh, my God!
-What the fuck!

120
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,791
You're an actual effing prince?

121
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,333
Actual effing prince?

122
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,000
-I mean…
-Oh, my God--

123
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,458
It's just ceremonial. That's all.

124
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,583
You never said that you have
a fucking carriage

125
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,375
with the horses and guards.

126
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,833
-We use carriages all the time.
-Oh, my God.

127
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,375
They're more reliable than cars,
to be honest, so…

128
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,166
Wow! It's so beautiful.

129
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,458
Thank you.

130
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,750
Oh, wow!

131
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:50,750
Wait.

132
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,333
You could've at least sent
two carriages, Girdhari-sa.

133
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,125
-Hukum--
-The luggage was also loaded on this one.

134
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,750
Baby, what is this?

135
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,666
This is…

136
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,375
-Water.
-This is blessed water.

137
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,041
-Blessed water?
-Please help yourselves.

138
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,375
Cheers, guys.

139
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,208
Come on.

140
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,083
Soph.

141
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,666
-The pitch meeting got pushed.
-Huh?

142
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,291
The pitch meeting got pushed.

143
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,875
Apparently, the Maharaja is busy.

144
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:19,791
Cheese!

145
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,583
What?

146
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,541
Oh, no!

147
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,625
They are taking my cars.

148
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,750
Perfect timing!

149
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,291
-Where's Pankaj-sa?
-Pankaj-sa…

150
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,750
Greetings.

151
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,750
Ms. Shekhar.

152
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,208
Do you ever come down
from that high horse?

153
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,666
It's our tradition. You won't get it.

154
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,000
You asked for a pitch and we're ready.
Then why wait till tomorrow?

155
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,708
-I'm busy today.
-I can see.

156
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:54,750
You're really busy.

157
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,541
Look, Aviraaj,
we have a lot of money to offer.

158
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,666
We don't need funding
from a Mumbai-based start-up.

159
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,750
I anyway live off
my father's inheritance, right?

160
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,541
Sir ji, why not sell the Rolls Royce too?
You'll get a good deal.

161
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,791
-Sir…
-Come with me. Come on.

162
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,250
Look, what happened between us
was very unfortunate,

163
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,416
but, Aviraaj, I'm very good at what I do.

164
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,291
I turned this Mumbai-based start-up
into a unicorn.

165
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,708
Just take the money.
Motibagh clearly needs it.

166
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,166
Ms. Shekhar, if you'll excuse me,

167
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,250
I have some actual lovely ladies
waiting for me. So, I'll see you later.

168
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,416
Wait, wait… C'mon guys.

169
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,166
-Hey, shall we go in?
-Oh, yes!

170
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,125
-Yes.
-All right.

171
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,083
This is the Royal Road
leading to the Palace.

172
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,208
What is that?

173
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,250
That is the Late Maharaja Yuvanath's
chamber.

174
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,166
There's nothing to see there.

175
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,208
Come along, I'll show you
the nicer parts of the palace.

176
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,208
Rambha, my paintings.

177
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,208
Without my paintings, my jewelry,

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,458
what's left, really?

179
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,083
-Your children, Hukum.
-Yeah.

180
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,708
Things are changing at the palace.

181
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,166
The two of you have served
the royal family very diligently.

182
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,875
We'll extend any help you need

183
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,000
to find new jobs.

184
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,416
Greetings.

185
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,125
Namaste, Girdhari ji.

186
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,791
Namaste, Sophia ji.

187
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,041
How long have they been working here?

188
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,375
40 years.

189
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,500
Just like me.

190
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,750
I have been here for less than 40 hours,
but I still feel bad for them.

191
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,833
You and your staff
are a part of this palace.

192
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,250
Girdhari ji, together,

193
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,958
we can change this situation.

194
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:57,583
For this, I need to learn more
about the Morpur family, Girdhari ji.

195
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,958
If you are willing to help me.

196
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,375
Ms. Shekhar!

197
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,625
It's our tradition, Hukum.

198
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,125
-Ms. Shekhar!
-Hi!

199
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,875
What a lovely surprise.

200
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,583
-Sophia, please.
-Sophia.

201
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,541
-Kunal.
-Digvijay.

202
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,875
-You already know him.
-Yes.

203
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,541
I call dibs on that one.

204
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,375
-They're definitely fucking.
-What?

205
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,708
It's great that we're all here.

206
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,416
That's my Head of Design, Niki.

207
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,166
-That's my EA, Keertana.
-Hi.

208
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,958
Hi, Diggy sir. So big… fan. I meant fan.

209
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,916
-Don't mind her.
-Hope you're joining us for dinner?

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,416
-Yeah, of course.
-Yes, of course.

211
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,625
-I'll be back in a second.
-Okay.

212
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,708
-Who's the one in that purple dress?
-Hey!

213
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,958
-Cheers.
-Divyaranjini. His twin sister.

214
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,291
-Diggy sir's.
-Hi!

215
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,750
-Thank you for having me.
-Hey. So wonderful to see you.

216
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,208
I'm so glad you made it.

217
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,416
Hi. Sameera Kashyap.

218
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,625
-Hi.
-She's the Head of Raghanis.

219
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,083
-Hi!
-Oh my God, I know her.

220
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,750
-What a surprise!
-Hi. How're you?

221
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,666
-Good to see you.
-Good. How are you?

222
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,708
-And I know you too. How are you, Kunal?
-Hi. I'm good.

223
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,750
-This is my younger brother.
-Pleasure.

224
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,750
Nice to meet you.
Stunning property. Beautiful.

225
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,583
-Thank you.
-Stunning indeed.

226
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,083
Come through. I'll show you around.

227
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,708
-See you around.
-How was your flight?

228
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,708
Bar's right there.
I insist you have a drink.

229
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,708
-I'll be with you in just a second.
-Of course.

230
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,291
-Thank you so much.
-All right.

231
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,916
-Kate. Sameera. Sameera. Kate.
-Hey.

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,916
Nice to meet you.

233
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,208
What is she doing here?

234
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,916
I have no idea.

235
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,708
-Act normal.
-I am acting normal, Kunal.

236
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:29,000
You probably don't remember, ma'am,
you met her at the business awards.

237
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,625
She's your competitor.
Even her outfit color matches with yours.

238
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,958
-How can that be?
-I know, Keertana!

239
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,875
So, what brings you to Morpur?

240
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:49,083
This. Raghanis are
always looking for heritage properties.

241
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,916
And when Aviraaj personally invited me,

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,833
there's no way I could've said no.

243
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,125
How could I not invite you?

244
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,125
Raghanis are the royals
of the hospitality industry after all.

245
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,291
Isn't it?

246
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,416
Are they both CEOs?

247
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,833
Add their net worth together,

248
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,875
and Morpur's nowhere near.

249
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,791
That's good. Thank you.

250
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,541
Rani-sa, who doesn't know
about your brilliant art collection.

251
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,791
So, a little something from us to you.

252
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,791
-Wow.
-Wow.

253
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,000
Raja Ravi Verma
was my mother's favorite artist as well.

254
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,458
So, it just felt right.

255
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,833
Really sweet of you. Thank you so much.

256
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,458
You're most welcome.

257
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,541
-Congrats, Paddy.
-I'm so happy, Bhabhi-sa.

258
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,458
So sweet.

259
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,500
-Incredible.
-Thank you.

260
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,916
What a lovely gift.
Thank you, Ms. Shekhar.

261
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,541
That was really nice…

262
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,000
Fizzy?

263
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,250
What is this? Portion control?

264
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,000
Are we all dieting?

265
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,791
It's the first course, Maji.

266
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,916
There will be more.

267
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,041
I hope so.

268
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,041
Hi. I'm Divyaranjini.

269
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,625
Everyone calls me Jinnie.

270
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,458
Hi, I'm Niki.

271
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,208
And everyone calls me Niki.

272
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,000
And what do you do, Jinnie?

273
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,416
Darling, we're Royals.

274
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,833
We don't do anything.

275
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,666
We just are!

276
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,875
We are!

277
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,166
Aviraaj, I saw your cover story.

278
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,125
It's pretty cool.

279
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,625
Thank you. Appreciate it.

280
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,708
So, how did you two meet?

281
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,583
Last month, was it? Sri Lanka, yeah.

282
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,916
During the business awards.

283
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,291
Business awards?

284
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,750
-Don't get Avi started on Sri Lanka.
-What!

285
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,625
He had a terrible time, didn't you?

286
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,083
-Really? You were in Sri Lanka?
-What?

287
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,000
-Horse guy?
-Soph was also there last month.

288
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,333
Yeah? Yeah.

289
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,791
She received the Entrepreneur of the Year
award for WorkPotato.

290
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:10,958
Why didn't you tell me?

291
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,333
Really? That's amazing.
Congratulations to the two of you.

292
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,208
-Thank you.
-Well, it's all her.

293
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,708
Yeah, it's all her.

294
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:18,958
Stop it.

295
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,916
I received this award two years ago.

296
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,875
-Congratulations, Sophia.
-Thank you, Sameera.

297
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,958
If the two of you were in Sri Lanka,

298
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,958
didn't you guys bump into each other?

299
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,833
You know, I was thinking,
how exceptional is this.

300
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,333
How often does this happen?

301
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,625
I mean, we have two reigning CEOs with us.

302
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,958
We should have a competition.

303
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,083
-A what?
-How about a pitch-off?

304
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,666
-Sorry?
-What?

305
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,750
A pitch-off!

306
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,125
I'm game. Let's do it tomorrow?

307
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,375
I know.

308
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,541
-I don't think you understand, Digvijay.
-I'm sorry.

309
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,500
No, I don't think you understand
how embarrassing this was for me.

310
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,083
-I know.
-You said we had a done deal.

311
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,875
We're an experienced company, Digvijay.
We came to close the deal.

312
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,000
That turned into a pitch…
And now there's another company?

313
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,083
Please ignore my brother. He's crazy.

314
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,750
How can I ignore your brother?
He's the Maharaja of Morpur.

315
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,250
-Yeah, but…
-Look, Digvijay, with all due respect,

316
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,625
if we don't find a solution by tomorrow,

317
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,708
I'll have to look for other options.

318
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,666
I can't hold off my board any longer.

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,208
-I'm on it.
-Okay.

320
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,000
Just shut up and follow me.

321
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,291
Okay, go! Go, go.

322
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,750
-Please, guys!
-Don't make him mad.

323
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,291
-You guys have lost it.
-Come and see our state for yourself.

324
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,458
Yuck!

325
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,375
The two of you are lost
in your own worlds.

326
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,916
No responsibilities, no business sense.

327
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,166
Yuck.

328
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,375
Oh, God, Diggy, where have you brought us?

329
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,125
-And what's that stink?
-It smells like poop.

330
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,708
Yes! Correct.

331
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,583
Because it's a literal shithole!

332
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,625
-Sorry?
-Bats have made this their home for years.

333
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,833
And that generates our annual income.

334
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,583
By selling their droppings
to an organic fertilizer company.

335
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,458
Yeah, funny. Poop.

336
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,833
Shit!

337
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,583
Bat shit.

338
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,250
Laugh all you want.

339
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,000
But this is our truth. And Motibagh's.

340
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,958
But since this wall has collapsed,
the bats have disappeared.

341
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,666
Now we're running out of time and shit.

342
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,250
You'll are finding this funny?

343
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:49,750
Sorry.

344
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,291
No bats, no poop. No poop, no fertilizer.

345
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,625
No fertilizer equals no money.

346
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,333
Without money,
you won't have these expensive clothes.

347
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,416
Without money,
we'll be in deep financial--

348
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,666
Deep shit.

349
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,875
-Just nonsense.
-So good.

350
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,666
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Okay, Diggy, stop. Stop.

351
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,333
Calm down. We're stopping.

352
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,000
-Yeah, we're stopping.
-Tell me.

353
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,041
-Yeah.
-All we're left with now is our title.

354
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,541
If we want to save face,

355
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,916
we have to lock a deal with Sophia now.

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,958
-And stop this Sameera nonsense!
-Okay…

357
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,291
-Okay.
-Yeah. I mean, Diggy has a point.

358
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,208
-Oh, yeah, does he?
-He does. Yeah.

359
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,000
Can an upstart entrepreneur save us

360
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,833
from this shithole?

361
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,541
Fizzy also has a point.

362
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,666
-What do we do then? Die?
-Dude.

363
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,791
-In a corner? Quietly?
-Calm down.

364
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,000
-Relax.
-I am calm.

365
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,083
Guys, I have an idea.

366
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,416
Since they're already here,

367
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
let's listen to their pitches,
and then we can just decide.

368
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,041
What else have I been saying?

369
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,750
Yes, but now I'm saying it, right?

370
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,000
This is the uninterrupted,
secluded side of the palace.

371
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,083
There are no guards!

372
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,500
You've been clocking that?

373
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,666
I have been.
They've been following us everywhere.

374
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,541
Why would you ever wanna leave?

375
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,625
New York's got that Kate energy.

376
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,375
-But, frankly, it just has better coffee.
-It does.

377
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,666
-It's just the coffee.
-It's just the coffee. Come here.

378
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,416
The power's out!

379
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
Why did the lights turn off?

380
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,500
Didn't we pay the electricity bill?

381
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,916
It's just a family ritual.

382
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,666
-Okay.
-Yeah, we call it Pratha.

383
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,875
Where are the candles?

384
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,125
-What the--
-Hukum.

385
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,041
I'm sorry, Hukum. Actually…

386
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,250
Rani-sa is asking for you.

387
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,166
What?

388
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,166
Who is Rani-sa?

389
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,375
That's my mom.

390
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,750
I'm gonna…

391
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,666
-Should I come?
-No, no!

392
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,416
That's fine. That's fine. Not just yet.

393
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,083
That's strange!

394
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,291
The entire palace is in darkness,
and your wing is all lit up?

395
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,666
-Aviraaj.
-Oh, new weed babies.

396
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,708
I know! Aren't they lovely?

397
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,625
Aviraaj?

398
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,541
I know about you and that girl.

399
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,333
Which girl? What do you know?

400
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,958
You cannot have an unmarried girl
stay in your room.

401
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,125
Ohh, Kate!

402
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,250
But how would you know she's unmarried?

403
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,166
-Hey.
-I'm not a child anymore, Mom.

404
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,458
Sure, but you also are Morpur's Maharaja.

405
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:53,083
Unless you are ready
to make your girlfriend, your Maharani.

406
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,583
French Maharani.

407
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,000
Bonjour. Ça va? Je m'appelle Rambha.

408
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,250
Joie de vie. C'est la vie.

409
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,708
Bon appétit. Croissant.

410
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,083
Pas français.

411
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,541
No croissant.

412
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,500
She's American.

413
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,791
-Stars and stripes forever!
-Whatever.

414
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,916
Mom, you can relax.
She's not my girlfriend.

415
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,375
Then?

416
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,708
Then?

417
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,250
It's a situationship.

418
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,458
What's that?

419
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,083
A casual, undefined relationship.

420
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,500
Which has everything else,

421
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,000
apart from drama.

422
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,916
You can't have anything without drama.

423
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,625
Oh, Paddy,

424
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,666
how many things do we need to teach you?

425
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,208
Please do this without me.

426
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,916
My situationship is waiting for me.

427
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,291
"Situationship." Yay!

428
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:52,750
-Undefined, casual…
-Causal relationship.

429
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,625
It's just a pitch, Sophia.

430
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,291
You're a strong girl.

431
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,708
You're a strong girl, Sophia.

432
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,208
If this project gets green-lit,
then by the first quarter--

433
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,541
I'm really sorry, Kunal.

434
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,625
And I'm so grateful
that I have you in my life.

435
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:31,833
I feel guilty for constantly
taking my frustration out on you.

436
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,500
It's okay, as long as we're together.

437
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,125
-Professionally, I mean.
-Of course.

438
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,833
-What did you think?
-Same.

439
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,291
-You assumed something else, right?
-Not at all.

440
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,458
So far, people have just read about you

441
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,458
or seen your photos.

442
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,041
Through The Royal B&B,
our customers will stay with you

443
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,541
and get to experience
your history and art closely.

444
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,416
These are great.

445
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,333
Thank you.

446
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,083
Basically, you want us
to become royal show pieces.

447
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,875
Absolutely not.

448
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:21,125
In fact, we want you to become
the global face of Indian royalty.

449
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:30,916
Raghanis. Pioneers of luxury hospitality
for the last 90 years,

450
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,125
who've made their mark across the world.

451
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:42,125
Seven countries, 32 hotels,
21 award-winning restaurants.

452
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,666
Ten Michelin star chefs.

453
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,666
But there's another reason
for our credibility.

454
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:50,458
People associate the same things
with our brand that they do with Morpur.

455
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:54,916
History, tradition, and legacy.

456
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,458
And only a 90-year-old
company can earn that.

457
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,041
Fair point.

458
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,750
We'd love for people
to come here as guests

459
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,041
and leave as your friends.

460
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,208
Some of our guests will get a chance

461
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,708
to learn gourmet recipes
from your royal chef.

462
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:19,000
And some will get a chance to celebrate
festivals with you. Like Holi, Diwali.

463
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,333
While learning to ride horses,

464
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:25,166
some will forge a friendship
with the rare Malani horses of Morpur

465
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,875
that have inward-curving ears.

466
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,333
These numbers, these projections,
these are all fantastic.

467
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,708
But this would be possible,

468
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,041
only when you make arrangements
to move out.

469
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,291
What?

470
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,333
Sorry, Sameera,
I think we're a bit confused.

471
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,458
Yeah, I can see that.

472
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,416
I apologize if I wasn't clear enough.

473
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,708
Listen, let's be honest.

474
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,875
Motibagh is in dire need of a renovation.

475
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:03,583
And to do it well,
you must move out of this property.

476
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,291
There must surely be another way.

477
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,458
Look, I understand your hesitation.

478
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,416
Let me assure you that your palace
is in really safe hands.

479
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,125
After all, we're converting
this palace into a hotel, right?

480
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,833
So, eventually, you will have to move out.

481
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,958
Fair point.

482
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:33,041
The Royal B&B is an extremely
authentic royal experience,

483
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:37,500
so, we really need you all
to stay here at the palace.

484
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,583
Without the royal family,
The Royal B&B is impossible.

485
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:42,750
This is great.

486
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,750
It would've been impossible
without your support, Zubin.

487
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,833
Of course I'll keep you posted.

488
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,833
Bye.

489
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,291
Soph, you're all praises for Zubin.

490
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,625
If you're showering fake compliments,
throw one my way as well.

491
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,500
Kunal, I can never praise you enough.

492
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,208
For example,
what a brilliant presentation.

493
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,250
Oodles of charm.

494
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,250
The charm was mine,
but the presentation was Keertana's.

495
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,416
-Well done, Keertana.
-Thank you, ma'am.

496
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:27,666
Okay. Can you guys stop flirting?
It's really weird for me.

497
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,291
We're not flirting.

498
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,625
What are we doing, Kunal?

499
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,083
We're flirting.

500
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:34,875
Why did we ever break up?

501
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,208
Because we started scheduling
meetings more than dates.

502
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,541
Okay, that's a great time
for everyone to have a drink.

503
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,541
Right.

504
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,000
Ma'am, speaking of which,

505
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,458
it's Aviraaj sir's farewell party today.
Shall we go there?

506
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,291
Kate ma'am has invited all of us.

507
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,708
Guys, they are
our most recent business partners.

508
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:57,041
We should bond with all of them.

509
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,666
-Networking.
-Right.

510
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,958
-With "all of them"?
-Yes, Soph. With "all of them".

511
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:05,291
-"All of them?"
-We've cracked a very big deal.

512
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,375
Let it just be us today.

513
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,500
Please convince him, Soph.

514
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,541
We should go.

515
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,750
Gastronautics welcomes all participants.

516
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,875
Today, the best chefs of India…

517
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:19,791
Diggy!

518
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,041
…will compete with each other.

519
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,875
Hey, what are you doing here?

520
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,375
I know your secret.

521
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:28,708
Secret?

522
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:32,500
Yeah, you're hiding
Dad's single malts here.

523
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,875
Yes. Yes.

524
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:40,375
Yeah.

525
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:42,208
But I'm gonna take them for Fizzy's party.

526
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,250
-Party?
-Yeah.

527
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:45,166
Another party?

528
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,416
Why does Fizzy love
all this noise so much?

529
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,458
Because, perhaps the outside noise
drowns his inner noise.

530
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,666
Diggy, he's leaving tomorrow, right? So…

531
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,708
Your heart must be bursting with joy.

532
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,541
Diggy might as well party.

533
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:18,666
Fizzy, I know you won't believe it,
but it was good to see you, dude.

534
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,916
You wouldn't believe it,
but you were right.

535
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,708
Am I ever wrong?

536
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:24,625
Always.

537
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,000
-And go!
-That's a lot of eye contact.

538
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,250
-Jinnie!
-Jinnie, we love you!

539
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,875
Back off! I need a champagne.

540
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,250
Yes, get some champagne!

541
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,000
-Excuse me.
-We love you!

542
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:40,375
Get the whole bar!

543
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,833
It used to be my favorite--

544
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:43,541
What a great party, Jinnie.

545
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,250
Niki,

546
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:50,875
she's our client. Don't complicate it.

547
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,750
Speaking of complications,

548
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:55,958
did you tell Kunal?

549
00:27:58,791 --> 00:27:59,625
Tell him what?

550
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,541
As if you don't know.

551
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,875
There's nothing to tell.

552
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,041
-Really?
-Really.

553
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:11,541
Yeah! Get it!

554
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,625
Maharaja ji will leave soon.

555
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,375
Then everything will be okay.

556
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,208
Oh, I've seen that look before.

557
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:19,291
Just go!

558
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,625
-Hey, guys!
-Hi.

559
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,458
Hi.

560
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,000
Hi.

561
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,541
-How's your night?
-Good.

562
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,208
Come dance.

563
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,916
-No.
-Come on, it's my last night.

564
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,875
No!

565
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,458
No way!

566
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,166
Don't you know this song?

567
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,208
This was my parents' favorite song.

568
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,583
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

569
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,833
this song is dedicated
to our favorite Maharaja,

570
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,916
HH Fizzy!

571
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:07,166
Your mound of Venus is so strong.

572
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,458
Are you interested in art and paintings?

573
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:10,958
Art was my minor in college.

574
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,958
You look like an artist.

575
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,750
It says you're a dancer too.

576
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,166
-I am?
-Yeah.

577
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,750
I think we kind of jumped to conclusions

578
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,791
about each other last time.

579
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,208
Forgive me, Maharaja ji.

580
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,791
Forgive me, Madam CEO.

581
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,583
Can I ask you something?

582
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,500
The song that played…

583
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,750
you said…

584
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,250
that was your parents' favorite song.

585
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,416
What do you mean "was"?

586
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,208
Can I ask you something?

587
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:34,958
Shoot.

588
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,541
Why are you going back to New York?

589
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,791
I know this house
is a little small for you,

590
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:48,083
but your fan following here is huge.

591
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,625
I have a huge fan following everywhere.

592
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:51,791
Really?

593
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,208
And, I mean…

594
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:00,083
I don't have a reason to stay here.

595
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:02,666
Unless you can give me one.

596
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:06,875
I can.

597
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,375
Your people here.

598
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,583
You are their favorite Maharaja.

599
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,875
I mean, can you blame them?

600
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:21,166
But you know what? I get it.

601
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,500
I love New York.

602
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:27,833
And I think you've gotten
used to living there.

603
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,333
The lifestyle,

604
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,208
the people.

605
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,875
And Morpur is nothing like New York.

606
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:40,333
But luckily for you, Digvijay
loves Morpur and its responsibilities.

607
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,416
So you can leave, hassle-free.

608
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,250
So, it's a win-win, right?

609
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,708
Okay. Is that what you think of me?

610
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:59,000
That going away from Motibagh
is me escaping my responsibilities?

611
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,166
You knew who I was, didn't you?

612
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,708
-From the beginning.
-Sorry?

613
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:11,875
-This was all an act.
-An act?

614
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,375
-An act for what?
-You tell me.

615
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,458
Aviraaj, I don't even know
what you do here,

616
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,250
Your Highness.

617
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,208
What can I gain from you?

618
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,375
You're running away to New York anyway.

619
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:30,375
Avi, there you are.

620
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,166
Babe, I'm so drunk.

621
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,041
How're we gonna get past airport security?

622
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,041
-What are you doing?
-Kiki!

623
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,916
Hey! Good Lord!

624
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,583
Why do you look so sad?

625
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,708
Shots? Shots?

626
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,875
Speech. You need a speech.
Come on, speech!

627
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:50,000
-Speech! Speech!
-Speech! Speech!

628
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,666
What a fucking night!

629
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,083
What a fucking night!

630
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:02,958
It's finally happening.

631
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,041
Congrats, partner.

632
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,541
Congrats, partner.

633
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,500
Speech! Speech! Speech!

634
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,875
Speech! Speech!

635
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:19,916
-Speech! Speech!
-Come on!

636
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,625
-Speech! Speech!
-Speech! Speech!

637
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
My dear brother, Aviraaj,

638
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:31,375
handsome and dashing,
is heading back to New York.

639
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,583
I'm very sad, but I'm very happy

640
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,791
he gets to return to his life in New York.

641
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:38,750
Aren't you happy?

642
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,708
Give us a good farewell speech, Fizzy.

643
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:42,625
Speech!

644
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,708
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!

645
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:47,041
-Speech!
-Speech!

646
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,791
Who knows when you're gonna come back, so…

647
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,333
bid us goodbye with love, Fizzy.

648
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,666
I will not bid y'all goodbye, Jinnie…

649
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:02,458
because I'm not going back to New York.

650
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,750
-What?
-What?

651
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:14,125
From now on, your 'favorite Maharaja' will
be taking over Morpur's responsibilities.

652
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,250
Oh, my God!

653
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,791
