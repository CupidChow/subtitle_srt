1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
Dan,

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,280
can I have a word with you?

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,879
Dan, you have to be strong now.

4
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,559
Your father...

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,120
He's in a coma.

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,359
Oh.

7
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,719
I see.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,799
I'll apply for a leave of absence for you.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,439
You can go and pack your things.

10
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,079
It's okay.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,600
I have an afternoon class.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,679
Excuse me.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Right.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,439
What did Master Joe talk to you about?

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,320
He didn't look happy.

16
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,799
Oh.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,960
My dad's about to die,

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,560
so Master wants me to visit him.

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,519
Huh?

20
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,439
Aren't...

21
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,519
Aren't you going to?

22
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,239
You saw what I saw.

23
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,319
Your dad probably wants to see you.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,040
Your Master is here, yet you're still talking!

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,079
Take out your Civics lecture notes.

26
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,719
Turn to page 21.

27
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,359
Hey.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,519
What are you doing here this late?

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
And what's all the stuff you're carrying?

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,439
- Can I stay the night with you? - Huh?

31
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,359
I can't close the window in my room.

32
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,090
Tell Uncle Rerng to fix it then.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,560
I'm too lazy to go downstairs.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,759
Please? Pretty please?

35
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,919
Please? Let me bunk with you.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,280
What do you say, Dan?

37
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,199
Your call.

38
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,680
All right.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,479
You can sleep in the middle.

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,370
But if you snore, you're going to sleep with the mosquitoes.

41
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,919
Fine.

42
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,759
Can I put these here for a bit?

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,520
The window isn't actually broken, is it?

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,639
Are you worried about me?

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,639
Yes. And what are you going to do about it?

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,759
You're looking for trouble again.

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,000
We'll get in trouble if someone catches us in the same room.

48
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,439
Anyway,

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,680
you're not close with your dad?

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
No.

51
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,159
And does he know

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,960
you've been having nightmares and had to transfer here?

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,800
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

54
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,520
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

55
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,960
But I don't want to remember it.

56
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,879
What are you guys talking about?

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,280
Surat might hear you.

58
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,520
Turn off the lights.

59
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,159
The switch is next to you.

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,759
Well, you were talking.

61
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,400
Ugh.

62
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,759
The cancer in Korn's brain has spread elsewhere.

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,730
I've administered painkillers intravenously

64
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,360
along with antibiotics.

65
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,879
How can you play such a lame hand?

66
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,759
The side effects of the medications will

67
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,170
cause him to be half-conscious

68
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,879
- or delirious. - Come on.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,170
And from now on,

70
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,519
the only treatment available is chemotherapy.

71
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,839
He seems to enjoy playing chess very much.

72
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,170
He does.

73
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,639
He used to play almost every day.

74
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,439
I see.

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
Hey, it's your turn. Come and make your move.

76
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
It's checkmate.

77
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,480
How are you going to make a comeback now?

78
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Shoot...

79
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,800
Who's that?

80
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,040
It's so early.

81
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,600
Don't you know...

82
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,000
Shoot! It's Brother Anurak!

83
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,519
Hide!

84
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,720
Come on in, sir.

85
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,839
Why did you slam the door in my face, Josh?

86
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,360
I'm sorry, sir.

87
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,600
I was startled. I thought a friend was pranking me.

88
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,319
And why is there bedding on the floor?

89
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,120
I've been tossing and turning recently.

90
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,959
So it's just in case I fall off the bed.

91
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Dan,

92
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,959
hurry up and get dressed.

93
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,800
We're going to the hospital.

94
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,759
I don't want to go.

95
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,839
Dan, this might be the last time

96
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,920
you get to see him alive.

97
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,360
I strongly believe he wants to see you no matter what.

98
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,279
Please do it for me.

99
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,199
This will be his last dose of morphine.

100
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,199
Then I'll remove the respirator

101
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,279
so he can go slowly.

102
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,720
If you'd like to say anything to him,

103
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,800
now's the time.

104
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,279
Dan,

105
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,360
I'll go and talk to the doctor about making preparations.

106
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,960
Some people might see a house as a safe haven.

107
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,600
But to me,

108
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,639
a house is a ticking time bomb on a battlefield.

109
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,679
Time is counting down until everything is obliterated.

110
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,120
Where were you?

111
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,210
I was at the market.

112
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,120
Why are you home early today? Don't you usually finish at six?

113
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,330
If I didn't come home early,

114
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,759
I wouldn't have found out you're leaving me!

115
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,519
Where are you running off to?

116
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,480
I asked you a question!

117
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,639
Go ahead and slap me!

118
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,679
Slap me like how you always do.

119
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,519
You're having an affair, aren't you?

120
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,159
You'll never be able to run away with your lover!

121
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,120
Don't think I don't know.

122
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,879
And if you run away,

123
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,840
I'm going to go after you and kill you both!

124
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,159
Ugh!

125
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,159
Did all the alcohol addle your brain?

126
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,399
Is that why you think I'm cheating?

127
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,159
Look at the state of you.

128
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,120
Who'd be able to put up with that?

129
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,759
You said you're going to work

130
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,559
but come home reeking of alcohol every day!

131
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,639
No one would be stupid enough

132
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,759
to stay with a loser of a husband like you!

133
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Vi!

134
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,519
Mom!

135
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,600
I'd been putting up with you for ten years.

136
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,090
I cleaned up after you.

137
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,159
But I won't put up with you anymore!

138
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,919
Let me tell you.

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,450
Without our son,

140
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,879
why would I put up with a piece of garbage like you?

141
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,279
You!

142
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,519
Dad, don't hurt Mom!

143
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,120
You're not going anywhere.

144
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,559
You have to stay with me for the rest of your life.

145
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,759
I might not be able to today.

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,399
But I'll try again tomorrow!

147
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,519
I'll run away from you!

148
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,919
Keep this in mind!

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,759
I don't love you anymore!

150
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,120
I don't love you anymore!

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Dan,

152
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
pack your mother's things!

153
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,320
I told you to go and pack her things!

154
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,440
I told you to do it!

155
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,039
I ordered you to! Why are you disobeying me?

156
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,639
Huh? Are you going to defy me?

157
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,759
Stop!

158
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,960
If you hurt our son,

159
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,879
I'm going to shoot you!

160
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,200
Dan, get out!

161
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,360
Don't touch him.

162
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Go ahead.

163
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,080
Shoot me!

164
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,120
Shoot me in front of our son! Do it!

165
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
If you hurt him, I'm going to shoot you!

166
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,240
Have you gone insane, Vi?

167
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,719
Have you gone insane?

168
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,840
- Let go of me! - Give me the gun!

169
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,879
- Let go! - Give me the gun!

170
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,639
- Let go! - Hey!

171
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
- Ow! - Let go!

172
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,799
- Give it to me! - Let go!

173
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,519
- Ah! - Ugh!

174
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,960
Dan!

175
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,440
After that day,

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,360
My mom was admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

177
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,759
When the doctor saw her,

178
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,720
she was diagnosed with mental instability and mood swings.

179
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,519
And that was when

180
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,240
I started having dreams about the shadow.

181
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,320
Dan? Where's Dan?

182
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,480
Dan?

183
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,399
Dan?

184
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,120
Dan!

185
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,120
No, he's still alive!

186
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,960
Dan! Dan, wake up!

187
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,200
Wake up!

188
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,080
Dan!

189
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,879
Dan,

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,360
if she recovers,

191
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
I'll do my best to look after you both.

192
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,879
I'll stop drinking.

193
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Dan,

194
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,080
it seems your father wants to hold your hand.

195
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,960
Dan?

196
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,240
Please wait outside.

197
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,080
This way, please.

198
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,919
Sir?

199
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,960
You still haven't forgiven him?

200
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,759
It's not necessary.

201
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,759
For a man like him,

202
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,279
he's very lucky to die painlessly.

203
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,519
The world is so freaking unfair.

204
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,960
Don't swear in my presence.

205
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,159
I'm sorry, sir.

206
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,600
It's not important

207
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,480
whether death is painful or not.

208
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,360
At least this is his final moment.

209
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,480
He probably wants you to release him from guilt.

210
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,600
How would you know him better than I do?

211
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,879
If he's truly guilty,

212
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,600
he wouldn't have treated Mom like that when she was alive.

213
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,720
Think about it.

214
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,240
He's about to die,

215
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,359
but he hasn't even forgiven you.

216
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,410
Father, do you think

217
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,960
my son is going to forgive me?

218
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,920
He's still very young.

219
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,559
I don't want him to believe...

220
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,799
I'm scared...

221
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,599
I'm scared that might be what he believes.

222
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,759
I don't want him to hate me.

223
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,200
Your son has been

224
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,440
visiting you almost every day.

225
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,079
If that's what he believes, he wouldn't have come.

226
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,440
The unforgiving voice you're hearing

227
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,720
isn't your son's voice.

228
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,960
But it's your own.

229
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,440
You still haven't been able to forgive yourself.

230
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,440
If you still feel guilty,

231
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,519
the best way to atonement

232
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,839
is to focus on recovery.

233
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,170
Oh.

234
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,759
May the Lord protect you.

235
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,359
Thank you.

236
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,720
I have to excuse myself now.

237
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,559
Oh, Dan!

238
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,599
Did you pick him up from school?

239
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Yes.

240
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,799
And who's this?

241
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,839
I'm a priest. The church has sent me

242
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,839
to look after the patients here.

243
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,890
Father Anurak is a priest

244
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,960
and my doctor's assistant.

245
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,200
Ever since he started looking after me,

246
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,319
I feel much more at peace.

247
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,839
Dan, say hello to him.

248
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,480
- Hello. - Hello.

249
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,559
I shouldn't interrupt your family time.

250
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,279
Excuse me.

251
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,890
Oh, okay.

252
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,410
Did you lose weight?

253
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,440
- Have you eaten? - Yes.

254
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,559
What did you do at school?

255
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,960
Are you hungry?

256
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,170
How was school today?

257
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,319
We can't change the way other people think.

258
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,039
Because if it was possible,

259
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,279
I would've been able to convince you to forgive your father by now.

260
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,720
Honestly,

261
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,920
if your mother was still alive,

262
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,079
I believe she would want you and him

263
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,720
to be on speaking terms again.

264
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,799
Brother Anurak?

265
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,319
Excuse me. You have a call from the school.

266
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,240
Dear Father Anurak,

267
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
I feel lonely.

268
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,200
And it seems no one else can actually hear me.

269
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,119
I think of the times when you'd sit in this room

270
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,960
and let me speak my mind.

271
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,960
You told me

272
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,039
feelings aren't reality.

273
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,519
It's only temporary.

274
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,960
Once the time has passed,

275
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,240
our feelings would change.

276
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,519
When I think of your words,

277
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,839
it always brings my consciousness back to reality.

278
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm still on antidepressants.

279
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,719
But I do have a goal of reducing the dosage

280
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,200
according to the doctor's recommendation

281
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,119
if I show signs of improvement.

282
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,359
I'm happy to know

283
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,200
you're feeling better, Vipha.

284
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,720
On the days you feel lonely as if there's no one else,

285
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,640
I'd like to remind you God is omnipresent.

286
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,640
He is always happy to listen to you.

287
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,359
With good intentions, may the Lord protect your family.

288
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
Brother Anurak.

289
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,319
What are you doing?

290
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,599
Why did you burn my letter?

291
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,359
You wrote a letter mentioning God,

292
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,160
but in fact, you behaved inappropriately

293
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,759
and slept around with a priest!

294
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,319
I guess you don't care about your husband or son anymore.

295
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,359
Is that the extent of your thoughts?

296
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,240
Is seeing me being happy going to kill you?

297
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,960
What's wrong with you?

298
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,680
If you're happy with him, then go and live with him!

299
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,559
There's nothing between me and Father Anurak.

300
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,200
Our hearts are pure.

301
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,640
There's nothing in the letter either.

302
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,880
Who'd be able to put up with you picking fights when you're drunk?

303
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,279
- I shouldn't have come back! - Then why did you?

304
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,319
Get out!

305
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,599
Let the world know

306
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,839
you're a harlot!

307
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
You slept around with a priest!

308
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,240
And don't ever think

309
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,440
that I'll let you have Dan.

310
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,599
Oh, I'm going.

311
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,640
And I'm taking Dan with me.

312
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,000
- Away from a scumbag like you! - You!

313
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,400
Stop.

314
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,519
Stop contacting him.

315
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,920
If you don't stop,

316
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,559
I'm going to tell the hospital to come and get you!

317
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,319
And I'll tell them you're insane!

318
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,960
And just you wait.

319
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,920
Let's see who'll get custody of Dan!

320
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,640
Here it is.

321
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,880
There.

322
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,920
This one's for you.

323
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,039
Wow, why does the food look so tasty today?

324
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,400
Then eat up. The school bus will be arriving soon.

325
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,160
This is a lot. I won't be able to finish it.

326
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,599
Can you pack it up so I can have it for lunch at school too?

327
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,200
The school also provides lunch.

328
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,039
You're just trying to make me feel better.

329
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,079
It's okay. We'll keep the leftovers, and you can heat it up later.

330
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,079
I'll put it away for you.

331
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,079
The bus is here!

332
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,799
So soon.

333
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,319
Dan.

334
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,440
This is all I have on me.

335
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,680
It's the best I can give you.

336
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,359
Spend it on whatever you want, okay?

337
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,920
Keep it.

338
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,359
Keep it with you.

339
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,160
She's at peace now. It's okay.

340
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,119
Thank you.

341
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,839
I'll check on Dan.

342
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,359
Thank you.

343
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,599
How is it? Is it delicious?

344
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,880
You should buy another one for your dad.

345
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,839
What's his favorite flavor?

346
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,119
I don't know. I've never had ice cream with him.

347
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,640
Why don't you go inside to see my mom?

348
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,319
I don't think it's appropriate if I go in now.

349
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,000
I came here because I wanted to know if you're okay.

350
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,160
I thought you didn't want to go in because my mom's a sinner.

351
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,440
Why do you think so?

352
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,160
My mom used to say killing yourself is a grave sin.

353
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,480
She killed herself, so she's a sinner.

354
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,960
That's not the case.

355
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,240
Sometimes, people commit suicide

356
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,400
because they might want to make a sacrifice.

357
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,759
You probably don't understand.

358
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,960
You'll realize

359
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,759
when you're grown up.

360
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,319
Okay.

361
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,680
And how are you feeling now? Are you doing okay?

362
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,559
I am.

363
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,279
But recently someone has been coming to stay with me.

364
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,680
A friend?

365
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,079
Is it a friend from school?

366
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,319
No.

367
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,559
I met him at home.

368
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,039
He often spends time with me when my dad's away.

369
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,960
He always lies next to me at night

370
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,519
and takes me somewhere when I'm dreaming.

371
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,880
When you're dreaming?

372
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,119
What does he look like?

373
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,359
Hm...

374
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,960
I can't remember.

375
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,720
But he doesn't have a face.

376
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,119
I don't really enjoy it when he visits.

377
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
Eat up.

378
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,079
Why aren't you eating?

379
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,000
Dan!

380
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,799
Why aren't you eating?

381
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,200
I made this for you! So eat!

382
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,359
Eat!

383
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,920
Come on!

384
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,039
Finish it!

385
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,880
Why aren't you eating?

386
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,839
I made this for you! Be grateful!

387
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,039
You're as arrogant as your mother.

388
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,480
If you're going to be a picky eater,

389
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,559
then no dinner for you!

390
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,200
Clean it up now.

391
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,240
Clean it up if you're not going to eat it.

392
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Clean it up!

393
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,360
Dan,

394
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,119
take your medication.

395
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,719
Take it and clean everything up.

396
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,480
Dad, where are you?

397
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:20,639
Dad, help me!

398
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:23,960
Dad, help!

399
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,079
Help me, Dad!

400
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,719
Please look after Dan for me. From Vipha.

401
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,119
Thank you.

402
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,639
I already sorted out the documents.

403
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,000
The hospital will contact the district office.

404
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Thank you.

405
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Sir,

406
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,159
I'd like to stay here tonight.

407
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
Of course.

408
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,400
- Here. Eat up. - Eat up.

409
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,199
I like it.

410
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,289
Can you eat it?

411
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,039
You've gotten a lot better.

412
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,880
I'll probably lose to you this time around.

413
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,400
What are you waiting for?

414
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,289
It's your turn.

415
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,159
Dad,

416
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:20,199
have you ever loved me?

417
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,360
That's a stupid question.

418
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,880
Of course I love you.

419
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,960
Is what you did your whole life

420
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,440
something you'd call love?

421
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,079
And what do you want me to do?

422
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:37,719
What fathers should do.

423
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,920
When I needed you,

424
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,079
did you ever hold me or say you loved me?

425
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,920
I'm just a kid, Dad.

426
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,719
What kind of men hold each other?

427
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,079
I can't pamper you like your mother did.

428
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:00,920
Don't use Mom as an excuse.

429
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,719
What Mom did deserves to be called love.

430
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,119
But what you did isn't

431
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,239
even comparable to what she did.

432
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,809
If she truly loved you,

433
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:18,599
she wouldn't have abandoned you...

434
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,769
She left you!

435
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,360
Not me!

436
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,639
And you know what?

437
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:27,199
I tried my best.

438
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:31,199
I made so many sacrifices since you were born.

439
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,159
No one ever told me

440
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:36,159
being a father would be this difficult!

441
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:39,519
Are you saying that since you had me,

442
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,199
you've never been happy?

443
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,159
Ever since you were born,

444
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,360
your mother and I had the utmost happiness.

445
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,119
And you're like

446
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,320
an emotional bond between her and me.

447
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,599
So in the end,

448
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,000
I've just been a tool for you to hold Mom back.

449
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Good.

450
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,599
Good thing she left you.

451
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,599
For a horrible man like you,

452
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,119
even if there were ten of me, Mom would still leave you.

453
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:23,039
You have a sharp tongue like your mother.

454
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:24,840
Do you know something?

455
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,039
I'm very happy

456
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,199
to see you so close to death, Dad.

457
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:33,880
But it'd be better

458
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,800
if you're conscious and die a painful death.

459
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,880
You came to see me today

460
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,719
because you wanted to torment me?

461
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:55,599
I know how much you hate me.

462
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,199
But I don't need anything else now

463
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,880
except for your forgiveness.

464
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,239
Forgiveness?

465
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,280
Do you think what you did can be easily forgiven?

466
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,119
You probably don't even know

467
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:17,719
how much you've ruined my life.

468
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:20,480
Can you forgive me, Dan?

469
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:21,559
No.

470
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,400
A man like you doesn't deserve forgiveness.

471
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,719
- Can you forgive me, Dan? - No!

472
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,559
- So I can finally leave! - No!

473
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:29,639
I'm sorry.

474
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:30,719
Please forgive me!

475
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,159
Dan, please forgive me!

476
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:34,119
Shut up! I said shut up!

477
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,159
A man like you doesn't deserve a peaceful death!

478
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:41,840
I'll never forgive you!

479
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,440
No! Korn, you jerk!

480
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,719
I'll never forgive you!

481
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,159
Never, Korn!

482
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:50,280
Never!

483
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,920
It's funny, isn't it?

484
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,360
You grew up to be exactly like me.

485
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:07,239
I'm very proud of you, Dan.

486
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:55,800
You might feel like there's no one else left.

487
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,079
But there are people around you who are worried about you.

488
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,760
They're also your family.

489
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:21,320
Are you okay?

490
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,920
Hey.

491
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,440
Are you for real?

492
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,760
Is this how you're going to do it?

493
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,159
Right?

494
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,480
Today's also Sunday.

495
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:50,480
The infirmary's closed if something happens to you.

496
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,880
That's why I brought you guys with me.

497
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,719
I think it's time

498
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,840
for me to finally grow up.

499
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,920
I don't know what you've gone through.

500
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,840
Your dad just passed away.

501
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:15,239
But I never saw you cry.

502
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:16,960
You're very strong.

503
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,280
Right. I'm...

504
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,960
I'm fine.

505
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
That's enough.

506
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:38,519
Know your limits.

507
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:40,079
Don't push it.

508
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,360
I think

509
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,559
you should try swimming across the width of the pool,

510
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,599
from this side over to that side.

511
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:57,119
Mm.

512
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:41,239
Dan?

513
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:12,039
Can you tell me the truth about Trin?

514
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:14,519
I'll find it out myself

515
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:15,599
if you don't give me a straight answer.

516
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,239
I saw something following Master Joe.

517
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:23,679
Anan has something to do with Trin's disappearance?

518
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,239
That's why I want to look into it.

519
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:28,519
Do you really believe Trin died from the side effects of narcotics?

520
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:31,000
There's proof of what happened to Trin.

521
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,639
The drama club and Master Joe

522
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,639
really made me happier.
