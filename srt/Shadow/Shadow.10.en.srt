1
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,800
(Red October)

2
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,159
Attempts to demand civil rights have been

3
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,439
a catalyst in many historical events.

4
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,879
A lot of you might not understand.

5
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,519
I'll give you an example.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,560
Many years ago,

7
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,439
laborers gathered to demand an increase in the minimum wage.

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,200
So the government could be aware of the problem

9
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,239
and help find a solution.

10
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,400
This is something civilians can do

11
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,560
because everyone has equal rights.

12
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,719
The government's duty is also to serve civilians.

13
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,560
Sir.

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,239
Yes, Trin?

15
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,200
What about Red October?

16
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,359
Why did the government hunt down civilians?

17
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,799
Didn't you just say

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,599
they're supposed to serve civilians?

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,120
The reasons behind it were complicated.

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,000
There were many political hands involved.

21
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,640
It would be a very long explanation.

22
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,319
It's too complicated.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,400
A child like you won't understand.

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,479
Maybe you should try to explain to us first.

25
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,400
That way, I can find out if I understand or not.

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,280
As far as I've heard,

27
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,530
didn't someone use their authority

28
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,439
to order the military to hurt civilians?

29
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,319
(Civics)

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,530
That's enough, Trin.

31
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,240
Don't say things at random again if you don't know the truth.

32
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,960
Then tell us the truth.

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,840
Or are you too scared to say it?

34
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,759
Trin!

35
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,919
Please take this.

36
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,879
Please take this. It's about Red October.

37
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,759
Please take this.

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Please take this.

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Please take this.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,520
(Red October)

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,360
This can't happen, Brother!

42
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,039
I understand.

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
Please calm down.

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,759
Are you going to apologize to him?

45
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,719
What for?

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,479
I'm just questioning the event.

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,719
Questioning or behaving aggressively?

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,960
Why did you distribute this fake information?

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,400
What are you planning on doing?

50
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,759
It's not fake!

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,120
- Stop! Stop! - I want to expose...

52
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,639
Stop, both of you!

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
I'm going to consider this a warning.

54
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,479
If such a thing happens again,

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,400
you might be suspended.

56
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,319
Have I done such a wrong thing?

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,360
I'm only questioning an event.

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,879
It's not part of the curriculum.

59
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,280
So that's how it's supposed to be.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,080
You're student body president.

61
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,520
You have to set a good example.

62
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,639
(The Mystery of Red October)

63
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,240
All right. Today's lesson will cover our civic rights and duties.

64
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,800
Sir, what about Red October? How did it happen?

65
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,639
- That's right. What happened? - Can you tell us?

66
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,319
It's much more fascinating.

67
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,730
Can you tell us?

68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,610
Why do you want to know about this?

69
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,000
Who told you?

70
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,639
There are many books about it.

71
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,560
- That's right. - Can you tell us?

72
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,399
This is not part of the curriculum!

73
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,319
But they teach it elsewhere!

74
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,240
Why can't you?

75
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,560
It's still history.

76
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,610
(Fruitcake)

77
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
Hey, look at this.

78
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,480
Master Joe and Trin?

79
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,839
A teacher and a student? That's not right.

80
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,120
What do you think?

81
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,199
Hey! Wha...

82
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,399
Let's go!

83
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,000
(Fruitcake)

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,439
Did you actually write the letter?

85
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,439
Yes, sir.

86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,240
I wrote it.

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,040
But I didn't send it to Master Joe.

88
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,360
And there's nothing between me and him more than what we are now.

89
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,160
Didn't I tell you

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,959
you have to set a good example

91
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,040
to your peers as student body president?

92
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,759
It's just an expression of my feelings for a person.

93
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,839
Trin.

94
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,839
Then I'd like to resign from the position.

95
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,800
What utter nonsense is this?

96
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,680
It would be chaos to host another election for student body president.

97
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,839
Keep a low profile.

98
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
I'll find another way to deal with it.

99
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,519
But from now on, you are forbidden from contacting Master Joe.

100
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,160
Do you understand?

101
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,000
(Fruitcake)

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,160
Do you have any idea

103
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,399
who the culprit that stole this letter is?

104
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
Not at all.

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,600
But feel free to punish me. I'll take responsibility.

106
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,399
Master,

107
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,920
why would you take the blame for a student?

108
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,600
He wrote this to you.

109
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,279
I trust you.

110
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,079
But in any case, I'll have to cancel this year's play

111
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,680
in order to quash any rumors

112
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,040
for the sake of our school's reputation.

113
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,399
I hope you'll understand.

114
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,319
Of course.

115
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,000
Hello. Can you hear me?

116
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,840
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

117
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,210
I have an announcement to make.

118
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,600
There's going to be School Night Party this weekend.

119
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,960
New students, for your information,

120
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,120
it's our annual networking event

121
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,360
between our school and St. Mary.

122
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,120
There will be tickets on sale and performances by the Music Club.

123
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,159
More importantly, you can also invite friends from other schools.

124
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,799
This is your chance!

125
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,090
There will also be a band competition.

126
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,600
Are you part of a band?

127
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,879
Anyone?

128
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,399
And at the end, you can vote for your prom king and queen.

129
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Whoo!

130
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,039
But don't forget you still have to strictly adhere to the rules.

131
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,519
Speaking nonsense and causing panic

132
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,679
among your peers is strictly forbidden.

133
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,000
Do you understand?

134
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,559
Off to class.

135
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,399
- Thank you, sir! - Thank you, sir!

136
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,039
If you look at the history in chronological order,

137
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,240
many significant historical events happened in our country.

138
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,330
These are proof that we live in a democratic country.

139
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,879
For example,

140
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,000
the People's War.

141
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,480
That's when citizens demanded the release of political prisoners.

142
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,840
Or Bloody May

143
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,519
where people came out to protest against the government.

144
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,240
Even though there were clashes,

145
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,759
the government ultimately acquiesced.

146
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,639
Sir, what about Red October?

147
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,330
You said last year you were going to include it in the curriculum.

148
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,600
- That's right. - Why?

149
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,000
How could you say that?

150
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
We can't include random things in our curriculum!

151
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,639
The curriculum came from the Ministry of Education!

152
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,039
Spend your time focusing on other historical events first.

153
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,000
They are supposed to include it in the curriculum!

154
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,399
Hey!

155
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,679
Oh? Danai?

156
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Have you recovered?

157
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Yes, sir.

158
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,240
Good. Take your seat.

159
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,399
And don't forget the report I assigned you.

160
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,039
That's all for today.

161
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,080
What? I just got here.

162
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,840
Right. What happened just now?

163
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
It sounded like Master was telling someone off when I walked in.

164
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,960
It was nothing.

165
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,519
Someone wanted to know about Red October,

166
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,440
so he asked Master to teach us about it.

167
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,480
But Master wouldn't.

168
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,240
What's with Red October?

169
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,159
Last year,

170
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,320
Trin got into trouble with Master Manit

171
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,759
after he refused to teach about Red October like today.

172
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,679
But back then,

173
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
it was a fiasco.

174
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Right.

175
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,519
We got history homework while you were away.

176
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Really?

177
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,639
On what?

178
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,120
European history.

179
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,960
I absolutely hate it.

180
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,200
But you still have to do it.

181
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,799
I'll give you a hand.

182
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,200
Let's do some research at the library.

183
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,279
I don't understand why I have to encounter such a thing.

184
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,360
What would all of you do?

185
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,720
I think we should just tell the students.

186
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
It's part of history that already happened.

187
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,039
It shouldn't cause any damage.

188
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,200
But didn't Brother Anurak order us not to teach it to the students?

189
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,200
We'll be in trouble if the ministry finds out we spoke of it.

190
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,720
That bad?

191
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,200
That's what I heard.

192
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,720
It's quite a big deal.

193
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:35,240
Ignore it, Manit. The students will forget it eventually.

194
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,519
(Red October)

195
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,720
(Red October)

196
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,559
Hey, what's this?

197
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,080
Shoot.

198
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,879
I completely forgot

199
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,960
Trin wrote a summary of Red October.

200
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,679
This is it.

201
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,639
I wonder who stuck it here.

202
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,639
I didn't read it back then.

203
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,159
Trin only made a few copies.

204
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
They were all confiscated.

205
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,720
I think there definitely was a massacre at our school.

206
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,679
How is that possible?

207
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,360
Red October didn't happen in here.

208
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,360
(School Building)

209
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,919
I don't think I did a good job,

210
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,480
especially during the second half.

211
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,000
It's okay.

212
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,519
It'll be a bit difficult.

213
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:56,759
The thing is, Hamlet has to pretend he's insane

214
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,039
to lure his own uncle into revealing the truth about who killed his dad.

215
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,840
But when he went too deep,

216
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,480
he started

217
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,159
to really lose his mind.

218
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,039
So the challenge is

219
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,200
how you're going to take a step further and relate to the character.

220
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,960
Sir, do you know

221
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,000
why Hamlet does that?

222
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,159
Why does he have to pretend to be insane to uncover the truth?

223
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,799
Because an insane person

224
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,399
does unexpected things.

225
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,960
It's going to be a bit difficult.

226
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,480
But if you can pull it off,

227
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,559
our play this year will be great.

228
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,879
I'll try, sir.

229
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,720
Good.

230
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,320
- Well then. I have to go. - Yes, sir.

231
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,159
You still haven't answered me.

232
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,879
- Ask her! - Ask her!

233
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,890
- Ask her! - Ask her!

234
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
What's going on?

235
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,410
- Ask her! - Ask her!

236
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,680
Can you be my date for the School Night Party?

237
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:19,650
- Say yes! - Say yes!

238
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,559
That's it.

239
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,759
Have you guys found a date?

240
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm afraid you'll have to be each other's dates.

241
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,759
Is that what you want to be my concern?

242
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,200
There's something we need to do that day.

243
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,039
Right.

244
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,920
Then should we talk it now...

245
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,759
Josh!

246
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,240
Okay. I'll start.

247
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,039
There are two things I want you to help with.

248
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,410
First, Josh.

249
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,680
I want you to take Trin's dream journal from Brother's office.

250
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
You can still bribe Uncle Rerng, can't you?

251
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,559
Sure. Easy-peasy.

252
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,720
(Administrative Office)

253
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,839
Second, Nai.

254
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,240
Find the rehearsal video Master Joe filmed from Trin's year.

255
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,079
Master Joe recorded during Trin's year.

256
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,279
It should be in the club's storeroom.

257
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,680
(Rehearsal Recording "Lord of the Flies")

258
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,559
As for me,

259
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,170
I'll deal with the photo.

260
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,650
I'll ask Cha-aim to photocopy it outside the school.

261
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
I'll talk to her.

262
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,119
(Trin Dhevawijitra)

263
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,720
What? How come I don't get to talk to Cha-aim?

264
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,519
Is this really the time, Josh?

265
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,440
(Photocopy)

266
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,410
All right. That's the plan.

267
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,240
Once we've got everything,

268
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,440
we'll figure out the cues.

269
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,240
So? Can you draw it?

270
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,440
It's super easy to trace this kind of linework.

271
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,720
- All right. I have to go. - Okay.

272
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,200
Oh, Dan.

273
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,599
Have you finished

274
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,920
reading the book I lent you?

275
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,039
Oh.

276
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,519
I haven't even started.

277
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,410
I haven't had much time lately.

278
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,599
You can take it back for now.

279
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,440
I'll borrow it again once I have time.

280
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,599
Sure.

281
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,599
Anyway, thanks for the help.

282
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,890
Oh.

283
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,279
Okay.

284
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,440
(There are things we can't see that emit light)

285
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,440
(and are powerful like spirits.)

286
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,400
(Like my feeling for you, I hope you feel the same way.)

287
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,119
Josh.

288
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,519
Josh!

289
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,519
- What's wrong? - I'm sulking!

290
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,119
Why?

291
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,119
Because I talked to Cha-aim?

292
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Yes!

293
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,720
Oh, Romeo. Such a sulky boy.

294
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,880
It's just business.

295
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,640
Right?

296
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,720
I've been giving you space. Why would you sulk?

297
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,200
- Oh? - Josh?

298
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:10,799
Josh.

299
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,640
It's okay.

300
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
He needs a top-up by the looks of things.

301
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,759
Do you think our plan's going to work?

302
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,920
Are you stressed about it?

303
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,119
I want to take you to this place so you'll feel better.

304
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,319
Where?

305
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,640
Just come along.

306
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,319
Have you found a date for School Night Party?

307
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,759
Not yet. Why?

308
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,119
I want to tell you

309
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,400
someone wants you to be their date at the event.

310
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,359
Who?

311
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,279
You'll find out that day.

312
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,240
What's up with you?

313
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,279
Well, it's true.

314
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,440
Tell me.

315
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,079
- No. - Come on.

316
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,079
You'll find out then.

317
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,880
- Tell me! - Ow!

318
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,799
I'm sorry!

319
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,839
It's okay.

320
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,759
Sometimes I forgot as well.

321
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,440
I don't want you to get hurt like this again.

322
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,440
Can I be honest with you?

323
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,119
Sure.

324
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,799
Actually,

325
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,680
I don't want us to expose this like we're doing right now.

326
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,160
I've constantly been wondering

327
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,200
why we're doing

328
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,640
all of these things.

329
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
For righteousness?

330
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,200
What if we uncover the truth?

331
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,519
Is it really going to change anything?

332
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,839
I believe in you.

333
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,960
But I just want you to be careful.

334
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,599
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

335
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,400
Thanks so much.

336
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
But I believe

337
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,079
these strange encounters

338
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,480
came to me so I can prove and expose some kind of truth.

339
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,319
Regardless of the outcome,

340
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,000
it's just as you said.

341
00:26:58,759 --> 00:26:59,839
Give it a go.

342
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,400
I'll stay by your side.

343
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Thanks.

344
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,839
We should go back.

345
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,680
It's getting dark.

346
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,759
All right.

347
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Oh?

348
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,440
(Saint Louis House)

349
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,359
Is it already curfew?

350
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,519
Right?

351
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,720
Hey, ladies! Where have you been?

352
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Right? You got back late. Where were you?

353
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,440
The door's locked.

354
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,559
Where are you going to stay the night now?

355
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,440
What right do you have to lock the door?

356
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,880
We're your seniors. So watch your tone

357
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,119
if you don't want Brother to hear about this.

358
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,920
Do you think we're scared of you?

359
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,839
You came back late

360
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,839
and keep causing problems.

361
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,839
Who do you think Brother's going to believe?

362
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,119
Us or you weenies?

363
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,799
This won't do.

364
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,759
Our plan can't fall through.

365
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,960
What's all this whispering?

366
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,480
What do you want?

367
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,519
You can stay here tonight.

368
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,319
Why did you let them have their way?

369
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,079
I had to.

370
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,279
If they tell on us,

371
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,400
we won't be able to go to School Night Party,

372
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:31,880
and our plan will fall through.

373
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,480
Well, that's true.

374
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,000
Anan's such a jerk.

375
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,240
Brother ordered him to leave me alone.

376
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,880
So he told his cronies to harass me instead.

377
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,599
Sometimes, there's a fine line

378
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,799
between a clever person

379
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,920
and a jerk.

380
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
Are you complimenting him?

381
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,319
Yes.

382
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,559
I am.

383
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,039
He's as sharp as a tack.

384
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,240
I'm tired.

385
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,359
Go to sleep then.

386
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,359
You can lean on me.

387
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,559
Aren't you tired?

388
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Not yet.

389
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,119
Probably soon though.

390
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,839
Dan,

391
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,480
thank you

392
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,599
for staying by my side.

393
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,480
Why would you thank me?

394
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,880
I haven't even done anything.

395
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,640
I feel safe

396
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,720
when I'm with you.

397
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm sorry.

398
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Hey.

399
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,839
It's okay.

400
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,000
There are a lot of kids here for the event tonight.

401
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:31,319
I'd like the police to keep an eye on things.

402
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,960
Why are you standing here all alone?

403
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,440
I know. I don't have a date.

404
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,119
What about Dan?

405
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,839
I don't know.

406
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,319
He said he'd find me a date.

407
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,240
He told me to come to the party first

408
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,960
and that he'll bring them along.

409
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,440
A blind date?

410
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,559
Are you excited?

411
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,199
More like stressed.

412
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,639
I don't know who he's going to bring.

413
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:15,400
Come and hang with us for now so you won't get lonely.

414
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,039
Okay.

415
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,559
Oh? Dan?

416
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,599
He looks super handsome!

417
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,599
So? Where's my date?

418
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,039
He's standing right in front of you.

419
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:01,119
Jeez.

420
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,960
I'm kidding.

421
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:15,480
This social event is an annual tradition.

422
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,360
Its objective is

423
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,599
to strengthen the bond between the two schools

424
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,920
and to celebrate the friendship among us.

425
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,400
In order to maintain our tradition,

426
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,880
I'd like all of you to adhere to the rules.

427
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:35,599
Without further ado, I shall officially begin the event.

428
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:01,039
Okay. It's almost time.

429
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,440
Guys, sync your watches.

430
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,329
We'll be far from each other. Communication is impossible.

431
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:08,639
I'll turn off the lights at 10:30 p.m.

432
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:11,920
Carry out the plan once the video's finished.

433
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,840
Let's go.

434
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,289
- Hey. - Oh? Do you want a piece of me?

435
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,639
- Huh? - Oh?

436
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,920
- What? - Who turned off the lights?

437
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,920
What is this clip?

438
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,840
Gosh. Who do you think it is?

439
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,599
I see a pile of dead bodies.

440
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,559
And I feel

441
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,809
like it's here.

442
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,769
There were dead people at our school.

443
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,639
My friend that hanged herself on the big tree

444
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,719
must've suffered a lot.

445
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,519
It's as if it's happened to me.

446
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:06,159
And every time I see these visions,

447
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,559
one particular person is always present.

448
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,719
And that person is...

449
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:12,920
(Murderer)

450
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,159
The one-armed man.

451
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,809
Who made Trin disappear?

452
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:20,440
Who did that?

453
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:23,000
- What a stupid joke! - It was Trin?

454
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:25,239
(Murdered)

455
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,440
(Anan Wattanapitaktep)

456
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:19,519
Do you think we've caused things to get out of hand?

457
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,559
It's already come to this.

458
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,289
Whatever happens, happens.

459
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,480
Brother Anurak,

460
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,719
can I ask you to keep this from my dad?

461
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,079
I've been looking forward to this moment for so long!

462
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:39,289
We made an oath to Brother to leave each other alone!

463
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,719
But didn't you start messing with me first?

464
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,769
Cha-aim!
