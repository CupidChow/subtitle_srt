1
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,239
Why?

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,760
I don't think this method's going to help me.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
So what do you want to do then?

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,480
I'm going cold turkey.

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,000
I heard it can help you recover faster.

6
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,159
Trin, you've been on your medication for many years.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,439
It's very dangerous to just go cold turkey.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,359
I'll ask a doctor from the hospital to see if there's another way.

9
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,560
I'm begging you.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,759
Excuse me.

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,240
All good.

12
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,240
He should feel better after a good rest.

13
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,280
Thank you very much.

14
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,199
And I'm sorry for waking you up in the middle of the night.

15
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,599
It's okay.

16
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,960
Anyway, excuse me.

17
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Ms. Kamon.

18
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,560
Yes?

19
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,719
Don't forget we can't let anyone know about this.

20
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,199
Yes, Brother.

21
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,479
What happened this time?

22
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,080
I just went out to find a place to draw, sir.

23
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,400
I don't know when Anan started following me.

24
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,159
How many times have I told you not to go out to the lake?

25
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,199
I admit I was wrong in that regard.

26
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,039
You can punish me however you want.

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,080
But as for Anan,

28
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,039
I was only defending myself.

29
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
Sir.

30
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,039
What's the matter?

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,520
Sir,

32
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,639
he tried to kill me.

33
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
Shut your mouth.

34
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,560
Stop arguing, both of you.

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Anan,

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,159
why did you go out to the lake?

37
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,680
Someone from the dorm told me Dan disappeared.

38
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,159
So I went out to look for him.

39
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,840
You? You're worried about me?

40
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,960
Yes!

41
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,080
If something terrible happens and no one's there to help you,

42
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,800
I'd be in trouble again.

43
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,919
Because no one can find fault

44
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,240
with someone like you anyway...

45
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,319
Stop!

46
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,240
Let's do it this way if you're not going to tell the truth.

47
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,319
You two can make an oath in front of God

48
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,199
to keep your distance and refrain from fighting each other.

49
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,439
If you disagree

50
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,079
and something like this happens again,

51
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,480
I'm going to call your parents.

52
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,730
I swear...

53
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,680
I swear I'll leave him alone.

54
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,439
I swear I'll leave Anan alone.

55
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,730
- Hello, Master. - Oh.

56
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,170
Hello, Brother.

57
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,439
Are these the winners of the drawing competition?

58
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,560
How did the students do this year?

59
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,959
Great. I've been trying to encourage their creativity during class time.

60
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,839
So they'll have more courage to draw outside of the box.

61
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,040
I really enjoy it, but I don't know if the judges from over there will.

62
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,279
You know they can be quite conservative.

63
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,639
Here. Have a look at this. I like this one. It got fifth place.

64
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
This one's also beautiful.

65
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,399
Very artistic.

66
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,759
Oh. But I like this one the best.

67
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,040
It's Dan's work.

68
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
I think he has potential.

69
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,480
Anyway, I have to get back to work.

70
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,120
Slow down. I can't keep up with you.

71
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,480
And why would you copy my drawing?

72
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,720
Draw something of your own.

73
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,000
Our styles are different anyway.

74
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,879
But I haven't discovered mine.

75
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Then draw from your own feelings.

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,079
Your individualism will come out eventually.

77
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,839
Have you been reading too many inspirational quotes?

78
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,480
That sounded so cool.

79
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,040
What's with you? Are you possessed by Van Gogh?

80
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,040
And what's with you? Keep drawing.

81
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,040
Just do it.

82
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,839
- Oh? - Oh?

83
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,560
- Hello. - Hello.

84
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,160
Uh...

85
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,360
You can say it, ma'am. He's my best friend.

86
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,959
Oh, okay.

87
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,319
Has your wound healed?

88
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,199
It's better now.

89
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,120
Come and see me at the infirmary if you have any strange symptoms.

90
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,480
I will, ma'am.

91
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,360
- Anyway, I have to go. - Yes, ma'am.

92
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,279
We don't get to see Ms. Kamon much.

93
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,439
Yeah.

94
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,560
She's been keeping to herself

95
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,480
since her daughter passed away.

96
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,839
You don't know?

97
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Ms. Kamon had a daughter.

98
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,600
They lived together.

99
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,840
Her daughter would help out at the infirmary sometimes.

100
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,759
But one day,

101
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,159
someone found she had hung herself

102
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,330
off a big tree behind the school.

103
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,639
Since then,

104
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,450
Ms. Kamon's been coming here to pray every day.

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,480
She probably feels guilty

106
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,120
and thinks she was the reason

107
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,799
why her daughter killed herself.

108
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,639
I feel sorry for her.

109
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,960
What was the daughter's name?

110
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,879
I don't know.

111
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,960
I never talked to her.

112
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,210
I only saw her in passing.

113
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,399
I never saw her talking to anyone either.

114
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,679
Except...

115
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,600
with Trin.

116
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,559
Trin?

117
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,210
They were probably close as well.

118
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,519
How sad.

119
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,240
He had to find out his friend died like that.

120
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,679
It's very sad.

121
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,519
The incident with Master Joe hadn't even quietened down,

122
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,919
then his close friend died.

123
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,120
Not long after that,

124
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,720
Trin started acting strange and delirious.

125
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,210
Go.

126
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,639
Get out.

127
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Get out.

128
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,639
Go!

129
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,960
Get out!

130
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,399
Get out!

131
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,090
Get out!

132
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,210
Get out.

133
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Get out.

134
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,279
So Brother Anurak summoned him to his office.

135
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
So that means Trin was Brother Anurak's patient?

136
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,000
I guess so.

137
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,840
Trin was having counseling sessions with Brother Anurak for bipolar.

138
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,480
Then Brother must have his treatment log.

139
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,080
He had to make a record of every session.

140
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,000
Isn't this a little too risky?

141
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,159
We won't find out anything if we don't try.

142
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,960
All done. Aren't I good?

143
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,960
What lie did you tell Uncle Rerng this time?

144
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,120
I just told him I wanted my confiscated item back.

145
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,600
He's not going to tell on us, is he?

146
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:06,440
No, I already took care of him. A joint for a smile.

147
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,720
I think we should hurry.

148
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,159
Be quick.

149
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,120
It's locked.

150
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,200
Did you find it?

151
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,559
Hurry up.

152
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,919
Someone's coming!

153
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,279
Hide!

154
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,159
Here. I'd like you to take this over for me.

155
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
No problem.

156
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,559
The lake is full of dangerous occurrences.

157
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,919
Yeah.

158
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360
We'll have to implement an absolute restriction.

159
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,639
Please handle Anan for me.

160
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Of course. I'll keep an eye on him.

161
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,759
And are you still okay with Danai?

162
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,399
It's been quite challenging.

163
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,720
I've been trying to convince him to accept my treatment.

164
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,320
I have a feeling he hasn't been telling me the whole truth recently.

165
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,639
Let me know if I can help with anything.

166
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Thank you.

167
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,639
- We should leave. It's late. - Yes, Brother.

168
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,960
Did you hear something?

169
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,759
I don't think so.

170
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,720
What noise was that?

171
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,240
Let's go. I must've been hearing things.

172
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,359
The cabinets are old. They probably creak.

173
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,559
The ones in my office do too.

174
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,600
I might've to ask Rerng to check on them.

175
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,200
How do you zoom in?

176
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,960
I'll show you.

177
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,080
Press this.

178
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Here.

179
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,039
Dan, why are the photos so blurry?

180
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,279
Well, we were in such a rush. It's fine as long as it's legible.

181
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
Let me have a look.

182
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,120
"I saw dozens of people die because of the one-armed man."

183
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,039
"And that includes my best friend."

184
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,519
"Aren't you going to take responsibility, Brother?"

185
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,679
"Think about it carefully. Why do you insist on keeping it secret?"

186
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,240
"I'm not talking nonsense."

187
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,080
"I'll prove it if you don't believe me."

188
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,559
"Once I've recovered from what I have,"

189
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,559
"I'll bring you proof to confirm I'm not insane."

190
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,639
"You can look forward to that day."

191
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,919
"Trin."

192
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,840
My best friend?

193
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,360
Who was it?

194
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,519
He didn't have that many friends.

195
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Josh,

196
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,600
who do you think Trin got the weed from?

197
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,639
Was it the same guy you go to?

198
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,240
It's possible.

199
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,440
I only know of one supplier here.

200
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,879
Take me to him.

201
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,039
Hey.

202
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,440
For real?

203
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,240
Right. I called Bancha.

204
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,039
He's always at home. He said we can just drop by.

205
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,879
Let's visit him this Saturday.

206
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Guys,

207
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,119
I have a date with Cha-aim.

208
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Huh?

209
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,650
I have a date with Cha-aim.

210
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,440
What? Speak properly.

211
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,720
I have a date with Cha-aim. Happy?

212
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,480
Wow, you're getting out of hand.

213
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,170
She agreed to go with you?

214
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,720
Where are you taking her?

215
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,039
I still don't know.

216
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,480
I don't feel confident at all.

217
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm worried I won't know what to say and things will be awkward.

218
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,170
Just be yourself.

219
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,839
She's given you a chance. What is there to be scared of?

220
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,920
There's actually nothing.

221
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,799
He's super predictable.

222
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,240
He's not worried or anything.

223
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,519
He just wants to brag about it. Isn't that right, Josh?

224
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,359
- I'm not bragging. I was just... - Braggart!

225
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,240
- I was just telling a story! Why? - Braggart!

226
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,200
- I will splash it! Come on! - Braggart!

227
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,799
- Stop your bragging! Josh! - What?

228
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,959
- Braggart! - Stop it!

229
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Aren't I right, Dan?

230
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,118
What's with you?

231
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,119
Oh?

232
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,480
Where's he off to now?

233
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,799
Hey.

234
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,559
Let my friend go!

235
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,039
- Dan! - Shoot!

236
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,200
Dan!

237
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,680
Are you okay?

238
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,279
What on earth was that?

239
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:58,440
Okay. Can anyone tell me what just happened?

240
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,119
I didn't smoke too much weed, did I?

241
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,440
Why did you run over there?

242
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,720
I saw a girl standing there with her back turned to me.

243
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,960
Then she disappeared all of a sudden.

244
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,170
So I thought she wanted me to follow her.

245
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:24,599
But when I followed her, it was like something was strangling me.

246
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,759
I couldn't breathe.

247
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,720
Then it was just what you saw.

248
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,170
Dan,

249
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,839
the girl you saw was

250
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,359
Ms. Kamon's daughter.

251
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,170
It's actually not important who she was.

252
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,759
But what I'm worried about

253
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,200
is that you've seen actual ghosts twice now.

254
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,960
This definitely isn't a good thing.

255
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,839
Dan, what have you done?

256
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,319
Why did the ghost have to go this far with you?

257
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,240
Thinking back,

258
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,199
it all started when I lost the lucid dream ring,

259
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,599
and Trin brought it back to me.

260
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,319
I think

261
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,170
we should find a solution to this now.

262
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,559
I'm worried you might get hurt.

263
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,200
I'll find a way to help you.

264
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,079
I think so too.

265
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,559
You can't be all alone now.

266
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,559
You're not hurt, are you?

267
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,680
How could he just suspend in mid-air?

268
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,519
Well,

269
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,640
what are we going to do today?

270
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Uh...

271
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,880
Should we get some dessert?

272
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,319
Yeah. Sure.

273
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,319
What are you looking at?

274
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
Nothing.

275
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,559
Well, you're cute.

276
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Yeah.

277
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
- Oh. - That's it.

278
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,480
What have you been reading?

279
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Josh,

280
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,838
are we really going to talk about books?

281
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,960
You don't have to push it.

282
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,559
But I'm actually curious.

283
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,519
Okay.

284
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,039
Well then. You have to read it

285
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,720
if I tell you.

286
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,119
Sure.

287
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,960
"The Switch of Love."

288
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,680
Where are Dan and Nai?

289
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,440
Today...

290
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,640
Oh, Dan probably has rehearsal, and I guess Nai's helping him out.

291
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,640
I see.

292
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,519
Why?

293
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Nothing. You guys are usually like three peas in a pod.

294
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,039
Not really.

295
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Yeah.

296
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,680
Are you bored when you're with me?

297
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,160
Oh, not at all.

298
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,759
I was just wondering.

299
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,160
Right. Should we check that place out?

300
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,759
I heard they sell comics too.

301
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,359
You might like them.

302
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,759
Are you sure you're not bored?

303
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,759
I'm really not bored.

304
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,559
It's fun to be around you.

305
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,640
- Okay. Let's go. - Yeah.

306
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,319
I'm done with this. Come on. Let's go.

307
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Okay.

308
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Let's go.

309
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,759
Okay.

310
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,160
After you.

311
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
This way.

312
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,640
Are you in love or high on weed?

313
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,160
Love is like weed.

314
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,640
It can drive people crazy as well.

315
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,359
Have you been reading inspirational quotes again?

316
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,359
Don't tease me.

317
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,240
You're not in love. You wouldn't understand.

318
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,559
I'm happy to see my friend happy.

319
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,240
All right.

320
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,519
And what about you?

321
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,519
Do you have a crush on anyone?

322
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,559
You're good-looking.

323
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,119
You could land anyone.

324
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,519
If I were you...

325
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
I don't know.

326
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,279
I'm serious.

327
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
I know.

328
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,799
My hands are full of problems. How would I find the time?

329
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
Are you...

330
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,079
Are you gay?

331
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,759
What's up with you?

332
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,160
- Are you into guys? - Shut up.

333
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,799
- You can tell me. - Why?

334
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,839
I don't have a girlfriend. So does that mean I'm gay?

335
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,440
No. So I'd know in case you're into guys.

336
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,440
What are you two talking about?

337
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,000
And what are you here for?

338
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,960
Can I borrow your shirt?

339
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,200
I hung mine up when I was showering, but it fell and got soaked.

340
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,799
Sure. Go ahead and pick something.

341
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,880
Is the bathroom free now?

342
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
It is now.

343
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,240
It's time to hit the showers.

344
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Shut up.

345
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,079
Let's shower.

346
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,240
In the closet?

347
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,839
On the rack.

348
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,599
All right. In the closet then.

349
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,279
You're hard-working.

350
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,240
- Nai. - What?

351
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,200
Do you think there was an incident

352
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,480
where heaps of people died at our school?

353
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,480
I don't know.

354
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,359
But as far as I've seen,

355
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,160
there are a lot of spirits around.

356
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,880
But aren't there a lot of dead people

357
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,039
everywhere anyway?

358
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:35,319
Are you still thinking about Trin's treatment log?

359
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Yes.

360
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
It's bugging me.

361
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,559
Right. I just remembered.

362
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,119
What?

363
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,559
I took Trin's treatment log

364
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,839
with me by mistake.

365
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,680
Are we going to get in trouble?

366
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,960
I don't know.

367
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,920
Let's find a way to return it later.

368
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,039
(Trin Dhevawijitra)

369
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,799
Trin Dhevawijitra's treatment log,

370
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,160
September 15, 1998.

371
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,558
During our last conversation, you mentioned seeing

372
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,119
strange and horrifying images in your head.

373
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,319
How is it now?

374
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Trin?

375
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Yes?

376
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,319
Pardon?

377
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,599
Do you still see those visions you mentioned last time?

378
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,359
I do, sir.

379
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,440
But I'm not sure what's in my head

380
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,039
and what's real anymore.

381
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,079
Close your eyes

382
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,279
and tell me what you see now.

383
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,839
Can I just fast forward it?

384
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,680
Hey, don't.

385
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,880
No. No!

386
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,079
Focus.

387
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,720
What do you see?

388
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,279
I see a pile of dead bodies.

389
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,920
And I feel like it's here.

390
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,920
There were dead people at our school.

391
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,920
My friend that hanged herself on the big tree

392
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,640
must've suffered a lot. It's as if it's happened to me.

393
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,319
And every time I see these visions,

394
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,599
one particular person is always present.

395
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,920
And that person is

396
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,440
the one-armed man.

397
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,319
- Huh? - Hey.

398
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,039
Let him do it.

399
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Here it is.

400
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,240
Have you ever dreamed of seeing these before?

401
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,400
No, sir. That was the first time.

402
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,279
Then I'd like to keep this.

403
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,799
I want to compare and analyze it to your previous dreams.

404
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Yes, sir.

405
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,720
Is there anything else that's bothering you?

406
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
No, sir.

407
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,480
Then give me a bit of time.

408
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,839
Yes, sir.

409
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,039
Well then. I should go.

410
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,799
Trin Dhevawijitra's treatment log,

411
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,200
September 15, 1998.

412
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,920
No. No!

413
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,119
Focus.

414
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,759
What do you see?

415
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,359
I see a pile of dead bodies.

416
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:52,000
And I feel like it's here.

417
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,319
There were dead people at our school.

418
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,079
My friend that hanged herself on the big tree

419
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,160
must've suffered a lot.

420
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,480
It's as if it's happened to me.

421
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,559
Shoot!

422
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,239
What's going on here?

423
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,840
Hey, help!

424
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,239
You can't do anything to me.

425
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,769
You're awake, Trin.

426
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,599
Did you see hallucinations again?

427
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,599
I'm serious.

428
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,480
You have to get help at a psychiatric hospital.

429
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,920
This isn't normal.

430
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,079
I'm not insane, sir.

431
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,809
I really saw them.

432
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,960
Those spirits are here.

433
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,239
Why aren't you listening to me?

434
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,639
Your parents are on the way.

435
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,480
I came here to keep you company.

436
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,000
Excuse me. Let me clean the wound.

437
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,769
Why didn't you listen to Brother Anurak?

438
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,159
Do you know I'm very worried about you?

439
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,159
Why didn't you come in to visit me that day?

440
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,880
You know

441
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,440
Brother was there.

442
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:33,440
We wouldn't be able to talk anyway if I went in.

443
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,159
Please don't be angry with me.

444
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,559
Do you believe what I said

445
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,559
about the things I've seen?

446
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,079
If what you said

447
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,679
can't be proven,

448
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,840
I won't be able to believe you wholeheartedly.

449
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,840
I'll find a way to prove

450
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,239
that what I saw

451
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:24,159
weren't hallucinations.

452
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,920
And I'm not insane.

453
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,519
Sir, do you know the one-armed man?

454
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,679
Help!

455
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:08,440
What actually happened at our school?

456
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,769
What do you mean by that?

457
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,719
What are you hiding from me?

458
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:14,079
Do you think Trin disappeared

459
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,239
because of the witch doctor?

460
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,479
The mind of the person treated this way

461
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,440
will be expanded

462
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:26,199
until they might be able to connect with some things,

463
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:27,329
especially

464
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,719
- Stop talking about this - evil beings.

465
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,329
or I'm going to expel you!
