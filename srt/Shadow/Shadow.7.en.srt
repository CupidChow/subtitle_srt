1
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,160
Who do you think you are?

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,480
Come out if you dare!

3
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,850
Trin?

4
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,080
Who are you, moron?

5
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,080
- Anan! Calm down! - Stop at once!

6
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,879
Hey.

7
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,170
What happened? Who's going to talk first?

8
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,439
All right. If no one's going to say anything...

9
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,839
Danai,

10
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,800
what were you doing before the fight broke out?

11
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,639
I just went inside the funhouse.

12
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,639
That's it. Then he punched me.

13
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
You're lying.

14
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,360
Do you think I don't know you were pranking me?

15
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,879
What did I do? I didn't even do anything to you!

16
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,879
- You... - Stop!

17
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,920
According to eyewitnesses,

18
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,959
you're fully in the wrong, Anan.

19
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,639
Everyone saw you punching Danai.

20
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,610
But Danai, no one knows what happened in the funhouse.

21
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,720
I still can't trust you.

22
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,399
Master Surat, as for Dan's case,

23
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,040
he's a student in my care.

24
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,839
His punishment is also up to my discretion.

25
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,720
I'd like to take it over from here.

26
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,079
As for Anan, feel free to deal with him as you see fit.

27
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,040
Dan, we'll continue this conversation.

28
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
This feels

29
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,879
rather familiar, Brother Anurak.

30
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,319
And what's your problem?

31
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,800
Uh, Brother. I'll deal with him for you.

32
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,439
His father is coming to talk to me tomorrow anyway.

33
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,000
He's in your hands now, Master Surat.

34
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,879
Come, Dan.

35
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,319
Is that really all that happened?

36
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,319
Yes, sir.

37
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,439
Dan,

38
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,959
you can tell me the truth.

39
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,360
It's just the two of us now.

40
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,759
I saw Trin in the mirror.

41
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,959
He took me into the funhouse.

42
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,680
You told me to tell the truth.

43
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,560
So this is it.

44
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,279
Fine.

45
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
If that's what you insist on saying.

46
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,199
But you have to accept the fact

47
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,879
that I have to continue to treat you based on my discretion.

48
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,600
And how have

49
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,800
you been sleeping recently?

50
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,600
You think I hallucinate, don't you?

51
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I've gotten better.

52
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,319
Sometimes it takes a while to fall asleep, but I still do in the end.

53
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,959
Bring your dream journal

54
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,399
to our next meeting.

55
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,759
So I can have a look at it.

56
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
I haven't been recording my dreams much recently.

57
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,959
I don't really have strange dreams anymore.

58
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,680
Even though you don't,

59
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,560
it's still a good idea to record it

60
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,560
so I can continue to analyze your dreams.

61
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Yes, sir.

62
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,959
Well then. I'd like to excuse myself.

63
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Dan?

64
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,639
Why are you still up?

65
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,839
You might get caught.

66
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,639
Well...

67
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,560
I want to talk to you about something,

68
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,439
but I don't want anyone else to hear.

69
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,480
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,399
I didn't expect my plan

71
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,679
to cause things to get so out of hand.

72
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Just forget it.

73
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,960
I already knew.

74
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,399
You knew?

75
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,120
How did you?

76
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,210
And since when?

77
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,480
Just zip up your bag properly next time.

78
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,399
And there's no need to apologize to me.

79
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,799
I got unlucky

80
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,519
running into that jerk.

81
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,240
Let me ask you something.

82
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,240
If you couldn't run out of the funhouse in time,

83
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,960
what would you do?

84
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,919
Would you get into a fistfight with him?

85
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,639
He wouldn't dare.

86
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,759
He was scared out of his mind

87
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,330
after seeing Trin's mask.

88
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,210
I wish you could've seen his face.

89
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,399
He was so horrified.

90
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,720
What if he finds out it was you?

91
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,210
I don't care.

92
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,360
I was going to take the mask off at first.

93
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,039
What makes you so confident?

94
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,759
This. It's my leverage.

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
If he does anything to me again,

96
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,679
I'm going to photocopy it,

97
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,679
and the whole school's going to find out.

98
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,360
You're evil.

99
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,210
Should I be scared of you?

100
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,960
I wasn't sure at first

101
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,759
about Anan and Ms. Yada.

102
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,330
But my suspicion was confirmed

103
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,799
when I saw his reaction in the funhouse.

104
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,279
Those two had

105
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,120
something to do with Trin.

106
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,679
Come on.

107
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,720
Let's head back to the dorm.

108
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,159
Can I stay here for a little bit?

109
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,799
It was probably one of the few times

110
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,679
we got to be happy.

111
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,159
Thank you for helping me remember

112
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,200
we used to feel this way.

113
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,639
(School Building)

114
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,960
What's going on now?

115
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
It might sound like I'm making an excuse.

116
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,879
But I never taught him

117
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,799
to behave in such a way.

118
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,480
No one in my family behaves this way.

119
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,639
Feel free to slap him if he does it again.

120
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,399
Please calm down. Don't worry.

121
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,799
Look at him. He's as pale as a ghost around his dad.

122
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,679
I haven't seen him like this in ages.

123
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,279
Right? Like during Trin's incident.

124
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,320
- I have to go now. - That's true. I think you're right.

125
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,159
- Go back to class. - So satisfying.

126
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,879
- This is so satisfying. - Yeah.

127
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,480
He's so scared of his dad.

128
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,879
He's so harsh with him.

129
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,679
Hey.

130
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,240
Aren't we leaving?

131
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,039
I'm off then.

132
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,200
Thank you very much.

133
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,519
Okay. For this class,

134
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,440
I'd like all of you to make a sketch of this sculpture.

135
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,399
Don't worry if you're right or wrong

136
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,200
or if it's beautiful or not.

137
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,639
I only want to see your foundation.

138
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
All right?

139
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,840
I guess this is easy-peasy for you.

140
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
Why?

141
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,120
You're constantly drawing.

142
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,960
I only draw random things.

143
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,120
I draw whatever I see in my dreams.

144
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,840
I suck at drawing.

145
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,799
I only know how to draw stick figures.

146
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,799
Can you teach me?

147
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,919
Just draw. Stick figures are fine.

148
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,240
Didn't Master say it himself?

149
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,879
There's no right or wrong.

150
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,519
It's not true.

151
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,960
During an art class in elementary school,

152
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,240
the teacher told us to draw whatever we wanted.

153
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,879
But I ended up having to take a supplementary exam.

154
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,279
I was so confused.

155
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,039
That I understand.

156
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,360
Huh?

157
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,080
Is everyone okay?

158
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,519
I'm sorry, sir.

159
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,559
It's okay.

160
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,600
Good thing no one got hurt.

161
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,919
Can any of you help me lift it back onto the table?

162
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,240
Come on. We'll help each other.

163
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,360
Can someone get a broom and clean up the shards?

164
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,919
Allow me, sir.

165
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,319
A sketch of this sculpture...

166
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,759
Don't worry if you're right or wrong

167
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,279
or if it's beautiful or not.

168
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,599
I only want to see your foundation.

169
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,599
All right?

170
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,720
Relax and draw whatever for this week.

171
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,410
Are you okay?

172
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,839
You didn't wait for me. Did your class finish early?

173
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,410
You were late.

174
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,440
What's wrong? You look pale.

175
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,410
And what's wrong with you?

176
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,079
Are you on crack or something? You seem energetic.

177
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,519
I'm not, you moron. You know nothing.

178
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,960
And so what? Can't I be happy sometimes?

179
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,650
I have to go. See you at drama club.

180
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,319
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

181
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,410
I'm going to go and read.

182
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,240
What are you reading? Let me see.

183
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,720
Did Cha-aim give it to you?

184
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,440
Yes, ages ago.

185
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,039
Does she like reading?

186
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,519
What does she like to read?

187
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,319
Can you tell me?

188
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,319
- Do you discuss books often? - Come on.

189
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,680
Where?

190
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,559
- Hey, no! - Dan!

191
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,039
Dan, no!

192
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,839
I'm worried about him.

193
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Yeah.

194
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,920
I don't want him to end up like Trin.

195
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,440
How dare you!

196
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,279
You're a busybody, aren't you?

197
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,079
- Hold on! - You think you're so tough!

198
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,079
Anan, calm down!

199
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,920
- Calm down! - What's wrong with you?

200
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
- What are you doing? - You!

201
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,240
What did I do?

202
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,680
You hurt my friend!

203
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,720
You deserve it!

204
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,440
What?

205
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Come on!

206
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,200
Calm down!

207
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,650
What?

208
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,960
In any case, I'm very sorry.

209
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,559
I'll take better care of my son.

210
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,890
Anan!

211
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,119
It's going to change the song for this scene.

212
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
- All right. - Okay.

213
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,680
Have you ever loved me?

214
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,890
I have.

215
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,839
Once.

216
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,410
Indeed.

217
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,279
You made me

218
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,359
believe so.

219
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,279
Pan a bit to the right.

220
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,519
- You can barely see the actors. - You should've never believed me.

221
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,359
I do not love you.

222
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,960
Perhaps I'm the fool.

223
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,279
You should run away to ordain.

224
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,319
Why would you fall for me?

225
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
I...

226
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,559
I...

227
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,599
I'm not an honest man.

228
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,119
I...

229
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,960
I'm sorry. Can I take a break?

230
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,319
Ugh. What's wrong with you now?

231
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,480
Are you okay, Dan?

232
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,160
- Maybe we should take 15. - Okay.

233
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,519
Okay. Let's take 15. We'll pick up where we left off.

234
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,359
Dan,

235
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,079
do you want some water?

236
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,279
Are you okay?

237
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,359
Thanks, Cha-aim.

238
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,880
I'm okay.

239
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,440
I forgot my lines and messed everything up.

240
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:52,039
What about your cut from the fight? How is it? Does it still hurt?

241
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,599
It's just a bit of bruising now.

242
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,559
I should go and sit down.

243
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:58,799
Okay.

244
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,319
Oh.

245
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,839
Cha-aim,

246
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,000
how are you doing? Are you tired?

247
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,240
Is Dan okay?

248
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,440
He's acting a bit strange.

249
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,759
Oh.

250
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,400
I don't know.

251
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,000
He's acting strange with me too.

252
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,920
I heard he's able to sleep now.

253
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,720
He might be stressed about other things.

254
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,440
You like reading, don't you?

255
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,559
I see you keep a book with you at all times.

256
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,720
What kind of books do you like?

257
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,920
Well...

258
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,319
- Like, general stuff. - All right.

259
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:27,759
Romance novels,

260
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,079
poems, stuff like that.

261
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,200
I think they're quite uplifting.

262
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,200
I have some free time lately.

263
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,640
Maybe you can recommend one for me?

264
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,039
Josh,

265
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,759
is this really what you want to talk about?

266
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,839
You don't have to push it.

267
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,000
Well,

268
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,759
I mean, you can talk about things you know

269
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,599
if you want to strike up a conversation with me.

270
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,079
Like,

271
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,839
photography.

272
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,279
I want to know how to use a camera as well.

273
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,400
- Photography? - Yeah.

274
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,799
Oh.

275
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,920
Press here, slide this up, and it'll open.

276
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,240
Then press this, and it'll open.

277
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,319
Turn this out to see the video.

278
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,799
See?

279
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,960
Here.

280
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,119
When you press this button...

281
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,559
Why?

282
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,519
Don't you feel like it tonight?

283
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,640
I'm pregnant.

284
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,799
Do you really feel like it?

285
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,839
Things might feel different.

286
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,200
But aren't we meeting tonight

287
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,359
to talk about what to do about it?

288
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,599
But it seems I won't be able

289
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,640
to come to see you that often anymore.

290
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,160
Why not?

291
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,839
I think someone knows about us.

292
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:52,759
Who does?

293
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,359
I don't know.

294
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,720
I'm guessing it's Dan.

295
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,960
Dan?

296
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,680
He doesn't seem like the kind of person to do such a thing.

297
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Right?

298
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,519
But he was the only person I saw in the funhouse.

299
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,440
But no one's found out about the nurse's daughter...

300
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,680
Stop mentioning that already.

301
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,960
That's way back in the past.

302
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,960
No one's going to find out.

303
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,440
Who's there? I hear you!

304
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,079
(School Building)

305
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:57,039
Last night, an intruder trashed our library.

306
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,119
The school has conducted an investigation.

307
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,000
No outsiders came in last night.

308
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,279
So I'd like to inform all of you

309
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,440
to keep an eye out.

310
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,000
If anyone finds out who the culprit was,

311
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,160
please report to Master Surat.

312
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,440
Okay. It's time for you to go to class.

313
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,359
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

314
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,400
Was it you?

315
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,000
I lost the lucid dream ring.

316
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,640
I can't tell dreams from reality anymore.

317
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,440
So why didn't you tell me earlier?

318
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,200
I could've helped you look for it.

319
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,519
I thought I got better.

320
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,640
I haven't seen the shadow for a while now.

321
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,440
Go to class.

322
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,160
I'm going to rest at the infirmary.

323
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,359
How are you feeling?

324
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,039
I'm okay now.

325
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,480
Did I startle you?

326
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,359
No, I...

327
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,960
I just had a bit of a nightmare.

328
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,240
Right. Tomorrow's Saturday.

329
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,799
The guys in the club are going into the city to buy supplies.

330
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,480
Do you want to come along?

331
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,079
Oh, sure. I can come along.

332
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:09,480
You can head back to the dorm.

333
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,519
I want to rest a little bit longer.

334
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:16,809
Okay.

335
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:48,079
Let's meet back here in an hour.

336
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,199
- Don't go too far, and be punctual. - Okay.

337
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,239
Come on.

338
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,199
- Is there a place you want to go? - I'm happy with anywhere.

339
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,519
Hey, Dan.

340
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,480
It's Tong.

341
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,119
Who's Tong?

342
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
The guy who always tells ghost stories.

343
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,920
Josh's totally missing out on this.

344
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,519
Let's check it out.

345
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,809
Ma'am, our team came all the way here.

346
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,809
Can you tell us the legend of the one-armed man?

347
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,559
How did he die? And what's the origin of his story?

348
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,400
Is it true his spirit haunts the villagers?

349
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,679
From what I've heard,

350
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:48,329
he was a boxer from 20 years or so ago.

351
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:51,119
Then he joined the navy.

352
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,559
But there was an accident.

353
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,769
The chain from an anchor

354
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,289
tore his left arm right off.

355
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:07,719
After he was discharged,

356
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,719
he sold himself to some homosexual millionaires.

357
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:11,960
Whoa.

358
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,519
They partied and did drugs on yachts.

359
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,199
The clients overdosed

360
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,329
and died on the spot.

361
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,880
- What's next, ma'am? - That's not all.

362
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,920
They say after he was arrested,

363
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,159
there was an influx of letters to the prison.

364
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:37,519
They were from clients who were sexual deviants.

365
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh!

366
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,079
Hang on. So is his ghost a vicious one?

367
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,289
They say you'll be able to hear

368
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,559
the sound of a chain dragging along the ground

369
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,119
- and someone moaning at night. - Ooh!

370
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,880
Villagers in the area can't sleep because of it.

371
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,809
Oh, ma'am!

372
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,809
I'm already getting goosebumps

373
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,329
just listening to the story!

374
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,000
So how did he die?

375
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,480
Kid, we're recording right now. Mind your manners.

376
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,360
Oh, it's okay.

377
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,159
All right. Please continue. What happened next?

378
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:16,920
From what I've heard, he was sentenced to death.

379
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,000
- Ooh! - That bad, huh?

380
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Let's go.

381
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,039
- Nai. - What?

382
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,769
Can I go and ask for a new ring from the venerable monk?

383
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,880
I think it might be difficult.

384
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,920
His creations are usually one of a kind.

385
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,639
He's not at the temple either.

386
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,289
He's on a pilgrimage in the woods.

387
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,039
Are you okay?

388
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
Yeah.

389
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,809
I'm still hanging in there.

390
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,199
Ow!

391
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,639
Can't keep your nose out of my business?

392
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,787
Do you think we've caused things to get out of hand?

393
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:07,920
It's already come to this.

394
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,400
Whatever happens, happens.

395
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:11,880
There's going to be

396
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,360
School Night Party this weekend.

397
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
I want to tell you

398
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,360
someone wants you to be their date at the event.

399
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,119
What I'm worried about is that you've seen actual ghosts twice now.

400
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,920
O Lord, please have mercy

401
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,440
and guide me to successfully help him.

402
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,079
- Lord, please bring Dan back. - Nai?

403
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,480
There were dead people at our school.

404
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
And every time I see these visions,

405
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,289
one particular person is always present.

406
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,289
And that person is...
