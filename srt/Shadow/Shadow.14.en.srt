1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,639
Brother Anurak,

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,640
my condolences.

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:12,119
Danai has passed away.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,519
How is that possible?

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,879
His vital signs were normal this morning.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,600
We tried our best.

7
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Dan.

8
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,719
(Where is Dan?)

9
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,530
I'd like all of you

10
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,719
to have a moment of silence as a respectful farewell

11
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,719
to the victim of this tragic incident.

12
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,599
Nai, what's wrong?

13
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,439
Dan's still alive.

14
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,240
And I'm going to bring him back.

15
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,080
Are you crazy?

16
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,439
He's pale as a sheet now. How are you going to do that?

17
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,960
Just admit it. He's dead.

18
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,759
I believe he'll come back.

19
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,520
He has to.

20
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,960
You still don't want me to sign Danai's death certificate?

21
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,800
Can you give me a few days?

22
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,759
But this might be illegal,

23
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,360
and I might be put under investigation.

24
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,879
Please.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,960
It's what Dan asked of me before he died.

26
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,120
It's part of his family's beliefs.

27
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,520
If that's the case, I'll prolong it with the staff member in charge.

28
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,680
You're a very kind man.

29
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,800
You even help him with something seemingly insignificant.

30
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,759
I just want to help him as much as I can.

31
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,840
I heard Brother Anurak hasn't allowed a funeral to be held yet.

32
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,280
Why not?

33
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,520
No one knows.

34
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,439
He's Dan's only legal guardian.

35
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,000
He has the power to do anything.

36
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Nai,

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,079
do you think

38
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,079
Dan will still be able to come back?

39
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,519
What? That's what you think as well?

40
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,639
When I saw Dan in my dream,

41
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,360
I remember

42
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,360
seeing him with...

43
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,610
The shadow?

44
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,360
Yes.

45
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,839
I guess it's the reason why he can't come back.

46
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,959
He told me to come back alone.

47
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,319
It's as if he wants to be with it

48
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,560
even though...

49
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,279
Then we'll have to bring him back.

50
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,680
The shadow lured him away.

51
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
It made him believe that place is where he longs.

52
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,560
And what are you going to do?

53
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,170
Are you going to carry his corpse so the venerable monk can perform

54
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,279
the ritual to ward the shadow off?

55
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,050
The body's in the morgue.

56
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,759
How are you going to cart him out?

57
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Josh has a point, Nai.

58
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,050
It's not a good thing

59
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,920
to be in the shadow's realm.

60
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,399
Besides, you could be trapped forever.

61
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
O Holy Father,

62
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,160
I'd like

63
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,160
to entrust my soul into the palm of your hand.

64
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,680
The agony and death of the Messiah

65
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,720
was to free humankind from its sin.

66
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,399
(Holy Bible)

67
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,680
You know I'm a sinner.

68
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,399
I'm not a good man,

69
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,920
unlike what other people are saying.

70
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,079
I'm just a one-armed man who sold his body.

71
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,199
The sin has not

72
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,120
washed away.

73
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,160
It still remains in my memory

74
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,720
and constantly haunts me.

75
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
(Holy Bible)

76
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,920
Brother Andrew

77
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,160
gave me this hand

78
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,399
so I could offer help to others.

79
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,759
But why is it that the more I help,

80
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,920
the worse things become?

81
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,319
If only I had sensed something was wrong,

82
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,399
it wouldn't have turned out this way.

83
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,639
Andrea, are you sure?

84
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,399
We'll have to help them in any case

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,639
or these kids will be in danger.

86
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,560
Hey, someone's coming!

87
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,000
How did you get here?

88
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
You saw the news, didn't you?

89
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,319
Are you the communist university students?

90
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,480
We were framed...

91
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,600
Father.

92
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,959
You can call us "Brother".

93
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,079
We don't actually want to join the communist party.

94
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,639
We're just politically active university students.

95
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,279
And we didn't hurt the soldiers unlike what the news said.

96
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,439
We really don't have anywhere else to go.

97
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,839
Please don't send us away.

98
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,279
Brother,

99
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,439
is there any way we can help them?

100
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,920
I'll be frank with all of you.

101
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,439
It's dangerous enough for you to come here.

102
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
The soldiers have been coming to search the school almost every day.

103
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,559
But we'll die if we go out as well.

104
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,799
We don't have

105
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,159
any energy left to go anywhere.

106
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Brother,

107
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,879
should we let them rest here for a few days?

108
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
And I'll handle the soldiers.

109
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,399
All right.

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you so much!

111
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,840
Thank you so much!

112
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,450
What are you doing?

113
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't think that no one knows.

114
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,330
If someone catches you offering refuge to those university students,

115
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,639
what's going to happen?

116
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,120
Not only would the school be closed,

117
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,090
but all of you will be branded communists as well.

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,090
There aren't any university students here.

119
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,240
Our school has been carrying on peacefully.

120
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
We haven't been notified of any groups of people coming here.

121
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,519
I'm just here to warn you out of the goodness of my heart.

122
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,879
I hope your long-standing honor and pristine history will not

123
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,159
end up in vain because of one wrong decision.

124
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Anyway,

125
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,639
the government officials have informed us

126
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,120
they'll send personnel to search this place tomorrow morning.

127
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,919
But if both of you insist no one is hiding here,

128
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,960
then there's no need to be worried.

129
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,159
Yes, we'll do our best to cooperate.

130
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,210
Excellent.

131
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,360
Well then. Excuse me.

132
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,960
Hey, what are you doing?

133
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,639
The soldiers might spot us!

134
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,960
Sorry.

135
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,279
There's still some film left, so I felt like taking photos.

136
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,480
Put it away for now.

137
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,320
I have no choice but to open up the school

138
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,960
for the soldiers so they can search the place tomorrow morning.

139
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,639
There's been an order from the government.

140
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,559
But I've made contact with the villagers nearby.

141
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,080
They'll come to pick you up and help take care of you.

142
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,000
I haven't heard any reports of the soldiers searching the woods.

143
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,440
You should be able to hide there for a few days.

144
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:42,799
Are you saying we're going to stay with the villagers for now?

145
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,039
Exactly.

146
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,320
They're picking you up at midnight.

147
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,360
You can start getting ready.

148
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
I'll give you a signal

149
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,799
when the villagers have arrived.

150
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,080
Thank you for helping us, Brother.

151
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,799
Thank you, Brother.

152
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,559
We'd be dead without your help.

153
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,559
Take good care of each other, okay?

154
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,519
He's so kind to us.

155
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,759
Guys,

156
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
don't you remember?

157
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,320
We can't put our trust in anyone just yet,

158
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,080
understand?

159
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,159
Okay.

160
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Let's pack up.

161
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,759
Go on.

162
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,080
- Just like I said. - Okay.

163
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,320
- I trust you. - Thanks.

164
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Are you done packing up?

165
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,720
Are you the university students taking refuge here?

166
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,759
That's right.

167
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,639
Guys, there are people here to pick us up.

168
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,240
- Hello. - Hello, everyone.

169
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,960
Come on. We should hurry.

170
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,440
Let's go.

171
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,279
All right.

172
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
After you.

173
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,799
What is this?

174
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,200
Brother,

175
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,159
some military vehicles have arrived at the school.

176
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,720
What?

177
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,759
Brother Anurak,

178
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,240
I suggest you stay here.

179
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,919
I'm going to see Brother Andrew.

180
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,840
There's no need.

181
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,720
He's already been detained in his office as well.

182
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,279
These people are my neighbors.

183
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,120
Come on. Let's go.

184
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Follow me.

185
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,919
Guys, it's the soldiers!

186
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Run!

187
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,919
Help!

188
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,240
No! Don't!

189
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,200
Wait here.

190
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,360
Brother Anurak,

191
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:55,759
did you open the gates for the soldiers?

192
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,599
Stop! Stop!

193
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,079
I'm begging you!

194
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,599
Brother Anurak!

195
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,410
Please, I'm begging you.

196
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,720
Stop... stop right now.

197
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,680
Didn't I tell you

198
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,079
not to keep secrets from me?

199
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,839
I'm doing this for the sake of Brother Andrew

200
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,480
who's well-respected by the public.

201
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,650
Otherwise,

202
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,359
these kids would've

203
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,279
ended up dead like their friends.

204
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,920
Please,

205
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,680
don't hurt them.

206
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,650
They're just children.

207
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,170
They're communists, Brother.

208
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,079
They're not children.

209
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,839
They're monsters.

210
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,119
I think you should return to your office.

211
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,410
And don't interfere with my mission again.

212
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,039
Any other funny business from you

213
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,720
and I won't be able to guarantee Brother Andrew's safety.

214
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,319
What are you going to do?

215
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,519
You should go.

216
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,359
And I'll handle

217
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,119
everything here.

218
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,440
I guarantee I won't let them feel any pain.

219
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,519
And the one that died

220
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,960
shot my subordinates.

221
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,920
I had no choice but to put him down.

222
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,720
I forbid you from hurting them!

223
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,720
This is an educational institution!

224
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,410
Otherwise, I'm going to inform the big-wigs!

225
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,170
Understood.

226
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Sergeant,

227
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,079
escort Brother Anurak away.

228
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,440
- Yes, sir. - No!

229
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,519
Let's go, Brother.

230
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,759
Please! I'm begging you! Don't!

231
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,119
- Don't do this! - Let's go.

232
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,720
- Don't do it! - This way, please.

233
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,799
- Don't hurt them! - Brother Anurak!

234
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,480
- Brother! - Don't worry!

235
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,480
Don't worry and don't be afraid!

236
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,200
They won't hurt you! Please don't hurt them!

237
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:23,170
- Brother! - Brother!

238
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,960
Don't worry and don't be afraid!

239
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,759
They won't do anything!

240
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,240
- Come with us. - Let go of me!

241
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,599
Let go!

242
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Stop!

243
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,720
- Come with us, Brother. - No!

244
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,079
No!

245
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
No!

246
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,890
No!

247
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,079
No!

248
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:09,279
How could I look at that every day

249
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,359
if my heart was innocent?

250
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,279
Maybe...

251
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,839
Maybe I should've died with them?

252
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,480
Is that why

253
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,559
you've never forgiven me?

254
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,240
If that's the case,

255
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,119
I'm going to do what you did

256
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,559
so he can return.

257
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,839
That boy has to survive.

258
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,799
Otherwise, I won't be able to rest in peace.

259
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,480
Hello, venerable monk.

260
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,680
You probably love your friend very much.

261
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,279
I don't know what else to do either.

262
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,599
Hm...

263
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,799
There's actually a ritual to resurrect the dead

264
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,279
called "Kosapasok".

265
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
But I don't want

266
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,440
anyone to perform it.

267
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:26,359
Resurrecting a dead person is

268
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,640
a risky business.

269
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,359
Bringing back the spirit of the dead,

270
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
if you call him and he can't hear you,

271
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,519
any lost souls or wandering spirits might

272
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,079
come to inhabit his place instead.

273
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,480
I believe Dan will come back no matter what.

274
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,920
He'll hear my voice.

275
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,119
That realm isn't your world.

276
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,319
Once you know he's heard you,

277
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,680
focus your mind back to the present at once.

278
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,799
Don't allow yourself to be in that realm.

279
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,319
Yes, venerable monk.

280
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Help!

281
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,480
Help!

282
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,039
Help me!

283
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Help!

284
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,720
Help! Help me!

285
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,680
Help!

286
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Trin!

287
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,519
Trin!

288
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,559
Trin!

289
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,559
You're here, aren't you?

290
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
Trin!

291
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Dan.

292
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Trin?

293
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,640
Is that really you?

294
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,599
Have you been trapped here this whole time?

295
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
That's right.

296
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,480
My spirit is still here.

297
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,160
I never left.

298
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,799
Just like you.

299
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,680
What happened that night?

300
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,799
The night you went missing.

301
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,599
It was Brother Anurak, wasn't it?

302
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,240
He killed you, didn't he?

303
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,079
Only him and I know

304
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,640
the truth.

305
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Don't come near me!

306
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,559
Are you okay?

307
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,200
Leave me alone! Don't come any closer!

308
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,960
Are you okay?

309
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,960
Who are you?

310
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,279
It's me, Brother Anurak!

311
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,119
It's me. Are you okay?

312
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,079
- Don't come near me! - Trin!

313
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,200
- Stay away! - Trin!

314
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,880
- No! - Trin!

315
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,519
Get out!

316
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,200
The shadow?

317
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Dan,

318
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,640
you've already seen everything.

319
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:02,359
Promise me you'll take me back.

320
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,559
Dan,

321
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,440
I don't belong in this place.

322
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,599
I have to go back.

323
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Trin?

324
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,119
Trin, what's wrong?

325
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,680
- Get out! - Trin!

326
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,720
Get out!

327
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,079
- Get out! - What's wrong?

328
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Don't!

329
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,839
Don't hurt him! No!

330
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,519
Enough! Stop!

331
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Dan,

332
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,839
where are you?

333
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,640
- Dan! - Nai?

334
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,880
I found you.

335
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,079
I found Dan.

336
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,039
Please have mercy

337
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,680
and guide me to help him.

338
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,200
I won't be a coward.

339
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,160
Lord, please let him return.

340
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Dan?

341
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,319
Are you in here?

342
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,920
- Dan? - Nai?

343
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,960
Nai, help me!

344
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,960
You can hear me, can't you?

345
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,200
Follow the sound of my voice.

346
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,799
Please,

347
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,200
bring him back again.

348
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Nai!

349
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,599
Dan, listen to me!

350
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,319
What you've encountered isn't real.

351
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,799
It doesn't exist.

352
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,720
And it never did.

353
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
Let me go.

354
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,839
Just let me go.

355
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Help!

356
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
Help!

357
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,559
Help, anyone?

358
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,119
(Morgue)

359
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,519
Usually,

360
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,200
when a person stops breathing for a few minutes,

361
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,920
it can render them permanently paralyzed.

362
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,440
But he's physically fine.

363
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,920
You need to rest a lot.

364
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,719
- Nai, Brother Anurak's dead. - Huh?

365
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,680
He shot himself in front of the pedestal last night.

366
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,039
I think he had his reasons

367
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,759
for doing that.

368
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,400
What reasons?

369
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,769
Nai?

370
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:30,289
Josh?

371
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,329
You really are awake.

372
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,360
Cha-aim.

373
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,199
Thanks, Cha-aim.

374
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,239
I thought you wouldn't come back.

375
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,559
And here's a sketchbook

376
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,239
in case you might want to draw when you feel lonely.

377
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,039
Thank you.

378
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,199
Of course I had to come back.

379
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,599
This place is where I belong.

380
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,400
I'll put the flowers away.

381
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Dan.

382
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,119
Master Joe,

383
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:53,639
I haven't seen you in a while.

384
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,119
It's incredible your condition has improved this much.

385
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,329
Brother Anurak would be very happy if he was still alive.

386
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,440
What happened to him?

387
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,639
(Morgue)

388
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,679
That lantern,

389
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,039
it was you, wasn't it?

390
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,039
Thank you

391
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,239
for always helping me.

392
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,639
From now on, I'm going to take good care of my own life.

393
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,440
I promise.

394
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,400
(Everything is completely dark without any sign of living things.)

395
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,119
(I can't tell exactly how...)

396
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,400
Brother Eric told me to come and pick you up.

397
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,079
Have you finished packing?

398
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Yes, sir.

399
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,559
We'll have to wait for the documents from the hospital for a bit.

400
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,719
Yes, sir.

401
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,000
I guess you must be disappointed

402
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,000
that I disrupted the play.

403
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,329
It's okay.

404
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,639
I think it was fun, actually.

405
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,400
It's something different.

406
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:25,840
But for me,

407
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,960
it's good to see you doing well.

408
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,809
I'm planning to do my best to help you with the club next year.

409
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:42,199
Should we make our school play

410
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,480
so popular we sell out for every performance?

411
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,239
That popular, huh?

412
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,559
You've given me a promise now.

413
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,079
Why do you keep using a pen that's out of ink?

414
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,960
Use this.

415
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,880
It's a very beautiful pen.

416
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:37,880
It's very nice to write with too.

417
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,159
Can I have it?

418
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,719
Sure.

419
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,239
Can you please come this way, Master?

420
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,039
The body of Trin Dhevawijitra who went missing last year

421
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,599
has been found.

422
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:18,039
His body floated up to the lake's surface behind St. Lawrence College.

423
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,480
After a preliminary inspection, one noticeable development is

424
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,360
that he only appears to have died a few days ago.

425
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,719
So now everyone is asking where was he after all this time?

426
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,769
Are you okay?

427
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:59,400
I think we should go back to the dorm.

428
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,559
Mm.

429
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:30,519
What are you doing? Aren't you going to bed?

430
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:36,119
I'm just doodling.

431
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,289
Turn off the lights if you're going to bed, okay?

432
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:53,159
Vi,

433
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:56,519
I have to go out of town for work. I'll be home late.

434
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,719
You can go ahead and have dinner.

435
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,880
Mm.

436
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,000
Come on.

437
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:10,559
I'm sorry about last night.

438
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,199
I didn't mean it.

439
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,960
Are you in a lot of pain?

440
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:22,039
I promise I'll quit drinking,

441
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,960
and I won't hurt you again.

442
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,400
You have to understand me.

443
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,800
You should hurry.

444
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,719
It'll be difficult to travel back if it rains.

445
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,159
I'll get going then.

446
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,079
I'm going to put up with it for you.

447
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,599
Thank you for giving me a child.

448
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,840
Otherwise, my wife might

449
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,320
run away again.

450
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:21,239
You did well for successfully performing the ritual.

451
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:25,280
Not many people can pull it off.

452
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,079
I hope your child can be born healthy.

453
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,599
And don't forget.

454
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,519
He is watching.

455
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:46,119
It's a boy.

456
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,039
Vi,

457
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:50,079
be careful.

458
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,960
- Be careful. - Mm.

459
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,960
Dan.
