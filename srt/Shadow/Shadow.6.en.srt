1
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,599
(School Building)

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Here.

3
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,000
Thanks.

4
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,210
That's a lot of stuff.

5
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,359
It'd be mean not to give you a hand.

6
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,000
Do you know you're the only one

7
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,920
who offered to help
since I got off the bus?

8
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,119
Where should I put them?

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,719
Here's fine.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
There.

11
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,200
Thanks.

12
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,880
Anything else? I can help.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,840
Oh, there's painting to do.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,120
You can grab a brush
from over there.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,439
Okay. Listen here, everyone.

16
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,760
Our Drama Club's annual stall is

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,280
to promote our play
and to sell tickets.

18
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,560
But the main objective is

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,480
to allow the public to see
your talent and determination.

20
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,680
But it seems there are still people
who still don't have a position.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,079
Can whoever doesn't have a position
please raise your hand?

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,640
Ah, you don't have a position?

23
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,480
I saw that.

24
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,359
What?

25
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,959
- I just...
- The pig mask you picked up.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,519
Trin's mask.

27
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,400
You know, don't you?

28
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,439
No.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,680
It's bad luck

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
if you play
with a dead person's belongings.

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,120
He might come back for it.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,560
Yes, I picked it up.

33
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,599
Then I put it down right here.

34
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,090
Besides, I wasn't playing with it.

35
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,840
I'm just trying to find old stuff
that can be used this year.

36
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,479
What? I tried to set the mood,
but you're not scared at all.

37
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,960
It's a shame to
think about it though.

38
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,879
The mask is so well-made,

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,759
but the play didn't
get to be performed.

40
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,719
Nai,

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,080
look at Dan.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Oh?

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,319
- You're good.
- It wasn't neat at first.

44
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,479
Hm.

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,560
Anyway, I have to go.

46
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,159
Mm.

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,840
It's funny, actually.
The bus is right here.

48
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,479
You don't need me to walk you over.

49
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,680
Oh? I'll go on my own then.

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,840
What?

51
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,560
Uh...

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
Okay.

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,719
- You go ahead.
- Okay. Bye.

54
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,680
(Meet me behind the dorm.
I have a suggestion for you.)

55
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,120
(Just follow the scent. Josh.)

56
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,560
Hey, come on over.

57
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,519
Have a seat.

58
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,560
Let me tell you.
This is the real deal.

59
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,920
What's up with you?

60
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,319
It's Mary Jane.

61
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,839
Sit down.

62
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Hey, take it easy.

63
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,519
Sorry.

64
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,720
First time?

65
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,839
Yes.

66
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,759
This is nice.

67
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,879
We should've asked Nai
to come along as well.

68
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,279
Why didn't you though?

69
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Well,

70
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,839
I want to ask you a question.

71
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,959
Just us.

72
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,759
What?

73
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,199
Man to man.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,879
- I'll be direct.
- Sure.

75
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,120
Do you like Cha-aim?

76
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,559
Is that what you want
to ask me about?

77
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,090
I'm serious.

78
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,480
She's lovely.

79
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,360
But she's just a friend to me.

80
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,679
You two seem close.

81
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,919
There's no space for me
to win her over at all.

82
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,480
Give me an opening.

83
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,450
Hey.

84
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,799
Sure thing.

85
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,120
You really don't have

86
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,000
any feelings for Cha-aim?

87
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,210
No.

88
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,879
I only think of her as a friend.

89
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,840
Like you.

90
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,090
Like Nai.

91
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,559
She's someone I trust.

92
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,399
There's nothing more than that.

93
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,360
I don't know if she has feelings
for me or not.

94
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,919
But I don't have feelings for her.

95
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,799
I love all of my friends equally.

96
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,879
But if you have feelings for her,

97
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,159
I can give you some space.

98
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,039
Anyway,

99
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
how did you get your hands
on this weed?

100
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
It's nice.

101
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh.

102
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,240
I got it from Bancha.
He's an alumnus.

103
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,399
By the way, you have
problems sleeping, don't you?

104
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Yes.

105
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,879
Perfect timing.
Bancha's the hermit type.

106
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,360
He lives near the woods.

107
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,919
He used to tell me

108
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,799
there's this witch doctor
who can help with mental disorders.

109
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm sure
he can cure a sleep disorder.

110
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,759
Really? Are you just fibbing?

111
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,559
Even Brother Anurak can't cure me.

112
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,960
- What can this witch doctor...
- Hey, come on.

113
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,120
Don't look down on him
if you don't believe it.

114
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,879
Hey, someone's...

115
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,960
I know. Follow me.

116
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,559
I'll take you on a detour
to the dorm.

117
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
Keep it down, okay?

118
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
Come on!

119
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,679
Boo!

120
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
Shoot.

121
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,440
Josh!

122
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,440
Why did you come into my room?

123
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,840
Your room is my room.

124
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,320
Scoot over.

125
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,519
Where were you?

126
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,960
That stench says it all.

127
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,519
Nai,

128
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,639
I got the intel.

129
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,360
Dan doesn't
have feelings for Cha-aim.

130
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
I can make a move on her now.

131
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,039
Just go to sleep.

132
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,440
What are you doing?

133
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Did you pee your pants?

134
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,120
No.

135
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,759
Hey!

136
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,200
You did!

137
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,320
What?

138
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:00,879
What's with you?

139
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,759
I haven't even said anything.
You admitted to it yourself.

140
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,320
It's natural, man.

141
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,720
Hey, I'm going to get some drinks.

142
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,279
- Do you want anything, Josh?
- I'm good.

143
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,240
What do you want, Dan?

144
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,159
- Didn't you lose a lot of water?
- Josh!

145
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,200
Can you get me a red soda?

146
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,759
Why so serious?

147
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,440
I was just teasing you.

148
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,639
Hi.

149
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,240
Mom made me garlic shrimp.

150
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,440
So I want to share it with you guys.

151
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,119
- Here...
- It's okay.

152
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm allergic to shrimp.
And I'm already full.

153
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,480
I like shrimp.

154
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,890
- Really?
- Yes.

155
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Thanks.

156
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,440
I have to go to the bathroom.

157
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,200
- My gut's playing up.
- Sure.

158
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,799
And how was class today?

159
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,039
It was nice, actually.

160
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,890
Uh, Dan?

161
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,039
Where are you going?

162
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,119
So does that mean you like shrimp?

163
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,650
I do.

164
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,799
If you eat that much,
it's too much sodium.

165
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,559
How do you know
it's too much sodium?

166
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,839
And what happened to your arm?

167
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,410
Oh.

168
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,039
It's nothing.

169
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,759
I have to go to the bathroom.

170
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,960
Dan, here are the costumes.

171
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,410
Pick one out for yourself.

172
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,759
Okay.

173
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Dan,

174
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
I'll pick one for you.

175
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,559
This one's nice. Should I wear it?

176
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:53,599
Mm. Dan, try this one.

177
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,480
It's lovely.

178
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,410
Is something wrong?

179
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,650
I'm fine.

180
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,079
I'll be right back.

181
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,559
Nai, can you take over from me?
I'll be back.

182
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,319
Cha-aim, are you okay?

183
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,039
I'll put the costumes away.

184
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,279
It's okay.

185
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,519
- Hey, it's all right. I can help.
- I'll do it myself.

186
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,480
The rack is just over there.
I'll do it.

187
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,720
Josh!

188
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,319
I said you don't have to.
I can do it myself.

189
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,519
I just wanted to help.

190
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,960
Josh, wait!

191
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,559
Josh!

192
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,000
Josh!

193
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,119
I'm sorry.

194
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,319
I'm really sorry.

195
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,480
I didn't mean to take it out on you.

196
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,559
I just don't want you to worry.

197
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,890
I'm sorry.

198
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,279
Can I ask you something?

199
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,359
Do you like Dan?

200
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,170
If you do,

201
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,650
I think you should
think about it carefully.

202
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,599
Dan's a weird guy.

203
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,759
I don't want you

204
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,920
- to be even more stressed...
- Josh

205
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,319
He's your friend.

206
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,960
How could you say that?

207
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,759
Cha-aim,

208
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,170
why haven't you gone home?

209
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,599
I forgot to give you this.

210
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,890
(The Story of Eternity)

211
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,920
- What is it?
- Oh.

212
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,519
I read it and thought
it was well-written.

213
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,519
I figured you'd like it,
so I got it for you.

214
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,759
Thanks.

215
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Mm.

216
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,359
Anyway, I have to go.

217
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,279
Have a safe trip home.

218
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Thanks.

219
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,960
(There are things we can't see
that emit light)

220
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,759
(and are powerful like spirits.)

221
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,279
Come on over!

222
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,559
Come and have a look!

223
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,400
Visit our stall!

224
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,839
This way, please!

225
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,240
We're doing Hamlet!

226
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,880
Buy tickets here!

227
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,160
Over here, please!

228
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,319
Buy a ticket to Hamlet
if you're interested.

229
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,759
- Over here, please!
- Please come and watch.

230
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,160
- Ask us about anything.
- Hello.

231
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,200
- Do you want to see Hamlet?
- Over here, please!

232
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,480
Come and have a look!

233
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,960
This way, please!

234
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,160
The tickets are on sale now!

235
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,759
- Just over here!
- Come and watch Hamlet!

236
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,799
One, two...

237
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,960
Okay. That's great.

238
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,440
Visit our stall!

239
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,400
I still haven't taken photos here.

240
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,559
Come here.

241
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,759
- Come and watch our performance!
- This way, please!

242
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,519
Go ahead and line up!

243
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,799
Come on over!

244
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,079
Come and watch our play!

245
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,200
Hello.

246
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,400
Is everything all right?

247
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,799
Okay.

248
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,279
Excellent.

249
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,119
- Hello, Brother Anurak.
- Hello.

250
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,240
Brother, this is Krit.
He's my husband.

251
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,279
- Hello, Brother.
- Hello.

252
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,920
We've never met before.

253
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,359
That's right.

254
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Hello, Brother.

255
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

256
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Krit,

257
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:26,079
- let's find somewhere to sit down.
- Sure.

258
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Yada,

259
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,160
is something wrong? Are you sick?

260
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,279
- Uh, no...
- Oh?

261
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,680
You haven't told him?

262
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,799
Tell me what?

263
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
She's pregnant.

264
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,920
Really? Congratulations.

265
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Congratulations.

266
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,599
Thank you.

267
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,799
Well...

268
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,400
The thing is, I just found out.

269
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,759
So I didn't have
the chance to tell you.

270
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,680
It's okay.

271
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,839
Anyway, take care of your health.

272
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,359
Let me know if work
becomes too overwhelming.

273
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,559
I will.

274
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,599
Excuse me.

275
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,319
Let's check out the stall
from St. Lawrence's Drama Club.

276
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,519
This year is extra special

277
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,119
because they're collaborating
with St. Mary.

278
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,279
- Thank you.
- How fascinating.

279
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,720
Let's have a chat with Master Joe
about this year's performance...

280
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,319
Hello. Come on in.

281
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,720
Please come and watch our play.

282
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,559
- Buy tickets for Hamlet here.
- This way. Thank you.

283
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,319
We're performing Hamlet this year.

284
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,039
The students are working hard,
and I'd like everyone to see it.

285
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,160
- Hello.
- You can buy tickets here.

286
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,799
Please come and watch
our performance this year.

287
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,359
Thank you, Master Joe.

288
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,799
Now, let's check out the stall
from the Science Club.

289
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,440
Very interesting.

290
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,119
- Hello.
- Hello.

291
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,039
Thank you very much, Master Joe.

292
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,680
I haven't seen the students enjoying
school activities for a while now.

293
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,079
Everything's in your hands now.

294
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,279
I'm sure the performance is
going to be great.

295
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,279
Thank you as well. I'll do my best.

296
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,960
You seem happy.

297
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,799
Indeed.

298
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,000
Dan.

299
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,759
What?

300
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
The thing is...

301
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,319
Well...

302
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,519
Did you read the book I gave you?

303
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,480
I haven't had time yet.

304
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,480
Do you want it back
for the time being?

305
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,119
It's okay.

306
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,000
I already finished it.
You can have it.

307
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Mm.

308
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,680
I'll be going now.

309
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,279
Cha-aim.

310
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,319
I'll let you know once I've read it.

311
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,799
Mm.

312
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,640
How do you use this camera?

313
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,079
Come on.

314
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,400
Open this up.

315
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,640
Look through the viewfinder.

316
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,759
Press this button
when you want to take a photo.

317
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,920
Here. Try holding it.

318
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,160
Hang it around your neck.
It's expensive.

319
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Okay.

320
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,519
Press this
and a photo will come out.

321
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,920
It's instant.

322
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,200
- Really?
- Mm.

323
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,319
Hey.

324
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,960
You're so pretty.
Will you be my girlfriend?

325
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,160
- Aw!
- How cute!

326
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,079
Ooh!

327
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,079
You're so cool, man.

328
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,960
What's wrong with you?

329
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,359
Are you jealous?

330
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,880
Jealous?

331
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,920
Why would I be jealous?

332
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,519
But can you be considerate
to the baby I'm carrying?

333
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,960
Have you thought
about what to do with this?

334
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,119
Calm down.

335
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,759
I know you're under stress.

336
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,960
But it's just as we've discussed.

337
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,119
Once the baby arrives,

338
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:11,079
stay with Krit
for a little while longer.

339
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,000
Once I've graduated,

340
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,359
you can resign from your job

341
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,880
and come to live with me overseas.

342
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,480
Are you sure?

343
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,519
Of course.

344
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,240
Do you want ice cream?

345
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Your treat?

346
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,839
Call me "Daddy" first.

347
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,839
What Daddy? I can pay for myself.

348
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,599
No need.

349
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,920
Let Daddy treat you.
Just wait there.

350
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,759
- No grass jelly for me.
- Okay.

351
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,799
- The movie was so funny yesterday.
- True that.

352
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,279
Oh!

353
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,839
Hey!

354
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,920
Stop getting in my way, fruitcake.

355
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,680
Hey, Nai! Don't!

356
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,000
Don't. Calm down.

357
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,519
Good. Watch your friend's back.

358
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,240
You're ugly,
but your manners are all right.

359
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,880
- Scumbag!
- Hey, Josh!

360
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,200
He missed.

361
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,039
You moron.

362
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,039
Stop biting my leg!

363
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,000
Josh! Hey!

364
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,880
- Hey!
- You!

365
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,200
Hey, Cha-aim!

366
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,319
Are you okay?

367
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,960
What's going on over there?
Stop right now!

368
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Cha-aim?

369
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
Are you okay?

370
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,519
Are you?

371
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,119
I'm okay.

372
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,960
You're not hurt, are you?

373
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,960
Anan, someone asked me
to give this to you.

374
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
(Secret - Fun House)

375
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,559
Trin?

376
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:21,159
Hey, wait up!

377
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,559
Who do you think you are?

378
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,440
Come out if you dare!

379
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,679
Trin?

380
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,079
Hey, who are you?

381
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,639
I wasn't sure at first

382
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,440
about Anan and Ms. Yada.

383
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:56,960
But my suspicion was confirmed

384
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,119
when I saw his reaction
in the funhouse.

385
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,440
Those two had
something to do with Trin.

386
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,329
I lost the lucid dream ring.

387
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:05,769
I can't tell dreams
from reality anymore.

388
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,960
Who's there?
