1
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,679
It's okay.

2
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,359
There's no need to be afraid

3
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,200
if you didn't do anything wrong.

4
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,119
You dropped something at School Night Party.

5
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,960
But I'm not sure if this can be considered evidence.

6
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,439
Thank you, sir.

7
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,689
Someone found it where it shouldn't have been.

8
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,079
Where was it, sir?

9
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,280
In the control room of the assembly hall.

10
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,599
But I never went up there.

11
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,239
Master Surat can also confirm my whereabouts.

12
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,599
And who found it, sir?

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,239
That's not important.

14
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,599
All that matters is how it got there.

15
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,079
- Hey, it's Anan. - Anan?

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,159
- Yes. - What are you looking at?

17
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,400
Let me take a breather. It's so heavy.

18
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,439
- Okay. I'll go and tidy up here. - Yeah.

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,438
(Murderer)

20
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,360
Shoot. Hey.

21
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Look at this.

22
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,240
Do you think it's true

23
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
about this one-armed man?

24
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,560
I believe it is.

25
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,319
I heard about him when I was young.

26
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,319
The neighbors talked about him.

27
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
I know, right?

28
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,599
But seriously,

29
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,039
don't you wonder why these strange things happened at our school?

30
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,199
Trin went missing.

31
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,639
Then there was Ms. Kamon's daughter who killed herself.

32
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,960
And the teachers don't seem keen to teach us about Red October.

33
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,479
I think

34
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
it's ghosts.

35
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,719
What are you on about?

36
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Oh?

37
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,439
Don't you believe in ghosts?

38
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,480
Why do you think Dan cut his own arm

39
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,170
if he wasn't possessed?

40
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,480
- Right? - Who was possessed?

41
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,199
Stop talking nonsense,

42
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,730
and get back to work.

43
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,319
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

44
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,519
I didn't want things to escalate this far.

45
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,730
But after the incident,

46
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,279
some students told their parents there's a murderer in the school.

47
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,879
The parents got anxious.

48
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,050
We'll need to ask you to assist us with this matter

49
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,079
for everyone's sake, Inspector.

50
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,319
I've listened to Brother Anurak's account.

51
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,000
I'd like to hear from you too. What do you say?

52
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,959
I really didn't do anything.

53
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,279
I just danced with my friends that night.

54
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,879
I don't know when I lost my wallet.

55
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,879
I didn't do anything. I swear.

56
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,360
Master Surat was with me too.

57
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,639
He'll be able to confirm once he's arrived.

58
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
That's right.

59
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,360
I saw him. He was in the assembly hall the whole time.

60
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,040
You were the one who filmed the rehearsal.

61
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,480
Isn't that right, Master Joe?

62
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,279
Yes, I did. It's the club's video.

63
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,879
And there's probably only one copy.

64
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
From what I've heard,

65
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,639
it's impossible for there to be only one perpetrator.

66
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:11,079
Please continue with the investigation, Inspector.

67
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,240
I've informed all of the police officers

68
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,160
that the investigation team has full access to the school.

69
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,878
If there's any problem, please coordinate with Brother Eric

70
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,800
or Master Surat.

71
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,759
I will.

72
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,000
Brother Anurak,

73
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,439
can I ask you to keep this from my dad?

74
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,439
He has to come out now!

75
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,800
- Our children are in danger! - Please stop!

76
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,040
- No! Call him! - Right now!

77
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,720
- Please calm down! - No!

78
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,439
- Please calm down! - No, he has to come out now!

79
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,559
- Please calm down! - Brother Anurak, come out now!

80
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,079
- Please remain calm! - Come out!

81
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,078
My child is not safe!

82
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,519
Please calm down!

83
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,040
He has to come out now!

84
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,120
We're almost out of paint.

85
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,639
We can tell Master Joe that we'll buy more paint tomorrow.

86
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,480
But I'd prefer it if we run out of paint.

87
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,759
That way, I can hang out with you again.

88
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,040
Josh, we're only going to buy paint.

89
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Okay.

90
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,319
Here.

91
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Thanks.

92
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,959
I'll take a break for a bit.

93
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,759
What about mine?

94
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,920
I bought these so we can all share.

95
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,800
That's all the money I had.

96
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,839
And which one's mine?

97
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,319
You can share it with me.

98
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,040
Here.

99
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,759
Why aren't you sitting down?

100
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,519
It's okay. Don't cry.

101
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,000
That's right. You weren't even dating. Don't be sad.

102
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,960
Well, I'm worried about him!

103
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,720
Think about it! What if the whole school

104
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,000
accused you of being in the wrong all of a sudden?

105
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,879
Wouldn't you care?

106
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,039
It's okay. Anan's rich.

107
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,519
He'll be able to find a solution.

108
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,330
She's right.

109
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,279
Don't cry.

110
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,039
Everyone's looking at you.

111
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Come on.

112
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,210
Do you think we'll get caught?

113
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,679
Honestly, I'm scared too.

114
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,480
I didn't expect

115
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,639
Brother Anurak would get the police involved like this.

116
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,039
It's already come to this.

117
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,210
Whatever happens, happens.

118
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,159
But now,

119
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,039
everyone in the school is starting to talk about this.

120
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,360
It's going along according to our plan.

121
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,679
Maybe

122
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,159
the police's involvement

123
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,960
might help us find the origin of the one-armed man.

124
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,679
You've got a point.

125
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,399
I hope so.

126
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,679
Do you think we've caused things to get out of hand?

127
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,960
We're only searching for one person,

128
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,090
but it's thrown the whole school into chaos.

129
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,399
Anan's taking all the blame too.

130
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,210
But if we don't do anything,

131
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,330
the one-armed man might hurt more people.

132
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,799
This is good.

133
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,960
So other people will be cautious.

134
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Why?

135
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,450
Are you worried about Anan?

136
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,919
What are you talking about?

137
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,210
I put his wallet in that room.

138
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,200
I don't know.

139
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,639
I never did anything bad before.

140
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,559
All right.

141
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,799
If you're horrible,

142
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,960
then I'm much worse.

143
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,559
Right. If you guys are horrible, then I'm even worse!

144
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,720
You're actually horrible. I know that.

145
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,799
You moron, I almost felt something.

146
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,559
I'm going to hit the showers.

147
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,159
Get lost.

148
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,960
I might go to bed as well.

149
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,759
Thanks so much.

150
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,080
And take good care of what the venerable monk gave you.

151
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,519
Don't let it lose its potency.

152
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,200
So the spirits can't hurt you again.

153
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,559
Okay.

154
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,879
I'm worried about you.

155
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,240
I know. Thanks.

156
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,879
Go to bed.

157
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Dan,

158
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
did you hear something?

159
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
What?

160
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,600
I didn't hear anything.

161
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,159
I'll go to bed now.

162
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,559
All right. Sweet dreams.

163
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,639
You too.

164
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,720
(Room 302)

165
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,360
Josh?

166
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,200
Are you wearing cologne?

167
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,879
Yes. It's a good day today. I'm thinking of asking Cha-aim out.

168
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,720
What's gotten into you?

169
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,360
I don't want to wait anymore.

170
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,200
We're going to hang out later.

171
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,039
I want to look nice when I ask her.

172
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,919
But can you guys keep me company

173
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,960
when I ask her?

174
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,039
Please? I'm embarrassed.

175
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,039
- You? Embarrassed? - Yes!

176
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,038
Okay, okay. Hurry up and do whatever.

177
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,119
Wanlop told us to be punctual. We don't want to miss the bus.

178
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,080
I know. We won't be late.

179
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,039
Hey.

180
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,080
It's time for me to score some points.

181
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Cha-aim!

182
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,399
What?

183
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,759
Just come.

184
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Do you need a hand?

185
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,759
I'm good. Come on.

186
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,879
Hey, let's check this shop out.

187
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,320
Hey, are you okay?

188
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,240
Do you want to wait outside?

189
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,279
It's okay.

190
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,279
Let's go.

191
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,559
- Josh. - What?

192
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
Is that the gym at your school?

193
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,799
There.

194
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,480
Right. It looks similar.

195
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,159
But it's a storeroom now.

196
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,679
Guys,

197
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,720
is that our school?

198
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,279
Huh? But why are there photos of university students?

199
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,840
Maybe there were student teachers back then?

200
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,639
I don't think so.

201
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,600
There shouldn't be. The school's far from the city.

202
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,559
(October 6, 1976)

203
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,960
October 6, 1976?

204
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
All of you,

205
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,519
you can look.

206
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,759
But do not touch.

207
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,120
I found a roll of film.

208
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
It was dated during Red October.

209
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,360
They probably were university students

210
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,320
accused of being communists.

211
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,170
(October 6, 1976)

212
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Huh?

213
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,119
What?

214
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:36,759
Do you remember when I said at one point

215
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,559
that I saw a bunch of ghosts?

216
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,480
It's these people. I recognize them.

217
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,519
(October 6, 1976)

218
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,039
Maybe they fled and died at our school?

219
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,759
(October 6, 1976)

220
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,359
That shop was so spooky.

221
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,200
It ruined my plan too.

222
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,519
And don't rush, you two.

223
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,999
I'm going to ask Cha-aim to be my girlfriend.

224
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,119
- Huh? - Huh?

225
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Right now?

226
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,519
Do I smell?

227
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,440
No.

228
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,890
Are you sure?

229
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,650
Cha-aim.

230
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,650
Huh?

231
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,920
Can you hand me the paint?

232
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,890
The paintbrushes too.

233
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,240
Can you be my girlfriend as well?

234
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,079
Huh?

235
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,920
Come on, Cha-aim. You're so slow on the uptake.

236
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,799
I don't want to repeat myself.

237
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,680
Do you want to go out with me?

238
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
But...

239
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,079
Can I give you an answer later?

240
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,920
Can you do that now?

241
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,440
Or I won't be able to sleep tonight.

242
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,480
Don't be silent, Cha-aim.

243
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,890
What do you think, Nai? Dan?

244
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Well...

245
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,839
We're in the same group.

246
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,680
If I'm going to have a boyfriend,

247
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,200
I want to ask the rest of the group for their opinions too.

248
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,119
So what do you two say?

249
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,759
I don't have a problem with it.

250
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,279
What about you, Dan?

251
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,039
Uh...

252
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,480
Do you have a problem?

253
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,650
Or do you like Cha-aim?

254
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,319
No, it's up to you, Cha-aim.

255
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,359
But I think

256
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Josh will be able to take good care of you.

257
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,079
Yeah. Okay.

258
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,720
All right.

259
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,200
About the question you asked me just now,

260
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,279
I'll...

261
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,079
I'll say yes.

262
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,839
- Really? - Yeah.

263
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,720
Guys, all of the backdrops fell down! Come and have a look!

264
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,279
Huh?

265
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,359
Let's go.

266
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,799
Nothing's broken.

267
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,359
(Drama Club)

268
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,359
What's going on? I can't open it!

269
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,480
I've been looking forward to this moment for so long!

270
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,000
I put his wallet in that room.

271
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,400
I'm so sorry.

272
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,240
What moment?

273
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,480
The moment I can finally deal with you.

274
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,720
What did I do to you?

275
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,640
We made an oath to Brother to leave each other alone!

276
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,599
But didn't you start messing with me first?

277
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,000
What did I do?

278
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,680
Then who gave my wallet to Brother

279
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,880
if it wasn't any of you?

280
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,519
I did.

281
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hey.

282
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,079
Are you that madly in love with me?

283
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,200
Is that why you returned my belongings?

284
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,000
Hand it in yourself if you're so in love with me!

285
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,559
That's right.

286
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,160
I'm so in love with you. Just like how you used to love me.

287
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,000
Gay-lover!

288
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,839
Nai!

289
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,640
Anan!

290
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,799
Anan, let go!

291
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Let go!

292
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,079
Stop!

293
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Let go!

294
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,720
Let go of me!

295
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,079
- Nai! - Let go of me!

296
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,640
You're straddling me?

297
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,640
Do you want to do me that badly?

298
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,759
Do it! Do me now!

299
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,279
- You jerk! - Nai!

300
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,279
Quick! Go and get Master Joe!

301
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,359
What's going on?

302
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,839
Master Joe!

303
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Nai!

304
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,318
Get Brother Anurak and Uncle Rerng.

305
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,319
Yes, sir!

306
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Dan!

307
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Dan!

308
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,279
- Dan! - Hey!

309
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,599
Hey!

310
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
What?

311
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,039
- Cha-aim! - What's happening?

312
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,119
Cha-aim!

313
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,599
Cha-aim!

314
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,880
Give me a hand!

315
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,079
- Cha-aim! - Cha-aim!

316
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,240
- Cha-aim! - Cha-aim!

317
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,400
- Cha-aim! - Cha-aim!

318
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,160
Call an ambulance!

319
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Are you okay?

320
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,440
- Let me come with you, sir. - All right.

321
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Then I'd like to come too.

322
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:47,359
No need. Cha-aim's my girlfriend. I'll take care of her.

323
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,880
You didn't see the whole thing, did you?

324
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
No.

325
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,359
But I saw a boy coming to get Dan and his friends before that.

326
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,440
It was as if there was something going on.

327
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:24,279
Everyone seemed panicked and ran after him.

328
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,200
I don't think it was them that started the fight.

329
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,920
Good thing Nai isn't in serious condition.

330
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,559
But it's Cha-aim that worries me. She's still unconscious.

331
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,960
Her diagnosis was inconclusive.

332
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,319
Have you informed Sister Rose?

333
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:47,720
I have. They're on the way now.

334
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,079
So how are you going to deal with Anan?

335
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,079
I've informed his father

336
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,000
about him assaulting his schoolmates

337
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,559
and what happened at School Night Party.

338
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,039
Everything inevitably points toward him.

339
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,640
Won't his father...

340
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,720
It's best to leave it to his family.

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
You can go back and rest, Master Joe.

342
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,640
I'll stay here and wait for everyone.

343
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,319
Okay.

344
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,119
Do you want to keep her alive

345
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,920
and let her announce to the world

346
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,440
you're the father of her baby?

347
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,640
If you got an abortion in the first place,

348
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,880
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

349
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,720
It's finally over.

350
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:33,799
Not yet.

351
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,200
There's still Trin.

352
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,839
He knows the baby Pare was carrying

353
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,640
is mine.

354
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,079
If you got an abortion in the first place,

355
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,000
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

356
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,279
Why did you kill Pare?

357
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,000
Why did you kill me?

358
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,400
Why did you kill me?

359
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,039
Anan?

360
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,119
Why did you kill me?

361
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Anan?

362
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,119
Anan, what's wrong with you?

00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,519
I'm sorry!

367
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,519
I did it, ma'am!

368
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,079
I made a mistake!

369
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,720
I deserved it!

I'm sorry!

371
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,519
Are you happy now?

372
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,279
I'm sorry!

373
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:53,200
- Hello. - Hello.

374
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Cha-aim,

375
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,799
it's time to wake up.

376
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,200
I'm here now.

377
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,759
Everyone's here.

378
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,079
Please don't leave me.

379
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,559
So we'll be able to hang out again.

380
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,720
Cha-aim,

381
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
please wake up and talk to me.

382
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,119
Cha-aim.

383
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,559
Cha-aim.

384
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,199
She'll wake up soon, ma'am.

385
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,039
She has to.

386
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,480
Do you think it's possible

387
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,079
Anan dealt with Trin?

388
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,000
I don't think so.

389
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,769
After Pare died,

390
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:56,599
Anan seemed to have stopped messing with Trin

391
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,039
because...

392
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,000
I think

393
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:12,000
Anan must have distributed Trin's letter at school to get revenge.

394
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:16,809
He's the only one capable of doing something so dirty.

395
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,960
By the way,

396
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,119
how come you saw that kind of vision again?

397
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,599
It's probably because of the shadow.

398
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,440
It must've shown it to me.

399
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,679
It wanted to protect me.

400
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:43,960
Did you start seeing the shadow again?

401
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,519
Yeah. Why?

402
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,519
Listen to me.

403
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,960
You have to stop seeing the shadow.

404
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,999
It might end up taking your life.

405
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,809
What are you on about?

406
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,840
The shadow's not the same as before.

407
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,440
It actually came back to help me this time.

408
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,960
We got you the tattoo

409
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,119
to ward off evil beings,

410
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,920
including that shadow.

411
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,960
And you're still going to insist it's helping you?

412
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,119
I just want you to be safe.

413
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,840
The shadow isn't evil.

414
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,329
It's protecting me.

415
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,559
Is this how it has to end?

416
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,840
It's okay.

417
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:06,480
I'll sort everything out

418
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,559
once I've recovered.

419
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,920
So we can raise our baby like we've discussed.

420
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,679
Not anymore.

421
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,039
Krit's found out.

422
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,400
He knows he's infertile.

423
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,809
He forced me to get an abortion.

424
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:45,639
Your son just woke up.

425
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,199
We'll wait until his condition has improved,

426
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,119
then we'll question him further.

427
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:30,440
Dan.

428
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
It's Pare,

429
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,519
isn't it?

430
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,360
I'm sorry

431
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,159
I hurt you at the tree that time.

432
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,840
We weren't able to communicate like this back then.

433
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,199
All I could do was make you experience

434
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,679
the last thing I felt in life.

435
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,039
It's okay. It's in the past now.

436
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,480
But you must've suffered a lot.

437
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,809
You keep getting hurt over and over.

438
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Right.

439
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,599
But probably not as much as Mom.

440
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,880
Can you tell her

441
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,679
not to worry about me anymore?

442
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:43,840
And thank you

443
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,559
for making me realize

444
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,400
Anan was the one who hurt me.

445
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,079
I didn't.

446
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,679
It's the thing that's protecting me.

447
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,329
Josh thinks that by doing this,

448
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,559
Cha-aim will be able to hear his voice

449
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,239
and wake up.

450
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,078
Did you go to see that shadow again?

451
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,329
It came to me.

452
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,359
Don't you believe what I said?

453
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,880
It might actually hurt you.

454
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,400
Instead of finding someone that doesn't exist,

455
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:30,679
shouldn't you spend your time trying to help Cha-aim instead?

456
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,440
I want to know

457
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,199
if the one-armed man really exists.

458
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:36,679
His name is Andrea.

459
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,440
He's a priest at St. Lawrence.
