00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,039
Hello, Brother.

2
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,319
Hello, Dan. How was the travel?

3
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,000
It was good, sir.

4
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,360
Hello.

5
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,639
This is Rerng. He'll help you with your accommodation.

6
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,839
- Hello. - Hello.

7
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,240
I'll take your bag to the dormitory.

8
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Thank you.

9
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,519
Dan, follow me.

10
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,800
How's your father?

11
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,199
I heard he needs another surgery.

12
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,519
Yes, sir.

13
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,759
He's still not getting any better.

14
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,050
He can't move

15
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,639
or open his eyes.

16
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,199
It's like he's having a dream and he's sleeptalking.

17
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,319
May God protect him.

18
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,240
I believe he'll get better eventually.

19
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,839
(School Building)

20
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,800
Our school is turning 80 this year.

21
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,519
It's been a well-known boys' school for a very long time.

22
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,639
Here, we address the students as "gentlemen".

23
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,199
There are rules and regulations, of course.

24
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,479
But more important than that are traditions

25
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,920
and respecting among students in each year,

26
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,800
teachers and the brotherhood.

27
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Dan,

28
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,120
you're now one of St. Laurence's gentlemen.

29
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,759
Yes, sir.

30
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,319
Follow me.

31
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,079
(Class 11/3)

32
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,839
Hello, Brother.

33
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,160
Look after this new student.

34
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
Of course.

35
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,839
All right, everyone. A new classmate in joining us today.

36
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,480
Why don't you introduce yourself?

37
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,519
I'm Danai Rungrueng.

38
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,199
You can call me Dan.

39
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,079
Hello.

40
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,240
That's it?

41
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes, sir.

42
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,720
I guess he's probably nervous.

43
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
It's okay. We'll get to know each other.

44
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,560
Dan, go and find a seat.

45
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,839
All right. Let's keep going with the first formula.

46
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,519
- Shoot! - Whoa!

47
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Uh-oh!

48
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Silence!

49
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,279
Pay attention.

50
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,399
Here.

51
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Let's move on to the next example.

52
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,959
(Trin)

53
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
It's for you.

54
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
From whom?

55
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,560
I don't know. The guys were just passing it around.

56
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,199
See this example.

57
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,758
X equals one.

58
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,279
So X divided by X equals one.

59
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,120
All right, everyone. That's it for today.

60
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,040
Don't forget to do your exercise.

61
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,720
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

62
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,639
Can I have my notebook back?

63
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,399
Huh?

64
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,279
It's mine.

65
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,279
(Nai)

66
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,159
Did you trick me into taking notes for you?

67
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,679
You're the new guy. So I hazed you a little.

68
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,600
My name's Nai.

69
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,039
Oh? Hey! You didn't take any notes!

70
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,360
What is this?

71
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,240
Thank you.

72
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,720
Why are you following me?

73
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm not.

74
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,000
It's the way back to the dorm.

75
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,799
Do you think you're the only one who's a boarder?

76
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,240
Are you mad?

77
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,039
It was just a bit of a joke

78
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,240
so you'll be able to handle it if someone gets rough with bullying.

79
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,840
Do you know where you're heading?

80
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,799
Don't you have a friend?

81
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,120
Stop trying to talk to me. It's annoying.

82
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,039
Fruitcake!

83
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,279
Throw it back!

84
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,519
- Who do you think you are? - Hey, hey!

85
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

86
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,960
Hello, Master.

87
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,000
You got lucky this time.

88
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,480
Was that the bullying...

89
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,240
you told me about?

90
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,879
He encountered something unexpected when he came home.

91
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,039
His girlfriend had mysteriously hung herself.

92
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,519
But you know what?

93
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,720
The spirit of his heavily pregnant girlfriend

94
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,919
never left.

95
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,360
Shoot!

96
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,240
Nai, you startled me!

97
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,480
Gee,

98
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,279
you have a new toy but you won't share.

99
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,519
I thought it was Master.

100
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,120
That's against the dorm rule. Aren't you scared of Surat?

101
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,960
How many has he confiscated? Do you think that would stop me?

102
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,080
Who is this moron?

103
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,639
How come you transferred here all of a sudden?

104
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,600
No reason in particular.

105
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,440
Were you kicked out of your old school?

106
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,960
Did your parents send you here as a punishment?

107
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
- Josh! - Oh?

108
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,080
You and your mouth.

109
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,279
What? I'm just curious.

110
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,320
I'm just here to study.

111
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,720
You really are a busybody.

112
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,759
You dared to call me names on the first meet?

113
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,559
Everyone knows they can trust the news from Josh the busybody.

114
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,759
Right, Nai?

115
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,039
Do you want to play?

116
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,799
Okay. Suit yourself.

117
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,759
Is there something strange on my face?

118
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,000
People keep looking at me since we were in class.

119
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,080
You're the new guy.

120
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,080
Naturally, people are going to gossip

121
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,720
about whose connection helped you get in.

122
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,080
I have an announcement to make.

123
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,240
There will be police officers

124
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,360
coming in and out of the school intermittently...

125
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,039
to maintain safety...

126
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,440
- for all of you. - What's happened?

127
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,200
Please cooperate with them

128
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,279
if they wish to question you.

129
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,320
Please also avoid the area near the lake behind the school.

130
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,440
Refrain from rowing in the lake or strolling in the area

131
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,960
because the search for evidence still has to continue.

132
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,559
Huh? Isn't the case with Trin over?

133
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,519
Is he dead or not?

134
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,360
That's him. It's new guy.

135
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,279
He sat at Trin's desk.

136
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,080
- Why would he? - Right?

137
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,159
Hang on.

138
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,279
You sat at Trin's desk?

139
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,559
I guess. I saw his name etched on it.

140
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,039
Shoot!

141
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Josh!

142
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,039
Why did you have to be so loud?

143
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,559
The whole school already knows.

144
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,080
What did this Trin do?

145
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,080
Last year,

146
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,039
he disappeared all of a sudden.

147
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,559
They said he disappeared near the lake at the back.

148
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,200
They searched underwater for a long time.

149
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,440
But they only found his jacket in the end.

150
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,799
The cops have been looking for him for over a year now

151
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,399
but they still haven't found him.

152
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,840
And the desk you sat at is cursesd.

153
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,559
Someone tried to dump it

154
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,519
but it came back to where it was the next day.

155
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,480
Spooky!

156
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,960
What happened to Trin is notorious.

157
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,279
The ghost story show I listen to even mentioned it.

158
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,440
Our school is cursed. It's full of ghosts,

159
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,200
especially the lake at the back.

160
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,200
It's super haunted!

161
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,840
If you follow the howling of a dog at night

162
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,320
right up to the lake,

163
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,440
you'll find...

164
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Shoot!

165
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,840
Please continue, Josh.

166
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,600
I mean the ghost stories.

167
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,559
You'll run out soon

168
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,360
because I'm confiscating your walkman.

169
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,559
So you won't be listening to those stupid radio ghost stories.

170
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,799
Come on, Master. I haven't gotten my comic back yet.

171
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,080
If you want to know about something, just ask any Master.

172
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,799
Don't make up stories and become scared among yourselves.

173
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,799
Why would they want to keep the lake story secret?

174
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,240
My toys are all gone.

175
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,879
Hey, St. Louis! Gather around!

176
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,919
Come on! What are you looking at?

177
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,559
Get going, all of you!

178
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,759
- Move! - Stop dragging your feet!

179
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,320
You're such a slow poke!

180
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,120
Get moving!

181
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,360
Last week,

182
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,879
Our House was beaten by St. George and St. Peter in cleanliness points.

183
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Does anyone want to give me an excuse?

184
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,840
No?

185
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,200
Good.

186
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,279
This week

187
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,240
is our cleaning duty.

188
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,120
So we talked and came up with an idea

189
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,080
to give the people responsible for last week's defeat

190
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,840
another chance.

191
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
You guys can clean up the place again this week

192
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,320
and take back the champion title, understand?

193
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,519
- Hm! - Hm!

194
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,840
What's all this humming about?

195
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,279
There!

196
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,320
Our House's symbol.

197
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,919
St. Louis. The leopard.

198
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,679
There's a hierarchy among the leopards.

199
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,200
There are alphas.

200
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,159
And we are your alphas.

201
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,879
Our duty is to instruct you to follow the school's rules.

202
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,480
Everything we're doing

203
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,159
is so that you can become a good upper-year student.

204
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,960
Remember.

205
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,000
This system

206
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,079
is going to continue to help you.

207
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,799
I heard there is a new student.

208
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,839
Hey,

209
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,480
let me give you advice as an upper-year student.

210
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,519
If you want to make friends, choose wisely.

211
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,559
Stay away from the fruitcakes.

212
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,200
If you end up sleeping with each other

213
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,440
and Master catches you, we won't help you!

214
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,839
Excuse me.

215
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,000
Leopards

216
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,720
usually live in solitude.

217
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,410
They live in a group or a pair only during mating seasons.

218
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,319
I think it's usually lions that live in a pride.

219
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,079
So you should do some research

220
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,440
before making an analogy

221
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,839
or you might lose your credibility.

222
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,079
Everyone, get down on the ground!

223
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,839
Get down

224
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,410
and put your hands behind your back!

225
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,279
I said get down!

226
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,960
Down!

227
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,759
Hey! This guy is asking for it!

228
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,680
You'll soon find out how things are when there's a defiant one.

229
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,410
You don't need any sleep tonight.

230
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,650
You can all just stay here!

231
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,119
Can I apologize on Dan's behalf?

232
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,039
Just let the rest go to bed, Anan.

233
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't say my name, Fruitcake.

234
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,039
What are you doing?

235
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,079
This is a school, not a military camp!

236
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,559
Get up.

237
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,599
I said get up!

238
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,440
Anan, your duty is to look after the younger year students.

239
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,759
You have no right to punish them for no reason.

240
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,799
But this new guy doesn't respect us.

241
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,960
- Hey! - Just apologize to him

242
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,480
so it'll be over.

243
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,720
I didn't mean it, sir.

244
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,559
Brother, but he...

245
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,279
Enough! That's enough.

246
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,720
Everyone, hit the showers and go to bed.

247
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,759
I'll deal with Dan myself.

248
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,720
Dan, follow me.

249
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,839
How did Brother just show up?

250
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,920
Forget it. He'll get his punishment.

251
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:51,279
I'm going to give him pain.

252
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,000
Tell me when your symptoms have become more frequent.

253
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,200
Around a week before I came here.

254
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,920
I couldn't sleep at all.

255
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,799
I experienced this every day

256
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
and I had to hold my breath when I dreamed

257
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,410
to feel as if I was about to die.

258
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,480
Then I'd be able to wake up.

259
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,720
What do you see in this picture?

260
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,650
A shadow.

261
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,650
Do you still see the shadow?

262
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,920
Can you tell me

263
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,410
what happened the first time you saw it?

264
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,279
It's probably when I was around seven.

265
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,000
Actually, I've been able to sense it for a very long time.

266
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,039
But after my mom's death,

267
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,480
it became even more apparent.

268
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,890
It didn't hurt me or anything.

269
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,319
And how's your condition been recently?

270
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,720
I can't breathe.

271
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,240
I can't move.

272
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,279
It's as if it can take away my soul at any time.

273
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,410
If you don't believe in the existence of the shadow,

274
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,720
it can't do anything to you.

275
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,759
Your mind is of the most importance.

276
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,599
Maybe if I know what it actually is,

277
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:53,160
I might be able to find a way to deal with it.

278
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,960
Dan, the mind is inside the body.

279
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,759
If your mind is strong and you know it's just dream,

280
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,559
it'll get better.

281
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,160
Trust me.

282
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,559
But after tonight,

283
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,480
whenever your symptoms start to show,

284
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,480
you have to take notes of what you see straightaway.

285
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,880
We're going to meet at least twice a week.

286
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,359
But if you really feel like you can't cope on any day,

287
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,359
take the medication the doctor prescribed you

288
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,039
so you'll be able to sleep more soundly.

289
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,319
All right, everyone. Gather round.

290
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,519
Everyone, line up!

291
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,720
- Hey! - Hey!

292
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,799
All right. Today, we're going to do a 4x100 medley.

293
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,079
You'll be divided into groups

294
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,920
of four people each.

295
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,160
Whichever group that gets the best record time

296
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
will get extra points from me.

297
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,720
If that's clear enough, then get into groups.

298
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,480
- Yes, Master! - Yes, Master!

299
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,960
Do you have a group yet?

300
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,799
Not yet.

301
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,720
Come on.

302
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,839
Don't group together, school athletes.

303
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,480
- Yes, Master. - Yes, Master.

304
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,839
And don't cheat either.

305
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,119
Do you want to team up?

306
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,319
I'm not a good swimmer.

307
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,559
That's okay.

308
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,440
I don't hope to win anyway.

309
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,759
Okay. Ready!

310
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,960
Get set!

311
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,960
Go! Go! Go! Go!

312
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,960
Come on!

313
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,640
Keep going!

314
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,519
It's your turn.

315
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,279
Next person!

316
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,680
Ready!

317
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
They're broken.

318
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,480
Get set!

319
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,240
Dan? Dan!

320
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,319
Dan?

321
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,079
Dan?

322
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,960
Can you hear me, Dan?

323
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,559
Dan?

324
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,400
Aw, Nai!

325
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,680
You sure won't let an opportunity pass by.

326
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,160
He's only here for a short while and they're together now.

327
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,039
Aw!

328
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,559
What on earth are you talking about?

329
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,680
Who's going to take responsibility if he drowns?

330
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,240
Come on. We were only joking. Don't be too serious.

331
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,319
Dan, what did you do?

332
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,079
How come you just sank like a rock?

333
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,279
Maybe Trin's ghost pulled his legs down?

334
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,319
- Trin's ghost? - Disperse. Don't clutter up.

335
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,359
Are you two okay?

336
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,480
You take him to the infirmary.

337
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,079
That's all for today.

338
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,200
Class is over.

339
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:57,160
- Yes, Master. - Yes, Master.

340
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,759
You're okay?

341
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,440
How was Trin like when he was alive?

342
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,960
Trin Dhevawijitra.

343
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,959
He was the president of the student council.

344
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,640
(Drama Club Teacher, Lead Actor)

345
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,240
Not many people were fond of him.

346
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,359
Some of the Masters didn't like him either.

347
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:36,279
They said Trin was disrespectful.

348
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,039
Anan's gang who were in the same year hated him even more

349
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,680
because Trin disliked the patronage system.

350
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,960
So he was always butting heads with them.

351
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,519
Last year, before he disappeared,

352
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,039
he got into trouble with Master Joe.

353
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,559
Master Joe is the Drama Club teacher.

354
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,640
What happened?

355
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,559
There was an accusation that they were dating.

356
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,000
It got so out of hand the Drama Club had to be disbanded.

357
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,119
And was it true?

358
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,960
I don't know.

359
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,400
But after that,

360
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,039
no one wanted be friends with Trin.

361
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,599
And everyone accused Master Joe of being behind the disappearance.

362
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:33,559
But no one was able to implicate him in the end.

363
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,359
If he's disappeared this long, wouldn't that mean he's dead?

364
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,839
Hey, look at the new guy.

365
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:47,680
I guess he wants to fill Trin's shoes.

366
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,640
I know. I saw that.

367
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,599
He probably wants to end up like him

368
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,319
that's why he's sitting in his seat.

369
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,359
He's really daring.

370
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,960
And what does that have anything to do with me?

371
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,039
You're his replacement, of course.

372
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,079
Trin disappeared, then you transferred here

373
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,319
and sat in his seat.

374
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,279
You're also the Brother's pet as well.

375
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,400
How can it be this coincidental?

376
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,799
Everyone thinks you're replacing Trin.

377
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,119
That's the most random thing I've ever heard, Josh.

378
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,920
You have to stop listening to those radio ghost stories.

379
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,599
And how did you

380
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,680
manage to get it back?

381
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,000
Surat's office key.

382
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,919
I won't let it be confiscated

383
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,519
or my dad's going to blow my ears off.

384
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,039
I just asked Uncle Rerng to make a copy of the key

385
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,599
and tipped him a little. The rest is sneaking around.

386
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,920
(Stage actors wanted for Hamlet)

387
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,400
It's not every day you see students

388
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,079
being interested in the school's magazines.

389
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,240
No one usually read those.

390
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,680
They'd only look at the photos, cut out their own, and keep it.

391
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,839
(Stage actors wanted for Hamlet)

392
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
If you're interested in doing something fun,

393
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:20,519
drop by for the audition.

394
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,079
But if you don't like acting,

395
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,279
there are many other positions to fill in the club.

396
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,799
There's also a surprise this year.

397
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,119
I hope I get to see all of you there.

398
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,480
This club is full of uncool people and wannabes.

399
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,839
Aren't you going to move?

400
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,279
Why would I? I don't see a problem.

401
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,640
Attention! Everybody, please stand up.

402
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,599
- Good afternoon, Teacher. - Good afternoon, Teacher.

403
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,599
- How are you? - How are you?

404
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:19,319
I'm very well. Thank you.

405
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,400
You may sit down.

406
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,240
- Thank you, Teacher. - Thank you, Teacher.

407
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,319
Let's continue where we left off last time on Greek Mythology.

408
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,319
Orpheus and Eurydice.

409
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,240
River Styx, also known as the infernal river,

410
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,720
is the boundary between Earth and the Underworld

411
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,160
in Greek Mythology.

412
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,359
Any soul that wants to pass through the boundary to the Underworld

413
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,640
has to pay a coin to the ferryman for the passage.

414
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:58,079
Many mythologies in several cultures also use this symbol.

415
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,358
For Thai culture, this symbol is called

416
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,759
"Ngern Pak Phee".

417
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,880
Can you give me an example of

418
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,880
contemporary literature similar to this story?

419
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,519
The Undying Lands in "The Lord of the Rings"

420
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,920
Frodo traveled to at the end of the story.

421
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,400
None of you know the answer to that question?

422
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,640
It's "The Lord of the Rings," of course.

423
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,759
Hasn't any of you read it?

424
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,920
What happened, Brother?

425
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,359
What happened to me?

426
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,039
Your classmates said you suddenly fainted and fell off your chair.

427
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,239
You're lucky you didn't get injured or hit your head.

428
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,920
Have you been feeling okay lately?

429
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,079
Brother,

430
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:21,329
it's true I can sleep now with the medication.

431
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,400
But the shadow's still harassing me.

432
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,880
The medication hasn't helped me at all, Brother.

433
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,119
Have you started recording your dreams?

434
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,239
Not yet.

435
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,289
Then, I'm ordering you to start today.

436
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,960
It's for your own sake, Dan.

437
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,000
Yes, Brother.

438
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,920
What on earth are you doing? Why are you still up?

439
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,289
And what are you doing here?

440
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,480
What are you drawing?

441
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,639
Can I ask you something?

442
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,329
When you were underwater,

443
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,599
did you see anything?

444
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,159
I think that might be

445
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,329
Trin's spirit.

446
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,199
Are you saying he's dead?

447
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,079
Do you believe in the spirit realm?

448
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,559
There are many dimensions

449
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,480
moving along this world.

450
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,679
But each person's sense and perception are different.

451
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,960
Some people hear voices.

452
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,079
Some people's hair stands on end

453
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,239
when there's a spirit nearby.

454
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,239
Some people might feel more than that.

455
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,599
I can see things around me.

456
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,480
But I choose to ignore them

457
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,840
because when I was a kid

458
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,079
I responded to a voice asking me to come and play with it.

459
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,329
And in the end, I got this.

460
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,599
What are you looking at?

461
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,079
Back there.

462
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:54,719
There's one.

463
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,559
So that means

464
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,639
because of my stupid sense,

465
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:24,440
I can always see the shadow.

466
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,239
And I had to transfer here because of it.

467
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,480
When I'm asleep,

468
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,119
I always see the stupid shadow in my dream.

469
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:37,559
I've seen it since I was young.

470
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,599
But since I got here, I don't know what the heck is...

471
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,679
Just forget it.

472
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,119
No one's going to understand a word I say anyway.

473
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,519
People always think it's just sleep paralysis.

474
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Hang on.

475
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,329
If it's just sleep paralysis,

476
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,769
shouldn't the shadow just appear to you when you're asleep?

477
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,480
Well, yes. It only appears when I'm asleep.

478
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,039
- But... - When you were drowning,

479
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,360
I saw it too

480
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,480
when I was trying to save you.

481
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,480
Then, that means...

482
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,519
It doesn't just appear when I'm dreaming.

483
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,840
You can't go to the lake!

484
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,639
We'll get in trouble if Brother finds out!

485
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,039
I don't care!

486
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:40,360
I want to find out if the shadow is Trin or not!

487
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,880
And if it is, what does he want from me?

488
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,159
But you can't just go there!

489
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,119
I just want to get it over with so we can leave each other alone!

490
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,039
Dan!

491
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,079
Dan!

492
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Dan!

493
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,719
Dan, let's get back to the dorm!

494
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,199
Dan!

495
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,769
Leave me alone!

496
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,719
Wait up! Dan!

497
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:04,809
(Do Not Enter)

498
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,639
Dan, wait!

499
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,329
We should go back.

500
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,840
Dan? Dan!

501
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:30,039
Dan!

502
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,480
Dan, what's wrong with you?

503
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,809
Wake up!

504
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,119
Dan!

505
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,880
What should I do?

506
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,880
Dan, wake up!

507
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,239
Dan?

508
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:24,199
Dan!

509
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,119
Dan, wake up...

510
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:31,039
Dan!

511
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,599
Trin?

512
00:41:58,329 --> 00:41:59,999
They must be so in love!

513
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,078
They're holding onto each other too!

514
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,809
Why haven't you ever thought of fighting him back?

515
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
Why should I bother?

516
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:06,639
No one's going to side with me anyway.

517
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,480
I know what you are.

518
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,809
It might be better if you and Dan keep a bit of distance.

519
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,960
But other people might find you disgusting.

520
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Did Ms. Yada say something to you?

521
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,959
Who's going to take responsibility if someone got seriously injured?

522
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,238
But after the incident that night,

523
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,038
I don't think it only depends on the strength of my mind anymore.

524
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,840
There has to be more to it.
