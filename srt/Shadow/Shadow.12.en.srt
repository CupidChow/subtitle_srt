00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:30,079
Help!

2
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,439
Help!

3
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,479
Help!

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,280
Help! Can anyone hear me?

5
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,560
Help!

6
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,719
Do you want to go out with me?

7
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,120
What do you think, Nai? Dan?

8
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,879
I don't have a problem with it.

9
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,879
What about you, Dan?

10
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,280
Uh...

11
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,920
Do you have a problem?

12
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,040
Or do you like Cha-aim?

13
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,680
Hello, Bancha.

14
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,280
I'll see you behind the dorm.

15
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,599
(The Tragedy of Hamlet)

16
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,400
Where have you been?

17
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,240
I thought we'd never see each other again.

18
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,039
Don't disappear again, okay?

19
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,240
(Hamlet)

20
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,610
Oh, Josh?

21
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,839
Hey, Bancha.

22
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,480
What's wrong with you?

23
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,279
Why did you ask me to deliver the goods to the school?

24
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,730
Don't you know it's super risky?

25
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,639
I'll have to charge you double.

26
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,240
I was super nervous when I drove here.

27
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,240
Sorry.

28
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,610
I'm going through something. I just want to toke and forget.

29
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Here you go.

30
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
I wrapped them beautifully just for you.

31
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,199
Tell me if you like it.

32
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,360
What's with you?

33
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,170
Are you okay?

34
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,610
You're not like the Josh I know. What's the matter?

35
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,240
Tell me if there's anything.

36
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,730
It's difficult to say.

37
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,680
It's okay. Things will get better.

38
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,170
Let's do it this way. Should I drive you to the city?

39
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Take in the scenery and check out girls.

40
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,680
Are you interested?

41
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,879
Sure.

42
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,959
But can I bring a friend?

43
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,879
It's up to you. I'll wait here.

44
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,920
(Room 302)

45
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,079
(Room 302)

46
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,079
Are you going to visit Dan?

47
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,759
Mm.

48
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,560
I'm worried about his arm.

49
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,560
How's his wound?

50
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,079
It's quite deep.

51
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm planning to bring him his stuff.

52
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,199
By the way, have you seen his sketchbook?

53
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,000
He might feel like drawing.

54
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,120
It's in the dresser.

55
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,800
I have to go and work on my report.

56
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,920
Look after Dan for me.

57
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Sure.

58
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,759
Did you go to see that shadow again?

59
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,439
It came to me.

60
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,759
Don't you believe what I said?

61
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,439
It might actually hurt you.

62
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,800
And how many times do I have to tell you

63
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,800
it's not hurting me? It brought me happiness.

64
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,639
It made you feel that happy, huh?

65
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,439
You can just give this up.

66
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,360
Everyone's trying to help you.

67
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,920
But whether you come to your senses is up to you.

68
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,079
Will you guys go for a drive with me?

69
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,879
My head's full of Cha-aim.

70
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,360
It's already past curfew.

71
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,160
We'll all get in trouble if we get caught.

72
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,639
I don't care if you don't go.

73
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,560
What about you?

74
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,560
Okay! I'm not important to anyone!

75
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,040
I'll just go alone, you jerks!

76
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,279
Josh,

77
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,120
why did you bring along so many friends? It's awkward.

78
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,399
Are you trying to attract the cops?

79
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,480
Do you know we'd split up into two teams

80
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,480
when we snuck out back then?

81
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,799
The first team would stay at the dorm to keep a lookout.

82
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,480
Surat always made me do a urine test.

83
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,120
I was super nervous.

84
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Hey.

85
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,159
Ma'am, our team came all the way here.

86
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,210
Can you tell us about the legend of the one-armed man?

87
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,000
Is it true his spirit's been haunting the villagers?

88
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,600
From what I've heard,

89
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,559
he was a boxer from 20 years or so ago.

90
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
Then he joined the navy.

91
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,039
But there was an accident.

92
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,639
The chain from an anchor tore his left arm right off.

93
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,840
Whoa.

94
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,399
It tore his left arm right off.

95
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,679
After he was discharged,

96
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,090
he sold himself to some homosexual millionaires.

97
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,679
They partied and did drugs on yachts.

98
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
The clients...

99
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,090
Do you think the one-armed man this lady's talking about

100
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,000
is the same person we're thinking of?

101
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,840
That's not all.

102
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,840
They say after he was arrested,

103
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,090
the was an influx of letters to the prison.

104
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,519
Can you take me somewhere?

105
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
They were from clients who were sexual deviants.

106
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,799
Where are you going?

107
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,559
They say you'll be able to hear

108
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,840
the sound of a chain dragging along the ground

109
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,960
- and someone moaning at night. - Ooh!

110
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,720
Villagers in the area can't sleep because of it.

111
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,120
Oh, ma'am!

112
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm already getting goosebumps just listening to the story!

113
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,240
Uh...

114
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,840
All right. Here we are.

115
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,840
You can get out now. We're here.

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,399
This is as far as I'm going to take you.

117
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,450
Thanks, Bancha.

118
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,600
- No problem. - See you.

119
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,120
Why did you come here?

120
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,000
I want to ask the lady about the story she told on the radio.

121
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,600
About that one-armed man?

122
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,919
What? When are you going to stop your obsession with these things?

123
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,960
Take it easy, Josh.

124
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,159
Oh? Why are you standing there? Come on in, already.

125
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,519
Hello, ma'am.

126
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,679
I listened to your story about the one-armed man.

127
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,360
So I'd like to ask you for more information.

128
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,200
I have to do a report on the supernatural and science.

129
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,080
Oh, I remember now.

130
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,039
It's just a story.

131
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,799
You can consider it as some sort of bedtime story.

132
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,639
Can we go now?

133
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,159
Oh, if you want to know the details,

134
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,440
ask that man over there.

135
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,480
They say he claimed to go to school with the one-armed man.

136
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,759
He was the one who told me the story.

137
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,600
But I don't know if it's true.

138
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,840
And I added an element of horror

139
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,320
to make it colorful. People like it.

140
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,559
Thank you.

141
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,200
- Excuse me, sir. - Yes?

142
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,559
Are you the man who knows the story of the one-armed man?

143
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,200
Why?

144
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,080
I want to know

145
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,200
if the one-armed man really exists.

146
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,480
Why would you want to know about him?

147
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,519
Just let him live his life in peace.

148
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,759
Are you saying he's still alive?

149
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,159
Who is he? What's his name?

150
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,600
His name is Andrea.

151
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,000
He's a priest at St. Lawrence.

152
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,799
Who's this Andrea?

153
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,000
I've been at the school for ages, but I never heard the name before.

154
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,600
We'll have to find out who the priest is and where he is.

155
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,120
Are you still obsessed with the one-armed man?

156
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,039
You already know he didn't kill Pare.

157
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,600
She died because of Anan and Ms. Yada.

158
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,679
And we don't even know if that old man was drunk.

159
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,639
Do you really believe there's a murderer at our school?

160
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,519
I think you're just delusional.

161
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,159
Josh, take it easy!

162
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,240
Instead of finding someone that doesn't exist,

163
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,039
shouldn't you spend your time trying to help Cha-aim?

164
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,639
You're so selfish, you jerk.

165
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,120
So what do you want from me?

166
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,320
Why did you shove me?

167
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,600
So what do you want to do?

168
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,639
You call me selfish when I ignore Cha-aim.

169
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,639
But when I care, you say I like Cha-aim.

170
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,000
And do you?

171
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,240
- Well, can't I? - Enough!

172
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,639
Why on earth would you two fight?

173
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,360
Darn it!

174
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,519
Hello?

175
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Dan.

176
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,720
Brother Anurak found out about the weed.

177
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,600
Jessada, Danai,

178
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,960
Brother Anurak wants to have a word.

179
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,720
As for you, Nattapon,

180
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,758
you're grounded. You can't leave the school on weekends

181
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,159
for one semester.

182
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,080
And you'll be put on probation, understand?

183
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Yes, sir.

184
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
You can go.

185
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Thank you.

186
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,879
Who does this weed belong to?

187
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
It's mine.

188
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Dan!

189
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,039
I've been under a lot of stress lately.

190
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,480
I bought it on the way to the city.

191
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Josh,

192
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,360
you can go back to the dorm now.

193
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,879
Josh?

194
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Leave us.

195
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:13,879
Dan,

196
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,960
do you know this is wrong?

197
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,759
It's going to be a problem if the police find out.

198
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,120
You could be sent to juvie.

199
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
I know, sir.

200
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,679
You know but did it anyway?

201
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,320
I can just expel you!

202
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,519
Go ahead.

203
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,399
I don't want to be here anymore either.

204
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,559
You know I have no one else left.

205
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,320
And I have to be cured of this stupid condition too.

206
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,399
But it's okay.

207
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,679
I realized weed helps me better than your treatment.

208
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,039
Dan, if you still insist on using marijuana,

209
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,360
you're going to end up like Trin!

210
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,480
How so?

211
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,000
Disappearing for good?

212
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,839
I know

213
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,650
Trin went missing because of someone named Andrea.

214
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,960
And you know him.

215
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,599
What are you talking about?

216
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,799
Andrea is the mastermind behind everything.

217
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,039
Why are you trying to protect him?

218
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,759
Do you want there to be more dead people at our school?

219
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,240
Stop talking nonsense.

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know anyone named Andrea!

221
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,960
And I order you to stop using drugs

222
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,480
before anything worse happens to you!

223
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,319
I don't know what happened to you.

224
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,200
But I'd like you to imagine your mother's face.

225
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,599
Don't mention my mother!

226
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,279
And even if she was alive,

227
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,890
I'd look for the truth you're trying to hide anyway.

228
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,359
Let me ask you something.

229
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,359
Aren't you ashamed of calling yourself a priest?

230
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,410
Enough!

231
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,200
Is this your doing?

232
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,960
(Trin Dhevawijitra)

233
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,079
When are you going to finally leave this alone?

234
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,440
It's you who has to leave me alone.

235
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,200
Because I'm going to end this.

236
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,039
- Let go of me! - Stop! Give it to me!

237
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,440
Dan, give it to me!

238
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Sir!

239
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,720
Andrea?

240
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,960
Those students,

241
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,359
you didn't kill them, did you?

242
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,559
Answer me!

243
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,119
Dan...

244
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,920
You didn't kill them, did you?

245
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,410
I'm sorry.

246
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,440
Dan...

247
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,559
No!

248
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Dan!

249
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,279
Dan!

250
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Mom?

251
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,410
Mom!

252
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,319
Josh.

253
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,650
Josh!

254
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,279
Get up.

255
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,480
Where's Dan?

256
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,240
How should I know?

257
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,720
Didn't you come back with him last night?

258
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,279
No, he took the blame for me about the weed.

259
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,119
He's probably being punished by Brother Anurak.

260
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,599
And you had the gall to be mad at him.

261
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,319
You were too harsh to him yesterday.

262
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,960
Go and apologize to him.

263
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,919
That's rich coming from you.

264
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,880
Don't think I don't know you're mad at him too.

265
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,720
Okay.

266
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,359
What are you mad at him about?

267
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,519
The shadow of course.

268
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,839
I've been trying to warn him,

269
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,519
but he won't listen.

270
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,279
I'm really worried about him.

271
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,599
Mm. I understand.

272
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,440
Is he at the church?

273
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,119
He might be cleaning as a punishment.

274
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,440
Mm. Hurry up and shower. Then we can go and help him.

275
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Dan?

276
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,359
Dan?

277
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,680
Uncle Rerng,

278
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,079
have you seen Dan?

279
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,000
He didn't come here.

280
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,039
Maybe he's at the club.

281
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,559
It's almost opening day. He might want to rehearse.

282
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Let's check it out.

283
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,559
Hey, when is Dan going to be here?

284
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,160
So we can start rehearsing.

285
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I don't want to waste any more time. Opening day is soon.

286
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,160
Hasn't he arrived?

287
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,319
Do you see him?

288
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,839
Ugh! You guys are useless.

289
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,039
If there's going to be this much trouble,

290
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,799
maybe we should just call it off.

291
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,240
She's unbelievable.

292
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,799
Is something wrong?

293
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,920
It's Dan. We don't know where he is.

294
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,278
We've been searching the whole school for him since his morning,

295
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,480
but we can't find him.

296
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,039
I'll recruit some staff to help find him.

297
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Come in.

298
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,880
Hello, Brother Anurak.

299
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,519
Hello, Inspector.

300
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,079
I'm here to give you updates about Ms. Kamon's case.

301
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:43,319
I'm afraid Anan and Yada will have to be sent to prison.

302
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,799
According to our evidence, it's very likely

303
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,319
both of them worked together to kill Ms. Kamon's daughter.

304
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,119
We'll probably have to wait for Anan to recover

305
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,839
until we can interrogate him. Isn't that right?

306
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,359
That's right.

307
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,880
Then I'd like to ask you

308
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,359
to keep me updated.

309
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,400
Of course. I'm happy to. I'll be on my way then.

310
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
No problem.

311
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Brother Anurak,

312
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,519
have you seen Dan?

313
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,119
He's missing.

314
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,119
He didn't come back here.

315
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,839
I didn't see him in the common room either.

316
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,279
Should we check somewhere else?

317
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,599
Where is he?

318
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,039
Where could he be?

319
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,599
There's no sign of him.

320
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,519
Mm. I glanced around and didn't see him either.

321
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Check over there.

322
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,119
Dan?

323
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:04,799
Dan?

324
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
You didn't find him?

325
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,880
If he doesn't return by tonight,

326
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,920
the investigation team and I will need to ask for Danai's details.

327
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,160
Thank you very much, Inspector.

328
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,759
This way, please.

329
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,880
You two can go back to the dorm.

330
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,279
The police will be handling things from now on.

331
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,720
Sir,

332
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,240
did something happen to Dan last night?

333
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,799
I don't think so.

334
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:59,359
I only disciplined and reprimanded him.

335
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,359
Sir,

336
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,200
I'd like to...

337
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,519
- I'd like to ask you... - Nai.

338
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:13,440
What's the matter?

339
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:18,599
No, sir. Nothing.

340
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,759
Anyway, excuse me.

341
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,000
As you all know, Dan has gone missing.

342
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,279
And he plays the role of Hamlet.

343
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,559
The play we're meant to perform this year.

344
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,119
So I'd like all of you to vote

345
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,000
if this year's play should

346
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,920
be performed or canceled.

347
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,440
What should we do?

348
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,319
- Let's cast our vote. - I don't know.

349
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:01,559
Raise your hand if you want to see the play being performed.

350
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,240
Hands down, please.

351
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,680
Who thinks this year's play

352
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,880
should be canceled?

353
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,880
The vote is unanimous.

354
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,519
The stage performance of Hamlet

355
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,440
for the year 1999

356
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,880
- will be... - Master Joe.

357
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,279
- Dan? - Dan!

358
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,319
Where were you?

359
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,599
Everyone was looking for you.

360
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,640
We thought you might've shared Trin's fate.

361
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,599
Also...

362
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,920
I want to apologize

363
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,200
for saying that to you.

364
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,720
Sometimes I forget you're going through a tough time too.

365
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,359
I really feel bad about it.

366
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,839
It's okay.

367
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,559
I'm not mad at you.

368
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,359
Let's visit Cha-aim this evening.

369
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,839
Mm.

370
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Dan,

371
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,880
can I ask you a favor?

372
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,880
Leave the shadow alone.

373
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,680
Don't go back to it again.

374
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,400
If you keep seeing it,

375
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,880
things might get so out of hand that you lose control.

376
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,079
If you end up disappearing someday,

377
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,599
what would we do?

378
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Mm.

379
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,920
Sure.

380
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,000
But you know what?

381
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,880
Ever since I was born,

382
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,160
my life's been full of horrible incidents.

383
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,519
The best moment of my life is

384
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,119
to have both of you

385
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,960
listening to my rants.

386
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,559
Are you trying to make us cry?

387
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,000
Right.

388
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,920
But I want to ask you something.

389
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,839
I need you two to help me with one more thing.

390
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,319
But I promise I won't make you

391
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,920
worry about me again once it's over.

392
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,920
How are you feeling, Cha-aim?

393
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,640
I got you some new flowers today.

394
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,880
So you can feel refreshed.

395
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,039
I borrowed a book from the library as well.

396
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,799
I want to read it to you.

397
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,200
"I walked down from the mountain when it was almost dark today."

398
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,279
"My mind was completely silent"

399
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,880
"as my footsteps crunched atop the dried leaves,"

400
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,119
"accompanied by my steady breath."

401
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,319
"The crickets chirped on both sides of the road..."

402
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Josh thinks that by doing this

403
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,519
Cha-aim will be able to hear his voice

404
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,160
and wake up.

405
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,440
"The full moon shone brightly..."

406
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:56,880
He said at least his voice will make her feel less lonely

407
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,960
if she's somewhere out there.

408
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:01,839
"Or being diligent"

409
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,279
"and hard-working..."

410
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,920
"Today, some people asked me"

411
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,279
"how we should"

412
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,240
"meditate."

413
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,519
"So I told them if they remember..."

414
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,799
"The full moon shone bright"

415
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Josh?

416
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,038
"Dull sky with some clouds."

417
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,039
Josh?

418
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,119
"Past the grassy field."

419
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,519
"The sound of the stream..."

420
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,559
Josh?

421
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,839
"My mind was completely silent..."

422
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Josh!

423
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,839
Josh! Can you hear me?

424
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,480
Josh!

425
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,599
Josh...

426
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,519
Josh...

427
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,039
"When it was almost dark..."

428
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,200
Josh!

429
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,440
"My mind was completely silent"

430
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,839
"as my footsteps crunched atop the dried leaves..."

431
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Josh!

432
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,119
"accompanied by..."

433
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,119
Josh...

434
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,319
Josh, can you hear me?

435
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,640
"The crickets chirped on both sides of the road..."

436
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,839
Josh!

437
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Josh...

438
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,279
Josh.

439
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,400
Josh!

440
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,599
Josh!

441
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,440
Josh...

442
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Josh!

443
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,759
Who's there?

444
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,519
Dan.

445
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,360
Are you sure about this?

446
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,239
Is it a monologue or...

447
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,159
- Your scene partner. - I see.

448
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,079
All right. Let's keep going.

449
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:59,119
"It's full of agony."

450
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,000
"Death is the only way to stop this feeling."

451
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,920
"I can hear everything, Hamlet."

452
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,960
"The answer is false."

453
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,880
"Everything you say is"

454
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,400
"merely a construct."

455
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,119
Aren't I beautiful?

456
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,840
Yes, very.

457
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,079
What about the back?

458
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,039
Do it like when you're acting.

459
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Josh,

460
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,920
stay put. Why are you pacing? It looks suspicious.

461
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,079
This is big. Aren't we going to get in trouble?

462
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,159
How much money do you have on you? Give it to me.

463
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,519
Here.

464
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,159
So? Are you going to help me?

465
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,360
Honestly, it's risky. Is it worth it?

466
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,639
That price can only buy you a backdrop change.

467
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,559
Here.

468
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,880
I'll change the scene lighting for that price.

469
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,480
But it's a shame. If you can offer more,

470
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,920
I might be able to change the whole thing.

471
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,559
All right. I'll give you a grand.

472
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,480
But you have to handle everything, understand?

473
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:58,159
Sure thing, pal. I'll tell Chat and the guys to help as well.

474
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,679
Now that's a good price.

475
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:04,920
I'll leave this here.

476
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,239
Gee, you sure made a good use of my money.

477
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,440
My wallet feels light.

478
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,239
Whatever.

479
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,360
Dan, are you ready?

480
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,440
Mm.

481
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,360
Are you ready, everyone?

482
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,360
- Yes, ma'am! - Yes, ma'am!

483
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,960
Excellent.

484
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,400
Remember. This year's performance is

485
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:31,960
a gift for all of you.

486
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,360
It is also a gift for the audience.

487
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,289
You can do it.

488
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,639
Are you ready? Do your best.

489
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,719
How are you, Dan? Are you nervous?

490
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,519
No, sir. I'm ready now.

491
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,039
Great.

492
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,559
You can do it.

493
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,400
Break a leg, everyone. It's almost time.

494
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,039
Are you ready?

495
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,599
We'll gather around.

496
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,769
(Hamlet Tickets)

497
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,079
- Hello, Brother Anurak. - Hello.

498
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,199
The play's about to start.

499
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,119
What time are you going to arrive? So I can tell the students.

500
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,119
I'm sorry, Master But I'm not available today.

501
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,039
I have a meeting with the provincial officers.

502
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,159
But I've told Brother Eric to handle everything for me.

503
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,000
Oh, I see.

504
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:08,480
But aren't you going to watch Danai?

505
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,159
I'd rather not.

506
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:11,960
Thank you.

507
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,920
There's a letter under the door addressed to you.

508
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,809
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

509
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,039
Sir,

510
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,559
I found the truth I've been looking for after all this time.

511
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
It's not about the identity of the one-armed man

512
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,639
or who murdered whom.

513
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,769
But it's made me found precious friendships

514
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,840
and mended what was broken inside me.

515
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:04,718
I'd like to thank you for trying to give me a new life

516
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,559
and always offering me kindness.

517
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,599
But my search for the truth has now come to an end.

518
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,960
I'm going to remember every second of happiness that people gave me.

519
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,329
Goodbye, sir.

520
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,079
Danai.

521
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
P.S.

522
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:27,840
The last time you'll get to see me is on stage.

523
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:30,559
I hope you'll come.

524
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,719
Dan!

525
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,639
Dan?

526
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,440
Dan, can you hear me?

527
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:36,119
You can hear me, can't you?

528
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,480
I'll try to bring him back no matter what.

529
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,809
Someone told me

530
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,960
if I offer an apology to the forest spirit,

531
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,199
it'll help me with everything. Is that right?

532
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,920
If you can perform the whole ritual,

533
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,769
you'll receive a blessing.

534
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,599
But if you can't...
