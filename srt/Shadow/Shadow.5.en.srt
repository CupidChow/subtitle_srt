1
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Dan!

2
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,039
Dan?

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,159
What's wrong? You were swimming normally just now.

4
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,880
I just...

5
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,280
I just saw Trin.

6
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,359
What?

7
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,959
- Hey, where are you going? - Dan?

8
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Dan?

9
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,920
Brother,

10
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,319
can you tell me the truth about Trin?

11
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,769
The truth?

12
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,640
What truth?

13
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,519
I think he's dead.

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,760
He really had a hand in making the shadow stronger.

15
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,760
I think it's related.

16
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,680
We're talking based on reality here,

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,239
not feelings.

18
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,200
Perhaps he wants to tell us something.

19
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,359
He might've been hurt

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,400
by the murderer who's hiding at this school.

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,159
But I'm sure there's no murderer here

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,079
and that Trin is still alive.

23
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,840
Are you saying I'm lying then?

24
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:08,479
Maybe you should let go of your fixation on the teachings.

25
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,759
It might be preventing you from finding out more.

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,159
Dan, it has nothing to do with the teachings.

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,810
But shouldn't what happened to Trin finally come to light?

28
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,719
I'll find it out myself

29
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,599
if you don't give me a straight answer.

30
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,400
Come on over, everyone!

31
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,960
Number One, the St. Lawrence Advancement Party.

32
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,319
I'm Trin Dhevawijitra.

33
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,159
If you'd like to see things at the school change,

34
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,400
please vote for me.

35
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,960
We will put a stop to oppression at this school

36
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,919
because we're going to abolish hazing!

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Whoa.

38
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,000
All lives in this school are equal.

39
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,800
Isn't that right, everyone?

40
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,120
Yes!

41
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,039
- Isn't that right? - Yes!

42
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,159
- Isn't that right? - Yes!

43
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,639
Don't forget to vote for me, Number One.

44
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,960
Trin Dhevawijitra,

45
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,919
the St. Lawrence Advancement Party.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,560
We advance and promote equality.

47
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,240
Number One!

48
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,879
Number One!

49
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,730
Number One!

50
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,639
Number One! Can I hear you?!

51
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,839
- Number One! - Number One!

52
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,199
- Number One! - Number One!

53
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,279
- Number One! - Number One!

54
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,959
Trin.

55
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,050
What?

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,519
Master Surat wants to see you in the Disciplinary Office.

57
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,000
- Number One! - Number One!

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,920
I'll be right back.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,279
Don't forget to vote for Number One!

60
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,759
I disagree with your party's policies.

61
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,920
And this shouldn't have happened in the first place.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,240
(St. Lawrence Advancement Party)

63
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,519
But personally, I believe

64
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,759
the hazing system isn't necessary for the students.

65
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,360
If we're prisoners, then it's a different story.

66
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,240
Watch your mouth!

67
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,839
You know this system's existed at our school for a long time.

68
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,920
It's thanks to this system that our honorable alumni

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,439
have become quality workers in society!

70
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,199
They were shaped by oppression?

71
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,050
Trin, I called you here to be reprimanded!

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
Do not talk back!

73
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,319
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,959
Anyway,

75
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,079
I order you to change all of your policies.

76
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,480
And remove all of the pamphlets and posters, understand?

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,720
Thank you to everyone who voted for me.

78
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,000
Your votes will not go to waste.

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,279
Students like us

80
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,839
have to use cesspool latrines

81
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,199
while the teachers use comfortable toilets.

82
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,079
- Isn't that right, everyone? - Yes!

83
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,879
- Isn't that right? - Yes!

84
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,959
In order to achieve the equality we deserve,

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,360
I'm going to build the "Dhevawijitra Bathroom".

86
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,600
- Do you agree? - Yes!

87
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,279
- Do you agree? - Yes!

88
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,879
- No cesspool latrines! - No cesspool latrines!

89
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,399
- No cesspool latrines! - No cesspool latrines!

90
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Come on!

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,480
- No cesspool latrines! - No cesspool latrines!

92
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,920
What are you all doing?

93
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,800
Don't you have a class to go to?

94
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,079
Get back to your classroom now!

95
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,439
Ten.

96
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,519
Nine.

97
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,160
Eight.

98
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Seven.

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Six.

100
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Five.

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Four.

102
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,519
Three.

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Two.

104
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,160
One.

105
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,279
If you want to call me over to have a word,

106
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,439
there's no need to send my friends away, sir.

107
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,319
I don't think Trin is suitable to be the student body president.

108
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,759
He only causes trouble

109
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,120
and wants to change the long-standing school rules.

110
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,399
He's also arrogant enough to plan to build a bathroom in his name.

111
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,800
But my friends voted for me.

112
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,639
And since I got so many votes,

113
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,560
it means

114
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,480
many of them dislike the existing rules.

115
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Trin!

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,959
Master Surat,

117
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,920
I think you should calm down.

118
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,639
We'll be able to reach a compromise with the students.

119
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,560
Besides, the votes for Trin were unanimous.

120
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,240
Many people accept the result.

121
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,439
- But his policies are... - I'll have a word with him.

122
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,600
I know these things can't be easily changed.

123
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,120
But we also have to respect reality.

124
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,480
Then please handle this, Brother Anurak.

125
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,199
Excuse me.

126
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,360
What are you going to do with me now?

127
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,360
Are you going to expel me?

128
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,959
Or have me suspended?

129
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,399
I'd like to hear your opinions, Trin.

130
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,279
And I'd like you

131
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,920
to hear mine as well.

132
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,439
I'm just following the policies

133
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,839
I promised my voters.

134
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,040
What's wrong with what I'm doing?

135
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
But you're trying to change a long-standing tradition.

136
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,199
If the tradition was good,

137
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,920
then why would people want to change it?

138
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,399
Trin,

139
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,720
do you think building a new bathroom is

140
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,519
really the right way forward?

141
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,279
Have you ever thought about

142
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,120
who's going to maintain it once it's built?

143
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,240
Who's going to clean it?

144
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,559
There will be additional expenses

145
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,559
and maintenance costs.

146
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,559
You're going to build it with the executives' hands tied.

147
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,039
It's no different from the hazing system.

148
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,159
Is that all?

149
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm going to let you go this time.

150
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,330
But if something like this happens again,

151
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,679
I'm going to have to call your father over.

152
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Yes, sir.

153
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,000
- Hello, Officer. - Hello, Brother Anurak.

154
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,639
I'm calling to inform you about our leads on Trin.

155
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
I see.

156
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,639
He was using narcotics while being treated for bipolar disorder.

157
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,480
Hello, everyone.

158
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,919
Welcome to St. Lawrence's Drama Club.

159
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,450
This is the first day of rehearsal.

160
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,210
I'd like to introduce you to the club president, Wanlop.

161
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,090
Feel free to ask him any questions you might have.

162
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,679
We also have Khim.

163
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,450
She'll be handling our finances.

164
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,480
You can discuss reimbursements with her.

165
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,240
But you can't get reimbursed for snacks at the Co-op like Chat.

166
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,330
Don't do that again, Chat.

167
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,679
Okay, sir. Loud and clear.

168
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,159
All right.

169
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,159
We only have two months to rehearse

170
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,210
after years of waiting.

171
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,639
I'd like everyone to do their best.

172
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,120
You can get to work now.

173
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,759
What is it?

174
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,279
A pig's head?

175
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,039
Is it a mask?

176
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,679
It looks difficult to put on.

177
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,639
Hey.

178
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
Master Joe?

179
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,639
Master?

180
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,639
Are you okay?

181
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,799
Uh... I'm fine.

182
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,559
I'm happy you're part of the Drama Club.

183
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Thank you.

184
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,639
The role of Hamlet is in your hands now, Dan.

185
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,720
Master Joe, can you come and take a look at this?

186
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,879
Excuse me.

187
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,799
The Drama Club's made a comeback.

188
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,320
Do you think Master Joe misses Trin?

189
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,720
Hm...

190
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,000
He might've already forgotten about him.

191
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,279
Forgotten? Don't you know how close they were?

192
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,320
Speaking of Trin,

193
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,600
did you see his pig mask?

194
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,559
I guess it's disappeared with him.

195
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,960
Don't say that, jerk. You're giving me goosebumps.

196
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,200
Here's your script.

197
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,960
Rehearse your lines.

198
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,200
The role's mine if you make a mistake.

199
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,159
That's rich coming from you.

200
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,840
You weren't cast, yet you showed up anyway.

201
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,919
Hey, my position has a name, you know?

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What?

203
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,799
It's "Photographer and General Assistant".

204
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,879
What do you think?

205
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,679
More like "General Servant".

206
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,399
I should whack you in the head.

207
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Do you want to rehearse?

208
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Okay.

209
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,559
- We're going now. - Okay.

210
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,320
I don't think you have to rehearse anymore.

211
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,279
I saw you during the audition.

212
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,960
You were so believable.

213
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
I don't think so.

214
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,639
There are still things I don't understand.

215
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,639
Well...

216
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,320
Do you want to see if there's any common ground

217
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,720
between you and Hamlet that you find relatable?

218
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,159
Such as?

219
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,799
Like, your background

220
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,039
or the things you like.

221
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,919
There should be some similarities.

222
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,600
Like what?

223
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,159
A dead father.

224
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,919
Oh.

225
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,879
Well...

226
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
I'm sorry about your dad.

227
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,320
Mm. Thanks.

228
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,360
Even though my dad's still alive,

229
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,679
I can sympathize with how sad it would be.

230
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,480
Your pep talk sounds weird.

231
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,799
I know, right?

232
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,600
I don't know how to help you.

233
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,080
Let's change the subject.

234
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
Oh.

235
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,240
What kind of backdrop do you have to work on?

236
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,480
Oh, I haven't started.

237
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,600
I'm working on the poster for the time being.

238
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,759
I just came up with a sketch.

239
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Here.

240
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,039
(HAMLET)

241
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
There's one in here too.

242
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,200
This.

243
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,799
- Did you draw that? - Yes.

244
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,720
All right, everyone.

245
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
Let's call it a day.

246
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,960
We'll update each other next time.

247
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,519
Thank you very much for today. You can go home now.

248
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,840
Hey, I have to go.

249
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,720
Let's go, Nai.

250
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Nai?

251
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,759
Nai?

252
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,559
Are you okay?

253
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,399
I called you many times.

254
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,559
I saw something following Master Joe.

255
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,159
Let's find out.

256
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,399
Hurry!

257
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,360
Nai!

258
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,720
I'm okay. Let's keep following him.

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,039
Nai,

260
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,599
that's enough.

261
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,319
You don't have to look anymore.

262
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,559
You might get hurt again.

263
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,799
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,240
Why are you apologizing?

265
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,890
I know you want to help.

266
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,079
But I understand your feelings as well.

267
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,920
I'm starting to feel guilty

268
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,650
hearing you say that.

269
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,890
I mean it.

270
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,039
I'll handle Trin myself.

271
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,519
Don't overexert yourself, understand?

272
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,480
Just help me with what you can.

273
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Do you feel any better?

274
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,359
Yes, I do now.

275
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,410
Let's get back to the dorm, or we'll miss curfew again.

276
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Come on.

277
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,240
Hey, fruitcakes!

278
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,480
What are you two doing at the infirmary?

279
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,890
I guess the vibe helps them get in the mood.

280
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,599
How long before you shut up?

281
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,759
- Hey! - Don't touch him.

282
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,200
I'm the one you have a problem with.

283
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,960
Take it out on me if you're angry.

284
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,240
Whoa. That's so sickening.

285
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,000
I think I'm going to puke.

286
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,279
Let's go, Jack, Doe.

287
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,319
Watch your back, both of you.

288
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,519
How long are they going to keep bullying you?

289
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Let's go.

290
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,440
Who did it to you?

291
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,359
Hi.

292
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,319
After having followed you guys' stories for a while,

293
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,839
it's my turn now.

294
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,319
And the story is...

295
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,720
Get away from me, fruitcake!

296
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,799
Nai's a fruitcake!

297
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,410
I don't think a relationship

298
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,119
between me and him is possible.

299
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,119
So all I can do is

300
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,759
express my feelings through words.

301
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,079
(I hope your wish comes true.)

302
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,240
(TK4020 - Just say you like him. He can't read your thoughts.)

303
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,200
That's bad.

304
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,519
But I'm jealous of you

305
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,279
for not having to keep secrets to yourself.

306
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,039
I don't understand.

307
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,599
Why do I have to go through these horrible things?

308
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,480
Even though my feelings are pure.

309
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,599
You were right.

310
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,440
It's good you told him.

311
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,160
Trust me.

312
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,680
At least it's better to let it out.

313
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,920
If you didn't tell him you like him,

314
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:30,559
you wouldn't know how he feels about you.

315
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,640
But now you know

316
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,680
he doesn't reciprocate your feelings.

317
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,359
Another good thing that comes out of it is

318
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,680
you got to know his true colors.

319
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,920
Hang on.

320
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,519
Are you

321
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,720
"TK4020"?

322
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,160
You're a know-it-all.

323
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,839
What are you going to do now?

324
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,240
Are you going to keep spending your life alone?

325
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,400
Oh?

326
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,039
Do you want

327
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,559
to transfer to Drama Club instead?

328
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,000
At least I can be your friend.

329
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,720
I don't think so.

330
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,920
I don't want to put myself at the center of attention again.

331
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,200
I should keep to myself.

332
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,440
Your call.

333
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,319
But you can tell me

334
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,279
if there's a problem.

335
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm happy to help.

336
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,039
Gee.

337
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,680
You look pale.

338
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,319
Why?

339
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:08,680
Are you worried the politician's kid is going to spy on us?

340
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,599
Trin?

341
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,480
He's dead.

342
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,000
How can he nose into our business now?

343
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,759
Are you really that confident?

344
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
But we got lucky that day

345
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,759
when you dealt with him like that.

346
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,839
He probably held such a strong grudge against you.

347
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,000
He deserved it.

348
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,880
I'm not afraid of him,

349
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,440
even if he's a ghost now.

350
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,160
Shh.

351
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,599
Stop worrying about the dead.

352
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,839
Right now,

353
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,839
you should worry about the living instead.

354
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,079
Hurry up and do whatever.

355
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,839
I'll get in trouble again if you get caught.

356
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,640
Okay.

357
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,279
Thank you, Uncle Rerng.

358
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,119
Wait.

359
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,519
- Hey. - Do you have a crush on Cha-aim?

360
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,119
So?

361
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
What is it?

362
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,559
Yes.

363
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,599
But I don't want it to be just a crush.

364
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,640
Then just tell her.

365
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,759
Are you crazy?

366
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,119
I need to be strategic about it.

367
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,440
Besides, I'm worried

368
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,240
my methods of making a move on her might not work.

369
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,119
I don't know.

370
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,319
I think there's a better chance

371
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,440
if you tell her first.

372
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
You've got a point.

373
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,640
It's our day off. Why did you call me here, Nai?

374
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Well, I...

375
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,759
If you keep dragging your heels, I'll send you back to the dorm.

376
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,359
Hurry up and get it done.

377
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,920
Surat will tell us off if we get back late again. Come on.

378
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,720
And why did you go there alone?

379
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,960
There'd be trouble if you got caught.

380
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,200
Right? Why did you risk yourself like that?

381
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,519
But Anan is so daring.

382
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,319
But what's more

383
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,640
is that I heard those two talking about Trin.

384
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,920
Do you mean

385
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,359
Anan has something to do with Trin's disappearance?

386
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,240
That's why I want to look into it

387
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,039
in case I can find any traces from Trin's account.

388
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,519
Here it is! I found something!

389
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,599
"Ever since I came to be,"

390
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,920
"no one's ever fulfill what I've missed"

391
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,960
"until I met J."

392
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,160
"You're the only person who made me want to overcome the thorny wall."

393
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,599
"Even though the thorns might prick me along the way,"

394
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,440
"I promise I'll climb over it to you."

395
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,960
"I want to be normal as a way to thank you"

396
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,480
"for giving me what I never thought of receiving."

397
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,960
"And that is a beautiful feeling."

398
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,839
"I thank you from the heart."

399
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,240
What's he on about? I don't understand.

400
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,960
And what kind of wall is thorny?

401
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,640
Was he a military cadet or something?

402
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,319
Josh,

403
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,839
shut your yap if you don't know anything.

404
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,559
And who's this "J"?

405
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,960
"J"?

406
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,160
Jim? Jiab? Jarb? Joob?

407
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,519
- Joe! - Joe!

408
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,920
It's nothing new though.

409
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,440
Everyone knew Trin liked Master Joe.

410
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,000
He said so as well in the letter.

411
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,720
What letter?

412
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,160
Last year,

413
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,200
someone photocopied Trin's letter and put it up around the school.

414
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,559
After that,

415
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,000
Trin started to change.

416
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,559
How so?

417
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,799
He wrote a love letter to a teacher. People obviously shunned him.

418
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,680
And who photocopied it?

419
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,519
Did they want to hurt Trin?

420
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,359
The case of MP Trairat Dhevawijitra's son

421
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,079
has been reopened

422
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,640
after a lead from the hospital where Trin Dhevawijitra received

423
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,440
treatment for bipolar disorder.

424
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,680
It seems that Trin stopped taking his medication of his own accord,

425
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,480
causing him to hallucinate.

426
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,640
And according to a witness's testimony,

427
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:10,640
it has also been discovered that he'd been using narcotics.

428
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,519
The police now think

429
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,200
it might have been the cause of his death.

430
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:23,160
But in any case, his body's never been found.

431
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:29,240
This case remains a mystery...

432
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,960
How could you let this information get leaked to the media?

433
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,079
I... I don't know, sir.

434
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,480
There must've been a mistake during the document transfer.

435
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,440
But I've already emphasized it to you.

436
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,480
If things get even more out of hand, will you take responsibility?

437
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,000
Brother!

438
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,960
- Where's Brother Anurak? - You can't go in!

439
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,480
- Where's Brother Anurak? - You can't go in there!

440
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,400
I demand to see him now!

441
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,319
I'm going to take this to court

442
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,119
if he refuses to take responsibility!

443
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,319
Mr. and Mrs. Dhevawijitra,

444
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,359
I'd like to invite you inside.

445
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,519
Here you are, Mr. Dhevawijitra.

446
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,920
You leaked the news my son was a drug addict, didn't you?

447
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,720
I can confirm the news didn't come from me.

448
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,160
How could that be?

449
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
That's right.

450
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,519
It's already come to this.

451
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,480
A student's been missing at your school for almost a year,

452
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,400
yet you still don't know anything.

453
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,599
And now you're accusing my son of committing suicide as well?

454
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,359
I never thought of blaming my student.

455
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,680
But for Trin's disappearance,

456
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,640
it's possible

457
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,599
he might've hallucinated and gone missing.

458
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,039
The police found evidence

459
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,079
from when he was getting treated for his injury last year.

460
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,039
Trin had been smoking marijuana before his disappearance.

461
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,920
But it's still all just speculation from the police.

462
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,960
I refuse to believe it

463
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,440
until we can find his body.

464
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,039
Trin!

465
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,960
Trin, my son!

466
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:40,759
Trin!

467
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,759
Do you think it's true about Trin?

468
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,319
Probably. It's all over the news.

469
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,640
- Josh... - Oh, you three.

470
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,160
How come you're still not in the cafeteria?

471
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,359
The Master on duty might tell you off.

472
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,599
Then can you cover for us, sir?

473
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,599
Tell him we were working for you.

474
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,319
Really.

475
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,400
Come on. Follow me.

476
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,920
You're awesome, sir.

477
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,119
I'll help you clean up the Drama Club for free.

478
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:14,400
- You're on your own. - Oh?

479
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,759
Aren't you going anywhere this weekend?

480
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,920
- Oh, we went to the library... - Well,

481
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,880
we have a lot of homework.

482
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,480
Then there's the play rehearsal too.

483
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,039
That's true.

484
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,279
Did you hear the news about Trin, sir?

485
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Of course.

486
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,359
Do you really believe

487
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,759
he died from the side effects of narcotics?

488
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,440
Isn't that what we should believe the most at this moment?

489
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,319
There's proof of what happened to Trin.

490
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,440
I think it's best if we believe it.

491
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:06,799
Do you think it's Master Joe who leaked the letter?

492
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
I don't think so.

493
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:40,480
How was my performance?

494
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,679
You seem to be worried about the lines and blocking.

495
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:45,769
But if you stay in the moment,

496
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,769
it'll appear more natural.

497
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,199
I'll try harder.

498
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,079
You don't have to try.

499
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:55,920
Just be the character

500
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,559
and stay in the moment.

501
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,840
You can do it.

502
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,159
Master Joe,

503
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,329
thank you so much.

504
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,199
I haven't done something this fun for a while now.

505
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,329
Every time I'm in a play,

506
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,079
I forget the outside world.

507
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,809
I forget

508
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,880
I have to take this stupid medication.

509
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,769
When I play the role of someone else,

510
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,960
it also helps me forget the fact that I'm sick.

511
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,960
Indeed.

512
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,289
Sometimes, when we play the role of a character,

513
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,440
it helps you get to know yourself better.

514
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,599
That's true.

515
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,289
Master Joe,

516
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,809
when my bipolar symptoms

517
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,039
get out of control,

518
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,719
I have to stay alone

519
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,199
so I won't cause trouble to other people.

520
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,239
Every time I take the medication to subdue the symptoms,

521
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:12,809
it always serves as a reminder

522
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:15,159
I'm abnormal,

523
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,809
weak,

524
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,519
and different from the rest.

525
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:22,719
You're not weak, Trin.

526
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,519
You're actually accepting it and fighting against it.

527
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,199
I don't want to be sick anymore.

528
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,769
I think

529
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:39,599
my life would be better if I didn't have to take medication.

530
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:44,679
I'm not a doctor, so I can't tell you to stop your medication.

531
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,920
But if acting makes you feel happy,

532
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,719
then I'd like you to keep doing it.

533
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,239
Drama Club

534
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,079
and you

535
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,400
really make me happier.

536
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:11,880
Sir,

537
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,920
thank you so much.

538
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,480
Please keep this pen for me for the time being.

539
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,679
Once I'm cured from this stupid disorder,

540
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,960
I'll come back for it

541
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,119
with an answer for you.

542
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:32,679
I'm sorry, Trin.

543
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,119
But I really can't accept it.

544
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,880
Neither now

545
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,360
nor in the future.

546
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,769
But I appreciate it.

547
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,559
And I hope you'll feel better.

548
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,769
Trin Dhevawijitra's treatment log, September 15, 1998.

549
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:35,039
During our last conversation, you mentioned seeing

550
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,360
strange and horrifying images in your head.

551
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,920
How is it now?

552
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Trin?

553
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,119
Yes?

554
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,039
Pardon?

555
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,840
Do you still see those images you mentioned last time?

556
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,360
I do, sir.

557
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,039
But I'm not sure what is in my head

558
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,639
and what is real anymore.

559
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,400
Close your eyes

560
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,360
and tell me what you see now.

561
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:10,329
No. No!

562
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,480
Focus.

563
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,199
What do you see?

564
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,289
I see a pile of dead bodies.

565
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,079
And I feel...

566
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,079
I want to ask you a question.

567
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,639
Man to man.

568
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,000
Do you like Cha-aim?

569
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,769
Is that what you want to ask me about?

570
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,039
I think you should think about it carefully.

571
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,960
Dan's a weird guy.

572
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,920
How could you say that?

573
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,400
He's your friend.

574
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,039
Can you be considerate to the baby I'm carrying?

575
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Have you thought about what to do with this?

576
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,440
Who do you think you are? Come out if you dare!

577
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,000
Trin?
