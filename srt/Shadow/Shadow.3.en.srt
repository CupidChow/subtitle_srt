1
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,039
Dan?

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,559
Oh? What's up?

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,399
Didn't you hear me calling you for ages?

4
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,239
I was just thinking about random things.

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,239
What are you reading?

6
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,399
Whoa.

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,210
You're reading this because you really want to join the drama club?

8
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,439
The library has a copy, so I borrowed it.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,640
Give it a read.

10
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,039
So?

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,480
I can't read it.

12
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,120
You're reading the English edition.

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
You're exaggerating.

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,689
You're going to the audition?

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,519
A club for fruitcakes like that

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,319
suits you perfectly.

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,120
Be careful though.

18
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,879
In case Master Joe...

19
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,480
You jerk. Did you just feel me up?

20
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,200
Stupid Josh.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,799
Guys,

22
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,519
the girls from St. Mary are here!

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,959
Let's go and have a look!

24
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,439
Come on!

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,319
What are the girls from St. Mary doing here?

26
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,599
Smile!

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,359
That's pretty! Wow!

28
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,759
Josh,

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,639
your camera might get confiscated again if you carry it around.

30
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,879
Then keep a lookout.

31
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,280
Tell me if Surat turns up, and I'll put it away.

32
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,919
Hold on a second.

33
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,439
Do you know the way to the drama club?

34
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,199
Yes, we do. We can read the signs.

35
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,090
Oh?

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,439
Huh? You look familiar.

37
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,919
Are you Prim?

38
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,960
I'm Anan. We'll be seeing each other often.

39
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,400
Why don't we get acquainted with each other?

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,120
If you're done introducing yourself,

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,199
then move out of the way, please.

42
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,000
- Aw! - My name's Jack!

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,560
I'm Doe.

44
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,520
How come it's so easy for them to make a move?

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,039
People say I look like a creep when I try.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
So what are you going to do?

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Watch me.

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,240
That seems heavy. Do you want to hold onto my heart instead?

49
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,479
That's enough, Josh. You're scaring her.

50
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,479
The new guy is thirsty.

51
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,560
I can carry that myself.

52
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,159
You read novels?

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,520
Oh, this?

54
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,840
Mm. It's quite fun.

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,400
This year's play is also "Hamlet".

56
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,120
Are you in the drama club?

57
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,960
Cha-aim, hurry!

58
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,280
Okay.

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,000
- I'm Cha-aim. You are... - I'm Dan.

60
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,199
Okay. I'll see you at the club, Dan.

61
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,879
Don't forget anything.

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Thanks.

63
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,759
But if you really feel like you can't cope on any day,

64
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,839
take the medication the doctor prescribed you

65
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,519
so you'll be able to sleep more soundly.

66
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,399
Whoa, Josh.

67
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,759
Don't you feel warm dressing up like that?

68
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm a hot dude. The weather never bothers me anyway.

69
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,079
It's Saturday. Where are you going?

70
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,279
There aren't girls coming to the school today.

71
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,879
Who says I'm staying at school?

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I've got to go.

73
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,279
Wait. You're going out?

74
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
Mm.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,720
Good. Can I carpool with you to see the venerable monk?

76
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,279
It's on the way into the city, isn't it?

77
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,079
My dad asked me to bring the monk some medicine.

78
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,040
Please?

79
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,319
No.

80
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,480
It's difficult to drive to the temple's entrance.

81
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,639
I'm not going.

82
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,240
Of course. You're always like this.

83
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,839
You can't even help me.

84
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,199
I kept an eye out for Surat yesterday,

85
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,120
and I let you copy my homework.

86
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,920
Some days, I cover your cleaning duties too.

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
It's a waste doing good things for some people.

88
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,399
Josh,

89
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,519
Nai is calling you an ingrate.

90
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,959
I know, I know. All right. We're going.

91
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,439
Just enough, you two.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,959
Why couldn't I be born with more friends?

93
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,480
Simple.

94
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,839
Dan,

95
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,439
do you want to come along?

96
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,160
Let's broaden your horizons.

97
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,279
Sure. I don't have anything else to do.

98
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,399
I'll give you five minutes.

99
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,199
I won't wait for anyone who's not ready.

100
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,040
And how are we getting there?

101
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,240
Josh, your family runs a big publishing house.

102
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,079
How come your dad hasn't bought a new car?

103
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,160
The AC's broken. It's super warm in there.

104
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,680
I let you carpool with me, and now you're complaining?

105
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,319
I'll have Somchai pick you up late afternoon.

106
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,279
Don't stay any longer than 5:00 p.m.

107
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,920
Surat will be furious if we get back late.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
All right.

109
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,839
- Thank you. - You have to thank me.

110
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Let's go.

111
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,240
You didn't sleep well last night?

112
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,559
No.

113
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,759
I took two pills but still had the same dream.

114
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,399
Are you crazy?

115
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,960
You could die taking pills at random like that.

116
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you want to talk to the venerable monk?

117
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,240
He's treated people with herbs before.

118
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,159
Since Brother's method doesn't seem to work,

119
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,360
there's no loss in trying something new, is there?

120
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,679
Sure. We can give it a try.

121
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,960
But it's not snake oil or black magic, is it? I'm scared.

122
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,120
Are you crazy?

123
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,919
The venerable monk only practices the white magic.

124
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,519
I'll tell him

125
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,120
in case he has any tips

126
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,519
so you can finally stop tossing and turning.

127
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
And what are those?

128
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,759
Headless dolls.

129
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,480
The villagers made them for the sick or children who might be in danger.

130
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,450
It's to prevent wild ghosts from taking them away.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,090
Wild ghosts?

132
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,759
Mm. Wild ghosts.

133
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,759
Greetings, venerable monk.

134
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,960
My dad asked me to bring you this medicine.

135
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,330
Oh.

136
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,360
Really, your father.

137
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,759
I told him not to bring me these.

138
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,559
How much did he pay for the postage?

139
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,399
I don't know. He didn't say.

140
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,450
Anyway, thank him for me.

141
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,330
Have you visited home at all?

142
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,639
I haven't for six months now.

143
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,720
I should be able to go

144
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,450
during summer break before senior year.

145
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,039
Visit home sometimes when you're free.

146
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,480
Parents might not say anything,

147
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,360
but they all miss their children.

148
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,360
And who did you bring along? Your friend from school?

149
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,279
Venerable monk, this is Dan.

150
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,240
Greetings, venerable monk.

151
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,330
Mm.

152
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,759
What about your friend with a sharp tongue? James? Joe?

153
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,000
Josh?

154
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,320
He had to go into the city, so he didn't come with us.

155
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,480
Is that so?

156
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,159
Oh, venerable monk.

157
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,279
Are a lot of people sick these days?

158
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,559
I noticed a lot of headless dolls.

159
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,639
That's right.

160
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,000
There was a malaria outbreak last year.

161
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,559
So the mountain people made them and brought them over.

162
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,039
Are they only meant to represent the afflicted?

163
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,919
Right. You just came along.

164
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,919
You know about the headless dolls as well?

165
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,320
Nai told me about it.

166
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,440
This area is the domain of wild ghosts.

167
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,960
The villagers used to sacrifice dead bodies to them

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,559
by floating them along the river.

169
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,039
Once the bodies washed ashore near where the wild ghosts were,

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
the ghost would be strengthened

171
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,399
and would protect the area in return.

172
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,600
And where did these dead bodies wash ashore?

173
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,720
On the shores of the lake at your school.

174
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,200
After World War II,

175
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,320
the school was built on those grounds.

176
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,200
And there was a law forbidding people from floating dead bodies.

177
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,080
And these traditions begin

178
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,000
to fade from existence.

179
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,039
Once people stopped floating dead bodies,

180
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,000
the wild ghosts believed the villagers had lost faith.

181
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,360
They probably became enraged,

182
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,600
the villagers started to disappear one by one.

183
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,679
So they thought

184
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,440
the wild ghosts took them away.

185
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,039
But I've heard

186
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,639
wild ghosts whisk away people who perform rituals with them,

187
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,559
who ask them for favors

188
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,480
and for help.

189
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,759
They'd take those they're particularly fond of.

190
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,360
These are the beliefs of the villagers.

191
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,000
Some might be true, and some might be false.

192
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,600
Venerable monk,

193
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,039
Dan hasn't been able to sleep that well.

194
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Do you know any way to help him?

195
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,039
It's been following you around since you were young, hasn't it?

196
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,679
Yes, sir.

197
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,759
You've been having nightmares since you were young, haven't you?

198
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,399
How do you know, sir?

199
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,360
Our world is

200
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,120
full of ghosts and spirits mingling together.

201
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,279
I can see

202
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,879
what Nai can see as well.

203
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,159
You probably understand that the realms

204
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,840
are arranged in one, two, and three.

205
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,200
The past, the present, and the future.

206
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,840
But in reality, each realm

207
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,879
flows synchronously, as in parallel universes.

208
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,639
Are you saying

209
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,960
the thing that's been following me

210
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,039
came from another realm?

211
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,399
I don't know how to get rid of it.

212
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,440
But I know a better way for you and it to coexist.

213
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,679
Give me your hands.

214
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,519
What you should do

215
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,960
is lucid dream training.

216
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,480
You have to learn to control your dreams.

217
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,240
Once you've gained control,

218
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,039
you'll also be able to control what's been following you.

219
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,279
Here.

220
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,080
This herbal medicine will

221
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,840
help you sleep better.

222
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,039
Keep this ring on your person at all times.

223
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,559
If you started feeling confused

224
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,879
between dreams and reality,

225
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,639
press the sharp corner of the ring

226
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,080
into your palm.

227
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,960
If you don't feel anything,

228
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,759
it means

229
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,519
you're still in a dream.

230
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,240
And that shadow won't

231
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,879
be able to do anything to you.

232
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,679
Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Samma Sambuddhassa.

233
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,879
Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Samma Sambuddhassa.

234
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,200
Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Samma Sambuddhassa.

235
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,119
Go on!

236
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,359
Shoot me now!

237
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,559
Shoot me in front of our son! Do it!

238
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,680
If you hurt him, I'm going to shoot you!

239
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,240
Have you gone insane, Vi?

240
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,359
- Give me the gun! - Let go!

241
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,890
Let go!

242
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,650
- Let go! - Give it to me!

243
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Dan.

244
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,410
How do you feel?

245
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,759
I saw my dad,

246
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,039
my mom,

247
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,920
and the shadow.

248
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,480
But it's different this time.

249
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,440
It's strangely clear.

250
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,170
Once you're in control, what you see

251
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,759
won't be a figment of your imagination.

252
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,200
Use the lucid dream ring well.

253
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,799
So you'll be able to live with it.

254
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,119
Even though the ring might be able to help you,

255
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,359
use it only when necessary.

256
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,650
Don't use it for everything.

257
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,519
Once you can distinguish a dream from reality,

258
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,720
come back to the latter as soon as possible.

259
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,000
You can't linger in another realm for too long.

260
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,799
Otherwise,

261
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,839
you will see what you're not supposed to see.

262
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,119
Do you understand?

263
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,079
What I'm not supposed to see?

264
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,359
What do you mean by that, sir?

265
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,000
In any case, do as you've been told.

266
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,519
Yes, sir.

267
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
You must've gone through a lot

268
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
when you were younger.

269
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,200
Each person's karma is different.

270
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,079
Escaping one's karma is also different.

271
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,759
The only way to escape your karma

272
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,440
is forgiveness.

273
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,119
Some things don't have to be understood in their entirety.

274
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,039
You'll be able to forgive

275
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,170
once it's time.

276
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,720
If your car didn't break down, we would've arrived ages ago.

277
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,440
It's because you were waiting for Dan.

278
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,960
We'll be in trouble if Surat catches us.

279
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:54,519
Surat? Am I your playmate?

280
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,559
That's rich coming from you. Don't you usually call him that too?

281
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,039
- Josh. - Huh?

282
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,440
- That wasn't me. - Then who was it?

283
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,960
Go on now.

284
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,519
Thank you.

285
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,640
What happened, Master?

286
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,440
The boys are straying out of line as usual.

287
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,359
They came back after curfew.

288
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,039
Have you gone crazy?

289
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,279
Huh?

290
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:56,000
- Give me the gun! - No!

291
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,079
Hey!

292
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,599
- Let go! - Give me the gun!

293
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,440
Who actually are you?

294
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Dan?

295
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,960
You guys haven't even showered yet?

296
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,680
Well, look at the state of him.

297
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,720
Dan?

298
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,279
Dan?

299
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Dan?

300
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,400
What are you doing?

301
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,119
Shoot. Venerable monk's gadget is good.

302
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,039
You slept like a log. I thought you were dead.

303
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,759
Are you sick?

304
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Do you have a headache?

305
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,039
Is it morning already?

306
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,240
For sure. The sun's up. What kind of a question is that?

307
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,759
It's almost time for the workshop.

308
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,680
You should hurry up and take a shower.

309
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,160
That's true!

310
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,480
Oh? Dan?

311
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Come on in.

312
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,519
So many people are here for the workshop.

313
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,920
They're definitely here for the girls.

314
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,480
You said it's a club for fruitcakes,

315
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,039
and now you're doing a workshop to prepare for the audition?

316
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,119
Josh?

317
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,799
- Are you... - Hold that thought.

318
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,279
Having a plan is how I roll.

319
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,039
What's your plan?

320
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,160
I have to have a girlfriend

321
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,599
once the production's over.

322
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,720
A straight guy's objective.

323
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,359
My mission begins now.

324
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,839
Is this a photo of you?

325
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,279
I took it the day you first came here.

326
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,480
Here you go.

327
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,960
Did I take a photo of you?

328
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,279
All right, students.

329
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,759
Sister Rose from St. Mary and I are very happy

330
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,839
to see all of you here at the workshop today.

331
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,920
You might be able to use what you learn

332
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,160
in tomorrow's audition.

333
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,519
This will be simple.

334
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,000
Relax and enjoy the moment. There's no need to be nervous.

335
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,440
Let yourselves go.

336
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,799
- Yes, Master - Yes, Master.

337
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,440
All right, everyone. Without further ado,

338
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,160
let's start with our first activity.

339
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,319
I want two students who aren't close to pair up.

340
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,279
Share your story with each other.

341
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,039
Then let your partner tell it to everyone else.

342
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,839
Ready? Let's get started.

343
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,200
All right. Pair up.

344
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,279
Dan?

345
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,599
Do you have a partner yet?

346
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,519
Lots of people came out this year.

347
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,960
Indeed.

348
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,160
What should I do if I don't have a partner?

349
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,839
It's okay.

350
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,519
You can partner up with me.

351
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,960
Or maybe with Master Joe?

352
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,559
Come and sit at the front.

353
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,599
Yes, ma'am.

354
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm easy.

355
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,759
Dan, you don't have to be nervous.

356
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,319
What do you want to talk about?

357
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,960
Um...

358
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
I don't know.

359
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,839
I don't really have much to tell.

360
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,200
Well then.

361
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,799
How long have you been in the drama club?

362
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,920
I'm not really in the drama club.

363
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,119
I just transferred here. It's my first year.

364
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,559
How come?

365
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,880
I have sleep problems.

366
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,759
Brother Anurak's been treating me.

367
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,960
I can stay close to him if I'm here.

368
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,720
Oh.

369
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,920
Don't you miss your parents staying at a boarding school?

370
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,519
My mom passed away.

371
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,160
And my dad is in the hospital with stage four brain cancer.

372
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,640
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

373
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,319
It's okay.

374
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,880
It's not really that much of a sad story.

375
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,119
What about you?

376
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,759
Have you been in the drama club long?

377
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,960
What's your position?

378
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,720
I'm pretty. It's obvious I'm an actor.

379
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,599
I'm joking.

380
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,599
I can tell you don't believe me.

381
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,119
I'm on the creative team.

382
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,119
We make props.

383
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,920
So you know how to draw?

384
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,160
Well, a little.

385
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Really?

386
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,519
What kind of things do you like to draw?

387
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,200
Hm...

388
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,480
Mostly generic things.

389
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,839
But I like surrealism the most. Do you know it?

390
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,519
Of course. I'm actually very fond of it.

391
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm a fan of Salvador Dali's work. Do you know him?

392
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,319
For sure. He's the man. How would I not know?

393
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,960
My mom took me to New York to see "The Persistence of Memory" once.

394
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,440
- Really? - Mm.

395
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,279
I wish I could go as well.

396
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,720
The real thing is very beautiful.

397
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Cha-aim,

398
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,440
why are you sitting here alone?

399
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, I just came out to draw.

400
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,599
People are chatting over there. It was noisy.

401
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,480
So I came to sit here instead.

402
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,680
It's quite cool under the shade here.

403
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,640
Cha-aim, this is Nai.

404
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,279
- He's my classmate. - Hi.

405
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,119
And this is Josh, my roommate.

406
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,759
Oh, Josh. You asked to take photos of my friends yesterday?

407
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,440
People are talking about me?

408
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,599
Of course. A lot of people, actually.

409
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,400
But most of them are saying you're a creep.

410
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,799
But I've seen your photos.

411
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,400
I think they're nice.

412
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,359
But you should just ask nicely for permission.

413
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,319
You seemed rather assertive yesterday.

414
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,319
The photos are nice?

415
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,119
Mm. Of course.

416
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,160
You seem to know how to capture everyone's good side.

417
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,920
Then can I take photos of you?

418
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,759
I've got my camera with me.

419
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,759
I told you not to be too assertive.

420
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,000
Cha-aim, the bus is here!

421
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,559
Okay.

422
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Anyway, I have to go.

423
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,640
Bye. Bye, Dan.

424
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,160
Come on. I'm starting to get hungry.

425
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,319
Come on, Josh.

426
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
Josh?

427
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,759
Josh? Let's go!

428
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,759
- Hello, Brother. - Hello.

429
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,880
Did the workshop just finish?

430
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,480
Yes, sir.

431
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,279
Good. Only studying will cause you to stress.

432
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,200
It's good to do some activities.

433
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:23,839
What's that you're wearing?

434
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:32,839
It's just a normal ring. I think it's nice.

435
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,880
But this is a school. Accessories aren't permitted.

436
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,240
I hope I don't see you wearing it tomorrow.

437
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,519
Yes, sir.

438
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,279
Go on.

439
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,960
Bye, sir.

440
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
(6. You shall not murder. 7. You shall not commit adultery.)

441
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,119
(8. You shall not steal.)

442
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,240
(9. You shall not bear false witness against thy neighbour.)

443
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,319
(10. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife,)

444
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,359
(or anything that belongs to your neighbor.)

445
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,759
The Old Testament

446
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,880
focuses on the significance of God.

447
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,359
As for the New Testament,

448
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,599
it contains the teachings we call the Bible.

449
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,680
If you can follow all the commandments,

450
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,440
you will be able to live a peaceful life.

451
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,920
Many of you like to trick your friends with ghost stories.

452
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,559
If you believe in Him,

453
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,119
you'll discover those things are all lies.

454
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,119
Sir.

455
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Yes, Dan?

456
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,400
But Isn't trying new things

457
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:43,160
also a way to help find peace in our lives?

458
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,480
What are you trying to say?

459
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,519
I mean,

460
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
if old beliefs don't work,

461
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,880
there's no loss in trying new things.

462
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:02,559
Are you saying not to believe in God?

463
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,720
That's not what I mean, sir.

464
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,400
I just think closing ourselves off from the world

465
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,840
is more horrifying.

466
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,199
Mm. All right.

467
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,000
Let's discuss this topic in the next class.

468
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,400
- Yes, Brother. - Yes, Brother.

469
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,159
Who dug this up?

470
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,039
Is that the guy that disappeared last year?

471
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,599
He's actually quite cute.

472
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,480
Fun time's over.

473
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:53,920
You can go inside. The audition's about to start.

474
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,719
Which role do you think suits him?

475
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,159
Oh!

476
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,880
Have you ever loved me?

477
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,840
I used to love you. Once.

478
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,599
Whoa.

479
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:36,159
Exactly. That was what you made me believe.

480
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,159
You should not have believed me.

481
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,199
Stop fidgeting.

482
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,440
If you fidget, you'll get even more nervous.

483
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:49,920
I can't remember the lines.

484
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,329
Can I just bail?

485
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,719
You can't do that. We've already come this far.

486
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,599
Let's do it this way.

487
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,599
Look at me if you get stuck.

488
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,159
Mm.

489
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,639
Mr. Nattapon Saisak.

490
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Dan,

491
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,880
what are you auditioning for today?

492
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,639
Hamlet.

493
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,159
What about you, Josh?

494
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,400
- Josh? - Huh?

495
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,119
What are you auditioning for?

496
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,239
Oh, I'm going for Horatio.

497
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,159
To be or not to be,

498
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,769
that is the question.

499
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,360
There is not a way

500
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,329
for me to maintain my honor.

501
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,719
It is as painful

502
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,199
as the vengeful arrow of destiny.

503
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,039
A weapon against the sea...

504
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,519
of destiny.

505
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,769
There is only one way to end all this. And that is...

506
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,960
Novels...

507
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,159
and wild buffaloes. What?

508
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,719
Uh...

509
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,159
I think that's enough.

510
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:43,039
You have other skills, don't you?

511
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Yes, sir.

512
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:47,679
All right. Next person, please.

513
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,000
Mr. Danai.

514
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:07,400
You can start once you're ready.

515
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,519
Horatio,

516
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,840
I think it’s just before midnight.

517
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,840
Why have I not encountered a single ghost?

518
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,159
But that is what I heard, my lord.

519
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,440
Wait for a short while.

520
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,360
Must I wait for a wandering ghost like a fool?

521
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,159
My heart is

522
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,329
set aflame.

523
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,880
And what if the ghost does not exist?

524
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,239
Nai,

525
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,239
are you okay?

526
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,519
I'm fine.

527
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,000
Rumors do not come by like a gust of wind.

528
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,289
There is proof of each person's meeting.

529
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,559
Dad?

530
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:19,360
Hamlet, my dear son.

531
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,119
Why did you come back?

532
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,960
Hm?

533
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,239
Isn't Hamlet supposed to reply with...

534
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,639
What do you want from me now?

535
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,960
The cast list is posted.

536
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,000
Make way.

537
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:59,239
You weren't seeing things. I saw it too.

538
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,119
By the way, who was it?

539
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,239
Dan, you're Hamlet!

540
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,639
- Congratulations. - Dan,

541
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,329
can I have a word with you?

542
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Dan,

543
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,119
you have to be strong now.

544
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,880
Your father...

545
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,559
He's in a coma.

546
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,599
Dad?

547
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,960
Some people might see a house as a safe haven.

548
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,400
Where are you running off to?

549
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,039
I asked you a question!

550
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,679
Dad, don't hurt Mom!

551
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,360
I guess you don't care about your husband or son anymore.

552
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,039
You wrote a letter mentioning God,

553
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,519
but in fact, you behaved inappropriately

554
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:23,920
and slept around with a priest!

555
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,289
Dan! Why aren't you eating?

556
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,599
I'm very happy

557
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,199
to see you so close to death, Dad.

558
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,440
But it'd be better

559
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:37,599
if you're conscious and die a painful death.
