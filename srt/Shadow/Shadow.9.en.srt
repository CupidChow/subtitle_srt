1
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,769
You're awake.

2
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,679
How long had I been asleep?

3
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,280
What happened?

4
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,679
What do you remember?

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,200
Agh!

6
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,679
Ah!

7
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,359
Ah!

8
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,439
Ugh!

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,000
- Ah! - Why did you do that?

10
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,200
I didn't.

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
Then who hurt you?

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,680
It was Trin.

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,879
He hurt me.

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,799
Trin again?

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,599
Is that your only excuse?

16
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay.

17
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,439
I won't mention him then.

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,000
But do you know the one-armed man?

19
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,879
What do you mean by that?

20
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,640
I saw him

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,560
the other day.

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,239
I saw him being imprisoned.

23
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,879
I saw a vision of a massacre.

24
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,439
Sir,

25
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,120
what actually happened at our school?

26
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,000
What connection are you trying to make?

27
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,560
- Why are you... - What are you hiding from me?

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,479
There's no such man at our school.

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,479
We've been carrying on in peace for decades.

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,680
None of the things you've mentioned has ever happened!

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,120
I know...

32
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,530
I know what you know.

33
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,120
- I know what you're hiding... - Silence!

34
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,439
Stop blathering nonsense at once.

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,199
How long do you plan to keep it secret?

36
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,599
Just say it, sir.

37
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,439
Tell me what happened.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,879
Just say...

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Enough!

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,319
Stop right now, Dan!

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,400
Nurse!

42
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,960
- Just tell me... - Nurse, I need help!

43
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,159
- Hurry! - Tell me what happened...

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,759
- Calm down! - How is it difficult...

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,159
- I need help! - Please calm down.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,520
Sir, please tell me.

47
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,800
Tell me.

48
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,000
Let go of me.

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,879
Sir!

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,280
Let go of me!

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,639
- Sir! - What are you doing here?

52
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,199
Brother Anurak...

53
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,400
- I brought something for Dan. - Please calm down.

54
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,599
Give it to the nurse outside.

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,159
Dan isn't accepting visitors.

56
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,000
- Come. - Brother Anurak!

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,759
Please calm down. It's nothing.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,199
You have to calm down.

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,400
It's okay. You can calm down.

60
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,840
Brother Anurak...

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,039
Are you asking for a blessing for Dan?

62
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,639
Yes.

63
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,759
How is he doing?

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,240
Don't worry.

65
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,759
He should recover before the play.

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
I'm not worried about the play.

67
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,879
I'm worried about Dan.

68
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,519
Likewise.

69
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,000
You feel it too, don't you?

70
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,399
It's like this thing has happened before.

71
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,439
There's no need to worry.

72
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,680
I won't let it happen again.

73
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,399
I see.

74
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,480
Why are you taking me here?

75
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
The venerable monk's away.

76
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,800
And Dan's my friend. I want to help him.

77
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,040
And the person I'm taking you to

78
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,759
can help us.

79
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,040
Hey, Josh?

80
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,439
Come on over.

81
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,279
This corner is my regular spot.

82
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Just a second.

83
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,319
Okay.

84
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,959
Excuse me? What's my remaining quota?

85
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
What?

86
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,519
My weed quota.

87
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
- Oh. Your quota? - Yes.

88
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,600
For what you've paid in advance...

89
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,519
Here. Two of these.

90
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Thank you.

91
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,879
Hey!

92
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,360
What on earth are you two playing at?

93
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,399
Nothing.

94
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,679
Is he...

95
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,450
Is he a friend of yours?

96
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,330
What's his name?

97
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,639
Nai.

98
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
All right.

99
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Here.

100
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,840
Hey, are you new to this?

101
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Yes.

102
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,799
The name's Bancha.

103
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,039
You'll get used to it if you visit enough. Don't worry.

104
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,450
I guess.

105
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,039
There was this one time my friend bought a cassette tape.

106
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,210
Do you know what the song's called? It's "Tim".

107
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,639
It's so relatable. My ex-girlfriend's name is Tim too.

108
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,600
I was so down. Then I turned around to look at Pode.

109
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,240
It was strange. He was sulking in the corner.

110
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,450
So I asked him, "What's wrong with you, Pode?"

111
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,879
Do you know what he said?

112
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,759
"I forgot. My mom's name is Tim."

113
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,679
It cracked me up.

114
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,919
It's so funny thinking about it.

115
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,450
What?

116
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,039
Can we ask him now?

117
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All right.

118
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,879
Bancha,

119
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,960
do you remember the forest shaman you told me about?

120
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,679
Do you?

121
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,960
What's with her again?

122
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,120
Why are you mentioning her now?

123
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Uh...

124
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,279
Nai likes horror stories.

125
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,559
It's fun to talk about.

126
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,559
What do you...

127
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,360
What do you want from me?

128
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
Bancha,

129
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,240
Ake asked me to tell you

130
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,279
it's okay

131
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,960
about that thing.

132
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,879
What thing?

133
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,399
He said he knew

134
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,399
you went out with Mam back then.

135
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,720
You're still feeling guilty about it, aren't you?

136
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,200
Because you stole her from him.

137
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,679
But he doesn't mind

138
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,720
because he and Mam weren't in love anymore back then.

139
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,440
And you bailed on him and didn't sign up for cadets.

140
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,919
Ake ended up dying there alone.

141
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,000
He doesn't want you to be upset.

142
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,320
In any case,

143
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,039
you're the friend he loves the most.

144
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,039
Can you see ghosts?

145
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,759
I was just making things up.

146
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,639
Hey.

147
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,039
You're awesome.

148
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,519
You want to know about the forest shaman, don't you?

149
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,039
Yes, we do.

150
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,200
My friend's in a bad way right now.

151
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,480
It might be the only way to help him.

152
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,120
I understand.

153
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Your story reminds me of a friend.

154
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,639
His name is Trin.

155
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,720
Are you in a rush to see Master Joe?

156
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,639
Hold him down!

157
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,360
One day, I was riding my motorbike home.

158
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,759
Then I spotted Trin walking along the road.

159
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,080
But he was all beaten up.

160
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,440
Hey, kid.

161
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,039
Where are you headed to?

162
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,960
Come on. I'll give you a lift.

163
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,440
We're going in the same direction anyway.

164
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,240
Climb aboard. I'll take you there.

165
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,519
Hey, hold on!

166
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,039
What are you doing? Come here.

167
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,960
So I took him home.

168
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,679
I thought he was going to stay with me for just a few days.

169
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,519
But somehow, he ended up staying long-term.

170
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,240
Here. Eat up.

171
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,840
Come on.

172
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,919
So what happened to you?

173
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,039
Oh?

174
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,639
What's with the silence?

175
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,279
Aren't you happy to meet an alumnus? Come on.

176
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,559
Hey. This is so nice.

177
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,679
I'll be right back.

178
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Hey.

179
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,559
Oh.

180
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,759
You look totally blazed.

181
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,240
Do you want some?

182
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,600
Take it easy, okay?

183
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,440
Or it'll knock you out.

184
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Interested?

185
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Here.

186
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,320
It's strong. But it'll stimulate

187
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,639
your imagination.

188
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,639
Music will sound so good to your ears.

189
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,799
Do you believe what I said?

190
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,240
Why wouldn't I? Anything's possible.

191
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,759
I don't have anyone else I can trust.

192
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,440
Thank you so much.

193
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,840
Well, you can drop by whenever you please.

194
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,120
I don't have that many friends either.

195
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,879
It's lonely.

196
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,320
Be careful. It's strong. Take it slow.

197
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,039
This is great. It's my first time too.

198
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,639
Do you have anything stronger?

199
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,320
Whoa. Any stronger and we'd have to get it from the forest shaman.

200
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,480
What forest shaman?

201
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,720
Oh.

202
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,960
The one the villagers are talking about?

203
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,519
Does she really exist?

204
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,559
Really.

205
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,279
They say she can cure anything.

206
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,279
I don't know if they're exaggerating or not.

207
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,159
Do you want to try and visit her?

208
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,159
Oh? What should I be cured of?

209
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,410
Your weed addiction.

210
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,410
Ship me off to Wat Tham Krabok if that's the case.

211
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,519
He went back to school once he got better.

212
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,559
- But he still came around. - What is this?

213
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,480
Sometimes he'd skip school and come by.

214
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,170
Trin?

215
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,650
How did you get here?

216
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Are you here for the weed? Come on in.

217
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Hurry up or the mosquitoes might escape!

218
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,079
Whoa.

219
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,359
All right.

220
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,359
It's just like last time.

221
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,240
This's just so cheap.

222
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,359
Be careful and take it slow. You could get knocked out.

223
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,039
Awesome?

224
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,559
Hey, this is so strong.

225
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,799
For sure.

226
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,410
All right.

227
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,920
Be careful.

228
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,410
What do you think?

229
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,559
Okay.

230
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,650
Gosh.

231
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,890
Thank you so much. You're very kind.

232
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,279
Let's increase the volume. The music's starting to quiet down.

233
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,359
But there was this one time when he disappeared for weeks.

234
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,119
I thought he got better since he didn't come back.

235
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,519
Then one day...

236
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,759
The chopping board's here. Calm down.

237
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,170
I couldn't believe what I saw.

238
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,680
Hey, hide the bong!

239
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,410
Coming! Calm down!

240
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,960
- Hey! - Hey!

241
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,759
Hey!

242
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,720
Hey! Oh? Trin?

243
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,039
Hey, what's wrong?

244
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,279
Hey, Trin?

245
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,410
Trin, calm down!

246
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,890
- Trin! - Let go, you moron!

247
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,000
Get away!

248
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,200
What's with you?

249
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,279
Trin, calm down! It's me!

250
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,240
Trin, it's me!

251
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,319
- Bancha? - Yes.

252
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,480
- Bancha, you have to help me. - What?

253
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,119
I saw students getting shot to death.

254
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Huh?

255
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,440
There was this shadow!

256
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,519
- A shadow! - Calm down!

257
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,039
An unknown shadow!

258
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,200
It was there!

259
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,410
The place was full of blood!

260
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,279
There was a shadow!

261
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:23,079
Students died! People died!

262
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,680
- I don't know what that shadow is! - Calm down!

263
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,720
- Look at my arm! - What happened to you?

264
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,799
Look at it!

265
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,200
- Do you believe me? - I do.

266
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,079
- Trin, calm down! - Get away!

267
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,440
Listen to me, Trin!

268
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,650
Trin, calm down!

269
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,119
Calm down.

270
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,680
- You have to calm down. - Bancha,

271
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,319
can you help me?

272
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,559
Can you take me to the shaman in the forest?

273
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,650
I'm begging you.

274
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,440
Oh, jeez.

275
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,279
Get away!

276
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,279
Calm down.

277
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,240
Let's get going.

278
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,240
Watch your step.

279
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,119
Take it easy. Are you okay?

280
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,650
Slowly.

281
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
What is it?

282
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,119
Uh...

283
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,680
Is he going to recover?

284
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Yes.

285
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,960
For this ritual to work, he has to take the medicine three times.

286
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
But if there's a mistake or a failure,

287
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,000
the forest spirits might whisk him away forever.

288
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,599
But regardless of the ritual's success,

289
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,799
something has to be given in exchange.

290
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,440
What is it?

291
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,000
The mind of the person treated this way will be expanded

292
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,400
until

293
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,640
they might be able to connect with some things.

294
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,680
Things that are invisible,

295
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,799
especially

296
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,759
evil beings.

297
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,680
A weak mind

298
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,119
is the perfect feast to attract them.

299
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,839
And...

300
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,039
And is there a way to protect him from anything horrible?

301
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,559
Hope.

302
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:26,440
We have to hope those things won't be able to see.

303
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,240
Hope that your friend can become stronger in time.

304
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,799
Because once he's been absorbed into the dark realm,

305
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
he might not be able to come back out ever again.

306
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,039
You have to be alone for this ritual.

307
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,279
But when I returned in the morning,

308
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,559
he disappeared without a trace.

309
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,720
And I never saw him again.

310
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,599
What were the evil beings the forest shaman mentioned?

311
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,759
I don't know.

312
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,960
Can you take me to her?

313
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,359
I can, actually.

314
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,000
But she returns to her residence only occasionally.

315
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,279
She goes into the woods for months at a time.

316
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,279
I don't think there's any other way to help my friend.

317
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,559
It's okay. I'll go in and find out tomorrow.

318
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,319
And I'll let you know.

319
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,240
But if there's a better way,

320
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,880
I want you to try it out first.

321
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,359
You know what happened

322
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,960
to Trin in the end.

323
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:31,960
Do you think Trin disappeared

324
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,480
because of the forest shaman's ritual?

325
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,720
No idea.

326
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,279
But I don't want you guys to risk yourselves.

327
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,200
Should we try bringing him to the venerable monk first?

328
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,160
He might be able to help.

329
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
All right.

330
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
But how are we

331
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,319
going to get Dan out?

332
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,160
I saw dead bodies! I saw my friend die!

333
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,440
Even though you don't believe me, you know what happened!

334
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,680
That man is a murderer, Brother!

335
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,400
You can't just let things be!

336
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,559
Nonsense!

337
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,519
Stop talking about this.

338
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,160
Or I'm going to expel you!

339
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,640
Are you threatening me?

340
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,319
That man is a murderer.

341
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,119
You're threatening someone who's trying to help!

342
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,759
Stop right now, Trin!

343
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,400
I ordered you to stop!

344
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,119
Do you know you're protecting the one-armed man?

345
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,759
I said stop!

346
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,440
But I...

347
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Brother Anurak?

348
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Sir?

349
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,359
Can you tell the nurse to release me?

350
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,519
I'm fine now.

351
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Sir?

352
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,279
Help!

353
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,839
Help!

354
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Help! Is there anyone out there?

355
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,400
Help me!

356
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,920
Help! Anyone?

357
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,119
Please help me!

358
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,039
Help!

359
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,559
Nurse!

360
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,319
Nurse!

361
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,519
Nurse!

362
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,640
Has he always been like this?

363
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,720
Can you administer a sedative in this case?

364
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,440
Yes, but we need consent from his guardian.

365
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,880
I can do it. I'm his only guardian.

366
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,000
- Nurse. - Yes, doctor.

367
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,440
What happened?

368
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,359
And...

369
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,160
are you okay?

370
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,559
Not really.

371
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,400
Thanks for worrying about me.

372
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,960
And you, how have you been?

373
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm okay.

374
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,000
Everyone at the club

375
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,160
is very worried about you.

376
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,759
Really?

377
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,599
- And... - And...

378
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,640
You go first.

379
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,519
Well, I want to ask you

380
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,400
if you're still up

381
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,599
for performing in the play.

382
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,079
Of course. I've gotten better.

383
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,880
Are you worried about the play?

384
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,079
Are you crazy?

385
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,559
I'm worried about you.

386
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,839
Dan!

387
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Let's go.

388
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
To where?

389
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,519
We've found a way to help you.

390
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,039
Cha-aim.

391
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,960
Where are we going?

392
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,640
I'll tell you later. But we have to go now.

393
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,960
- I can't pry it open. - Take it easy.

394
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,680
The IV tube is in the way.

395
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,119
You're quite pretty. Do you have a boyfriend?

396
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,759
I'm actually married with kids.

397
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:09,400
Oh, right.

398
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,599
But are you telling the truth?

399
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,920
Aren't you into young and cool guys?

400
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,359
Something like that. I have to go. Bye.

401
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,799
Take it slow.

402
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,680
Are you sure this is going to help him?

403
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,640
I'm worried he might get worse if we don't do anything.

404
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,920
But I don't want to do it.

405
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,880
- Dan? - Please, Dan.

406
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,039
Do it for me.

407
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,279
How much time do we have?

408
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,640
It's like an hour before the nurse comes in to check on him?

409
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,039
Then we should hurry.

410
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,839
- Let's go. - Gently.

411
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,960
Be careful.

412
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,319
Venerable monk.

413
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,480
- Careful. - Gently.

414
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,359
Help him lie down on the mat.

415
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,079
Hey, Dan.

416
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,720
Can we do anything to help him?

417
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,640
He can't take it much longer.

418
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,119
What are you doing?

419
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,440
I'm tattooing a Yantra on you

420
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,440
to protect you from those evil beings

421
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,599
that are trying to telepathically connect to you.

422
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,000
Your mind is stronger than last time.

423
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,440
Now it's up to you

424
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,000
how you're going to use this strength.

425
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,079
Do you understand what he said?

426
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,159
We have to go.

427
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,519
Okay.

428
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,920
Come on.

429
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,840
Gently.

430
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,840
Nai.

431
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:45,920
Yes?

432
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,079
Don't let your protection diminish.

433
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
I won't.

434
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,920
Do you think what we're doing

435
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,079
will help anything?

436
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,239
I don't know.

437
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,119
But I can feel it.

438
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:35,960
Feel what?

439
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,920
When the venerable monk was tattooing the Yantra,

440
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,840
I saw the shadow starting to fade from me.

441
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,679
Isn't that a good thing then?

442
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,159
I'm not so sure about that.

443
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,920
What do you mean?

444
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:00,599
I'm starting to feel unsure about

445
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,289
what is actually harassing me.

446
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,559
I dreamed about the one-armed man last night.

447
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,599
It was different than the dreams I've had before.

448
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,769
It felt as if he was really there with me.

449
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,039
Do you think making the shadow disappear is going to end it all?

450
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:30,440
We have to expose this so everyone can be aware.

451
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,920
We have to find out the truth.

452
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,679
It's all right.

453
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,880
At least you have something to protect you

454
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,679
from the evil spirits trying to harm you.

455
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:17,480
You look better.

456
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
I'm feeling better now.

457
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,329
I'm sorry, sir.

458
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,960
For what?

459
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,039
You're unwell. I understand.

460
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,329
I'm talking about

461
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:37,960
my curiosity and meddling.

462
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:43,599
From now on,

463
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:48,480
I'll focus on my recovery based on your treatment.

464
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,400
I think it's the only method that can help me.

465
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
That's good.

466
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:58,639
I'm glad to hear that.

467
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,599
Yes, sir.

468
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,079
Anyway, you should rest.

469
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,599
Thank you.

470
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,199
We're hosting a social event this weekend.

471
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:47,960
It's our annual networking event

472
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,920
between our school and St. Mary.

473
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,239
I want to tell you

474
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,519
someone wants you to be their date at the event.

475
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,400
I'm afraid you'll have to be each other's dates.

476
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Is that what you want me to worry about?

477
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,639
There's something we need to do that day.

478
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,000
What is this?

479
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,809
I completely forgot Trin wrote a summary of Red October.

480
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,599
I think there definitely was a massacre at our school.
