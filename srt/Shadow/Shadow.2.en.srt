1
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,719
Dan!

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,480
Dan!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,039
Dan!

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Dan!

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,839
Dan, wake up!

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,800
Wake up!

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Dan?

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,879
Dan!

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,920
Dan! Dan, wake...

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,399
Dan!

11
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,159
Dan!

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,600
Dan! Dan, wake up!

13
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,039
Dan!

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,240
Help!

15
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,799
Help!

16
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,520
Brother, you have to help Dan!

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,640
Dan!

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,159
Rerng, take him to the infirmary now!

19
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,840
As for you, we'll talk later.

20
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:07,049
Hurry!

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Dan!

22
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,810
Entering a forbidden area is already against the rules.

23
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,120
But you two went there at this hour as well.

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,280
Has it ever crossed your mind how things could've turned out

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,719
had I not found you?

26
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,840
Who's going to take responsibility

27
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,370
if someone got seriously injured?

28
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,090
I'm sorry, Brother.

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,039
Seriously, why did you two go there?

30
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,439
I just wanted to get out and relax a little.

31
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,719
Should I ask you one more time?

32
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,240
That really is the truth, sir.

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,680
And who came up with the idea to go there?

34
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,199
It was me, sir.

35
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,520
I asked Dan to go with me.

36
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,560
I'm the only one you should punish.

37
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,360
Okay. You can go.

38
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,879
Thank you.

39
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,319
Danai's awake, Brother.

40
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,879
Thank you.

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,400
Dan, how are you feeling? Any better?

42
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,280
Yes, Brother.

43
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm not here to scold you.

44
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,639
You should rest until you've recovered first.

45
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,319
And how's Nai?

46
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,599
I've already talked to him.

47
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,319
He said he took you out to the lake.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
But both of you have broken the rules.

49
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,120
I have no choice but to punish you both

50
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,360
according to the school's policy.

51
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,920
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,680
Dan, I'd like to know what happened last night.

53
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,120
I saw myself on a rowboat in the middle of the lake.

54
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,480
And all of a sudden, I couldn't move.

55
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,170
I saw a shadow moving closer and closer.

56
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,480
Brother,

57
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
I think it was...

58
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,610
Trin.

59
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,120
How did I get here?

60
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,800
You've been here right from the start.

61
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,079
I guess the hypnosis

62
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,120
made you feel as if you were somewhere else.

63
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,000
But everything we've talked about

64
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,560
actually has happened.

65
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,839
It's just your mind

66
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,360
that made you think we were talking in a different place.

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,480
And how did you know

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,519
the shadow is Trin?

69
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,839
I don't.

70
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,279
But your obsession with Trin

71
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,920
might've shaped your mind into thinking it's him.

72
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you think

73
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,079
Trin's spirit hasn't departed?

74
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,639
We can't prove

75
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,920
whether spirits actually exist.

76
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,800
I also don't want to jump to conclusions.

77
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,920
We don't know what you saw.

78
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,040
But what I can do is psychotherapy.

79
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,319
Let's talk about this.

80
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,279
You think the shadow is Trin, don't you?

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,360
I'm not sure either.

82
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,240
Even if it isn't Trin,

83
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,759
I feel he has something to do

84
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,040
with the shadow becoming more powerful.

85
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,639
Since I started seeing the shadow, I've never felt this way before.

86
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,360
How did you feel?

87
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,959
Heavy.

88
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,720
It was so heavy,

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,839
as if I was becoming part of it.

90
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,439
You think Trin has become a supernatural being?

91
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,120
You think I believe in nonsense now, don't you?

92
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't stop you from believing in whatever you want.

93
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,439
But I'd like you to consider other possibilities as well.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,399
Up until this very day, no one has found Trin's body.

95
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,680
He might still be alive somewhere else.

96
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,439
Dan?

97
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,759
Dan? What's wrong?

98
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,079
What just happened, sir?

99
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,199
You were telling me what happened at the lake.

100
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,160
Then you just went still.

101
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,639
You don't remember anything at all?

102
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,560
I think you should go back to sleep.

103
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,399
We can talk another time.

104
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,360
Wine stains from mass.

105
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,519
You can mop over there.

106
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,330
I'll mop here.

107
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,120
Hey...

108
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,039
Thanks.

109
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,919
Why would you thank me?

110
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,240
We both got punished.

111
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,480
It's me who should be thanking you

112
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,799
because it's my fault.

113
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,159
You actually didn't have to take the blame for me.

114
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,320
It's okay.

115
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,759
If Brother knew we both went out to the lake intentionally,

116
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
things would be worse.

117
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,840
You might be under even more scrutiny.

118
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Anyway,

119
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,480
are you hanging in there?

120
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,919
Your reaction the other night was very concerning.

121
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,879
Mm.

122
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I guess I am.

123
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,240
But I still have to find the cause of that stupid shadow.

124
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,519
Otherwise, it'll feel like I'm constantly fighting

125
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,159
against the unknown.

126
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,240
And how did you

127
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,279
get acquainted with Brother?

128
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,919
It seems like you two are already close.

129
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,639
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

130
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,440
No, I can tell you.

131
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,879
My mom used to be one of his psychiatric patients.

132
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,960
He used psychology

133
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,759
in combination with his faith in God.

134
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,799
And Mom ended up being a firm believer.

135
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,960
But after she died

136
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,360
and Dad was hospitalized,

137
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,519
Brother suggested I transfer here

138
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,120
so he can watch over me.

139
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
And

140
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,120
has your condition improved with his treatment?

141
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,639
I got better for some time when I was younger.

142
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,840
But I started seeing the shadow again

143
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,720
after Mom died.

144
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,559
At first, I wondered

145
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,240
if it was because my mind got weaker.

146
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,840
But after the incident that night,

147
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,639
I don't think it only depends on the strength of my mind anymore.

148
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,279
There has to be more to it.

149
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,000
Do I sound like I'm talking nonsense?

150
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,320
Do you believe me?

151
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,320
Of course I do.

152
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,919
I can see ghosts, remember?

153
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,720
There's nothing strange about it.

154
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
But it's difficult

155
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,639
to convince other people.

156
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,279
I understand.

157
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,919
I understand

158
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,120
you're making an excuse to wipe your hand on my shirt as well.

159
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,039
- You got it all dirty. - Sorry!

160
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,879
I didn't mean it! I'm sorry!

161
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,039
Darn it.

162
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Huh?

163
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,799
Did we just share a laugh together?

164
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,519
I guess we're close friends now?

165
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,159
Right.

166
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,720
It's so weird though.

167
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,919
We got close because of it somehow.

168
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,919
It's all right.

169
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,480
Hey, I said I'm sorry!

170
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
It's clean now.

171
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Come on.

172
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,240
Let's go.

173
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,639
Or we might get punished again.

174
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
Let's go.

175
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,279
All right.

176
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,039
Oh, no.

177
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,279
You don't have it, do you? Deal.

178
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,320
Hey, hey. It's the gay couple.

179
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,159
Wow, the new love birds have gone public!

180
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Hey!

181
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,360
They're touching each other!

182
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,279
They must be so in love!

183
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,720
Did you two clean up the septic tank or something?

184
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,440
Your clothes are all stained. What have you been up to?

185
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,519
See? They're touching again.

186
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,519
They're probably still in the mood after the mouth-to-mouth.

187
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,279
I knew it. The busted cubicle door was your doing, wasn't it?

188
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,759
The toilet paper is all gone too!

189
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,799
Aw, aw.

190
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,360
Kiss, kiss.

191
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,480
This is imported, you jerk!

192
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,200
Hey, Dan!

193
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,759
Dan!

194
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,039
Dan!

195
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
Let go!

196
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,519
Shoot, it's Ms. Yada!

197
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,080
Run! I'm out!

198
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,360
I don't care who started the fight.

199
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,039
I think you already know the answer.

200
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,559
I don't want you to get in trouble, especially since you're new here.

201
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,440
I won't tell Brother this time.

202
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,279
But

203
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,759
what if Anan treats me like this again?

204
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Put up with it for now.

205
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,079
Those kids won't be teasing you for too long.

206
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,079
They'll get bored eventually.

207
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,240
I don't want you to come and go so quickly.

208
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,759
Go on. Call your friend in.

209
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,279
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,359
Is there anything you'd like to say to me?

211
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,440
I'm sorry, ma'am.

212
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,559
I guess the story won't be much different from what Dan told me.

213
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,279
But I'd like to tell you something.

214
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,359
Yes, ma'am?

215
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,079
Well...

216
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,599
I know what you are.

217
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,359
What do you mean by that, ma'am?

218
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,890
I'm talking about last year.

219
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,960
I know you and Dan are close.

220
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,119
But he's a new student.

221
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,200
I don't want to see him step out of line.

222
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,079
You can be direct with me.

223
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,920
It might be better

224
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,799
if you and Dan keep your distance.

225
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,079
I don't want to see anyone else get bullied

226
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,410
because of their sexual orientation.

227
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,359
But ma'am, it's not my fault...

228
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,480
This includes you as well.

229
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,240
It'll be good for you too.

230
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,920
I don't want to see you being bullied either, understand?

231
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
You can go.

233
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
How did it go?

234
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,759
Nothing much.

235
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,920
Let's get our wounds cleaned.

236
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,559
Sure.

237
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Here.

238
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,960
You can do it yourself, can't you?

239
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,279
Nai,

240
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,559
did Ms. Yada say something to you?

241
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,890
You can trust me.

242
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,359
She...

243
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,960
told me to keep my distance from you.

244
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,720
Why?

245
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
I...

246
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,410
I'm into guys.

247
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,119
Then help me clean my wounds.

248
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,440
Don't pay her any attention.

249
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,039
But other people might find you disgusting.

250
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,650
So what?

251
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,119
I find people like Ms. Yada more disgusting.

252
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,119
Why?

253
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,960
So what if you're into guys?

254
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,720
Does that mean we can't be friends?

255
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,519
Hurry up. My wounds are starting to rot.

256
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
You're exaggerating.

257
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,759
- Nai. - Hm?

258
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,240
Why haven't you ever thought of fighting back?

259
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,559
Why should I bother?

260
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,720
No one's going to side with me anyway.

261
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,160
When did he start bullying you?

262
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,160
Two years ago.

263
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,160
I had just joined the marching band.

264
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,599
Hello.

265
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,920
Anan was there before me.

266
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:21,960
Hi.

267
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,920
Hello.

268
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,680
I almost didn't make it

269
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,880
when I first started.

270
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,559
- Can you teach me? - How are you doing?

271
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,480
- Hey, there's a new guy. - Anan helped me.

272
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,640
He's playing the sax too.

273
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,000
- I'll check on him. - He was very patient with me.

274
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,400
Go on.

275
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
How are you doing?

276
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
- Hey. - Hi.

277
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,559
I'm Anan. Nice to meet you.

278
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,079
I'm Nai.

279
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,599
Can you play? You looked a bit awkward back there.

280
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,359
This is my first time.

281
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,640
Right. Put your fingers here.

282
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,799
Look.

283
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,480
Three fingers there. Hold them like this.

284
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,960
- Sorry. - That's right.

285
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
- Index, middle, ring... - There.

286
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,359
Give it a go. Round your lips into an "O".

287
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,680
"O".

288
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,960
Got it? Give it a go.

289
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,200
See? You got it.

290
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,720
I mean your pose.

291
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,160
Well, you too.

292
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,039
I started to become close to him.

293
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,079
I had feelings for him.

294
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,039
I admit that.

295
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,559
(Welcome to Saint Lawrence College website)

296
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,799
(Have you ever had a crush on someone?)

297
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,960
Hey, Nai!

298
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hey,

299
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,799
what are you doing?

300
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,359
Nothing.

301
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,880
Come on. Let's eat.

302
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,559
Okay.

303
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,279
During the semester break,

304
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,359
he had to attend a summer course in the UK.

305
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,559
That's when it started.

306
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,119
Aren't you going home during the break like the others?

307
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,960
No, I'm not.

308
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,319
There are a lot more things to do here.

309
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,359
Then keep practicing.

310
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,279
You have to be better than me when I get back.

311
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Anan,

312
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
are you okay? You look pale.

313
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,599
Are you not feeling well?

314
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,039
- You definitely aren't well. - Mm.

315
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,279
I think I'm coming down with a fever.

316
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,119
Do you want to go to the infirmary? I'll take you there.

317
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,759
It's okay. My dad's going to be here soon.

318
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,400
I'll just take a long nap at home.

319
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,279
Are you sure you're all right?

320
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,839
Mm.

321
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,559
I am.

322
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
That was so nice.

323
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,119
- Right? - Mm.

324
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,519
- Get a lot of rest, okay? - Mm.

325
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,519
I'm going to miss you.

326
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Likewise.

327
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,519
Safe travels.

328
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,720
Don't forget to keep in touch sometimes too, okay?

329
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,839
Sure. I won't be gone for long.

330
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,319
We'll see each other again next semester.

331
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,839
See you.

332
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,160
Don't forget to take some medicine!

333
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,519
You have a call.

334
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,119
Okay.

335
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,799
Hello?

336
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,440
Hey, Nai! I'm back!

337
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,400
Anan?

338
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,440
How have you been?

339
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,279
I've missed you.

340
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,000
It was so nice there.

341
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,680
If only you could come too.

342
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,000
What about you? Did you practice at all?

343
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,960
I did.

344
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,880
But I couldn't really play without you.

345
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,559
Why not? Am I just sheet music to you or something?

346
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,119
No.

347
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,319
Well...

348
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,720
I see you as more than just an upper-year student.

349
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,599
What do you mean by that?

350
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,519
Well...

351
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,119
I like you.

352
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Hello?

353
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,400
Hello? Anan?

354
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,559
Hi, Tong.

355
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,319
How are you doing?

356
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,920
Hi.

357
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,000
If cats had hands and feet,

358
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,559
I'd hire them to do my laundry.

359
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,559
But cats don't listen much anyway.

360
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,000
- I'm like a slave to mine nowadays. - A slave to your cat.

361
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,079
Yes, I had to...

362
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,319
If only we could order them around.

363
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,920
- Anan? - It's the other way around.

364
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,319
Right?

365
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,960
- Right? - Right.

366
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,759
I only pay 30 baht for the cat food.

367
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,880
Anan,

368
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,680
about that day...

369
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,880
Get away from me, Fruity!

370
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:59,200
Huh? Nai's a fruitcake!

371
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,880
Hey, fruitcake!

372
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,359
- You two! He's a fruitcake! - A fruitcake!

373
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,279
- He does really look like one! - True!

374
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,960
I knew it. He really looks like one!

375
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,160
He's even sitting like a fruitcake!

376
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,599
He folds his arms and legs too!

377
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,480
What are you doing right there, fruitcake?

378
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,079
Too stunned to speak, aren't you?

379
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,559
Does your dad know?

380
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,920
- Where are you going? - I knew it!

381
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,880
Hey, where are you going, Fruity?

382
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,759
You do it.

383
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:54,480
Bull's eye!

384
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,319
There!

385
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,319
There you go!

386
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,519
That was great!

387
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,519
Come on!

388
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,240
There!

389
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,319
He got it!

390
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,559
See?

391
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,279
So that's the story.

392
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,920
It's good to have just a few friends anyway.

393
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,200
At least

394
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,519
people might stop gossiping about me.

395
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,559
Hey,

396
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,519
don't think that way.

397
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,079
I think the people teasing you are stupid.

398
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,559
Ms. Yada too.

399
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,519
Don't mind them.

400
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,960
Hello?

401
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,079
Nai, it's me.

402
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,720
What's the matter, Dad?

403
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,480
Can you do me a favor?

404
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,799
This Saturday, can you go to the hospital in town

405
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,599
and get the medication for the venerable monk?

406
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,000
Come on, Dad. Why don't you bring it to him yourself?

407
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,880
I'm going to be busy with work. It'll take a while to finish.

408
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,400
I'll have to drive across the provinces too.

409
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,920
Come on. You'll get to visit him too.

410
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,240
Mm...

411
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,559
(Stage Actors Wanted for Hamlet)

412
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,920
Do you want to sign up?

413
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Huh?

414
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,279
Sign up for what? I can't even act.

415
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,519
Don't be shy. Everyone wants to be a celebrity nowadays.

416
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,200
If you really want to be one, I won't tease you.

417
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,440
What prank are you going to pull on your friend this time, Josh?

418
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,640
- Hello. - Hello, Master.

419
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,079
Nothing. I just want my friend to follow his dream.

420
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,480
Drop by the Drama Club if you're interested.

421
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,279
You can help out on set as well.

422
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,519
Yes, sir.

423
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,519
Dan, don't talk to Master Joe too much.

424
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,680
People might call you a fruitcake.

425
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,640
And what's wrong with being one?

426
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,960
This year's poster is cool. I have to take a pee.

427
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,079
(Stage Actors Wanted for Hamlet)

428
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,329
Are you sure?

429
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,079
Yes.

430
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,039
If Master Joe was really involved with Trin's disappearance,

431
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,199
it might help me get closer to the truth.

432
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,519
Wasn't that confiscated?

433
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,960
I know. I have to answer this.

434
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,239
Don't put my name down, okay?

435
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Hello?

436
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Why are you calling me?

437
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,039
(Sign up for an audition)

438
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:16,809
Dan?

439
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,329
Dan,

440
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,199
what do you think you'll find here?

441
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,239
I don't know.

442
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,719
I just want to know what kind of atmosphere Trin used to be in.

443
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:03,079
Can you tell me about Trin and Master Joe?

444
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,000
I want to know what happened back then.

445
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,960
At the time,

446
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,679
Trin and Master Joe were close.

447
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,400
Trin sent Master Joe a love letter.

448
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,960
But someone found it.

449
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,809
And it was posted on the walls around the school.

450
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,809
So Trin quit the Drama Club.

451
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,880
Sounds like my story, doesn't it?

452
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,559
But I'll be fine.

453
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,679
At least I didn't disappear without a trace.

454
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,440
But Trin

455
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,329
suddenly started shutting himself off.

456
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,329
He kept to himself.

457
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:12,400
Then he just vanished.

458
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,809
Dan, I'm sorry

459
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,809
for saying hi to you on your first day.

460
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,719
I don't want you to get in trouble

461
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:30,159
because you're friends with me.

462
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,360
Why are you apologizing?

463
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,119
I'm actually happy.

464
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,400
- You are the dream - Huh?

465
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:58,920
You know how to play?

466
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,039
I didn't know. You're good.

467
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,679
- You are the dream - You are the dream

468
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,880
- In my heart - In my heart

469
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,400
- The dream - The dream

470
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,199
- Far, far away - Far, far away

471
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,809
- As out of reach as the stars - As out of reach as the stars

472
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,329
- In the vast sky - In the vast sky

473
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,039
- I'm not even sure - I'm not even sure

474
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,519
- If I can hold onto them - If I can hold onto them

475
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:42,679
- Like flowers - Like flowers

476
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,840
- Of hope - Of hope

477
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,769
- Our dream - Our dream

478
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:54,519
- Is limitless - Is limitless

479
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,289
Only if

480
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,119
You understand

481
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:05,719
I'm sure

482
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,920
That someday

483
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,360
The girls from St.Mary are here!

484
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,960
- I'm Cha-aim. You are... - I'm Dan.

485
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,480
Okay. Then...

486
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,769
What do you want to talk about?

487
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,599
I have sleep problems.

488
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,960
How come?

489
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,480
You didn't sleep well last night?

490
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,039
No, I had the same dream.

491
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,079
Since Brother's method doesn't seem to yield any result,

492
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,000
there's no loss in trying something new, is there?

493
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,289
You have to learn to be in control of your own dream.

494
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,480
Once you've learned to do so,

495
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,840
you'll be in control of what you see as well.
