1
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,240
To live or to die now,

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:11,960
that is my problem.

3
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,439
Am I even honorable?

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,609
I don't even know.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,120
There is only one feeling I'm experiencing inside.

6
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,199
Agony.

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,760
The only way to stop this feeling

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,079
is death.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
Did you hear that, Father?

10
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:51,600
I'm in agony.

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,439
I can't endure it any longer!

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,239
I've heard everything, Hamlet.

13
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,480
That answer is false.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,120
And what you are speaking of

15
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,239
is merely a construct.

16
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,040
But if you wish to escape the pain,

17
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,280
try this medication.

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,599
It'll help you to sleep better.

19
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,120
You've always meant well for me, Father.

20
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,959
Thank you.

21
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,039
Is this really the new version of Hamlet?

22
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,090
Isn't the interpretation a bit off?

23
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,560
But it feels familiar.

24
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,879
Wanlop.

25
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,759
Yes, sir?

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
What's going on here?

27
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,680
Nai asked to change the lighting cues this morning.

28
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,439
He said he'd like to add an extra scene at the end.

29
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,159
And where is he?

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,479
I don't know, sir.

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Hamlet!

32
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,639
You can't trust someone like that!

33
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,879
In the end,

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
you'll fall for the innocent facade of the Grim Reaper.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,919
The evilest person is

36
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,120
the one you believe had your best interests at heart.

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,360
But you know what?

38
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,479
You're not the first.

39
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
And you won't be the last.

40
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,719
- Help! - Help!

41
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,120
- Help! - Help!

42
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,800
- Help! - Help!

43
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,879
- Help! - Help!

44
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,199
- Help! - Help!

45
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,400
- Help! - Help!

46
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,170
- Help! - Help!

47
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,170
- Help! - Help!

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,359
- Help! - Help!

49
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,839
- Let us out! - Let us out!

50
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,800
That's it?

51
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
I guess.

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,050
But that scene was awesome.

53
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,120
Dan!

54
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,399
Dan?

55
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Dan?

56
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,759
Dan!

57
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,439
Someone call an ambulance!

58
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,920
(Third Eye Shut)

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,439
- Dan! - Dan, can you hear me?

60
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,360
Dan, don't fall asleep!

61
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,879
Smash...

62
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,519
the pedestal.

63
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,519
- Dan! - Dan, wake up!

64
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
Dan!

65
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,319
Dan's arrived at the hospital.

66
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,360
His condition is rather concerning.

67
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,600
Master Joe will keep him company there.

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,879
- Thank you very much, Master Eric. - You're welcome.

69
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,560
Danai has caused trouble multiple times already.

70
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,079
I think we should set an example this time,

71
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
or there could be copycats.

72
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,279
That's true, Master.

73
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,600
I think he's harassing you, Brother Anurak.

74
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,920
You have to stop protecting this boy.

75
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,959
But Dan's still at the hospital.

76
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,800
Let's decide on his punishment after he's woken up.

77
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,759
I understand we don't have a policy to expel our students

78
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,839
unless they show severe signs of disruptive behavior.

79
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,120
But it could manifest itself later on in Danai's case.

80
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,680
She has a point, Brother Anurak.

81
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,759
We're receiving more complaints from the parents as well.

82
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,199
The incident at the school dance was also his doing.

83
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,839
We must deal with this with the utmost severity.

84
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,079
You should make a decision as soon as possible, Brother.

85
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
There will be no expulsion this time.

86
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,800
I'll take responsibility for this myself.

87
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,079
I'm going to resign from my position as the director of St. Lawrence.

88
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
What should we do now?

89
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,360
Aren't you two hungry at all?

90
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,439
I had a sandwich.

91
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,560
But Nai hasn't had anything.

92
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,720
Nai, you have to eat something,

93
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,120
or you might fall ill as well.

94
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,279
I'm not really hungry, Master.

95
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,879
But thank you.

96
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,399
Brother Anurak?

97
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,679
You should take the boys back to their dorm.

98
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,240
You two have class tomorrow.

99
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,360
I'll stay the night here.

100
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,120
- Is that a good idea? - Yes.

101
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,210
I know the doctors here.

102
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,279
I have to stay and discuss Dan's treatment anyway.

103
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,559
Okay.

104
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,039
All right. We should leave.

105
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,919
Excuse me, Brother.

106
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,450
I know

107
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,960
you're not entirely like what Dan believes.

108
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,330
You know both Dan and Trin are

109
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,639
possessed by a certain entity.

110
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,360
I just thought

111
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,799
had we believed them right from the start,

112
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,330
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

113
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,240
Thank you very much, Uncle Rerng.

114
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,399
What did you talk to Brother about?

115
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,559
It was nothing.

116
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,600
He's as worried about Dan as we are.

117
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,360
What about Cha-aim?

118
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,919
How is she doing?

119
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,759
She hasn't moved a bit.

120
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,090
I'm at my wits' end.

121
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,960
We're only in the eleventh grade.

122
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,519
Why do we have to go through all of these stressful things?

123
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,440
Josh.

124
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,120
If Cha-aim didn't become acquainted with us,

125
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,240
she wouldn't have ended up in this state.

126
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,159
- I don't... - Josh, calm down.

127
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,039
- This kind of thing... - I don't know what to do!

128
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,799
How would I live if Cha-aim were to die?

129
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,480
I haven't been able to sleep because I'm so worried about her!

130
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,960
There has to be a way!

131
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,120
I'm willing to do anything!

132
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,799
Just about anything to bring her back!

133
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,960
Take it easy.

134
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,480
The venerable monk.

135
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,679
Your venerable monk.

136
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,960
Thank you so much for lending a hand, Josh.

137
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
Don't worry, ma'am. I'll do anything to help bring Cha-aim back.

138
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Cha-aim!

139
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,600
Dan? Dan!

140
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Huh?

141
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,879
How come you're here?

142
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
I should be asking you that.

143
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,720
When did you get here?

144
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,080
Since that day at the club.

145
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,519
And I don't remember anything else.

146
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,519
But you can't be here.

147
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,480
It's time you went back to your body.

148
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,320
Your mom and Josh are waiting for you.

149
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,639
But I don't know what to do.

150
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,559
This place is full of darkness.

151
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,679
And there's a monster too!

152
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,159
It's so scary!

153
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,960
There's a monster here!

154
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,919
A monster?

155
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,840
That's right. You have to go back with me.

156
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,399
Can you hear me? Cha-aim?

157
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,759
Can you hear me?

158
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,120
That's Josh's voice!

159
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,080
Dan, it's Josh! We have to hurry!

160
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,279
I don't want to go back anymore.

161
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,320
What do you mean?

162
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,679
Are you going to stay here?

163
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,799
In such a scary place like this?

164
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,399
There's also a monster.

165
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,480
Cha-aim, the shadow isn't a monster.

166
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,279
How can it not be?

167
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,759
- Have you even seen it? - Listen to me.

168
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,240
The shadow isn't a monster.

169
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,480
How can it not be?

170
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,720
I think

171
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,320
it killed Trin.

172
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,799
- Dan... - No.

173
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,720
It'd never do such a thing.

174
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,360
Besides,

175
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,399
this is the only place

176
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,159
I don't feel pain.

177
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,600
It's the only place I feel wanted.

178
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,960
I don't have anything else left, Cha-aim.

179
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,599
I don't want to go back anymore.

180
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,960
How can you say that?

181
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,599
You still have me,

182
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,410
Nai, and Josh.

183
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,200
Everyone needs you.

184
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,920
I'm exhausted. I've had enough of everything.

185
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,960
You know what?

186
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,890
Being awake or asleep is equally as agonizing for me.

187
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,279
If I go back,

188
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,559
I don't know when it's going to end.

189
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,890
I can't take it anymore.

190
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,200
Do you want me to go back and be in agony like that?

191
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,410
I really don't want to.

192
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,410
Then,

193
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:19,000
can I ask you something?

194
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,079
Did you read

195
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,200
the book I gave you until the very last page?

196
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,359
I saw it.

197
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
And...

198
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,759
And...

199
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,960
And have you ever felt

200
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,410
the same way I feel?

201
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,079
Why...

202
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,279
Why?

203
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,759
Why, Dan?

204
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Why...

205
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,319
Why haven't you ever told me?

206
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,650
You know, right?

207
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,279
I asked you that day.

208
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,200
Yes, I do.

209
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,170
Then why?

210
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,119
Why?

211
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,839
I thought Josh could look after you better than I could.

212
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,000
You should go, Cha-aim.

213
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,240
I really want to stay here.

214
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,680
Dan, can you hear me?

215
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,170
Dan?

216
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Dan.

217
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,599
Dan, did you hear that?

218
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,519
Nai's calling for you.

219
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,319
Please come with me.

220
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,960
Go on, Cha-aim.

221
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,410
Go back.

222
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,960
There's no time! Go!

223
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
Go! Trust me!

224
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,000
Hurry!

225
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,480
Cha-aim?

226
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,480
Nai, Cha-aim's awake!

227
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,200
Dan, can you hear me?

228
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,839
Josh, go and get the doctor.

229
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,359
Yes, ma'am!

230
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Dan?

231
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,200
You can hear me, can't you?

232
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,720
The children wanted their friends to return safely.

233
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,839
Thank you very much.

234
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,839
Your friend isn't the same anymore.

235
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,839
Dan has gone too far to be the same again.

236
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,559
I don't want to say anything to discourage you.

237
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,920
But to be frank,

238
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,759
it's very difficult to bring him back.

239
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,559
I want you to be mentally prepared.

240
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,599
How come? Cha-aim was able to come back.

241
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,400
Dan should be able to as well.

242
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,359
We can't help all the people in the world.

243
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,000
Some people will choose their own path

244
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,079
because it's what's best for them.

245
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,480
We won't be able to stop them.

246
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,319
Unless...

247
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,559
Unless?

248
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,200
Some people have unfinished business

249
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,319
in another realm where they are right now.

250
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Dan!

251
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,960
- Dan! - Dan!

252
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,960
Smash...

253
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,839
the pedestal.

254
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,920
If I can help him,

255
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,839
he'll actually come back, won't he?

256
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,880
The pedestal?

257
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:03,279
- Help! - Help!

258
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,119
This pedestal?

259
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,759
Josh?

260
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,759
Josh?

261
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,319
Please don't hurt me!

262
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,359
I just want my friend to come back!

263
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,559
What in the world is this?

264
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm in the courtyard here at St. Lawrence College,

265
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,480
where fragments of human skeletons have been discovered.

266
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,599
It's been speculated they were cemented inside for over 20 years.

267
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,680
The police are investigating whether this is a murder case.

268
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
And there's Brother Anurak.

269
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,519
Brother Anurak, what happened?

270
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,519
The police are bringing in Brother Anurak Sirisittidech,

271
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:37,519
the school director for questioning at the police station.

272
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,160
He was the school's vice president at the time

273
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,519
and might have relevant leads.

274
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,680
This isn't the first case at St. Lawrence College.

275
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,480
An eleventh-grader, Trin Dhevawijitra, also disappeared

276
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,039
from the school grounds.

277
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:54,680
It seems there's more to the case.

278
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:59,240
The governor is currently discussing whether to close down the school.

279
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,880
We'll be back with the latest developments at noon.

280
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Josh,

281
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,960
can you take me back to Dan?

282
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,119
Watch your step.

283
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,599
Nai, have you heard the news about the smashed pedestal at our school?

284
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,079
They found skeletal remains.

285
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,880
The police are interrogating Brother Anurak as well.

286
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,759
What actually happened?

287
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,960
News?

288
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,680
Mm.

289
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,480
I met Dan in my dream.

290
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,680
What do you mean?

291
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,480
Well, it was very dark.

292
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,839
But then I saw a light

293
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,160
when I met Dan.

294
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
I...

295
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,039
I think I had a conversation with him too.

296
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,359
But I can't remember what we talked about.

297
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,839
What's the matter?

298
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,640
Can you get in touch with Bancha for me?

299
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,079
Why?

300
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,039
Cha-aim said she saw Dan.

301
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,559
I think he's trapped in another realm.

302
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,160
Didn't the forest shaman Bancha knows

303
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,640
say herself that

304
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,559
we can ask for anything?

305
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,319
I'm going to ask her to bring Dan back.

306
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,839
You did it, didn't you?

307
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,759
I'll do anything to bring Dan back.

308
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:01,799
Hey.

309
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,960
This is as far as I'm going to take you.

310
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,519
Thank you.

311
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,839
Catch you later.

312
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,279
You've arrived.

313
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,839
Someone told me

314
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
if I offer an apology to the forest spirit,

315
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:33,319
it'll help me with everything. Is that right?

316
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,960
Do you believe in the balance of nature?

317
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,160
This lake is

318
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:45,960
like a portal to another realm.

319
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,319
There is a forest spirit

320
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,359
people believe to be a shadow.

321
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,440
It helps protect the village from disasters.

322
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,400
Alas, one day,

323
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
your school was wrongly built

324
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,240
on top of these sacred grounds,

325
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,599
causing the portal to close.

326
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,440
The energy and spirits were abandoned

327
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,960
and have been stuck here for almost a hundred years.

328
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:24,000
So the nature in this area was thrown out of balance.

329
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,799
Therefore,

330
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,119
the ritual of wishing upon the shadow is

331
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,720
to enable the wisher

332
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,920
to see the other realm

333
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,960
so they can

334
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,880
release those spirits

335
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:46,200
and energize the shadow again.

336
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,960
Offering an apology to the forest spirit is akin

337
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,319
to opening up the third eye.

338
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,640
You'll be free from everything.

339
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,079
You'll be awakened.

340
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,559
You'll see the past, present, and future.

341
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,599
If you can perform the whole ritual,

342
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,079
your wish will come true.

343
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,679
But...

344
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,599
if you can't,

345
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:24,809
the forest spirit will forever imprison you.

346
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:26,840
You.

347
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,440
You have seen it all.

348
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,809
You've seen the truth behind that place.

349
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:38,360
What do you mean by that?

350
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,960
You probably thought that was a spirit.

351
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,769
It's the past that is

352
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,880
still endlessly manifesting itself.

353
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:01,920
But you already have an immunity to it.

354
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,079
You'll fare better than your friend did last year.

355
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:12,809
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been taken away by the forest spirit.

356
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,239
My friend?

357
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Trin?

358
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:27,199
Are you saying

359
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,360
Trin failed the ritual?

360
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,809
During the ritual to open the third eye,

361
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,960
you must drink this herbal medicine.

362
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,440
You'll be slightly nauseous but have to endure it.

363
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,329
There are three dosages

364
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
for early evening, the middle of the night, and early morning.

365
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,880
No matter what happens,

366
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,119
you can't leave this place. Drink.

367
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,679
You said I'd only feel nauseous!

368
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:22,769
Darn it!

369
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,480
It's the soldiers! Run!

370
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:57,199
Ma'am, he's disappeared!

371
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The shadow.

372
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,239
He appeared sooner than I thought.

373
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:09,719
All of you go and find him now.

374
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:13,159
There will be pandemonium if the ritual isn't finished.

375
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,519
Go!

376
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:23,289
Get out!

377
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
Get out!

378
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,679
- Trin! - Trin, where are you?

379
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,239
- Trin! - Where are you?

380
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,039
- Trin! - Can you hear me?

381
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,920
Trin!

382
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:53,079
- Help! - Help!

383
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,599
- Help! - Help!

384
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:59,639
- Help! - Help!

385
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,769
- Help! - Help!

386
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,000
- We're here! - We're here!

387
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,400
- Help! - Help!

388
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,239
- Get us out of here! - Get us out of here!

389
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:12,559
- Help! - Help!

390
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,400
- Help! - Help!

391
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,960
- Help! - Help!

392
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,559
- Get us out of here! - Get us out of here!

393
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,840
- Help! - Help!

394
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,809
- Help! - Help!

395
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,289
- Help! - Help!

396
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,199
Trin, stop!

397
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,639
I order you to stop!

398
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,400
Stop! Stop right now!

399
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,440
What's actually in there?

400
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,519
Huh?

401
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:18,599
Answer me!

402
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,840
I have to smash it

403
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,119
so they can be at peace!

404
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,719
So they can be reincarnated!

405
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,239
What are you talking about?

406
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:30,480
You really don't know?

407
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,079
Don't you?

408
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:36,679
You don't know the Red October university students died here?

409
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,159
They were buried here!

410
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,639
There were buried right here!

411
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,559
I have to release them!

412
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,329
If I don't help them,

413
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:49,119
it's going to catch up.

414
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:51,199
Who's going to catch up with you?

415
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,289
Stop talking nonsense at once!

416
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,920
No!

417
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,079
Stop!

418
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,079
Stop!

419
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,638
- I order you to stop! - Let go!

420
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:02,439
- Stop right now! - Let go of me!

421
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,639
Stop!

422
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:33,719
Don't come any closer!

423
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:35,960
Are you okay?

424
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,880
Leave me alone! Stay away!

425
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,800
Who are you?

426
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,159
It's me, Brother Anurak!

427
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,519
It's me! Are you okay?

428
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:49,559
- Stay away! - Trin!

429
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:51,880
- Leave me alone! - Trin!

430
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,559
- Go away! - Trin!

431
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,920
So the forest spirit is

432
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:06,440
the shadow Dan's been seeing this whole all this time?

433
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,239
What did he do to attract his attention?

434
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,039
That's why he refuses to let him go.

435
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:18,519
And what do I have to do?

436
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,079
My friend's soul is wandering in an unknown place.

437
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,760
I want him to come back.

438
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,719
Can you ask the forest spirit to bring him back?

439
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,639
It's not up to me.

440
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,960
Your friend is with him now.

441
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,159
What else can I do?

442
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,719
So what do you guys want to do?

443
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:09,199
I'll drop you off at the hospital. Then we'll part ways.

444
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:10,719
Sure.

445
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
Nai,

446
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:15,719
what's on your mind?

447
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,599
Do you remember when we brought Dan

448
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:23,360
to perform that ritual to ward the shadow off?

449
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Mm.

450
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,280
I had a fight with him.

451
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,880
He said the shadow hadn't been coming to him at all.

452
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,280
If the shadow is the same entity as the forest spirit

453
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,079
and we performed the ritual to ward it off,

454
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,559
it means the shadow hasn't

455
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:46,199
been able to come to Dan.

456
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,559
But at the time,

457
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,440
Dan's soul was inside his body.

458
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,000
But we don't know where his soul is right now.

459
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,199
Do you think it's going to work?

460
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,559
We won't know if we don't try.

461
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,280
Bring it on.

462
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:27,079
Nai, get the wheelchair.

463
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,760
What should I unplug first?

464
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,880
Let's lower the rails first.

465
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:04,760
Hang in there, Dan.

466
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,360
- Be gentle. - Mm.

467
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:19,199
Josh?

468
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:20,880
Did you accidentally hit something?

469
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,880
Are you crazy? I didn't hit anything.

470
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,960
Dan?

471
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,480
Dan?

472
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:30,800
He's not breathing.

473
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:32,679
Go and get a doctor!

474
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:34,159
Hurry!

475
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,280
Dan!

476
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,960
You have to be okay!

477
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,519
Dan!

478
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,360
Resurrecting a dead person is

479
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,239
a risky business.

480
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,679
If you call him and he can't hear you,

481
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,760
any lost souls or wandering spirits might

482
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,639
come to inhabit his place instead.

483
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:58,360
Please have mercy

484
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,920
and guide me to help him.

485
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,480
- Lord, please bring him back. - Nai?

486
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:04,719
Dan, listen to me!

487
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,400
- Nai, help me! - What you've encountered

488
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,639
isn't real.

489
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,079
It doesn't exist.

490
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:11,119
And it never did.
