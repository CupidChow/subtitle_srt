Hua, your mom

20
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:01,322
bought all of these today.

21
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,121
Thank you, mom.

22
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:04,922
I didn't eat well these two days.

23
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,322
Have some more.

24
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:10,681
They taste good, right?

25
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:16,481
Good as usual.

26
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:18,761
Hua,

27
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:21,761
I've been a little tense lately.

28
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:23,282
I admit that

29
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:24,761
I'm pushing you too hard.

30
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,201
You won't be mad at me, will you?

31
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:31,961
That's good.

32
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,082
I've talked with your dad.

33
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:37,642
About the girlfriend

34
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:38,841
that you brought home yesterday.

35
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:40,802
We think

36
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:41,601
she is fine.

37
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:49,681
Your girlfriend

38
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,362
might be a little different,

39
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:52,561
but what she said

40
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:53,681
made sense.

41
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:55,642
She's getting older.

42
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:58,722
Since you are in love with her,

43
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:00,522
we have to be responsible, right?

44
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,481
I have asked around.

45
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:04,722
The wedding

46
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,282
is now scheduled

47
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:07,561
half a year in advance.

48
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:09,002
Seriously,

49
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:11,401
you have to queue up for a wedding.

50
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:13,242
I'm thinking

51
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:14,722
we shouldn't follow the norm.

52
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:15,802
Such as

53
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,882
looking for the auspicious day.

54
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:20,401
Oh, right!

55
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:25,561
I have found a few hotels.

56
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:26,401
Take a look.

57
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,041
All of them

58
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,841
are available within three months.

59
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,401
Which do you prefer?

60
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:32,201
Mom, hold on.

61
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:32,841
Hold on a second.

62
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:36,722
You said the both of you

63
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,802
agree with me marrying Qin Shi?

64
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:41,282
I think

65
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:42,642
we should think it over again.

66
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:43,722
We agree!

67
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,961
Absolutely agree!

68
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:50,362
Ms. Qin

69
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:52,082
might not be

70
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:54,282
a perfect fit for our family,

71
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,882
but marriage is all about you two.

72
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:59,722
As long as you like each other,

73
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:02,121
then that's fine.

74
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:04,841
Mom, you're not

75
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:07,802
going to evaluate her any further?

76
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:13,561
Ever since you were young,

77
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:15,201
I've always told you

78
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:17,242
to be responsible for your life.

79
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,122
So,

80
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:19,242
this choice of yours,

81
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:20,601
I totally agree with it.

82
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:28,321
Although

83
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:29,761
marriage

84
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:31,962
is all about the two of you,

85
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:33,642
I do have

86
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:35,082
one condition.

87
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:39,802
Yes, it's only right to have conditions.

88
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:40,562
Go ahead.

89
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:41,562
The more the merrier.

90
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:46,562
My condition

91
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:48,242
is very simple.

92
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,642
Marriage

93
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:52,321
is a really big event.

94
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:54,601
We might not follow

95
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:56,201
the usual wedding norm,

96
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:57,562
but your feelings

97
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:59,001
have to be genuine.

98
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:01,122
It's easier to fall in love

99
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:03,201
than to get along with each other.

100
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:04,122
So,

101
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:05,881
you should seize every opportunity

102
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:07,321
to get along well.

103
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:09,161
If anything happens,

104
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:10,842
you can communicate

105
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:12,082
and solve it.

106
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,041
I'm very open-minded.

107
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:26,881
Just go ahead and do it!

108
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:43,761
Impressive.

109
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:45,321
It's really impressive!

110
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:47,962
She is asking you to live together

111
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:49,041
with the lady lawyer.

112
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:50,362
Honestly,

113
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:51,481
your mom

114
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,842
made a smart move!

115
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:54,242
What are you going to do?

116
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:56,082
Are you going to resist desperately

117
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:57,321
or surrender?

118
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,161
No way I'm going to surrender.

119
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,321
Then what?

120
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:04,441
Are you really going to live together?

121
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,041
I'm really curious.

122
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,562
You scolded her

123
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:10,082
so harshly the other day,

124
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:10,962
how are you

125
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:11,761
going to look for her again?

126
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:17,842
Why don't you

127
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:19,642
play pretend.

128
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,082
Maybe something will happen.

129
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:23,721
I didn't know

130
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,001
you like mature ladies.

131
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:26,682
Yang,

132
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:27,881
to be honest,

133
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,281
that lawyer is quite pretty.

134
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:35,041
What's that look?

135
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:37,481
That look of yours is telling me

136
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:38,522
I'm wrong.

137
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:41,522
Living together is impossible.

138
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,321
But I can pretend that

139
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,481
we're living together.

140
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:44,321
Great idea!

141
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:46,761
You're making it hard

142
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,161
for them to tell.

143
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:50,682
So, I'm planning to rent an apartment.

144
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:51,881
I second that.

145
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,642
You must have a house to live together.

146
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:56,321
You can help me to look for one.

147
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:57,441
I...

148
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:00,161
Why do I have to help you?

149
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:01,402
Because I'm broke.

150
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:02,082
Then...

151
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:05,962
Yang,

152
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,881
I have no problem in
helping you with that

153
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,441
but I think, you...

154
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:10,922
Yesterday, your wife

155
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:11,761
called me.

156
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:13,281
She said you bought a game console.

157
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,642
- It was me...
- Alright!

158
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:15,802
Stop it.

159
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:18,161
I'm such a good friend.

160
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,481
I'm willing to do anything
for my brother.

161
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:22,562
Don't worry about it.

162
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:23,962
After I've fully retrieved
the stock account,

163
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:25,201
I'll pay you back.

164
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:25,761
Keep it up!

165
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:27,842
What's your budget?

166
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:28,761
You decide.

167
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:43,562
Why do you have

168
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,041
the invitation from Xi Mei PR?

169
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,642
What's your intention

170
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:49,201
to approach Mr. Pang and Ms. Lan

171
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,041
in this charity gala?

172
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:51,802
(He is being cautious of me)

173
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:53,682
(getting close to Mr. Pang and Ms. Lan,)

174
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:55,481
(which means he too)

175
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:56,962
(was going after the two of them.)

176
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:58,281
(But it's not for the project of)

177
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,122
(the Association for
Women Entrepreneurs.)

178
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,041
(Could there be a bigger case?)

179
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,001
(What could it be?)

180
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:16,402
Shi, are you free this evening?

181
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,122
Come over to my house for dinner.

182
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:22,201
Why do I feel like

183
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,402
you are up to no good?

184
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:26,802
I miss you.

185
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:31,082
Okay.

186
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,660
(Yang Hua)

187
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:43,521
Hello.

188
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:44,682
Hello, Ms. Qin.

189
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:45,601
This is Yang Hua.

190
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:46,802
What is it?

191
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,841
Well, when are you free?

192
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:50,882
I need to take my luggage back.

193
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:52,081
Luggage...

194
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,202
Sorry, I'm too busy.

195
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:56,882
Look.

196
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:58,281
If you are not in a hurry,

197
00:08:58,601 --> 00:08:59,601
I will send it to you

198
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:00,442
after I get off work.

199
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:03,081
Okay, sorry for the trouble.

200
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:04,521
Hang on.

201
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:06,922
This morning you said that

202
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,481
something's wrong with Luowei Yulan.

203
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:09,841
What's the problem?

204
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,401
It's okay, don't feel burdened.

205
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,682
We are just having a small talk.

206
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,002
Do they have

207
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:17,242
any lawsuit recently?

208
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:18,721
I didn't pay attention to it.

209
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:19,682
But if you want to know

210
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:20,521
about this company,

211
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,882
I can teach you some tricks.

212
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,122
Do you have a laptop with you?

213
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,161
Just a moment.

214
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:26,653
Go to

215
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:27,798
the official website of Luowei Yulan.

216
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,122
There's a link at
the bottom left corner.

217
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:31,920
It's open.

218
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,562
(Rowe)
It's open.

219
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:32,650
(Rowe)

220
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,841
It looks fine.

221
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:36,002
They look just like

222
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:37,481
a parent company and a subsidiary.

223
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:38,530
The problem is that Rowe

224
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,721
(Rowedollars)
The problem is that Rowe

225
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:39,800
has no project
(Rowedollars)

226
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,442
has no project

227
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:41,802
with its branch

228
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:42,682
in China at all.

229
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:44,682
I have gone through

230
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:46,641
the website of Luowei Yulan before.

231
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:48,161
In terms of design,

232
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:49,682
company name,

233
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:51,401
or the news section,

234
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,442
they are hinting that

235
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:53,841
they're partnering with Rowe.

236
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:55,002
But they didn't make it clear

237
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,762
on their partnership with Rowe.

238
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:57,922
Which means that

239
00:09:58,122 --> 00:09:59,682
if Luowei Yulan's clients

240
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:01,161
know that these two companies

241
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:01,841
are not related,

242
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,161
then there will be no issue.

243
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:05,202
However if someone hid this on purpose,

244
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:06,161
or is misleading this,

245
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,322
then there will be an issue.

246
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:08,281
If investors

247
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:08,922
thought

248
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,161
the projects they have invested in

249
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:11,161
were managed by

250
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:11,882
an overseas company,

251
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:13,081
then this will become a big issue.

252
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:15,562
Do you think

253
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,242
Ms. Lan knows about this?

254
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:18,481
I don't know about this.

255
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:20,922
Yang Hua.

256
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:21,562
What exactly

257
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:22,721
did you do previously?

258
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:25,682
That's not important.

259
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:26,961
You should care for

260
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:27,882
Luowei Yulan.

261
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:28,961
I hope I'm just overthinking.

262
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,180
(Rowedollars)

263
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:55,322
Hi,

264
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:56,922
Qiao, this is Qin Shi.

265
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,401
Have we signed the contract

266
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,041
with the Association
for Women Entrepreneurs?

267
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:02,641
It's still in the process.

268
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,442
That means we haven't.

269
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:06,362
Can you do me a favour?

270
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:07,401
Please help me to delay it.

271
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:09,002
This is

272
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,122
not quite appropriate.

273
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,601
Qiao, I'm begging you.

274
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:13,961
You must help me with this.

275
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:14,641
Ms. Qin,

276
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,322
it's not that I don't want to help.

277
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:17,682
The thing is,

278
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:19,242
you have to give me a good reason.

279
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,802
I have a very good reason.

280
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,521
And you know me well.

281
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,762
I won't mess around

282
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:25,841
on such an important thing.

283
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:27,122
I won't screw you up,

284
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:27,762
okay?

285
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:28,922
Help me to delay for 24 hours.

286
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,002
Only 24 hours.

287
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:31,922
It's a deal. Thanks.

288
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:46,442
Wang.

289
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:48,802
Stop the approval process

290
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:49,882
for three hours.

291
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,041
Yes, Mr. Qiao.

292
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:55,362
Come in.

293
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,481
Ms. Qin, are you looking for me?

294
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:04,762
From now on,

295
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:06,242
put down everything on hand

296
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,841
and fully investigate

297
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:10,762
Luowei Yulan with me.

298
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:12,041
Roger that.

Luowei Foundation

302
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:44,122
was founded in 2016.

303
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,922
They have a few investors.

are in an investor relationship.

Found it.

309
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:09,802
Where's Mr. Qiao?

310
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,682
Mr. Qiao went to the legal office.

311
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:14,202
Has Mr. Qiao been here?

312
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:14,961
He just left.

I've got the contract.

315
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,322
I will get the chairman to sign it now.

316
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:39,041
Ms. Li.

317

Ms. Tang.

319

Can you see what's wrong?

320
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:18,481
These corporate groups,

321
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,242
subsidiaries and branches

322
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,762
are quite normal.

323
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:22,841
I don't see any problem.

324
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:26,961
No problem.

325
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,521
Ms. Qin, I need to answer a call.

326
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:42,322
Where is the problem?

327
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:53,481
Hello.

328
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:56,562
Wait for a while, I'm at the firm.

329
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,161
I can't

330
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:01,322
eat with you today.

331
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,362
My boss is asking me

332
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:03,641
to do a background check with her.

333
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,922
You told me your boss has

334
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,401
personality problems two days ago.

335
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,081
And now you work so hard for her.

336
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:12,721
Stop teasing me.

337
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,521
I'm just whining to you.

338
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,161
She's actually quite nice.

339
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:20,922
You said it yourself.

340
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:23,401
You always complain that I'm busy,
no time for you.

341
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:24,841
Now you are busy,

342
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,841
you have no time for me.

343
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:28,242
You've stood me up so many times.

344
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:29,481
Now, it's my turn.

345
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:30,562
That's only fair.

346
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:32,122
Alright.

347
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:33,322
Go home early today.

348
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:34,721
I will be busy for a while.

349
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:36,122
I'll call you after I'm done.

350
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:37,362
Feifei.

351
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:44,601
What's with the hem and haw?

352
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,041
There's nothing we can't say.

353
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:49,481
Nothing.

354
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:51,242
Work hard.

355
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:52,442
I'll buy you something to eat.

356
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:54,401
Okay.

357
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:55,362
Bye bye.

358
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,481
Okay, bye.

359
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:24,002
Ms. Qin.

360
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:25,322
Would you like to order takeaway?

361
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,601
It's almost eight o'clock.

362
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,601
It's already eight?

363
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:31,802
Almost.

364
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,362
I'm doomed!

365
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:34,521
It's over.

366
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:35,721
What's wrong, Ms. Qin.

367
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:36,922
Something has come up.

368
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:37,481
I need to go.

369
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,442
After

370
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:39,362
I left,

371
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:40,041
you should

372
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:40,802
tidy all these up.

373
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:41,762
Don't let others see them.

374
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:42,922
Okay, no problem.

375
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:43,641
I'm leaving.

376
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:47,682
- Please be safe.
- Keep them properly.

377
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:48,721
I will keep them properly.

378
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,881
We said to have dinner together.

379
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:08,001
It's already eight thirty

380
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:09,322
and she's not here yet.

381
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:11,082
Then,

382
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:13,161
should we wait for her?

383
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,442
I'm not hungry. I can wait for a while.

384
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,121
You can have some first
if you're hungry.

385
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:19,922
Don't starve yourself.

386
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:21,281
Oh, right.

387
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:22,802
I have made you some soup.

388
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:24,562
For you only.

389
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,962
I've added cordyceps in it,
very nutritious.

390
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:31,521
Here.

391
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:34,482
Be careful.

392
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:37,442
I'll open it.

393
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:40,442
It's hot.

394
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,161
Drink before anyone gets here.

395
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:49,761
I'll go get it. Stay here.

396
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:58,562
Shi, come...

397
00:17:58,562 --> 00:17:59,202
Don't talk.

398
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:00,121
I'm starving to death.

399
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:01,602
Hurry, let's eat.

400
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:03,842
Here, give it to me.

401
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:06,401
I'm famished.

402
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:07,962
I invited you for dinner,

403
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,802
not supper.

404
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,041
Take it slowly.

405
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:14,041
Delicious!

406
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,202
Did Wenyu come with you?

407
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:18,641
Look at you, like you've been

408
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:19,842
starved for a few days.

409
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:22,962
Here, here.

410
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:23,802
That's right.

411
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,041
The food is cold, warm it up for her.

412
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:26,802
No need for that.

413
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:27,761
I'm done.

414
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:32,082
Okay.

415
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:33,682
Shi.

416
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:35,241
I

417
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,442
visited dad today.

418
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:37,281
Let's talk after dinner.

419
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:38,322
I don't want to ruin the mood.

420
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:40,802
Okay. Okay.

421
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:41,682
Talk after dinner.

422
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:46,881
I'll do it.

423
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:47,401
Stay still.

424
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,322
It's so tasty.

425
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:49,161
Coming.

426
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,281
Wenyu, what's wrong

427
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,121
with your head?

428
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:55,641
Stop talking, I'm starving!

429
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:56,922
Hurry up and eat.

430
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,001
Don't stop there, hurry and eat.

431
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,121
I have some here too.

432
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,082
Eat up.

433
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:39,241
Are you all full?

434
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:41,361
Here, have some fruits.

435
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,761
The fruits are very fresh today.

436
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:48,401
Oh, this is your brother's.

437
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,761
This is for the both of you.

438
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:50,482
Have some.

439
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:51,322
Freshen up.

440
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:52,241
You should go to bed first.

441
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:53,001
We have something to talk about.

442
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,322
Alright, you guys go ahead.

443
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:56,722
Thank you for the food.

444
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:57,922
It's fine.

445
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,602
The purpose of me asking you

446
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,041
to come here is about

447
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:06,602
dad's 70th birthday celebration.

448
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:07,802
I've been thinking...

449
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:08,922
I'm going to divorce with Meimei.

450
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:09,802
It's final.

451
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:14,682
Good job!

452
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,562
How dare you bring this up?

453
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,161
What's wrong with it?

454
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:20,562
Qin Shi,

455
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:21,641
you better stop being a shit-stirrer

456
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:22,602
in other's business.

457
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,281
If I'm a stirrer, then what are you?

458
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:25,361
Shit?

459
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:31,442
How can you bring this up when
you were guilty of infidelity!

460
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:33,722
You tell dad about this.

461
00:20:33,722 --> 00:20:34,482
Don't talk about it here.

462
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:35,761
You will say, "Dad, I'm divorcing".

463
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,682
Look, she's really good
at making up stories.

464
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:39,521
Which eye of yours

465
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:40,881
saw me cheating?

466
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:42,361
I feel really glad for that man

467
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:43,842
who wanted to marry you.

468
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:45,281
It's lucky that you guys broke up!

469
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:46,722
A woman like you who is always

470
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:48,161
thinking of breaking up
other people's families,

471
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:49,361
you really deserve to be single forever!

472
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:50,682
Nonsense!

473
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:52,922
She's your younger sister!

474
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,881
Younger sister?

475
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:55,482
Does she see me as her brother?

476
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:56,121
Look at yourself,

477
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,562
do you look like a brother?

478
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:59,041
What did you say?

479
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,442
Stop telling to him.

480
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:01,761
Go and tell dad yourself.

481
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:02,682
Go now!

482
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:03,682
Right now, at once!

483
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,722
I will. I will tell him.

484
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:07,161
What's the problem?

485
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:08,241
It's not like
I haven't been beaten before.

486
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:09,682
I've been beaten up since I was young!

487
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:12,082
But dad is older now.

488
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:13,281
What if something happens to him

489
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:14,401
when he beats me up...

490
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,361
You're not a filial child, but I am.

491
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,241
Didn't you like to tell on people?

492
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:20,322
Tell him if you want!

493
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:22,722
You wish

494
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:24,361
I'll help you to tell him right?

495
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:26,041
Tell him if you can.

496
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:28,761
Brother, see that?

497
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,482
He is forcing me to irritate dad!

498
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,401
How can I go on with this?

499
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:33,761
That's right, look at my head.

500
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:34,682
Look at it!

501
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:35,202
Ms, Qin,

502
00:21:35,202 --> 00:21:36,322
see if this counts as domestic violence!

503
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:37,322
Does it?

504
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:39,241
If visible, it's called a bruise.

505
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:40,521
If it is not,
then it's called a fatal wound.

506
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,521
Those words that you said to Meimei

507
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,521
are all deadly.

508
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,082
People like you,

509
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:48,001
are you not shameful about your wound?

510
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:48,482
Painful?

511
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:49,761
You deserve it!

512
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:51,121
A person like you...

513
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:53,001
No one else on earth other than Meimei

514
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:54,202
could stand you.

515
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:56,041
You better not divorce.

516
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,682
I'm helping you, do you get it?

517
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:58,842
Thank me, hurry.

518
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,722
Thank you so much!

519
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:02,121
I don't need that, thank you!

520
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,281
Enough.

521
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,562
Cut it out.

522
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:06,161
The reason I asked you

523
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:07,281
to come here is about

524
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:09,001
dad's 70th birthday celebration.

525
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:12,842
It looks like

526
00:22:13,322 --> 00:22:14,922
I have to remind you again

527
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:16,161
our family rules.

528
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,842
Our family

529
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:20,562
is indeed more complicated

530
00:22:20,562 --> 00:22:21,442
than other families.

531
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:24,041
But we are all from the Qin Family.

532
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:25,281
We all have

533
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:26,241
the same father.

534
00:22:27,442 --> 00:22:29,281
We are a family.

535
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,241
What do we do

536
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:32,482
as a family?

537
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:34,281
Unite and love.

538
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:39,442
What if conflict happens?

539
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:40,641
Then, it has to be his fault.

540
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:41,761
Shi.

541
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,401
You can reason

542
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:49,202
or argue with him,

543
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,442
but you can't hurt
each other's feelings.

544
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:52,922
But he hurts other people's feelings.

545
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:54,322
So, it's your fault!

546
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:55,082
Hurt?

547
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:55,962
Who's hurting?

548
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:58,780
- Who's hurting?
- Alright. Stop it you two.

549
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,562
Shi, I'll apologise to Meimei

550
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:04,521
on behalf of Wenyu.

551
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:05,482
Brother!

552
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:07,562
The elder brother is like a father.

553
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:08,881
If you make a mistake,

554
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:09,881
then it's my fault.

555
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:12,121
About this matter,

556
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:13,562
let's stop it right here.

557
00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:14,682
Okay?

558
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,922
Wenyu.

559
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:19,241
Let me remind you of this.

560
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:20,602
A person

561
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:21,922
has only one

562
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:22,922
70th birthday in his life.

563
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,241
I don't care how bad

564
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:26,401
was your relationship with Meimei.

565
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:27,802
We have to prioritise

566
00:23:27,802 --> 00:23:29,202
dad's 70th birthday.

567
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,241
We'll push back

568
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:32,322
everything else.

569
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:34,401
What about my wound? I'm hurt.

570
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:35,361
I don't see anything!

571
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:42,842
Serves you right.

572
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:51,202
Uncle!

573
00:23:51,202 --> 00:23:52,121
Walk slowly.

574
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:55,562
Sorry to keep you waiting.

575
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,241
I'm going to leave if you don't come.

576
00:23:57,442 --> 00:23:58,361
Off you go.

577
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,121
Where's sushi?

578
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:00,722
I didn't bring it.

579
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,001
I don't believe you.

580
00:24:02,562 --> 00:24:03,521
Didn't you bail on me?

581
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:04,521
I'll do the same too.

582
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:07,241
Stop messing around.

583
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:08,562
I have to go back to work

584
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:10,562
after having dinner with you.

585
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:12,401
For a legal assistant like us,

586
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:13,682
time and money

587
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,361
are all in the hands of our boss.

588
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:18,161
Why are you so diligent right now?

589
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:19,082
Of course!

590
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:19,881
Get in, have some food.

591
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:29,842
How is it?

592
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:31,041
Not bad.

593
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:31,842
It's all your favourite.

594
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:35,241
Didn't you say

595
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,722
only those who are inefficient

596
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,281
and bootlicker will work over time?

597
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,202
When did you become

598
00:24:39,202 --> 00:24:40,041
a bootlicker?

599
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,361
You are a bootlicker!

600
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:44,082
If a legal assistant

601
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,001
doesn't work

602
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,482
when others are not,

603
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:49,082
when will we be successful?

604
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:52,322
Eat slowly.

605
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,562
You have worked really hard.

606
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:54,802
A scholar who has been away three days

607
00:24:54,802 --> 00:24:55,802
must be looked at with new eyes.

608
00:24:56,442 --> 00:24:57,401
I don't have many choices.

609
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:58,842
Everyone works so hard.

610
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:01,562
Cheng & Hui achieved
the top five in the industry

611
00:25:01,562 --> 00:25:02,641
for a reason.

612
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:05,401
I have many juniors in Cheng & Hui.

613
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:07,482
Should I talk to them

614
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:08,322
to take good care of you?

615
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:09,922
Oh,

616
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:12,962
do you know Qin Shi?

617
00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:14,241
It seems like she's from Hua Zheng.

618
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:15,962
She is now my boss,

619
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:17,361
and also the lead attortney
in family department.

620
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:29,602
I think

621
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:31,401
she's a junior a few years after me.

622
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:32,722
You really know her?

623
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:34,922
You have no idea

624
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:37,082
how bad her temper was.

625
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:38,962
We were always bad-mouthing her
behind her back.

626
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:40,082
What did you guys say?

627
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:41,881
A dictator.

628
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:42,641
Autocratic.

629
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,361
Stubborn.

630
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:45,001
Achieve her goals by all means.

631
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:47,442
She also has a nickname, Stapler.

632
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:49,322
Stapler? What does it mean?

633
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:51,041
You don't know what a stapler means?

634
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:52,962
Once she

635
00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:54,602
gets a bite on a case,

636
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:55,641
she'll chew out two holes with one bite

637
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:56,682
and three holes with two bites.

638
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:00,161
The stapler.

639
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,001
It was a nicer nickname

640
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,121
than what she had in university.

641
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:04,482
What was she called that time?

642
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:06,761
The riot dog.

643
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,482
Everyone, the mock trial
is this Saturday.

644
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,401
Please be serious on your revision.

645
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:22,922
Don't be caught by me.

646
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:23,922
If I can smell

647
00:26:23,922 --> 00:26:25,401
a faint hint of loopholes,

648
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:26,521
I won't let you off.

649
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:27,562
Do your revision.

650
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:31,442
Not mock trial again!

651
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:34,641
Riot dog, it's really unpleasant!

652
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:36,761
Stapler sounds better.

653
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:39,881
Right.

654
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:40,842
Do you know

655
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:42,241
what she likes?

656
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:43,322
Or dislike?

657
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,842
I'm not a bootlicker.

658
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,322
I just want to know her better

659
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:52,602
to avoid making mistakes.

660
00:26:55,562 --> 00:26:57,001
I'm not close with her.

661
00:26:57,202 --> 00:26:57,962
So, I don't know her well.

662
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:36,161
I feel really glad for that man

663
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,722
who wanted to marry you.

664
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,401
It's lucky that you guys broke up!

665
00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:40,521
A woman like you who is always

666
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:41,962
thinking of breaking up
other people's families,

667
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,442
you really deserve to
be single forever!

668
00:27:48,761 --> 00:27:49,641
Qin Wenyu,

669
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:51,641
if all men on earth

670
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:52,761
are like you,

671
00:27:52,842 --> 00:27:54,161
I'd rather be single forever!

672
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,442
Hello, how can I help you?

673
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:12,761
Hello. Hi, Ms. Qin.

674
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:13,802
How long are you going to be here?

675
00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:15,802
How long?

676
00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:19,881
Your luggage!

677
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:26,842
Don't tell me you forgot about it.

678
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,241
No, I didn't.

679
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:29,202
I didn't.

680
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:31,322
No. No.

681
00:28:31,322 --> 00:28:33,482
I still have

682
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:34,121
something to do.

683
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:35,602
Can you come over and get it yourself?

684
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:38,161
Okay.

685
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:39,881
Should I go to your firm or...

686
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:41,082
No.

687
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,161
Come to my house.

688
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:43,962
I will send you the address.

689
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:45,202
See you later.

690
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:52,521
It's your fault, Qin Wenyu!

691
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:16,041
Good evening.

692
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:21,082
Come on in.

693
00:29:21,442 --> 00:29:22,401
It's quite late now,

694
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:23,881
I'll leave once I get my luggage.

695
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,241
Your luggage is still in the car.

696
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:29,602
I didn't carry it up.

697
00:29:29,682 --> 00:29:31,241
If you're not in a hurry,

698
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:33,202
you can come in and have a drink.

699
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:44,562
I'm sorry.

700
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:46,202
I don't have slippers at home.

701
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:49,761
Your foot...

702
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:52,761
It's fine, I knocked on it just now.

703
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:53,922
I have treated it.

704
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:55,802
Come in.

705
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:58,521
I don't have many guests,

706
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:00,001
so I didn't really tidy up the place.

707
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:01,881
Well, what do you want to drink?

708
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:03,761
Coffee or...

709
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:04,881
Water is fine.

710
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:06,241
Water.

711
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:07,722
Over here.

712
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,082
Excuse me.

713
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:12,281
Have a seat.

714
00:30:19,682 --> 00:30:21,322
You are looking at documents
of Luowei Yulan.

715
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,161
It's because of these documents,

716
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:25,641
I didn't deliver your luggage.

717
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:27,361
My bad.

718
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:27,922
Thank you.

719
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:37,322
When you were in university,

720
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:38,401
were you majoring in Finance?

721
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:40,482
Securities in finance.

722
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:43,641
Well, could you read
financial statements?

723
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,761
Annual report, equity statement,
and investment instruction?

724
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:47,562
I can read.

725
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:50,562
Yang Hua.

726
00:30:50,802 --> 00:30:52,322
I may need your help.

727
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,241
I have

728
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,082
search through all the documents

729
00:30:56,082 --> 00:30:57,202
that are related to Luowei Yulan.

730
00:30:57,842 --> 00:30:58,482
I couldn't identify

731
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,281
any problem.

732
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:00,761
But my instinct is telling me

733
00:31:01,322 --> 00:31:03,202
the problem should lie

734
00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:04,202
in these documents

735
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:05,241
that I couldn't understand.

736
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:06,602
Our firm is going to sign a contract

737
00:31:06,602 --> 00:31:08,322
with Association
for Women Entrepreneurs.

738
00:31:08,922 --> 00:31:10,161
If there's a problem with Luowei Yulan,

739
00:31:10,322 --> 00:31:11,722
there must be something wrong
with Ms. Lan.

740
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:13,241
Thus, we cannot sign this contract.

741
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:15,161
But I can't turn down

742
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:17,361
such a big client

743
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:19,121
just with my instinct!

744
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:21,922
Could you take a look for me?

745
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:28,722
When do you need it?

746
00:31:28,962 --> 00:31:30,041
Tomorrow before work.

747
00:31:34,682 --> 00:31:36,722
You...

748
00:31:36,922 --> 00:31:37,602
As quick as you can.

749
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,761
It's ten o'clock now,

750
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,562
we have time until tomorrow before work.

751
00:31:44,962 --> 00:31:45,922
This should do.

752
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:46,641
Really?

753
00:31:46,802 --> 00:31:48,082
As long as there's no one
causing trouble.

754
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:55,482
What?

755
00:32:00,322 --> 00:32:01,361
Any terms?

756
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:04,521
No.

757
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:09,562
From what I know about you

758
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,761
for not a very long time,

759
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:13,322
I don't think

760
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,641
you're someone so helpful.

761
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:17,761
There must be something
you want from me.

762
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:19,562
I don't.

763
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,202
Yes, you do.

764
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,241
I don't.

765
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:21,842
You do.

766
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:22,602
I really don't.

767
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:23,401
You do.

768
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:24,322
I do.

769
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:29,521
Well, look.

770
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:30,361
I will help you with these
documents first,

771
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:31,482
then,

772
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,202
we will talk about me.

773
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,761
See if you could help me, okay?

774
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:36,881
You think I'll go back on my words?

775
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:38,281
I know you won't.

776
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:58,001
You can rest now.

777
00:32:59,121 --> 00:32:59,562
Okay.

778
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,361
I'll stay with you.

779
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:07,922
(I need to keep an eye on you.)

780
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:08,802
(If you can't do it,)

781
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:11,281
(I still have time to change my plans.)

782
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,202
Up to you. Do you have coffee?

783
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,121
What brand do you want?

784
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:18,682
Anything. The richer the better.

785
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:20,041

Should I wake her up?

809
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:07,219
Ms. Qin.

810
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,470
Wake up.

811
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:13,801
Ms. Qin.

812
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,722
(Since my mother bet)

813
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:21,641
(I won't really be with Qin Shi,)

814
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,661
(I should take a photo as proof.)

815
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,859
(This should be the best revenge.)

816
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,531
(Oh my, Yang Hua.)

817
00:36:29,002 --> 00:36:30,962
(You really are a genius!)

818
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:48,287
Don't move.

819
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:56,373
Ms. Qin,

820
00:36:56,603 --> 00:36:58,282
listen to me.

821
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:10,134
I actually just want to snap a photo

822
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,202
to show my mother.

823
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:14,601
Why?

824
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:16,282
She still hasn't been defeated

825
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:17,401
from my visit last time?

826
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:21,282
Seems like it's not good enough.

827
00:37:24,282 --> 00:37:25,242
About your term last night,

828
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:26,202
is this it?

829
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,744
What is lacking?

830
00:37:32,202 --> 00:37:33,121
I'll give her what she wants.

831
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,762
It seems like your mother
knows you well.

832
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:41,762
Your estimation of your opponent

833
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:43,081
is about the same as mine.

834
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:43,922
Why?

835
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,776
Are you going to withdraw

836
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:47,002
or continue to fight?

837
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:49,242
There's no turning back.

838
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:49,841
Alright.

839
00:37:50,722 --> 00:37:51,361
Tell me

840
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:52,442
about your plan B.

841
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:53,881
What plan B?

842
00:37:54,682 --> 00:37:55,881
You said it yourself last time.

843
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,561
There are two plans for anything.

844
00:37:59,442 --> 00:38:00,801
I still need some time

845
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:02,002
to think it over, thoroughly.

846
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:03,361
My mother...

847
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:05,561
I have an idea.

848
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:06,442
Do you want to know?

849
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:07,561
What is it?

850
00:38:12,242 --> 00:38:12,962
Give me your phone.

851
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:20,601
Mom,

852
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:22,722
we think you were right.

853
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,282
We totally agree with you.

854
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:25,282
Don't worry.

855
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:26,722
We will be happy.

856
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:27,482
Yang Hua will

857
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:28,361
take very good care of me.

858
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:29,002
Right?

859
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:35,682
Bye bye, mom. Love you!

860
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:38,601
Problem solved.

861
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:40,257
Send this to her.

862
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:41,391
This should be a good enough.

863
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:46,002
What if it is still not enough?

864
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:48,661
Then, we have to go all in.

865
00:38:48,852 --> 00:38:50,251
You should move in today.

866
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:53,561
Really move in here?

867
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:56,722
A good move has to be
difficult to ascertain.

868
00:38:56,922 --> 00:38:57,841
One tiny video

869
00:38:57,841 --> 00:38:59,361
can't really be the big move.

870
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,282
What if she's here to check on us?

871
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:02,202
Your mother is someone who

872
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:03,962
will not stop until she
reaches her goal.

873
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,321
She won't give up

874
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:06,401
until she sees us living together.

875
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:09,121
You're right, well...

876
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:11,561
Will it be

877
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:13,321
inconvenient for you?

878
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,121
Follow me.

879
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:27,962
This is my study room.

880
00:39:29,194 --> 00:39:29,881
I only come in here

881
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:31,121
not even twice a month.

882
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:34,881
You can sleep there.

883
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,401
Actually, this house

884
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:39,881
is just a place for me to sleep.

885
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:41,401
There's usually no one in the house.

886
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:42,442
Chances of us seeing each other

887
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:43,202
should be rare.

888
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:46,081
I'll pay you the rent

889
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:47,242
based on the market price.

890
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:48,036
You don't have to.

891
00:39:48,321 --> 00:39:49,697
I'm guessing no less than two months

892
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:50,852
of you staying here,

893
00:39:51,227 --> 00:39:52,361
your mother will break down.

894
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:53,881
That won't do. That's a different thing.

895
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:55,002
I still need to pay you.

896
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:56,615
You really shouldn't have.

897
00:39:57,522 --> 00:39:59,121
You stayed up all night to help me,

898
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:00,881
I don't know how to thank you.

899
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:02,682
What you've got?

900
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,522
I've tried my best to simplify my words

901
00:40:05,522 --> 00:40:06,482
to explain it to you.

902
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:07,682
If you have any problem,

903
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:08,641
ask me after.

904
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:13,002
You've got so much after one night?

905
00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:13,941
Yup.

906
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:16,178
Are you sure all these

907
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:17,042
are true?

908
00:40:17,522 --> 00:40:18,361
I'm never wrong

909
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:19,161
in money and numbers.

910
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:20,482
Thank you.

911
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:27,962
I'm going to work.

912
00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:30,244
The password is 000725.

913
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:31,121
You can use anything

914
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:32,042
in this house.

915
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:32,801
For the sake of

916
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:33,762
the report that you gave me,

917
00:40:33,762 --> 00:40:34,361
you can live here

918
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:35,682
as long as forever.

919
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,242
I...

920
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:38,361
I'm going off.

921
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,171
Bye!

922
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,242
I wouldn't stay too long.

923
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:19,183
Dear.

924
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:20,416
What is it?

925
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:23,042
Our son!

926
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,019
Our son?

927
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:25,801
Our son!

928
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:26,442
What's wrong with him?

929
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,121
Look at this.

930
00:41:27,522 --> 00:41:28,682
He really is living together

931
00:41:28,682 --> 00:41:30,722
with that woman, look!

932
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:31,641
Let me see.

933
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:34,161
Mom,

934
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:36,282
we think you were right.

935
00:41:36,282 --> 00:41:38,081
We totally agree with you.

936
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:38,722
Don't worry.

937
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:39,801
We will be happy.

938
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:42,361
Isn't this good?

939
00:41:58,762 --> 00:42:00,442
How many faces does she have?

940
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:34,290
God of Wealth.

941
00:43:34,735 --> 00:43:35,576
Isn't the air of freedom

942
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:36,841
sweet?

943
00:43:40,682 --> 00:43:41,801
