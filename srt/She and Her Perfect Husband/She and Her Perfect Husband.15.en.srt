19
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:57,461
There's one more thing that

20
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:58,500
you must pay attention to.

21
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,900
If condition permits,

22
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:01,061
you need to meet

23
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:01,940
all the factory shareholders.

24
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,701
There are economic disputes between

25
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:04,981
the major and small shareholders.

26
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,781
This will cause a lot of
unnecessary trouble

27
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,100
in your take over.

28
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,100
For the biggest decision maker,

29
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:10,941
if possible,

30
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,421
it's better to meet their family too.

31
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,620
(Zhou)

32
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,620
Let me teach you one last trick.

33
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:35,301
After today,

34
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,581
go to the factory one of the nights.

35
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,660
Go there secretly on your own.

36
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,701
Don't tell anyone.

37
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:41,180
(Why?)

38
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:42,781
There will probably be a result

39
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,781
when you're there.

40
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,860
(Miss Qin)

41
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:51,020
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

42
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:52,380
Hello.

43
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:53,740
(Yang Hua.)

44
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,740
(I have a question.)

45
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,221
If there is one thing where

46
00:02:58,421 --> 00:02:59,781
doing it doesn't benefit you

47
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,380
but can help the others,

48
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,581
(not doing it doesn't do you any harm,)

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,540
(but for the others it's a catastrophe.)

50
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:06,341
How would you choose?

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,701
Are you listening?

52
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,100
Yes.

53
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,620
But I think

54
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,221
I can't give you an answer.

55
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,900
(One's fate is never decided by an outsider.)

56
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,941
(It stems from one's own choice.)

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,380
You are a lawyer,

58
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:30,380
you should know this better than me.

59
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:32,620
Although, you're asking me a question,

60
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,981
but I think

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,781
you already have the answer.

62
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
All you wanted is just my encouragement,

63
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,141
am I right?

64
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,020
But,

65
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,341
this choice of mine, is it right?

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,260
Qin Shi,

67
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:49,861
you once told me,

68
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,421
you are a good lawyer.

69
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:55,020
What choice will a good lawyer make?

70
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,141
I understand now.

71
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,301
Thank you.

72
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,260
(Yang Hua.)

73
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:04,820
Yes.

74
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:10,380
I have a favor to ask.

75
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:38,660
What are you doing here?

76
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:40,581
Looks like

77
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,220
you have already known Cheng & Hui

78
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,741
has changed their attorney.

79
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,981
I must say,

80
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:47,701
you lots of lawyers

81
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:48,820
have been testing

82
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:50,380
my bottom line many times.

83
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,021
One moment you say it's wrong,

84
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:53,741
the next moment, you say it's right.

85
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,701
Since you already knew,

86
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,141
I'll cut to the chase.

87
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:02,940
Cheng & Hui gave up on Ms. Lan,

88
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,260
but I didn't.

89
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,621
So I am here today

90
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:06,901
not to represent Cheng & Hui,

91
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,461
but myself.

92
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,621
I want to be Ms. Lan's attorney

93
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,220
in my own name.

94
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:13,940
I won't charge any attorney fee.

95
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:22,461
Can I go in now?

96
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:28,181
The lawyers at Cheng & Hui

97
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,901
are indeed unique.

98
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,581
All of you are unpredictable.

99
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:33,621
Ms. Qin,

100
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,060
you did not disappoint me.

101
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,100
You came just in time.

102
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,701
Ms. Li has just told us about

103
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:39,940
the situation.

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,741
Ms. Li, why are you here?

105
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,660
I should be the one asking you this.

106
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:46,141
Ms. Li was here

107
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,581
30 minutes before you.

108
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:48,621
She told me

109
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,540
exactly the same thing you just said.

110
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,901
Great minds think alike.

111
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:56,461
Now I have a question

112
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:57,340
for the both of you.

113
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:00,021
Everyone has given up

114
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:01,220
on this case.

115
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,940
Why do you still want to represent

116
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,820
and even not charging?

117
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:11,260
Who should answer? You or me?

118
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,660
Go ahead.

119
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,301
Then I will continue

120
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,500
from where I left off.

121
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,301
This case,

122
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:19,741
judging from the current situation,

123
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,581
if you want to reverse the situation,

124
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,861
to be honest, it's difficult.

125
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,820
But it's not completely impossible.

126
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,741
I think 99%

127
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:29,060
of the lawyers who take this case

128
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
will definitely persuade you to give up

129
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,820
and declare bankruptcy.

130
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:33,940
Only 1% will not give up,

131
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,060
and those are lawyers like us.

132
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,820
We cannot stand seeing

133
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,220
the weak being treated unfairly.

134
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,421
Ms. Qin,

135
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,461
am I right?

136
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,100
Not for me.

137
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,340
I am different from you, Ms. Li.

138
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,660
I'm not here to uphold justice.

139
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,581
I just think

140
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,500
this case is very difficult and challenging.

141
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,181
To me, this case,

142
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,141
it will either make you famous

143
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,220
or crush you completely.

144
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,660
I personally don't accept the latter.

145
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:09,301
I also believe in your sincerity.

146
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,901
Now I want to know

147
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,060
your specific plan.

148
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,581
You are telling me to

149
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,540
withdraw the lawsuit and not divorce?

150
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,141
It's not to not get a divorce,

151
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,981
but to not get a divorce at the moment.

152
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,260
Why?

153
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,861
Didn't you say before only by divorcing

154
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,741
she can keep most of the property?

155
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:35,021
Before, we thought

156
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,301
Luowei Yulan's debt

157
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,940
has nothing to do with Ms. Lan.

158
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:39,741
But actually,

159
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,220
Ms. Lan is Luowei Yulan's

160
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,861
fund guarantor,

161
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,260
so even if you get a divorce,

162
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:45,060
you'll still have to pay

163
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,060
one billion.

164
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,421
We still have one other solution.

165
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:51,340
In order to ensure

166
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,820
the possibility of such a solution,

167
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,581
I've also consulted an expert.

168
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:56,421
Ms. Lan, do you want to listen to

169
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:57,780
- what he has to say?
- Sure.

170
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,220
Please wait a moment.

171
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:11,820
Yang Hua, you can start talking now.

172
00:08:13,181 --> 00:08:14,421
(To solve the debt problem,)

173
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:15,660
(currently there are two ways.)

174
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:17,340
(One, the sale of assets.)

175
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,421
(Ms. Lan, half of your Yulan Group shares,)

176
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,981
are tradable shares,

177
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,540
but the market for the tradable item,

178
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:23,701
compared to your debt,

179
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:24,861
it's just a drop in the ocean.

180
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:27,301
So if you want to repay the loan,

181
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,621
you can only sell what you have

182
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,301
and most of the non-tradable shares.

183
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,340
Currently,

184
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:35,981
within the board members,

185
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,821
your elder brother is the only one

186
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,501
qualify to absorb these shares.

187
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:42,660
But I know, you had

188
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:43,821
(some arguments with him.)

189
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,061
You should know very well now

190
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:47,340
if he can help you.

191
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,621
I guess this uncle of mine

192
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,061
will be laughing in his dream.

193
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
What about the second way?

194
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,501
(I took a look just now and)

195
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:07,140
(Ms. Lan, apart from the shares,)

196
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:08,100
(there are two more companies.)

197
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:08,981
The business of these two companies

198
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,381
is very good.

199
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,140
Although you've mortgaged it,

200
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,020
but in general,

201
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:14,181
under normal operation,

202
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,460
there will be no debts.

203
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,821
The purpose of those creditors

204
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:18,580
are not to ruin your business.

205
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,421
All they want is just to get their own money.

206
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,501
If they agree for you
to continue operating,

207
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,621
it will be just a matter of time

208
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,100
before you can pay back the money.

209
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,861
So, from your experience,

210
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,261
how long will it take

211
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:30,061
to pay off the debt?

212
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,540
For Yulan Group and several other companies,

213
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,421
according to current
operating conditions,

214
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:36,700
a conservative estimate,

215
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,140
about three years.

216
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:39,621
(So,)

217
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,821
(provided they agree that)

218
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,821
(you may continue to operate.)

219
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:44,061
Okay, thank you.

220
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:44,660
I understand.

221
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,100
So this is your solution?

222
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,621
I disagree.

223
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:53,261
I don't care if we

224
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:54,421
had to bear the debt

225
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,421
where my aunt was a guarantor.

226
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,421
But why do we even have to bear

227
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,941
those nonsensical debts?

228
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:00,741
This is not fair.

229
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,020
Yes, it's not fair,

230
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,501
but this is the reality.

231
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,460
Ms. Qin's husband has already said,

232
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,540
even if we want to do this,

233
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:12,381
it is still subject to the
consent of the creditor.

234
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:15,660
Yesterday,

235
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,981
I met Mr. Tao Junhui.

236
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,220
What did he want from you?

237
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,621
Mr. Tao gave us a suggestion.

238
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,660
Because now everyone already knew

239
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:27,100
Mr. Pang Dingfang fled overseas,

240
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,301
the hope of getting repayment

241
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,220
fell onto you, Ms. Lan.

242
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:35,020
So if you have an encouraging
debt repayment plan,

243
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,301
they can guarantee

244
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,220
normal operation of the businesses under you.

245
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:41,340
Yes,

246
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:43,981
this is the only way out.

247
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,340
If the creditors know Ms. Lan

248
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,181
has the tendency of avoiding the debt,

249
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:50,861
they'll definitely

250
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,301
not go soft on you and fight till the end.

251
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,861
If it goes to the judicial process,

252
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,261
then all your companies

253
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
will be gone.

254
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:04,220
Including the shares of Yulan Group.

255
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,460
You are too simple-minded.

256
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:09,020
Other things aside,

257
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,981
we don't even know yet

258
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,061
who will get Yulan Group

259
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:12,981
after Pang Dingfang leaves.

260
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,340
Yes,

261
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,421
my aunt owns the majority shares,

262
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,261
but the board of directors

263
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:19,381
will never let my aunt

264
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,821
be in-charged of Yulan Group.

265
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:23,140
They will definitely put my uncle in power.

266
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:24,780
If that's the case,

267
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,741
it's impossible for you

268
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,580
to use Yulan Group

269
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,821
to save Luowei Yulan.

270
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:31,540
- Why?
-Why?

271
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,421
Because they don't think

272
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,140
I can manage a business well.

273
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,220
In their eyes,

274
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:40,061
I'm just a woman with a pretty face,

275
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,900
but ignorant and brainless.

276
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,100
They address me as Ms. Lan

277
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:46,700
just because of my last name.

278
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,981
It's only because of this surname that

279
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:49,501
I own this property.

280
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:57,340
Ms. Lan,

281
00:11:58,941 --> 00:11:59,780
I feel that

282
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,861
it doesn't matter

283
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,460
what do people think of you,

284
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,821
the important thing is,

285
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,861
how do you see yourself.

286
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,861
Thank you.

287
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,501
I need some time

288
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
to think this matter over.

289
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:17,460
Danping,

290
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:19,621
please see them off.

291
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:20,340
All right.

292
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,540
Ms. Lan,

293
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,780
you've mentioned before,

294
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,100
in your whole life

295
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,381
you have been deprived of authority

296
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,501
and have always been told

297
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,421
what to do.

298
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:32,741
This time

299
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:34,220
you can make your own decision.

300
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:35,981
I hope you decide on something

301
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,181
you feel is right.

302
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:41,261
Let's go.

303
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,181
We shall take our leave now.

304
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:58,460
Ms. Qin,

305
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,981
this is our third time

306
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,981
having a common secret.

307
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,140
I hope this time
we can work together happily.

308
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,460
Li Dai.

309
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,421
Let's have lunch together.

310
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,061
Your treat?

311
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:13,941
My treat.

312
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:16,580
Let's go.

313
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,061
Qin Shi,

314
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:28,181
this time I'm very impressed.

315
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:30,660
Don't praise me.

316
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,340
It feels uncomfortable.

317
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:34,660
I'm saying this
from the bottom of my heart.

318
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:36,941
I've always felt

319
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,261
you are

320
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,140
a back-door sycophant.

321
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,580
I never thought this time

322
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,941
you are doing so much for Lan Xiaoting.

323
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,900
You should know

324
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:47,700
if Madam Tang finds out about this,

325
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,261
the price you need to pay
is much higher than mine.

326
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:51,700
I don't agree.

327
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:53,220
Although

328
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:54,301
I am an employee of Cheng & Hui,

329
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,981
the only thing I sold it to the company

330
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,861
is my time.

331
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,381
It does not include my character and values.

332
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:00,861
I am

333
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:02,540
using my own private time

334
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,941
to do what I want.

335
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
This does not violate
the interests of the firm.

336
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,621
It doesn't matter even
if people find out.

337
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:08,981
So,

338
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
the next time we discuss about the case,

339
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,660
it's better to do it
outside of working hours.

340
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:13,100
I agree.

341
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,700
I can't stand seeing people like Pang Dingfang

342
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:17,941
getting away with it.

343
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,501
You too, right?

344
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,100
But you,

345
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,660
after you've seen so much,

346
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,061
you still think you can get married.

347
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:27,261
I'm impressed.

348
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:28,981
Possibly because

349
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,460
my parents have a good relationship.

350
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,100
I am always optimistic

351
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:33,460
towards marriage.

352
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:35,900
You said

353
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,621
we have three secrets between us.

354
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:41,700
What else?

355
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,861
About Xiao Gao who was fired

356
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:49,061
from the criminal department.

357
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,700
The news about Cheng & Hui's

358
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,741
RMB 25 million,

359
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,140
he actually heard it

360
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,900
over my conversation with Qiao.

361
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:57,540
You knew about it

362
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,780
but you never let Madam Tang

363
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,181
track down the source,

364
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:01,621
and never took this matter

365
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:02,421
to make things difficult for me.

366
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,621
I will remember this favor.

367
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:09,780
Neither do I

368
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,100
like to owe favors.

369
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:12,580
So,

370
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,900
I'll return it to you.

371
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:19,580
My USB?

372
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,981
(Ms. Li,)

373
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,340
(I really do not know)

374
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,700
(what you are talking about.)

375
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,660
(My son and Qin Shi)

376
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:30,061
(were never married.)

377
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,061
(Why did Qin Shi even say this?)

378
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:37,261
I can explain this.

379
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,821
There's no need.

380
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,460
I've thought

381
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,900
about this matter

382
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,220
many times from the beginning.

383
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,181
The only reasonable explanation is that

384
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,580
you've been lying.

385
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:52,900
In order to rise through the ranks

386
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:53,941
in your career,

387
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,020
you made up a perfect marriage.

388
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:58,861
The most coincidental

389
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:00,460
and also the most unexpected thing

390
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,501
was that Yang Hua

391
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,381
suddenly appeared on the scene,

392
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:07,140
and Madam Tang recognized him immediately

393
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,741
and brought him to you.

394
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,421
I have to tell you first,

395
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,861
I didn't dig into your privacy.

396
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:17,900
It's just that your privacy

397
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:20,220
always comes to me.

398
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:24,861
At first

399
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,340
I think the both of you

400
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:28,301
only looked sweet on the outside,

401
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,301
and there is an undescribable weirdness.

402
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
But I never thought

403
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,580
the truth is so crazy.

404
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:36,941
Qin Shi,

405
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,780
I really admire you

406
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:39,580
from the bottom of my heart.

407
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,501
In order to achieve your aim,

408
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:44,140
you've worked harder than me.

409
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:47,421
What do you want?

410
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:49,460
I am not one

411
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,900
who stabs people from the back.

412
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,660
So I have no intention of

413
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,981
telling anyone about this.

414
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:57,061
But...

415
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,821
But I am one

416
00:16:58,061 --> 00:16:59,900
who doesn't particularly like fake people.

417
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:01,861
So,

418
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:04,021
I'd advise you

419
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,741
to withdraw from the
11th floor competition.

420
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:18,820
Even if I withdraw,

421
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,141
it doesn't mean you'll make it.

422
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,100
I know.

423
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,621
Ms. Qin,

424
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:26,940
don't get me wrong.

425
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,141
I'm not here

426
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:29,381
to compete with you for a spot.

427
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,261
Even if I am,

428
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,340
I do not have to do it in this way.

429
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:37,060
All the time

430
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:39,661
I am against you

431
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:40,501
was for only one reason.

432
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,820
That is,

433
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:43,700
I want fairness.

434
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,621
Thank you for your lunch.

435
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,861
I'm returning this to you.

436
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:04,621
See you later.

437
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,901
(Think about it,)

438
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,220
(if they are married,)

439
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,100
(why should I against it?)

440
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:34,021
(I'm not an old-fashioned)

441
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,541
(or a bad mother-in-law.)

442
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,541
(My son is 28 years old,)

443
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
(in his golden year,)

444
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,220
(has a bright future.)

445
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:41,820
(Come to our neighborhood)

446
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:43,580
(and ask around.)

447
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,861
(So,)

448
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,300
(don't make us pay the compensation.)

449
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:51,781
Any idea?

450
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:56,580
No.

451
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,141
About this matter,

452
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,661
I've thought about it countless times.

453
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,621
There's no solution.

454
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,700
Do you need me to explain it to Ms. Li?

455
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,220
It's pointless to

456
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:18,060
explain this matter to anyone now.

457
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,820
But,

458
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,420
this time,

459
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,940
I'm amazed by Li Dai.

460
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,861
Before this, I thought

461
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:26,820
she's a fake person.

462
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,820
She looked like she doesn't care.

463
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,180
She's scheming.

464
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,700
But this time, she's so upright,

465
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,381
and never thought of

466
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,901
reporting me at all.

467
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,340
She left me a way out.

468
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,141
The road to suicide.

469
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,021
She wants me to withdraw
from the 11th floor.

470
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:45,861
Do you want to?

471
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,021
Do you want to hear the truth?

472
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:53,180
Of course I don't.

473
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,060
Every step I took to be here today

474
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,381
was not easy.

475
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:00,381
Yes, I cheated,

476
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,141
but that's not my intention.

477
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,741
I hid my own real marital status,

478
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:07,180
but I'm not proud of it.

479
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,381
And I never cheated in my capability.

480
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,340
For working women,

481
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,981
the workplace has a glass ceiling.

482
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,460
Not only in the legal industry,

483
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:18,060
but in every industry.

484
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:19,621
Do you know why the fertility rate

485
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,060
of these two years

486
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,060
has been going down?

487
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,300
That's because some companies

488
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,220
are not treating the working women well.

489
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:27,220
For us,

490
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,700
we have to bear the important task of reproduction,

491
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,420
and be financial independent

492
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:32,261
like a man.

493
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,300
Upgrade and fight monsters at work,

494
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:36,580
take care of children
and cook after work.

495
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,501
Do you think it's easy?

496
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,141
But fortunately,

497
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:49,501
many girls now

498
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,781
are not that stupid either.

499
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,820
Since there is no way

500
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:54,501
to satisfy the society and family,

501
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,861
we can just give up on

502
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,621
what is needed from us.

503
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,100
I'll just take care of myself and

504
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,340
live my own life. Can't I?

505
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,541
If you're married,

506
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,781
they're worried that you'll get pregnant.

507
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,501
If you already have one child,

508
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:06,621
they're worried
you'll be getting another.

509
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:08,220
Please, I'm afraid too, okay?

510
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:19,541
(I remember I've kept the USB)

511
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,781
(in the drawer.)

512
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,621
(How did it get into Li Dai's hand?)

513
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,300
About this matter,

514
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,621
I can't think of any other way.

515
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,820
Suicide is the only way.

516
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,661
Worst case, I'll just change a place

517
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,541
and start all over.

518
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,661
Just like you said,

519
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,901
if I choose the wrong way,

520
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:40,100
I'll never

521
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,021
get to the destination. I accept this.

522
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:46,220
I'm doomed.

523
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:47,981
I hope it won't

524
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,340
affect you too much.

525
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:57,021
Can I ask you a question?

526
00:21:58,781 --> 00:21:59,901
If you get to the 11th floor,

527
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:00,781
will you tell your boss

528
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,381
the real situation?

♪The moon and the stars shut their eyes♪

If I get to the 11th floor,

531
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:14,300
of course I'll tell.

532
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,381
I even want to change the situation.

533
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:20,180
This occupational discrimination

534
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,340
against professional single women

535
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:24,021

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,180

542
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,741

Yes, right.

It's okay.

562
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,180
This chair will be blocked by my skirt.

No, Qin Shi,

we're taking a family portrait,

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
what are you doing here?

00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,781
Who is going out?

578
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:48,781
Come back in quickly.

579
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:50,060
You know it's a family portrait.

580
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,981
Today is dad's birthday,

581
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,021
we're taking a family portrait.

582
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,741
There's no reason to
photograph our guest.

583
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,300
Whose family portrait are you taking?

584
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,220
What do you mean?

585
00:23:57,661 --> 00:23:59,021
Ex-wife is also a wife.

586
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,700
She gave birth to the children
in this family,

587
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,700
so she's family, right?

588
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,781
Besides, dad didn't say anything,

589
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:03,141
what's the matter with you?

590
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,141
Enough. Enough.

591
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:05,820
Shi, like this,

592
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,661
you'll take a photo

593
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:08,940
with dad and aunt first, okay?

594
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:09,901
Let's move aside.

595
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:11,300
- No, no, no, don't.
- Move aside.

596
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,220
Why should we?

597
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,141
Don't move, don't go anywhere.

598
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:13,621
Move aside.

599
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:14,021
Just stay where you are.

Why should we?

602
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,741
You can't keep spoiling her.

603
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:17,261
It's up to you.

604
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,021
If you don't want to, just stand aside.

605
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:18,661
What are you doing?

606
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,180
What are you doing?

607
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:19,741
What are you doing?

608
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:20,381
What are you doing?

609
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,060
Pass me the camera.

610
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:21,940
No...

611
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,220
Mom, she pinched me.

612
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,621
Qin Shi, he is your brother.

613
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:27,501
How can you pinch him.

614
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,781
He is being rough!
So I just pinch him.

615
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:29,381
No.

616
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,180
He is my son.

617
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,021
Don't pinch him.

618
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,621
Look at her.

619
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,100
This character, this temper.

620
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:34,901
What else do you want to do?

621
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:35,981
Fall in love? Get married?

622
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,981
In your dream.

623
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,781
You are the one dreaming.

624
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,340
What are you doing?

625
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,460
What are you doing?

626
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,700
Why do you talk like that
about my daughter?

627
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:55,420
Enough, stop arguing.

628
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:01,940
Excuse me,

629
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:03,420

It's dad's birthday,

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,261
the meal is ready,

634
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,261
let's eat first.

635
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,381
We'll take the photo later.

636
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:13,700
All right, let's eat first.

637
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:14,621
We'll take the photo later.

638

Let's eat first.

We'll take the photo later.

640
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,021
All good, all good.

641
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,580
Let's eat first.

642
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,180
Let's eat first.

643
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:21,741
Let's go.

644
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:23,541
She pinched me.

645
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:24,300
Dad,

646
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:25,861
don't be angry.

647
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:28,141
Let's eat first.

648
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Come on. Quick.

649
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:33,940
I'll be 70 years old

650
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:36,460
after today.

651
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:39,580
My whole life,

652
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,820
I've never wanted fame nor wealth,

653
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:44,621
I just want to

654
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:46,700
be an honest and good person,

655
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,261
marry a wife,

656
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,861
have a few children,

657
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,700
earn money to support the family,

658
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:54,381
and shelter the family.

659
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:56,820
Am I too demanding?

660
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,340
Everyone sees this

661
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:00,501
as an easy thing,

662
00:26:01,381 --> 00:26:02,141
but why does it seem so difficult

663
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:03,940
when it comes to me?

664
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:13,460
Dad,

665
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:15,220
let me drink with you.

666
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:19,261
Wenbin.

667
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,220
My eldest son.

668
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,261
When you were born,

669
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,861
I was so excited that
I almost passed out.

670
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:28,820
It's like a dream.

671
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,021
Come.

672
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,901
When I divorced your mother,

673
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,420
you were only four years old.

674
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:43,700
She is ambitious,

675
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,420
she insisted to develop abroad.

676
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:47,220
All I can do for her

677
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,100
is to let her go.

678
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:55,700
Liu Yan

679
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,100
treats you really well.

680
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:01,501
She treats you like her own son.

681
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,420
You are sensible too

682
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,340
and is willing to call her mom.

683
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,300
A nice lady like her

684
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,541
married me and became a mother.

685
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,060
What can I do?

686
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,741
I can only treat her well, right?

687
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:15,060
Our life was hard.

688
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:16,420
When I started my business,

689
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,981
my mind and heart

690
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:19,580
were all focused in one place.

691
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,300
And then I realized,

692
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,060
I'm getting richer,

693
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:26,700
but I couldn't carry on

694
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,100
with my life.

695
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:30,661
People said our life is all about money,

696
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:33,060
but my conclusion
after all these years is,

697
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
no matter how good your family is,

698
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,700
it's pointless if someone else

699
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
has ulterior motives.

700
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:38,940
Liu Yan,

701
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:40,781
you have such bad temper.

702
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,180
You never change.

703
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,820
Look at the occasion

704
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:44,981
before you speak.

705
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,700
I've told you many times

706
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:48,460
about this matter.

707
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:49,901
I married Hu Xiaomei

708
00:27:50,021 --> 00:27:51,021
the right way

709
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,901
and legitimately, right?

710
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,541
Okay, all right, Qin.

711
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:57,781
That's enough for today.

712
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:58,700
All right.

713
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:00,420
Come, celebrate your birthday.

714
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:02,621
All right, all right.

715
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,340
Come, everybody.

716
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,261
Thank you for celebrating my birthday.

717
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:08,820
Happy birthday, dad.

718
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:09,541
Happy birthday, dad.

719
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,781
Happy birthday.

720
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,940
Can you for the sake of me,

721
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,820
for this old man,

722
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,580
an incompetent husband,

723
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,940
an incompetent father,

724
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,541
just stop arguing?

725
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,021
At this table,

726
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
we're a family.

727
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:40,621
I don't want to see you

728
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,861
pointing fingers at each other,

729
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:42,901
fighting and arguing.

730
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:45,820
It's no big deal.

731
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,501
Everyone thinks well of each other.

732
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,901
Liu Yan,

733
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:53,700
for this I'll have to criticize you.

734
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,861
You are Wenbin and Wenyu's mother,

735
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,021
but on this occasion

736
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,741
you are a guest,

737
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:01,940
there's nothing much to say.

738
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:03,781
It's fine

739
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,180
if your children are fighting,

740
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,940
but why did you go along with them?

741
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,420
What you said does make sense.

742
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:12,661
But you saw

743
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:13,420
what happened just now.

744
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:14,861
Who started it?

745
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:16,661
Even if some people

746
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,141
don't treat me as a member
of this family,

747
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:18,820
it's fine.

748
00:29:20,621 --> 00:29:21,781
But Wenyu is my son.

749
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,220
He has only a mother

750
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:23,940
since he was a child.

751
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:25,501
If he was wronged,

752
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:26,420
who else will help him if I don't?

753
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,861
Wenyu.

754
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:31,300
Daddy is sorry

755
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:34,820
about this.

756
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,420
Look,

757
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,981
he looks like he's being pampered

758
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:39,901
growing up,

759
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,220
but in fact I know

760
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:44,541
he grew up with us in the kitchen.

761
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:47,501
Entrepreneurship was hard at that time.

762
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:48,861
I don't have much time for him.

763
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,021
We ran a restaurant,

764
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:53,141
but no one cooked for him.

765
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,180
He never had enough of food.

766
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,820
When he was starving,

767
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:58,541
he can even raw meat.

768
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,741
When I think of these things,

769
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:03,981
I really feel sorry,

770
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,340
Wenyu.

771
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:08,901
Dad.

772
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,381
At that time,
there was a lot of pressure,

773
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:12,940
I had bad temper,

774
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:14,340
I was impatient.

775
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:16,820
There were more scolding
and less educating.

776
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,580
You never liked reading since small.

777
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:21,700
It's okay if you don't like reading,

778
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,300
but you're slow

779
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:25,700
and often get cheated.

780
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:28,261
To feed without teaching,
is the father's fault.

781
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,580
Yes, this is all my fault.

782
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,501
Dad, that's enough.

783
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,901
It's my fault.

784
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:39,940
But now,

785
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,180
I have Meimei with me,

786
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:45,420
I will never be cheated again.

787
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,781
And I'll never asked to

788
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,100
divorce Meimei anymore.

789
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,580
I will never leave Meimei again.

790
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,861
I...

791
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
You've finally told the truth.

792
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,661
No, dad.

793
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,541
Listen to me.

794
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:04,940
There's no point explaining!

795
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:05,541
I'm talking nonsense.

796
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,021
No.

797
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,460
Let me tell you,

798
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:07,460
I know all the devious ideas you have

799
00:31:07,981 --> 00:31:09,501
by just looking at your eyes.

800
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:11,220
Have I not told you?

801
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,580
Children of the Qin family

802
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:13,420
were only widowed,

803
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,580
never divorced.

804
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,781
Dad, I don't agree with what you said.

805
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,340
My mother is alive and well,

806
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,861
brother's mother
is alive and well too.

807
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,621
When are you a widower?

808
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,100
Enough.

809
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,940
I'm not wrong.

810
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,501
- You are talking back at me now?
- Dad.

811
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:25,141
Don't.

812
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,901
I must teach you

813
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:26,661
a lesson today.

814
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,741
Don't!

815
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:30,460
Dad, enough about me.

816
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,060
Talk about Qin Shi.

817
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:36,741
Qin Shi has a boyfriend.

818
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,661
Wenyu, you...

819
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:45,541
Yes.

820
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,661
Qin Shi has a boyfriend.

821
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:49,501
They've been dating for
two to three years.

822
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:50,100
Right?

823
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:51,021
They live together now.

824
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,420
She broke up with

825
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:53,981
Tao Junhui because...

826
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:55,501
Qin Wenyu!

827
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:56,541
Have you gone crazy?

828
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,220
Shi.

829
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:00,700
Is it true what he said?

830
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,180
Tell mom.

831
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:06,661
Tell mom,

832
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:07,501
okay?

833
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:11,700
I can explain this.

834
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:20,100
It's true.

835
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:21,621
- No.
- This is great.

836
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:26,741
This is great.

837
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:28,141
No, he can't.

838
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:36,420
Hua.

839
00:32:36,981 --> 00:32:38,220
The reason why I've never

840
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,261
stopped you from befriending Qin Shi

841
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,580
does not mean I approve of her.

842
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,820
It's because I think my son is

843
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:46,060
firstly, not stupid.

844
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:46,901
Secondly,

845
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:48,340
not someone who has never
seen the world.

846
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,261
I just need to give you time

847
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,901
to make a wise choice.

848
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:55,420
But I never thought...

849
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,141
I really

850
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,420
underestimated Qin Shi's ambition.

851
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:04,501
She's just a thirty-year-old lady.

852
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:05,901
Do need not have to be

853
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,340
so harsh on your words.

854
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,901
30 years old?

855
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,420
34.

856
00:33:10,981 --> 00:33:12,700
Her nominal age is already 35.

857
00:33:15,901 --> 00:33:16,501
Hua,

858
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,021
do you know,

859
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,180
Qin Shi

860
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,541
told everyone in the department

861
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:23,420
that you've been married for two years.

862
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:25,661
Now everyone thinks

863
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:26,781
I am a liar.

864
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,901
Saying that my son is married,

865
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:30,381
but I'm still saying that he's single,

866
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,541
and lied to your blind dates.

867
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,981
Tell me,

868
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,501
what kind of person will

869
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:36,781
ruin someone's reputation like this?

870
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:39,820
Can you just blabber about a marriage?

871
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,060
That's impossible.

872
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:47,060
Why not?

873
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:49,781
Their boss told me this personally.

874
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,060
Do you know what

875
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,060
their boss said?

876
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,541
She said...

877
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,060
Mom.

878
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,220
Qin Shi said it last time,

879
00:33:58,381 --> 00:33:59,501
she doesn't want you

880
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:00,741
to talk to her colleagues privately

881
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:02,501
without her consent.

882
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,981
I remember you promised.

883
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,621
I...

884
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,061
I didn't agree to it.

885
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:11,700
If it hadn't been previously someone

886
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,341
wanted us to compensate
their financial loss,

887
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,261
I wouldn't have communicated with her.

888
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,860
I was forced.

889
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,301
That person is called Li Dai.

890
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,301
She is not Qin Shi's boss.

891
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,781
On the contrary, she is a colleague

892
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,061
competiting with Qin Shi.

893
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,140
So whatever she said,

894
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:25,620
cannot be trusted.

895
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:27,660
Right.

896
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,301
What he said is right.

897
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,700
If so,

898
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:33,541
call Qin Shi over.

899
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,821
We'll talk face to face

900
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:35,981
and make things clear.

901
00:34:36,581 --> 00:34:38,781
If I really wronged her,

902
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:41,021
I can apologize to her.

903
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
I am most democratic,

904
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,140
most reasonable.

905
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:49,860
Hua,

906
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,140
what your mother said

907
00:34:52,261 --> 00:34:53,061
makes sense too.

908
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,741
There's no need to call her here

909
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:56,781
because all this

910
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,581
is what I told Qin Shi to say.

911
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,741
Why?

912
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,140
Because I love her very much.

913
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,180
I love her so much that I won't allow

914
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:09,460
anyone to pursue her.

915
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,981
Such a brat.

916
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,420
Okay, as expected of my son.

917
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,660
For this, you're just like me.

918
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,140
Just like me.

919
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,940
Tell me the truth,

920
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,860
is it because of this man that

921
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,900
you didn't marry Tao Junhui?

922
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:45,940
No.

923
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,821
Be honest.

924
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,700
No.

925
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,061
That's enough.

926
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,420
What are you doing?

927
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:55,940
You're interrogating her

928
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:56,700
like she's a criminal.

929
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,700
When Shi was not seeing anyone,

930
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,180
you were worrying at home.

931
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,420
Now that she's seeing someone,

932
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,981
you are getting angry here.

933
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:05,581
What are you doing?

934
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,501
Jun,

935
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,940
don't take this kind of thing

936
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,220
too seriously.

937
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,981
Now young people behave in this way.

938
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,460
They are not serious in relationship.

939
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,380
Even if they live together,

940
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:17,220
they're not necessarily partners.

941
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,021
Right?

942
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:18,981
- Mom.
- Liu Yan.

943
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,940
You have no right to comment

944
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
in this matter.

945
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:25,220
All right.

946
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,860
That...

947
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:28,981
What's his name again? Yang?

948
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,700
Yang Hua.

949
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:34,460
Yes.

950
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,261
Tell Yang Hua

951
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:37,620
to come in two days.

952
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:38,860
He can't.

953
00:36:39,581 --> 00:36:40,380
Why not?

954
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,420
He went abroad for business.

955
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,021
Meimei knows.

956
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:46,860
Yes.

957
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:48,301
He...

958
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,860
I met him two days ago

959
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,420
and he said he was leaving soon.

960
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,900
He often gets sent

961
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:53,781
for overseas business trip.

962
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:54,940
Really?

963
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:57,021
Even if he goes abroad,

964
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,021
he will be back too.

965
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:04,781
Wait for New Year then.

966
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,981
New Year?

967
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:08,420
Away till the end of the year?

968
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:09,940
Being in such a relationship,

969
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,620
Is he good looking?

970
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,620
how many times do you see each other
in a year?

971
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,700
We're both busy with work.

972
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,140
Even if we're in the same city,

973
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:23,261
we do not meet often.

974
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,021
We'll just call if there's anything.

975
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,541
We're busy with our own stuff.
It's good.

976
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,741
What?

977
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,261
How can you get married then?

978
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,781
I've never thought about marriage.

979
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,541
What?

980
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:35,140
Not getting married?

981
00:37:35,261 --> 00:37:36,981
So why are you with him?

982
00:37:42,741 --> 00:37:44,101
According to the rules of Qin family,

983
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:45,860
we're can only be widowed,

984
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:46,700
never divorced.

985
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,581
This is a rule set by dad,

986
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:49,460
I'll definitely follow.

987
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:50,940
But I think,

988
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,940
don't take on something

989
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,301
that is beyond one's capabilities.

990
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,420
I have no confidence in myself that

991
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:56,380
I will not get divorced.

992
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:58,261
About this,

993
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:00,061
in my second brother's words,

994
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,301
he said I am abnormal.

995
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:02,620
When I am opinionated,

996
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,541
even I am afraid of myself.

997
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,021
I've never said that.

998
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,220
Don't put words into my mouth.

999
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,301
By the time

1000
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,180
if I can't take it anymore,

1001
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,860
should I kill myself or get killed?

1002
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:13,301
Dad, teach me a trick.

1003
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,460
Shi,

1004
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,620
stop the nonsense.

1005
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:16,900
Is there anything that I can't say?

1006
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:18,781
There's no guarantee that everything
will be fine after marriage,

1007
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:20,180
and you can be happy without divorcing.

1008
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,061
Qing,

1009
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:25,821
look at my brother,

1010
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,061
prosperous and successful in his career.

1011
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,860
You are at home every day,

1012
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:30,180
you must be worried

1013
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,301
if there is any seductress

1014
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,220
who will jump onto him.

1015
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:35,261
Meimei,

1016
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,781
marrying my idiot brother,

1017
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,380
you must know better than me

1018
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,781
just how much do you regret it now.

1019
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,420
Look at my mom.

1020
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:44,860
She has married my dad

1021
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:45,900
for more than 30 years now.

1022
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:47,460
Until now,

1023
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,301
my two brothers

1024
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,420
are still calling her aunt,

1025
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,460
not accepting her.

1026
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,700
And she?

1027
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,140
A yes-man

1028
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:55,101
in front of his ex-wife.

1029
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,341
She doesn't even dare

1030
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:58,741
to decide where and what to eat

1031
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,061
on my dad's birthday.

1032
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:02,220
Do you really think
being married is happy?

1033
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:09,140
Very good.

1034
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,981
Talking about me,

1035
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:12,660
right?

1036
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,581
You're so brave now.

1037
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,261
Worthy of being a lawyer.

1038
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:19,021
She can't be controlled now.
Not anymore.

1039
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,220
Dear lawyer,

1040
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:21,581
excuse me.

1041
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,380
I won't bother you

1042
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:24,940
coming to my humble house again.

1043
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,781
And you, don't call me dad anymore.

1044
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,220
I'll call you my ancestor.

1045
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,420
No, no.

1046
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:32,860
Happy birthday to you.

1047
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
You don't need to drive me out.
I'll leave.

1048
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,940
Shi! Shi!

1049
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,821
Don't stop her!

1050
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,061
Kneel down!

1051
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,460
Shi!

1052
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:54,420
Shi, wait!

1053
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:55,261
Wait!

1054
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,061
Wenbin, you don't have to say anything.

1055
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
I'm not here to urge you on anything.

1056
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:00,021
I got a call from the institute

1057
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
asking me to go back.

1058
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,101
I'm thinking if you can

1059
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:04,420
give me a ride.

1060
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,180
Get in.

1061
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,261
All right.

1062
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:23,460
Taller than Wenyu

1063
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,541
and much more handsome.

1064
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,581
Meimei,

1065
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,180
did you ask about his family?

1066
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:33,741
What are his parents like?

1067
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,380
What is his job?

1068
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,541
And he often goes abroad.

1069
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,380
Aunt. Aunt.

1070
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,261
Didn't Meimei just say

1071
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,301
he does financial investment.

1072
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:44,501
I heard you can make

1073
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,781
a lot of money in this industry.

1074
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,581
Yes, you're right.

1075
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:47,900
But,

1076
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,140
how much does he earn?

1077
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:51,620
Does he have a house

1078
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:52,620
in Shanghai?

1079
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,900
How big is it? In which area?

1080
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,021
Does he have a car?

1081
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,220
I didn't ask these.

1082
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,021
These are important things,

1083
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,021
why didn't you ask?

1084
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,460
These are important questions,

1085
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:06,021
how can you not ask?

1086
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,061
Just eat.

1087
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:08,180
How dare you talk.

1088
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:09,180
It's all your fault.

1089
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,301
I told you to keep it a secret.

1090
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,261
You just couldn't keep it in, can you?

1091
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,581
Whistleblower.

1092
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:14,301
How do I face Qin Shi now?

1093
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,981
I'm so passive.

1094
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,021
These things need to be told.

1095
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,220
Be open and aboveboard.

1096
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:21,660
Why must you hide?

1097
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:23,261
Maybe Yang Hua

1098
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,620
is a dishonest person.

1099
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:26,341
No, mom.

1100
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,341
He's not. He's nice.

1101
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:30,261
It's just that...

1102
00:41:31,581 --> 00:41:32,341
What?

1103
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,380
It's just that I think he's a bit weird.

1104
00:41:34,741 --> 00:41:35,620
- Weird?
- Weird?

1105
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,541
- Weird?
- Weird?

1106
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:38,420
How weird?

1107
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:39,420
How is he weird?

1108
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,460
Is he mysophobia?

1109
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:41,420
Something not right with his brain?

1110
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:41,900
No.

1111
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,180
What's weird about him then?

1112
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,420
I can tell it specifically.

1113
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:47,301
It just feels weird.

1114
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:49,220
You will know

1115
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,101
when you meet next time.

1116
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,981
But, I have observed him.

1117
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,180
He is quite attentive

1118
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:55,581
and also very considerate.

1119
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,900
He's a perfect match for Qin Shi.

1120
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,140
Really?

1121
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:01,660
You've asked a lot,

1122
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:02,700
but missed the point.

1123
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,821
You have to ask

1124
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:06,021
if he wants to get married.

1125
00:42:06,781 --> 00:42:07,261
Right?

1126
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:09,220
That's true.

1127
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,220
Does he want to get married?

1128
00:42:12,581 --> 00:42:13,420
How would I know?

1129
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,460
So does Yang

1130
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:18,301
want to get married?

1131
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,821
I do not know either.

1132
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:21,581
Does he want to get married?

1133
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:29,021
He should want to.

1134
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,261
He will want to.

1135
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,341
Are you very busy recently?

1136
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:00,981
Yes.

1137
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:02,101
What is it?

1138
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,061
Not happy?

1139
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,261
What do you think?

1140
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,981
Let's talk about happy things then.

1141
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:10,781
I have something to tell you.

1142
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:12,940
The leader in my office

1143
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,220
is retiring soon.

1144
00:43:14,581 --> 00:43:15,460
He proposed

1145
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,620
that I take over as dean.

1146
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,140
That's good.

1147
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:22,261
You are going to be a dean.

1148
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,981
Sister-in-law will be very happy.

1149
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:28,700
Whenever you open your mouth and speak,

1150
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,180
it will definitely be
a huge weapon of destruction.

1151
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:33,180
Did I say too much

1152
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:34,620
when we were at home just now?

1153
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:36,620
You do know that you're in the wrong?

1154
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:39,900
Let me call sister-in-law

1155
00:43:40,021 --> 00:43:40,741
and apologize to her.

1156
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,660
No, it's fine.

1157
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:43,061
As long as you're sincere.

1158
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:45,420
