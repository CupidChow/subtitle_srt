00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:58,624
(Humans are strange creatures.)

20

(Although we don't have wings,)

21
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:01,824
(we wish to attain great heights.)

00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:03,705
(That's why everyone in the world)

23
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,745
(is passionate about
building skyscrapers.)

24

(In the entire world,)

25

(Asians)

26
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:10,624
(are the most obsessive
toward skyscrapers.)

27

(Out of the ten tallest skyscrapers
in the world,)

28

(nine of them are in Asia.)

32
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:33,145
(was a terrible day for me.)

33
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:53,225
Qin Wenyu.

34
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,225
Qin Wenyu?

35
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:23,624
I'll smash your door open

36
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,184
if you don't open it for me!

37
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:26,145
Smash my door?

38
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:29,384
You're something else, aren't you?

39
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:30,024
Do you believe

40
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:31,264
that I'll smash the door open today?

41
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:31,904
Are you opening it or not?

42
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,104
I'll count from three.

43
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:34,505
- Stop!
- Will you open it or not?

44
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,785
Three, two...

45
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:36,585
Stop!

46
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:37,505
What are you guys doing?

47
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:37,904
Wei,

48
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:38,904
this has nothing to do with you.

49
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:39,904
This is my family affair.

50
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,305
All of you

51
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,065
better get out of my way!

52
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:42,544
Qin Wenyu, listen!

53
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:43,904
If you don't open it right now,
I'll smash...

54
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:46,305
If someone calls the cops right now

55
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:47,384
and report you for
the ruckus you caused

56
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:48,824
or for the weapon you possessed,

57
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:49,945
not only will you be imprisoned
for 15 days,

58
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:50,785
but you will also
have a criminal record.

59
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:52,225
Excuse me.

60
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:53,585
Let me speak with the mister inside.

61
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:10,065
Mr. Qin,

62
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:11,505
this is your divorce agreement

63
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:12,785
with Ms. Ren Meimei.

64
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:13,744
If you wish to divorce her,

65
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:14,945
you can sign it right now.

66
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:16,344
The Civil Affairs Bureau
closes at 5:30 p.m.

67
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,465
We can still make it in time.

68
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:18,064
What do you think?

69
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:19,745
I'll send you guys there
after you've signed the agreement.

70
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:22,865
Mr. Qin,

71
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:23,905
you cannot

72
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,465
hide inside forever.

73
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,264
You have to open the door eventually.

74
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:29,344
If there's any misunderstanding,

75
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:30,905
you should open the door

76
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:32,465
and clarify it.

77
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:33,745
Ren Meimei,

78
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:35,664
don't think that I'm scared of you

79
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,104
just because you brought this pest here.

80
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:37,905
I won't

81
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,025
talk to you guys today!

82
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,585
Since you don't want to talk to us,

83
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:47,745
you can talk to the cops then.

84
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:49,664
Cops?

85
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:51,145
What cops?

86
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,504
What gives you the right
to call the cops?

87
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:55,344
Qin Wenyu,

88
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:56,705
that's enough of you.

89
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:57,985
Tell her to put down her phone.

90
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,185
She's the one going overboard here.

91
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:01,625
I can opt

92
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:02,465
to skip the call.

93
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:04,025
However,

94
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,145
can you allow me to enter?

95
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,344
I promise that I'll head inside alone.

96
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:08,264
I'll have a chat with you.

97
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:09,544
Tell that person to leave first.

98
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,905
Are you not done yet?

99
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:14,784
If you don't wish
to cause trouble for yourself,

100
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:15,664
you should wait downstairs.

101
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:16,264
But look at him...

102
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:17,745
Listen, just leave this to me.

103
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,064
Give me a moment.

104
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:24,865
I'm sorry about that.

105
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:25,384
Thank you.

106
00:05:51,824 --> 00:05:52,745
Search the place all you like.

107
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:55,185
You can search

108
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:56,305
every nook and cranny.

109
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:57,344
You better search every corner.

110
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,145
There's no one here.

111
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:00,305
You mustn't omit

112
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:02,264
any minute details.

113
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:03,905
Check this place out.

114
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:04,985
Is there anyone here?

115
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,064
Is there someone hiding
under the sheets?

116
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:08,465
Nope.

117
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,264
So, you guys

118
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:12,784
went too far today.

119
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,104
Where's the trust between us?

120
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:14,585
Huh?

121
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,104
I'm very angry.

122
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:18,344
Tell that jealous woman

123
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:19,185
that I won't let her off

124
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:20,425
for what she did today.

125
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,145
I'm very angry.

126
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:29,544
Hey.

127
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:30,185
Wait.

128
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:31,905
Hey.

129
00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:36,064
I wonder whose phone is ringing?

130
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,585
Surprise!

131
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:53,504
She's the...

132
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:55,305
What are you doing?

133
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:57,625
Why are you taking pictures of her?

134
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:58,185
Stop it!

135
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,384
Stop it right now!

136
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:00,784
You're not stopping?

137
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:03,064
Why are you taking pictures of her?

138
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:06,905
If I truly wanted to have an affair,

139
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:07,824
why would I bring her

140
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:09,824
back to my hotel?

141
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:11,104
Do you think I'm an idiot?

142
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,985
The pictures I took

143
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,784
look great.

144
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,344
Look.

145
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,745
Look at your gestures.

146
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:20,344
Look at your expressions.

147
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,145
No one would believe it

148
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,305
even if I said you two were innocent.

149
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:24,344
Qin Shi,

150
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,425
I'm your brother, you know?

151
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:29,025
Why are you helping an outsider
instead of me?

152
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:30,104
Are you messing with me here?

153
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,224
Delete the pictures.

154
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,625
Right now,

155
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:35,145
I'm Ren Meimei's lawyer.

156
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:36,824
Mr. Qin, please mind your behavior.

157
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:37,625
Even so,

158
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:38,985
I'm paying you for it, right?

159
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:40,104
Delete the pictures!

160
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:45,264
Mr. Qin,

161
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:48,705
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:50,104
It's all my fault.

163
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:54,465
Ms. Qin,

164
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:56,264
it isn't what you think.

165
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,224
Why don't I

166
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,305
head outside

167
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:02,425
and explain the situation to Meimei?

168
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:05,185
You don't need to
explain anything to her.

169
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:06,745
There was nothing between us.

170
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,264
Why are you trying to
explain yourself to her?

171
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:08,705
Huh?

172
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:10,544
You see,

173
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:11,784
if you find her,

174
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:12,944
not only will you not
be able to explain yourself,

175
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:14,264
but she will also chew you out.

176
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:15,344
You should leave first.

177
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,064
Follow me.

178
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:21,625
Where are we going?

179
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:23,745
Do you wish to divorce her?

180
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,260
(Divorce Agreement)

181
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:46,904
Tell her to sign it first.

182
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:49,704
Why should I?

183
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:51,024
He was the one who brought it up.

184
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,024
She's lying through her teeth.

185
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:54,784
You heard it just now.

186
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,904
She brought it up first.

187
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,385
You can't side with her now.

188
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,344
I didn't bring it up.

189
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:00,945
You didn't? Did you lose
your memories or something?

190
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:02,344
Guys, you two are adults.

191
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:04,104
Can you two stop being so childish?

192
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:06,385
You two

193
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:07,265
are financially independent,

194
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:08,104
possess financial freedom,

195
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,104
and are childless.

196
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,185
The divorce agreement in front of us

197
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:12,784
is the 17th version, you know?

198
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,625
We could already use it as a template.

199
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,104
I suggest you two
sign the paper immediately.

200
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:18,224
Isn't it better for you two

201
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,904
to go on your separate ways
and find your own happiness?

202
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,224
It's obvious

203
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,664
that you two don't want a divorce.

204
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:34,185
But you two just had
to bring it up every day.

205
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:35,985
As your divorce lawyer,

206
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:37,904
I suggest you guys
head home and think twice.

207
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:39,544
There are procedures
we have to follow for a divorce

208
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:41,185
and there are certain attitudes you must
show if you don't want a divorce.

209
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,305
Arguing with each other like this

210
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:45,104
is a waste of everyone's time.

211
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:48,945
She's saying that you wasted her time!

212
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,185
Mr. Qin Wenyu,

213
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:51,625
please remember

214
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:53,185
that you're already married.

215
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:55,185
You should avoid

216
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:56,104
spending time with other women alone

217
00:09:56,185 --> 00:09:57,265
if you can.

218
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:00,544
Ms. Ren Meimei,

219
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:02,265
if you still wish

220
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:03,224
to retain your marriage,

221
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:05,584
please show your partner

222
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:07,305
enough respect and trust.

223
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:09,745
If you guys call me
for something like this again,

224
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:10,904
I'll charge you double the amount.

225
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,265
Double the amount?

226
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:14,664
Did you actually pay her?

227
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:15,305
Hey, how could you

228
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:16,745
cheat your sister-in-law of her money?

229
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:18,344
Are you a moneygrubber?

230
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:20,544
Are you doing your laundry?

231
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,024
Li.

232
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,865
She teaches English at a university.

233
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:37,464
She has also received
her Master's Degree.

234
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,505
She's 28 years old this year.

235
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,224
She's 160cm tall.

236
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:41,185
She's elegant too.

237
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:42,305
Why are you rejecting her?

238
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:44,344
She has bad cleanliness habits.

239
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:45,224
She litters.

240
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:46,664
How could a person like her
be a teacher?

241
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,060
(Age: 26  Weight: 43kg  Pediatrician)

242
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,500
(Age: 26  Weight: 43kg  Pediatrician)
She's a pediatrician.

243
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,584
She's a pediatrician.

244
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,185
I assume she has
good cleanliness habits.

245
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:54,825
Why did you reject her too?

246
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,945
She has no sense of time.

247
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:56,505
She was 30 minutes late

248
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:57,664
on our first date.

249
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:00,385
She's a lady.

250
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:01,664
It isn't that big of a deal

251
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:02,784
for her to be late.

252
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:03,144
Mom,

253
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:04,745
if you waste time,
that means you're wasting your life.

254
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:05,584
Wasting other people's time

255
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:06,425
is just like murdering them.

256
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:07,065
She was 30 minutes late

257
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:08,024
on our first date.

258
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:09,185
She didn't even apologize to me.

259
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,505
It's as if she's taking her lateness

260
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:11,024
for granted.

261
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,065
That means she has done it before.

262
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:15,104
What about her?

263
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:16,385
What about this girl?

264
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:18,745
She's taking her doctorate
in Jiaotong University.

265
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,904
She's knowledgeable,
cultured, and educated.

266
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:22,825
She doesn't like pets.
That means she has no compassion.

267
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:25,544
What about her?

268
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:26,464
She's too pretentious.

269
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:27,584
This girl is excellent.

270
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:29,704
She spends too lavishly.

271
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:30,704
What's bad about her?

272
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:32,224
She has weird fashion taste.

273
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:39,385
What about her? She's an air stewardess.

274
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:41,305
She's beautiful and compassionate.

275
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:42,745
And, she's even a volunteer

276
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:43,985
in the pet rescue center.

277
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,344
Hua,

278
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:48,065
you have nothing
to complain about her, right?

279
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:50,185
Yeah.

280
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:51,784
But she didn't like me.

281
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:54,344
If so, have you ever thought of

282
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,985
the reason behind it?

283
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,745
I'm perfectly fine.

284
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:00,945
You're perfectly fine?

285
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,265
What did you say when she asked you

286
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,144
if you had a house?

287
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:08,904
I think our life shouldn't
be constrained

288
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:10,664
by a concrete box.

289
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,065
If you know that buying a house

290
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:13,625
isn't the only way
to safeguard your life,

291
00:12:13,704 --> 00:12:14,704
and if you know that
there are many other choices

292
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:15,464
other than buying a house,

293
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:16,185
you might not

294
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:17,344
insist on buying a house.

295
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:20,425
Mom,

296
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:21,945
what I said was based on
evidence and logic.

297
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:23,344
It was supported by data.

298
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:25,945
If so, what did you say
when she asked you

299
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:27,584
about your dreams?

300
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:32,344
My biggest dream in life

301
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:33,625
is to spend

302
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:34,745
a peaceful life

303
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,825
and die on my bed.

304
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:39,265
Hua,

305
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:40,825
do you know

306
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:42,305
what's my biggest dream

307
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:43,185
in life?

308
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:47,265
My biggest dream in life

309
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:48,144
is for you

310
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:49,664
to be successful

311
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,144
and establish your own family.

312
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:52,505
But look at you right now.

313
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:53,784
You don't have a family,

314
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:54,664
and you didn't succeed in your career.

315
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,065
I don't need you

316
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:58,344
to be a prominent businessman.

317
00:12:58,464 --> 00:12:59,825
However, you should at least
contribute to society

318
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:01,185
and our family.

319
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:03,024
You should get married
and give birth to children.

320
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:03,704
Your father and I

321
00:13:03,704 --> 00:13:04,904
are still young.

322
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:05,865
We have the energy

323
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:07,344
to take care of your kids for you.

324
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:25,584
Hua,

325
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:27,784
it's not that I'm forcing you

326
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:29,945
to get married now.

327
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,505
I just wish that you can
be like the others

328
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,904
and do what's appropriate for you
at the appropriate age.

329
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:36,224
I hope that you can get back

330
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:38,104
on the right track slowly.

331
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:39,784
I don't want you to obtain
immense happiness.

332
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,385
I just want you to be joyful.

333
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:43,664
My biggest wish right now

334
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:45,505
is for you to be happy.

335
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:48,625
Mom,

336
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,425
actually, obtaining happiness

337
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:51,584
is a simple thing.

338
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:53,024
We just need to stop
comparing ourselves to others

339
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,224
and lower our desire.

340
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:55,425
That way, we can be happy.

341
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:56,625
Right now, many places

342
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:58,224
are still suffering from wars.

343
00:13:58,985 --> 00:13:59,584
Our lives are much happier

344
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:00,865
compared with them.

345
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:05,505
It's almost 3 p.m.

346
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:09,185
Stop right there! You!

347
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:15,745
Stop right there!

348
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:27,544
You're content with your life?

349
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:28,945
You're already 28 years old!

350
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:30,104
You graduated from a famous university,

351
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:31,584
yet you're trading stocks at home?

352
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,825
You don't get into a relationship.

353
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:34,544
You only rear your stupid tortoise!

354
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:37,224
Do you know what other people
are saying about you?

355
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,224
They say you're mentally ill, you know?

356
00:14:41,305 --> 00:14:42,024
Dear,

357
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:42,584
it's time to

358
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:44,425
go grocery shopping.

359
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,985
Come on, let's go.

360
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:47,425
This is none of your business.

361
00:14:47,664 --> 00:14:49,185
The only thing you can do
is to help us reconcile.

362
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:50,664
You should be

363
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:52,104
(Transaaction successful)
more reserved with your words.

364
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,065
(Transaaction successful)
Forget about other people.

365
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:55,224
It's fine as long as

366
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:55,985
our son is happy, right?

367
00:14:56,024 --> 00:14:56,985
Fine, let's go.

368
00:14:58,945 --> 00:14:59,625
God of Wealth,

369
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:00,745
Dad has earned a lot of

370
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:02,185
tortoise feed for you, are you happy?

371
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:14,305
It may be happy,

372
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:16,265
but I'm not!

373
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:22,865
I begged someone to arrange this

374
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:24,784
blind date for you.

375
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,024
Tonight, at 8 p.m.

376
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:27,625
This is your last chance.

377
00:15:27,904 --> 00:15:29,505
Failure isn't an option.

378
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:30,425
Mom.

379
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:31,584
This lady is called Li Dai.

380
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:32,865
She's a lawyer.

381
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:33,945
She's beautiful, capable,

382
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:35,385
gentle, and virtuous.

383
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:37,104
If you can't get it done this time,

384
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:38,664
get out of the house.

385
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:39,945
Mom, I've paid

386
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:40,945
for the house too.

387
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,385
I have the right to stay here.

388
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,344
If you're that capable,

389
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:46,745
you can sue me in court.

390
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:48,224
Mom!

391
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:49,625
Don't call me Mom
unless you win her heart.

392
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:51,065
Aunt.

393
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,344
Aunt?

394
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:57,985
Darned kid.

395
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:09,745

What's wrong, Hui?

410
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:19,625
Qin Shi,

411
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:22,265
do you think I should

412
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,184
pick the white dress

413
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:25,905
or the black dress?

414
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:29,025
The white dress makes you look younger

415
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:30,424
while the black dress looks more classy.

416
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:31,745
You look good in either of them.

417
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:32,704
Do you wish to be young

418
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,944
or classy?

419
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:36,424
Of course I wish to be young.

420
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,344
Has the niece of
the lawyers' association's

421
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:41,104
deputy director

422
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:42,424
reported for duty?

423
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:44,224
Which one do you mean?

424
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,424
I told you about her two days ago.

425
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:49,584
Did you forget it again?

426
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,745
Her name was Wu Fei.

427
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:52,344
Qiao said

428
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:53,665
she already reported for duty
at the Ministry.

429
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:56,584
Come in.

430
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:58,625
Ms. Qin,

431
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:00,064
here are the materials
you told Liu to prepare.

432
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:01,545
Here.

433
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:02,665
Wait.

434
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:10,665
Which of them is Wu Fei?

435
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:13,344
It's the one standing there.

436
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:16,745
Got it.

437
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:17,545
You may leave now.

438
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,785
Hui, I saw her.

439
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,145
She's young and beautiful.

440
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:30,865
Her uncle is the deputy director

441
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:31,985
of the lawyers' association.

442
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:34,785
I'm not too close to him,
but we're not strangers either.

443
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:36,304
I cannot rest at ease

444
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,424
if I leave her in someone else's care.

445
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:40,265
You're the only one

446
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:41,424
who can take up this task.

447
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,304
It's my duty

448
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:44,304
to share your burden with you.

449
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:45,704
It's also part of my job.

450
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:48,104
Don't tell anyone about this.

451
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:50,704
Bian Jing from 11th Floor
is going to leave soon.

452
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:53,104
Is that so? That's quite sudden.

453
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,064
Did you actually hear what I said?

454
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,184
Your mentor is leaving soon.

455
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,665
How could you be so nonchalant about it?

456
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,224
I was too engrossed in my work just now.

457
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:08,545
I didn't get what you meant.

458
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,064
Why is she suddenly leaving?

459
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:13,385
Isn't she one of the partners?

460
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:15,145
The news isn't official yet.

461
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:16,745
I'll announce it in a few days.

462
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,064
I've already discussed this with Jin.

463
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:20,145
As long as

464
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:21,665
you keep yourself in check,

465
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,985
do your job well,

466
00:19:23,104 --> 00:19:24,745
and don't create any trouble,

467
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:26,824
you have a higher percentage

468
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:28,505
of taking over her post
compared to the others.

469
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:30,385
You know how many people

470
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:31,985
have their eyes on her position, right?

471
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:34,184
I can recommend you for the position.

472
00:19:34,785 --> 00:19:35,944
I'm sure I did a lot of great deeds

473
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:37,344
in my past life.

474
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:40,184
Don't worry.
I'll surely keep myself in check.

475
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:41,865
I'll be more obedient
than your dog, Paul.

476
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:44,905
I'll take them.

477
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,025
Remember to arrive early
for tonight's party.

478
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:50,865
Has your husband
returned to the country?

479
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:52,464
You should bring him along.

480
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:55,145
His company sent him

481
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:56,665
to Slovakia for a business trip.

482
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:00,625
Your husband is so secretive.

483
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,064
It's been two years,

484
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:03,665
yet I haven't met him once.

485
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:05,985
How many times do you guys
meet each other in a year?

486
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:07,905
Can you stand the loneliness?

487
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,344
I couldn't stand it
if I were in your shoes.

488
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:11,625
You're truly impressive.

489
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,785
If I were you, I would've
divorced him long ago.

490
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:15,625
I'm also envious of

491
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,785
your relationship with Jin.

492
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:18,385
You two are always together.

493
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:21,265
But I like it more when
he's not by my side.

494
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:22,905
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

495
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:23,944
The further we are from each other,

496
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:24,745
the more we long for each other, right?

497
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:26,424
You should be cautious.

498
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:28,545
Listen, at this crucial moment,

499
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:29,625
work is the least of your concern.

500
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,464
You need to make sure nothing bad
happens in your personal life too.

501
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:32,265
Remember,

502
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:34,505
do not get pregnant.

503
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:36,224
Don't get a divorce out of the blue.

504
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,625
I hope so.

505
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:41,665
Alright. See you tonight, Hui.

506
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:42,265
Goodbye.

507
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:43,025
Goodbye.

508
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,145
I've heard that Ms. Bian Jing

509
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:11,545
has a student she was proud of.

510
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:13,145
And today, you're finally willing

511
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:14,184
to offer her to us.

512
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:17,145
Ms. Tang, thank you for the compliment.

513
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:28,665
Welcome

514
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:29,584
to Cheng & Hui.

515
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:31,985
Thank you, Ms. Tang.

516
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:35,665
I heard that you're already married.

517
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:37,385
How long have you been married?

518
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:39,464
What does your husband do for a living?

519
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,424
Her husband is working in
the financial sector.

520
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,304
The financial sector, huh?

521
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:49,865
Ms. Tang, please resume your business.

522
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:50,785
I'll bring her around

523
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:51,704
the office.

524
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:52,625
Okay.

525
00:21:56,424 --> 00:21:57,824
Hello, Mr. Zhang?

526
00:21:58,304 --> 00:21:58,785
Yes.

527
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:37,505
Good evening.

528
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:39,905
Hello.

529
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:40,905
Please have a seat.

530
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:44,340
- Vivian.
- Susan.

531
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,580
I missed you!

532
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:47,304
I missed you too!

533
00:22:47,505 --> 00:22:48,665
You're as beautiful as always.

534
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:49,940
You're always so beautiful.

535
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:50,944
Really?

536
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,584
Yeah.

537
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:56,060
You'll surely like my present.

538
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:58,665
Okay.

539
00:22:58,785 --> 00:22:59,505
Thank you.

540
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,625
Thank you.

541
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:01,745
Please take your seat.

542
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,224
Sorry for being late.

543
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:10,104
Mr. Jin.

544
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:11,385
- Jin.
- Mr. Jin.

545
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:12,584
You're here?

546
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:16,665
Happy 20th anniversary

547
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:18,385
to you and Mr. Jin.

548
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:19,944
May you two grow old together.

549
00:23:22,145 --> 00:23:23,424
Thanks for the kind thought.

550
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:25,625
You look great today.

551
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,785
Do I?

552
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:29,745
Did you see

553
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:31,145
the most elegant person over there?

554
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:32,145
Who?

555
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:33,745
The one with all the jewels
and accessories.

556
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,944
She's the president of the
Association for Women Entrepreneurs,

557
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:37,745
Lan Xiaoting.

558
00:23:38,424 --> 00:23:40,625
If you maintain a good relationship
with her,

559
00:23:40,745 --> 00:23:41,224
to you

560
00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:42,304
when you work as

561
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:43,905
a lawyer for enterprises in the future.

562
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:46,064
According to reliable sources,

563
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:47,424
they're going to change their

564
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:48,385
legal adviser soon.

565
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:49,865
Seems like that's your new target.

566
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:53,064
It's not only my target,
it's yours as well.

567
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,025
There's an unspoken rule

568
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:56,584
in their circle.

569
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:58,145
They do not interact with single women

570
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,025
or divorcees.

571
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:03,385
Maybe it was a cause
of concern before this.

572
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:06,625
If you win Ms. Lan to your side,

573
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:08,424
forget about the position on 11th Floor.

574
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,025
I'll give you anything you want.

575
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,304
I'll even appoint you
as one of our partners if you wish.

576
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:15,145
Lan,

577
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:17,104
this is

578
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:18,064
the rising star

579
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:19,545
who I've mentioned just now.

580
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:20,905
This is Ms. Qin Shi.

581
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:22,145
Hello, Ms. Lan.

582
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:25,905
Nice to meet you.

583
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:27,104
Ms. Qin, you've achieved this much

584
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:28,385
at such a young age.

585
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:29,385
You're impressive.

586
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:31,385
It's all because of Hui's teaching.

587
00:24:31,424 --> 00:24:32,025
Hui, please continue

588
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,064
to guide me in the future.

589
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:34,985
She's so eloquent.

590
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:35,985
That's right.

591
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:37,104
Ms. Lan,

592
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:38,025
your dress

593
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:39,505
looks perfect on you.

594
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:41,745
Ms. Lan, you look perfect.

595
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:44,104
Where do you do
your skincare maintenance usually?

596
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:46,025
I don't do anything

597
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:47,184
in particular.

598
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:48,545
I just like to do yoga

599
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:49,505
on a constant basis.

600
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:51,464
It helps us to regulate our balance

601
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,665
and reduce stress.

602
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:55,104
Youngsters like you all

603
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:56,304
should exercise more often.

604
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,985
Health is wealth, you know?

605
00:24:57,985 --> 00:24:58,665
You have a point.

606
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:00,304
Ms. Lan, please excuse me.

607
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:01,224
I have a call to answer.

608
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:03,905
Go now.

609
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:05,745
I'm curious about something.

610
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:07,184
I know you're a busy person.

611
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:08,344
Where did you find time to do yoga?

612
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,625
How many times do you do yoga per week?

613
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:13,704
Mom, don't worry.

614
00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:14,745
I'm here.

615
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:17,145
Yes, everyone is here.

616
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,265
Excuse me, do you
have an invitation card?

617
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,464
I'm looking for Ms. Li Dai.

618
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:20,424
Alright, this way, please.

619
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:21,505
Ms. Li is on the rooftop.

620
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:22,385
Thank you.

621
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,304
James Yang?

622
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:28,905
I finally saw you in person.

623
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:30,545
You are?

624
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:31,944
That's not important.

625
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,304
I'll bring you to her.

626
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:34,025
But...

627
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:35,464
She's over there.

628
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,860
Come.

629
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:45,145
Qin Shi,

630
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:46,665
how dare you keep this secret from me?

631
00:25:46,665 --> 00:25:47,665
What?

632
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:49,424
I found out about your secret.

633
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,620
Everyone is looking at you.
Don't do it here.

634
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,580
Go to talk somewhere else.

635
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,420
Actually, only members
can access this area.

636
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,540
Are you here to look for a friend?

637
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,980
That's my personal affair.

638
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,220
I don't think I need to tell you that.

639
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,020
Your lips...

640
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,420
Let me introduce myself.

641
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,780
I'm Qin Shi.

642
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,620
You're Yang Hua, right?

643
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,340
How did you know my name?

644
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,420
Do we know each other?

645
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,020
We don't.

646
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:53,780
If so,

647
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,980
why did you do that?

648
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,260
Let's drop that topic.

649
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,340
I have one question for you.

650
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,820
Can you explain yourself?

651
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,060
Hey.

652
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,780
Close the door.

653
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,580
Since when

654
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,540
did I get married?

655
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,900
Is there a need to deceive them?

656
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
You're not deceiving them.

657
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,460
This is a strategic disguise.

658
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,460
I'm a lawyer.

659
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,740
My credibility is vital to my career.

660
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,980
Let me ask you this then.

661
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,820
Do you wish to work at Cheng & Hui?

662
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,820
Of course.

663
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,580
If so, you have to get married.

664
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,580
But why?

665
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,660
Single female lawyers

666
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,460
have no future in Cheng & Hui.

667
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,980
At most, you'll reach the rank
of a senior attorney.

668
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,300
If you don't believe me, you can tell

669
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,420
Tang Yihui about your current status.

670
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,500
I dare to say that she won't even

671
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,580
provide you with a job opportunity.

672
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,780
But why?

673
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,140
That doesn't make any sense.

674
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,740
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

675
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,660
Will you agree to it

676
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,020
if I told you earlier?

677
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,940
I won't.

678
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,620
That's why I made the decision for you.

679
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,260
So,

680
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,020
in order to develop your career,

681
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,940
you found a random person
on the Internet

682
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,620
and pretended to be married to him.

683
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,860
And I

684
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,060
became your husband

685
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,180
unknowingly,

686
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,180
is that the case?

687
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,060
Actually, it wasn't random.

688
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,180
But that doesn't matter.

689
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,180
You have a clear understanding

690
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,220
of the situation.

691
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,940
So,

692
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,220
I'm very sorry about this.

693
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,540
But don't worry.

694
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,460
I've never used your identity

695
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,740
to commit any crimes.

696
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,300
Actually, I think

697
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,660
I would've never encountered you
in this lifetime

698
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,540
if it weren't for this coincidence.

699
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,060
I promise you this.

700
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,500
You'll still be the same you
after you exit the door.

701
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,500
We will

702
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,140
not be affiliated with each other.

703
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,580
It won't

704
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,300
affect you in any way as well.

705
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,340
How can you be sure of that?

706
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,460
Have you ever heard of
the butterfly effect?

707
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,380
The flap of a butterfly's wing

708
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,380
might even cause

709
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,220
the NASDAQ Composite to fluctuate.

710
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,140
How can you be sure

711
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,140
that your lie

712
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
won't affect my future

713
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,420
in any way?

714
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,020
I...

715
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,780
I cannot guarantee that.

716
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,380
Right now, everyone outside

717
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,740
thinks that I'm your husband.

718
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,540
According to
the Six Degrees of Separation,

719
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,020
this can also mean

720
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,940
that everyone knows

721
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,420
that we're a married couple.

722
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,700
Your behavior

723
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,020
has already affected me

724
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,020
physically and mentally.

725
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,620
If so,

726
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,580
what else can I do for you?

727
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,060
Why don't you make some requests?

728
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:47,860
Let's see

729
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,340
if we can reach a compromise.

730
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
I want to get a divorce.

731
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,220
Yes, we're especially busy this year.

732
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,100
Ms. Lan.

733
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,980
Danping? Come here.

734
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,460
Let me introduce her.

735
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,420
This is my niece, Zhao Danping.

736
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,380
I brought her

737
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,740
to the association so that
she could help me out.

738
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,860
Danping,

739
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,540
this is Tang Yihui.

740
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,180
She's the owner of Cheng & Hui,
the best law firm

741
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,180
in all of Pujiang.

742
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,740
Lan,

743
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,980
I guess talent

744
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,180
runs in the family, huh?

745
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,580
All of you are smart, capable,

746
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
and beautiful too.

747
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,300
Nice to meet you.

748
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,620
You can call me Yihui.

749
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,500
Ms. Tang, you flatter me.

750
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,260
Speaking of competence,

751
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,140
no one can best a lawyer.

752
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,260
Your speaking skills alone

753
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,100
can make us give up without a fight.

754
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,100
I came in a hurry.

755
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,660
I didn't bring any gifts with me.

756
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,300
I can only wish you and your husband

757
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,900
a happy anniversary.

758
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,420
Ms. Zhao, you're too courteous.

759
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,060
You two may enjoy your chat.

760
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,100
I'll excuse myself first.

761
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,180
Alright, please go ahead.

762
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,220
Let's go.

763
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,340
Hello, Qiao?

764
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,860
Ms. Lan has entered the room.

765
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,860
Did you see her?

766
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,820
Yes, she just entered the room.

767
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,140
Sorry about that.

768
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,020
Did you see the girl

769
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,900
beside her?

770
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,300
I did. What's the matter?

771
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,380
Her name is Zhao Danping.

772
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,420
According to Ms. Lan, she's her niece.

773
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,420
Do a background check on her.

774
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,060
Zhao Danping?

775
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
Alright, I got it.

776
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,580
Hello, Ms. Tang?

777
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,100
This is Li Dai.

778
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,020
What's the deal

779
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,740
with Zhao Danping?

780
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,300
Zhao Danping

781
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,700
is the niece of Ms. Lan.

782
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,540
It's no wonder

783
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,260
she gave me such a reaction

784
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
after she heard about Cheng & Hui.

785
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,580
I would've given a stronger reaction

786
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,860
if someone else

787
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,260
took 120 million away from me.

788
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,620
Ms. Tang, Mr. Jin,

789
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,420
I've done a background check on her.

790
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,660
Zhao Danping

791
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,740
is the niece of Ms. Lan indeed.

792
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,860
Her mother

793
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,540
was Ms. Lan's biological sister.

794
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,660
However, she passed away
a few years ago.

795
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,940
I've read both the divorce agreement

796
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,900
and the materials.

797
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,900
Li Dai did nothing wrong.

798
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,100
If I were in her shoes,
I would've been more ruthless.

799
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

800
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,540
I've spent the entire year
building up connections

801
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,940
in vain.

802
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,660
Alright now.

803
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,180
Don't be angry.

804
00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,980
Even if this is our case,

805
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,060
we can't just do a background check

806
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,820
on everyone, right?

807
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,540
Besides,

808
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,580
it's not like

809
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,100
we have no chance to make a comeback.

810
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,100
Let's wait for a little longer.

811
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,660
With your wit,

812
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,140
maybe you can turn misfortunes
into blessings.

813
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,460
Even if it doesn't work out,

814
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,220
we have enough clients

815
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,380
to sustain our business.

816
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,900
It doesn't matter
even if we lose Ms. Lan.

817
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,860
You don't need to work that hard.

818
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,940
Losing Ms. Lan doesn't matter?

819
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,900
She's our door to
a huge business circle, you know?

820
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,260
The circle itself is worth
hundreds of billions of yuan, you know?

821
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,620
Look at you.

822
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,900
You were the beau of
the Faculty of Law, you know?

823
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
Why do you keep talking about

824
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,060
such materialistic things?

825
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,100
Enough already.

826
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,940
Our guests are waiting for us.

827
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,140
Let's go.

828
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,940
Don't be angry.

829
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,300
Your request

830
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,180
is very reasonable.

831
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,220
I will tend to it as soon as possible.

832
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,380
How soon?

833
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,460
My situation

834
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,380
is a little complicated.

835
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,620
I need some time

836
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,660
to explain myself to them.

837
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,060
Maybe three months.

838
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,900
Three days.

839
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,300
I can wait three days
at most.

840
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,060
Three days? Isn't that...

841
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,740
Miss Qin,

842
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,300
I'm already being thoughtful here.

843
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,820
I just want you

844
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,980
to announce our divorce on your end.

845
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,980
I don't even need you

846
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,380
to clarify the truth.

847
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,140
Under such circumstances,

848
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,860
I don't think it's appropriate for you

849
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
to make another request.

850
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,820
Miss Qin,

851
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
if you can't agree to this,

852
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,300
I have to suspect you

853
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,660
for dragging me down

854
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,260
into a rabbit hole.

855
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,620
If that's the case,

856
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,700
I think you should

857
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,380
explain yourself

858
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,380
to your boss and colleagues.

859
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,660
Three days!

860
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,100
Three days it is then.

861
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,460
Empty promises don't count.

862
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,460
Let's draft an agreement.

863
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,740
Mister, I don't think that's necessary.

864
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,300
Miss Qin, you're a lawyer.

865
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,540
You should know better than me

866
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,740
that a verbal agreement
is not legally bound

867
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,140
compared with a written agreement.

868
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,780
Don't tell me you're trying
to break your promise?

869
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,660
Of course

870
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,900
I won't break my promise.

871
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,060
Mr. Yang, you have
great legal awareness.

872
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,820
Here's a thumbs-up.

873
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,220
Thanks.

874
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,540
So, who'll draft it up?

875
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,180
Hui, what's the matter?

876
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,500
Where are you?

877
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,780
I'm nearby.

878
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,500
I'm not interrupting you two, right?

879
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,620
Are you two having a date?

880
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,900
Young girl, you should be more reserved.

881
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,140
This is a public area.

882
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,820
Everything's fine
between you two, right?

883
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,860
Yeah.

884
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,220
We're doing pretty good.

885
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,940
I'm so glad to hear that.

886
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,100
I can't afford to hear

887
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,020
another piece of bad news.

888
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,140
Did something bad happen?

889
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,860
What's the matter?

890
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,740
It's nothing.
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

891
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,060
Jog with me tomorrow morning,

892
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:07,980
okay?

893
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,900
Alright, I got it.

894
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,740
I'll hang up now. Goodbye.

895
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,420
(Divorce agreement
Part A: Yang Hua Part B: Qin Shi)

896
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,380
(Divorce agreement
Part A: Yang Hua Part B: Qin Shi)

897
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,220
(Party A:  Party B:)

898
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,660
This looks reasonable.

899
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,700
(Party A:  Party B:)

900
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,420
Sign it then.

901
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,140
I wish to add another term to it.

902
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,820
What is it?

903
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,460
You need to keep
this agreement confidential

904
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,900
for three days.

905
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,740
You're not allowed
to come to my company.

906
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,820
You're not allowed

907
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,300
to contact my colleagues either.

908
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,300
During this period,

909
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,220
if anyone recognizes you

910
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,260
as my husband,

911
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,900
you have to notify me immediately,

912
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,100
and,

913
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,860
you cannot deny your identity.

914
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,660
If I have to incur losses in my career

915
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,380
because of you,

916
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,900
I have the right to demand
compensation from you.

917
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,740
How much?

918
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,860
You have to pay me
twice my annual salary.

919
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,260
Only for three days?

920
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,140
Yes.

921
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,220
Alright.

922
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,900
Let's carpool back together later.

923
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,340
Sure.

924
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,620
I'm returning to the company.

925
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,500
Are you guys returning
to the company too?

926
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,420
Yeah.

927
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,380
Ms. Qin.

928
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,220
- Ms. Qin.
- Ms. Qin.

929
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:06,860
The elevator is here.

930
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,300
Let's go.

931
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,060
You can wait for me at home tonight.

932
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,100
I'll head home later.

933
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,380
No need for that.

934
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,220
I've already cleaned everything.

935
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,820
You can wait for me downstairs.

936
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,060
It's okay.

937
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,100
I'm going to head back
and fulfill my duties

938
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,060
as a wife and a mother.

939
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,580
Initially, I intend to take my time

940
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,100
to achieve my goals.

941
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,700
But now, it seems like

942
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,180
I need to speed things up.

943
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,860
I believe in you.

944
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,740
I believe that you can definitely do it.

945
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,740
However, you have to protect yourself

946
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,820
before

947
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,940
your goals are achieved.

948
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,460
If I were you,

949
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,220
I would not reveal
this secret to the world.

950
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,380
If everyone only cares about themselves

951
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,380
and tries to escape
from their responsibilities,

952
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,700
their mistakes will never be rectified.

953
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,660
In the end, this unpredictable world

954
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,380
will make everyone

955
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
pay a price for it.

956
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,460
God of Wealth, what's wrong?

957
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,740
Did Grandma chase you out again?

958
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,700
That's fine.

959
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,900
I'll apologize to her.

960
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,340
Mom.

961
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,700
Mom?

962
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,580
Who's there?

963
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,020
Mom,

964
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,620
why can't I unlock my door?

965
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,180
I've already changed the lock.

966
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,060
Our house doesn't welcome

967
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,420
an unfilial son like you.

968
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,980
You can come back

969
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,340
when you've decided to get married.

970
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,860
Mom, can you stop messing around?

971
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,980
Where can I go at this hour?

972
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,740
Mom?

973
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,460
Mom?

974
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,260
If you dare to open the door for him,

975
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,180
you can join him on the streets.

976
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,980
I'm going to lock the door.

977
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,740
I'm just checking
if you've locked the door.

978
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,500
It's dangerous

979
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,660
if we don't lock our doors

980
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,100
before sleeping.

981
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,820
Mom.

982
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,740
Hua,

983
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,780
your mother is throwing
a tantrum right now.

984
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,980
Go outside and
lay low for the time being.

985
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,460
I'll persuade her to change her mind

986
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,340
once she's not angry at you.

987
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,380
I've kept something good for you

988
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,220
in the water meter room.

989
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,260
You can use them for the time being.

990
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
This is all I can do for you.
