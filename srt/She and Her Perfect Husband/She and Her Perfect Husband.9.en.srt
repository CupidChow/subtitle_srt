=Episode 9=

19
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:57,964
Love only lasts for 18 months

20
00:01:58,204 --> 00:01:59,443
but a marriage lasts forever.

21
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:01,284
I don't think

22
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:02,524
fluctuating hormones

23
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:03,484
provide a good basis

24
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:04,844
for a stable legal bond.

25
00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:06,763
I want to get married

26
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:08,003
because being single

27
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,363
is too costly.

28
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:10,604
I'm busy.

29
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:11,483
I don't have time to date.

30
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:12,804
Yang Hua is the same.

31
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:15,044
He wants to get married. He doesn't
want to fall in love.

32
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:16,843
We struck a deal

33
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:18,203
and decide to get married.

34
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:19,443
Do you have other questions?

35
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:21,723
Hua.

36
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:23,404
When did you

37
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:25,124
want to marry without love?

38
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:26,923
I thought you didn't want
to get married.

39
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:29,483
Mom, before

40
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,524
I met Miss Qin,

41
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:31,604
I didn't want to get married.

42
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,684
But after I met her, I...

43
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:36,843
Marriage without love

44
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:38,083
will never last.

45
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,684
You're ruining your future here.

46
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:41,804
Mom.

47
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:43,884
Feelings come with times.

48
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:45,804
Yang Hua and I share

49
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:46,723
the same set of values.

50
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:48,884
In my opinion, physical attraction

51
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:50,083
initiates a good relationship.

52
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:51,524
Then, your personality shapes it

53
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:52,483
before your values seal it.

54
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:53,604
A compatible set of values

55
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:54,723
means no conflicts.

56
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:56,604
That is the most conducive

57
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:57,804
environment to develop a bond.

58
00:02:58,164 --> 00:02:59,324
Quoting you just now,

59
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:00,283
I am an excellent individual.

60
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:01,604
And I am willing

61
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:02,684
to marry Yang Hua.

62
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:04,964
Do you have other questions?

63
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:06,124
Weren't you hoping

64
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:07,124
that he would get married soon?

65
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,003
Yes,

66
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:10,164
I was.

67
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:11,884
But he should

68
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,363
find someone the proper way.

69
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:18,363
Can I

70
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:19,604
interpret what you just said

71
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,483
as Yang Hua can get married,

72
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:23,404
but it'll be you who decide

73
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:24,964
whether his partner

74
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:26,723
is a good fit for him.

75
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:27,843
Not him?

76
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:30,884
That's not what I meant.

77
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:34,723
Hua.

78
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:37,604
I'm happy to see you get married

79
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,964
but I want you

80
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:40,363
to find someone suitable for you,

81
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:42,443
someone you truly like.

82
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:44,244
I'm not going to hurt you.

83
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:45,843
Listen to me.

84
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:51,884
Mom, I think

85
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:53,443
Miss Qin is a good fit.

86
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,283
No.

87
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:56,923
She's irreverent

88
00:03:56,923 --> 00:03:58,964
towards marriage.

89
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:00,684
If you get married,

90
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:01,923
divorce is only ending.

91
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:03,124
Besides,

92
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:04,164
our family

93
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:05,964
has never had a divorced couple.

94
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:07,923
No. I won't agree to this!

95
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:09,843
You claim

96
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,083
to have your son's best interest at heart.

97
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:12,643
But did you ever consider

98
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:13,923
his feelings?

99
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:16,804
He didn't want to get married

100
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:19,203
so you forced him
to attend matchmaking events.

101
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:20,643
He wants to get married now

102
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,083
and you're making it harder for him.

103
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:23,564
He's single. So?

104
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:25,203
He's married. So?

105
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,603
He's divorced. So?

106
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:29,163
Do you care about your son

107
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,923
or do you care about how others

108
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:32,724
would view you and your son?

109
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:34,124
As a mother,

110
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:35,203
you should

111
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:36,883
give him your support

112
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:37,763
and understanding.

113
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,043
You should protect him from

114
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,203
the societal prejudices,

115
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:42,844
instead of joining them

116
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:45,004
and hurting him.

117
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,083
Let's go home, Hua.

118
00:04:55,883 --> 00:04:57,444
I won't force you to get married now

119
00:04:57,763 --> 00:04:59,404
or attend any matchmaking events.

120
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:01,124
I will not say a thing

121
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:03,203
even if you remain single forever.

122
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:10,363
Let's go.

123
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:11,564
Hua.

124
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:13,323
Let's go home.

125
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:13,883
Mom.

126
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,363
One more thing.

127
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:18,564
I hope this is the first

128
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:20,004
and the last time

129
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:21,643
we speak like this.

130
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,124
I don't want you

131
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,244
to barge into my workplace

132
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:28,004
without giving me prior notice

133
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,844
nor do I want you to discuss

134
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,284
anything about me with my colleagues.

135
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:33,844
People like you

136
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,124
do not respect the elderly or your superior.

137
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:38,004
I won't come here even if you invite me.

138
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,684
Go, Hua.

139
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:39,643
We're going home.

140
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:41,163
Come.

141
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:46,163
No.

142
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:47,284
Here.

143
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:04,804
You can go back first.

144
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:05,444
What?

145
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:07,244
Why aren't you going back with me?

146
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,724
I still have some business to attend.

147
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:11,203
I'll be home once I'm done.

148
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:14,603
Promise me you'll be home.

149
00:06:15,564 --> 00:06:16,444
Give me your word.

150
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:18,284
I believe you.

151
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,083
I'll cook your favorite tonight.

152
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:21,444
I got it, mom.

153
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:21,923
Go.

154
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:23,043
Take care.

155
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:24,124
Remember to come home.

156
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:26,444
Bye, Mom.

157
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,363
Excuse me.

158
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,603

Qianqian,

165
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,244
why didn't you pick up the phone?

166

(Senior Attorney)

167
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:35,284
Stop shoving.

What are you looking at?

00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:54,363
Qianqian.

173
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:56,163
Give me the latest document

Why?

178
00:08:09,964 --> 00:08:11,323
They have

179
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:13,524
made us work so hard.

180
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:15,244
And yet, they want to remind me

181
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,844
of how single I am.

182
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:19,804
The sweetness hurts!

00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:21,323
Oh, my heart!

Don't wear high heels that often.

201
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:15,324

00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:56,483
(My mind is going crazy.)

243
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,684
(Can you help me sort it out?)

244
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:00,283
In what kind of situation

245
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:01,603
do you

246
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:03,523
have to hide your marriage
from your mom?

247
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,644
I won't hide it.

248
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:07,283
I'm old enough as it is.

249
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:10,244
If...

250
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,843
If you're married for two years,

251
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,843
you and your spouse have the looks,
have the income,

252
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:17,043
have the perfect chemistry,

253
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,564
and even have a child.

254
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:22,004
Why would you hide the marriage
from your mother?

255
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:23,043
Why?

256
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,084
Why?

257
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,843
Why?

258
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:30,684
Why are you asking me this question?

259
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:32,244
It's not meant to be answered.

260
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:34,204
(For example,)

261
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:35,444
(my mom and my wife)

262
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:36,403
(fall into the river at the same time.)

263
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:37,403
Who should I save first?

264
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:40,124
What if your mother

265
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:41,483
doesn't know you're married

266
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:42,483
and keeps asking you
to attend matchmaking events?

267
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:43,403
Will you go?

268
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:45,444
No, this is getting annoying.

269
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:47,004
What if you did attend
the matchmaking event?

270
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,684
Let me tell you this.

271
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:52,804
If that ever happens, it's either

272
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:55,004
one, I'm doing it to shut my mother up

273
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:55,963
or two,

274
00:12:56,363 --> 00:12:58,004
I'm cheating on my wife.

275
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,004
So you're saying

276
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:00,723
regardless if you're doing this
to silence your mother

277
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:01,963
or if you're cheating,

278
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:05,043
this means your marriage

279
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:06,523
isn't as perfect as it shows.

280
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:07,204
Right?

281
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,043
Yes.

282
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:13,204
I see.

283
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:23,140
If Yang Hua lied about being single,

284
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,980
(Qin Shi Yang Hua Yang Hua's mother)
If Yang Hua lied about being single,

285
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,004
then Qin Shi could also lie

286
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:29,523
about her perfect marriage.

287
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:31,244
Yang Hua either has

288
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,523
a secret and he

289
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,244
has to keep the marriage under wraps

290
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,363
or he

291
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,324
(Qin Shi, Yang Hua, Yang Hua's mother)
is a casanova.

292
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:44,043
If Yang Hua

293
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:47,684
(Qin Shi, Yang Hua, Yang Hua's mother)
is single...

294
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:53,124
Oh, lord!

295
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:58,004
If Yang Hua is single,

296
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:03,283
then Qin Shi

297
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,523
is unmarried!

298
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,140
(Qin Shi, Yang Hua, Yang Hua's mother)

299
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:15,324
You're lying.

300
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,204
Wow.

301
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:25,923
Bon appétit.

302
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:36,204
Baby.

303
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:39,043
Isn't this place expensive?

304
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:40,603
It's okay.

305
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:43,684
To celebrate getting my freedom back,

306
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:45,444
we have to eat something fancy.

307
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,363
Even if we dine at a hawker stall

308
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:50,324
by the street,

309
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:51,804
I'll be over the moon too.

310
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:55,804
Let's go to somewhere else.

311
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,923
You're like an angel.

312
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:03,843
But, if you're with me,

313
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:05,564
you'll have to enjoy

314
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,124
a good life.

315
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:14,403
I don't want this one and this one.

316
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:15,603
For the rest,

317
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:17,723
give me one portion each.

318
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:19,244
Noted.

319
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:23,963
All is your favorite food.

320
00:15:26,163 --> 00:15:27,603
Kombu pork ribs soup.

321
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,324
The news of your return

322
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:31,564
makes your father so happy

323
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,684
that he prepared a table full of dishes.

324
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:36,043
Try this.

325
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:37,483
Braised pork belly.

326
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:38,963
Home-cooked food is the best.

327
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:40,884
- It's delicious.
- Of course.

328
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,324
Have some more.

329
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:43,564
Look at you.

330
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:45,004
You spent a few days out there

331
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:46,644
and you have lost so much weight.

332
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:48,483
It breaks my heart.

333
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:49,004
Here,

334
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:50,603
eat more.

335
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:51,963
- Eat up.
- Yang. Come.

336
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:53,923
After the dinner,

337
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:56,363
carry Hua's luggage back.

338
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,644
Are you going to move back?

339
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:00,923
What about Qin?

340
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:02,324
Just eat up.

341
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:04,564
No need to mention an outsider.

342
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:09,324
Dad, mom.

343
00:16:09,564 --> 00:16:11,363
I know both of you were worried sick

344
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:12,884
because of what I did earlier.

345
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:14,163
For that, I apologize.

346
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,644
It's just a squabble between a mother
and her son.

347
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:22,363
It's not a big deal.

348
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:25,043
Many things

349
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:26,324
have happened

350
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:28,163
so I have learned so much.

351
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:30,043
I was very selfish back then.

352
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:32,163
I based happiness

353
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:33,843
on your selfless sacrifices.

354
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:35,923
I enjoyed your care

355
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:36,884
but I didn't

356
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:38,444
reciprocate your feelings.

357
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:39,923
I asked for freedom

358
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:41,004
but I relied on you

359
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:42,043
to provide support.

360
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:43,923
I had no right to do that.

361
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,764
After spending some time with Qin Shi,

362
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:51,764
I discovered that she has

363
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:53,004
many qualities I don't.

364
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:54,403
She is brave,

365
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:55,804
independent and responsible.

366
00:16:56,124 --> 00:16:57,084
Most importantly,

367
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:58,363
she has the courage

368
00:16:58,363 --> 00:16:59,324
to face challenges.

369
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:00,963
Hua.

370
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:02,843
Why are you telling us this?

371
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:04,684
Mom.

372
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:06,403
You were disrespectful

373
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,643
when you barged into

374
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:08,564
Qin Shi's office today.

375
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:12,043
You said you had a business to attend.

376
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:12,804
Did you

377
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:14,283
go to Qin Shi's law firm?

378
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:19,204
As a competent businesswoman,

379
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,003
Miss Qin already has

380
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:22,844
a lot of obstacles

381
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,003
on her plate.

382
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:26,084
I don't want my relationship with her

383
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,964
to draw any criticism

384
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:28,844
to her.

385
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,163
It's not fair to her.

386
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:31,923
Hua.

387
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:33,684
Mom, I know

388
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,123
you love me very much.

389
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:36,724
But Qin Shi's parents love her

390
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,484
very much too.

391
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:38,684
You love me but it doesn't mean

392
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:39,883
you can hurt someone else's child.

393
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:41,324
Also, her parents'

394
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:42,403
marital problems

395
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:44,403
are not hers to bear.

396
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:47,003
I said it

397
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:48,484
in the heat of the moment.

398
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:50,324
But Yang Hua,

399
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,523
a family has a huge influence

400
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:53,763
on an individual.

401
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:54,964
But she still nonetheless

402
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:56,564
becomes an excellent lawyer.

403
00:17:57,403 --> 00:17:58,643
On the contrary, I think

404
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:02,003
her parents raised her well.

405
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:03,684
Mom.

406
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:06,324
Even if I won't marry Qin Shi,

407
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:08,444
I don't plan to move back here.

408
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:10,883
I want to be independent.

409
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:12,724
I'm almost 30.

410
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,804
It's the age for a man
to be independent.

411
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:16,163
It's time for me to learn
to be responsible for my life.

412
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,043
Hua.

413
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:19,844
We agreed to this.

414
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:21,163
Just move back.

415
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:23,084
I will not force you to do anything.

416
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:24,123
Good.

417
00:18:24,123 --> 00:18:26,003
Well said, Hua.

418
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:28,003
For what you just said,

419
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:29,123
I'll make an exception today

420
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:30,324
and you'll drink with me.

421
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:33,684
You're ruining it.

422
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:34,643
I'm ruining it?

423
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:36,643
You only have yourself to blame

424
00:18:36,643 --> 00:18:38,163
for the entire debacle.

425
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:39,883
Hurry up now.

426
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:41,844
Bring out that bottle of good wine that I keep.

427
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:44,003
I'll drink with my son today.

428
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:45,283
Are you out of your mind?

429
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:47,804
That bottle is for Hua's
wedding night.

430
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:49,523
I'll drink it today

431
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:51,084
because I'm happy.

432
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:52,084
Go now.

433
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:52,763
Don't dally.

434
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:53,523
Take it out.

435
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:54,724
Hurry.

436
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:56,643
I can't deal with this.

437
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:58,564
Hua.

438
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:01,283
Well said.

439
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:09,883
Hua,

440
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,204
if

441
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:14,243
you listened to your mom

442
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:15,883
and moved back today,

443
00:19:16,003 --> 00:19:18,444
I wouldn't be this happy.

444
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,324
After I heard

445
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:21,484
what you just said,

446
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:23,724
I feel proud.

447
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:27,964
Even though you're jobless

448
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:30,684
and keeps a pet tortoise,

449
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,444
you're not a spineless man.

450
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,643
You can hold your ground.

451
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:37,123
For that,

452
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:38,444
we should have a toast.

453
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:50,123
Hua,

454
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:52,844
I don't know this Miss Qin

455
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:53,883
very much

456
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,084
but

457
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,163
if she can change you this much

458
00:19:58,204 --> 00:19:59,964
after a few days together,

459
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:01,763
then she

460
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:03,763
is definitely someone extraordinary.

461
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:04,923
She is amazing.

462
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:11,204
Marriage can wait, can't it?

463
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:12,123
If there's time,

464
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:14,444
you guys can continue dating.

465
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:15,804
Okay?

466
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:19,564
Come.

467
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:21,204
Another glass.

468
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:28,123
Eat some.

469
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:33,003
Mister,

470
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:35,204
if you can't pay with your phone,

471
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:37,324
we accept cards here too.

472
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:39,844
Hold on.

473
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:41,684
Darling.

474
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:43,724
Can you pay for me first?

475
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:45,484
Something's wrong with my phone.

476
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:46,523
I can't load it.

477
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:49,684
Did you forget the password?

478
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:50,523
No.

479
00:20:50,523 --> 00:20:51,923
It must be an update or something.

480
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:52,564
There must be a mistake.

481
00:20:52,844 --> 00:20:53,883
Can you pay for me first?

482
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:56,324
But

483
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,043
I don't know if I have enough money.

484
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:00,564
Money.

485
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:02,324
It's 7,480 yuan in total.

486
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,364
That's so expensive.

487
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:06,163
But...

488
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:06,923
Just use your card.

489
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:07,844
Don't worry.

490
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:09,003
I have a spare phone in my car.

491
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:09,883
I'll transfer the money to you later.

492
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:10,643
Go ahead.

493
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,243
It's alright, just pay it.

494
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:22,684
7,480 yuan.

495
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:23,844
Yes.

496
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,020
(Simpleton)

497
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,380
(Simpleton)

498
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:02,844
What takes you so long?

499
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:05,084
What's the matter?

500
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:06,484
Let me in, Sister-in-law.

501
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:07,684
Do you know how...

502
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:09,163
Just let me in.

503
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:09,923
Wenyu, you can't come in.

504
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:10,403
Why?

505
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,763
Mother called us

506
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:15,604
and told us not to keep you.

507
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:16,923
Go home.

508
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:18,643
Seriously, sister-in-law?

509
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:19,523
You're

510
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:20,484
joining them too?

511
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:20,763
Just

512
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:21,444
call my brother to come here.

513
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:22,484
I'll talk to him.

514
00:22:22,484 --> 00:22:24,084
He's studying in the study room.

515
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:26,003
I never disturb him when he does that.

516
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:27,163
Listen to me.

517
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:28,444
Go home.

518
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:29,444
But...

519
00:22:29,444 --> 00:22:30,283
Sister-in-law.

520
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:31,684
Meimei set me up.

521
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,283
All of you

522
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,883
are forcing me to take drastic measures.

523
00:22:35,243 --> 00:22:37,084
We want to help you

524
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:38,204
but your brother

525
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:39,564
was furious about this.

526
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:40,844
I get nervous

527
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:41,923
when your brother is angry.

528
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:43,523
Please help me.

529
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:44,403
Sister-in-law.

530
00:22:44,403 --> 00:22:44,804
I...

531
00:22:44,804 --> 00:22:45,204
No,

532
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:46,163
Sister-in-law.

533
00:22:47,604 --> 00:22:48,163
Okay.

534
00:22:48,163 --> 00:22:49,643
Sister-in-law.

535
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:51,724
You know what?

536
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:55,364
Just lend me some money.

537
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:56,204
I don't have

538
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:57,643
any money with me.

539
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:58,724
I hailed a cab to come here.

540
00:22:58,724 --> 00:22:59,883
I haven't paid the driver yet.

541
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:01,364
He's waiting for me downstairs.

542
00:23:01,364 --> 00:23:02,684
Lend me some money.

543
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,604
Okay.

544
00:23:04,604 --> 00:23:05,403
Wait.

545
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:07,403
No. No need to close the door.

546
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:08,003
No.

547
00:23:08,084 --> 00:23:10,043
Close it.

548
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:13,883
What the hell?

549
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:18,204
Thanks, sister-in-law.

550
00:23:19,604 --> 00:23:20,684
Just 400 yuan?

551
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:21,084
Yes.

552
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:21,684
Give me more.

553
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:22,763
- Go back now.
- Any more and...

554
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:25,003
Sister-in-law.

555
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:29,123
Fine.

556
00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:31,804
Shunning me, aren't you?

557
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:35,844
Your family got your back at home

558
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:37,123
but your friends got your back
out there.

559
00:23:37,523 --> 00:23:39,123
I don't have many things

560
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,923
but I sure have many friends.

561
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:44,964
Why are you stopping me?

562
00:23:44,964 --> 00:23:47,043
It's not that I won't let you come here.

563
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:48,684
You saw it last time.

564
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:49,523
I defended you

565
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:50,364
and what happened next?

566
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:51,243
Your two women

567
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:52,643
almost trashed the shop.

568
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:54,123
I won't cross

569
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:54,923
your wife now.

570
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:56,643
It's fine. I'm here now.

571
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,604
What are you afraid of?

572
00:23:57,923 --> 00:23:59,364
What are you doing, Hu Peng?

573
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,283
For our brotherhood,

574
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:05,403
please

575
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:06,484
spare me.

576
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:13,123
Okay.

577
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:14,804
Fine.

578
00:24:16,484 --> 00:24:17,204
Brother.

579
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:18,643
Stop sulking.

580
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:20,324
Apologize to your wife.

581
00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:22,364
Life goes on.

582
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,340
(Low Battery)

583
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:39,084
Hello?

584
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:41,243
What are you doing?

585
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:43,204
You're about to sleep?

586
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:45,003
You see,

587
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:46,604
my phone is dying.

588
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:48,604
Can I

589
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:51,444
crash at your place for a night?

590
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:53,844
Don't get me wrong.

591
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:54,844
I can sleep on the couch.

592
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:56,444
I'm a good man. You have nothing to worry.

593
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:58,923
Really?

594
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,444
Only you care about me now.

595
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:01,724
By the way,

596
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:03,243
do you have an extra
charging cable there?

597
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:05,084
Thank you.

598
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:06,923
Hua.

599
00:25:07,243 --> 00:25:08,364
Are you all right?

600
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:09,604
Yes.

601
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:11,523
Are you sure?

602
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:14,484
Bye, Dad.

603
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:15,444
Take care.

604
00:25:19,923 --> 00:25:21,283
Stay safe.

605
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:26,484
That brat

606
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:28,364
can't drink at all.

607
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:32,243
He's such a lightweight.

608
00:25:32,243 --> 00:25:35,084
A lightweight.

609
00:26:57,804 --> 00:26:58,403
Yes?

610
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:00,444
You drank?

611
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,003
A bit.

612
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:06,763
I said

613
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:10,043
I wanted to tell you something.

614
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:12,123
Are you sober enough to hear it?

615
00:27:13,724 --> 00:27:14,403
Sure.

616
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:21,643
Have you dealt

617
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:24,003
with your family?

618
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:25,684
Yes.

619
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:28,403
What is your next step then?

620
00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:30,564
I'll move out as soon as possible.

621
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,444
I'm not rushing you.

622
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,883
You can stay here

623
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:36,043
for as long as you want.

624
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:44,084
I...

625
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:46,403
I...

626
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,243
There has been a change of plan.

627
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,403
According to our plan,

628
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:52,043
I would tell them

629
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:54,204
that you're going abroad

630
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:57,883
but since you can't.

631
00:27:58,324 --> 00:27:59,283
Tomorrow,

632
00:27:59,283 --> 00:28:01,243
there'll be a partner dinner in our firm.

633
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:02,643
They invited me

634
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:04,324
so I have to bring you there.

635
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:06,763
So

636
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:08,324
tomorrow,

637
00:28:08,324 --> 00:28:09,364
can you help me again?

638
00:28:09,364 --> 00:28:09,964
I swear

639
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:11,163
this is the last time.

640
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:21,283
Are you listening to me?

641
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:24,684
You want me to attend the partner dinner

642
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:26,123
with you tomorrow.

643
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:27,123
Are you fine with it?

644
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,523
I have a question for you.

645
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:33,724
You told me to keep

646
00:28:34,684 --> 00:28:36,163
Luowei Yulan's affairs

647
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:36,643
as secret.

648
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:37,923
Is it because your law firm

649
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:39,923
has something to do
with the 25 million debt?

650
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:48,324
Don't pull a long face.

651
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,003
You bought your lesson at least.

652
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:51,283
Even if you don't know

653
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:52,364
how capable our lady boss is,

654
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,883
you have to have faith
in our lead attorney.

655
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:56,604
As expected from Miss Qin.

656
00:28:56,604 --> 00:29:00,123
She can settle 25 million yuan that quickly.

657
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:02,444
I didn't expect Yulan Group to be so efficient.

658
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:05,684
All right.

659
00:29:05,684 --> 00:29:06,804
I'll buy you a coffee later.

660
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:07,724
Now that's what I called gratitude.

661
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:17,084
I can explain to you slowly.

662
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,123
You...

663
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:31,163
Sorry.

664
00:29:32,043 --> 00:29:33,643
I have to take a shower.

665
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:35,283
I'm drunk.

666
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:37,084
We'll talk
after I finish taking a shower.

667
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,860
(Certificate of Honor Best Performance Award)

668
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:19,283
I feel like

669
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:22,724
I have seen this Li Dai somewhere.

670
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:30,804
You...

671
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:31,763
What are you doing?

672
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,204
You scared me.

673
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,043
I'm admiring you.

674
00:30:37,204 --> 00:30:38,163
I'm admiring

675
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:40,724
the prettiest woman in this world.

676
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:42,444
I'm marveling

677
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:44,204
at the power of the almighty Creator

678
00:30:44,204 --> 00:30:46,804
as He has created such a perfect woman

679
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:49,364
and how lucky I am

680
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:50,564
to be able to be

681
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:52,684
your husband?

682
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:56,364
You start reading poetries
when you're drunk.

683
00:30:56,964 --> 00:30:58,484
Stop it.

684
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:01,523
It's from the depth of my heart!

685
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,604
I can't help myself, you know?

686
00:31:05,204 --> 00:31:06,804
My dearest!

687
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:07,604
For many years,

688
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:08,804
living next to you

689
00:31:08,804 --> 00:31:10,763
is nothing but a bliss.

690
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:13,844
You are still the woman I first met.

691
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:15,604
So elegant, so graceful.

692
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:18,444
Untempered by time.

693
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:20,523
My darling.

694
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,043
It stinks.

695
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:26,964
My darling, I shower you in compliments.

696
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:28,724
Okay.

697
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:29,844
Sleep now.

698
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:31,403
Goodnight.

699
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:32,043
Go to sleep.

700
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:32,604
Sleep.

701
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:36,844
Goodnight.

702
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:38,604
I'll close the door for you.

703
00:31:46,684 --> 00:31:47,243
Jesus.

704
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:06,204
Yang Hua.

705
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:08,084
Please don't get this

706
00:32:08,084 --> 00:32:09,484
from your dad.

707
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,684
You are always this stubborn.

708
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:32,324
It's past 11 p.m. now.

709
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:34,123
Life is short.

710
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:35,923
Time is never enough.

711
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,283
Oh, our imperfect body

712
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:41,123
is this fragile.

713
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:43,043
It is the only vessel in this world

714
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:45,403
that can house a soul.

715
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,604
Take good care of the vessel

716
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:49,003
or you're wasting the talent

717
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:51,123
and the appearance God
bestowed upon you.

718
00:32:56,923 --> 00:32:58,804
Hmm.

719
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:07,403
You're drunk.

720
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:14,043
I...

721
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:22,403
I...

722
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:25,523
I still have documents to go through.

723
00:33:25,523 --> 00:33:26,523
No, you don't.

724
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:28,484
I don't want to sleep.

725
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:29,564
Yes, you do.

726
00:33:29,763 --> 00:33:31,163
I don't want to sleep.

727
00:33:31,364 --> 00:33:32,163
Yes, you do.

728
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:33,243
But I...

729
00:33:38,003 --> 00:33:40,204
When I first met you, I thought

730
00:33:41,523 --> 00:33:43,243
you are the definition of beauty.

731
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:44,523
I marveled

732
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,923
at this miracle by our Creator.

733
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:51,084
The night is dark
and the dews are forming.

734
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:53,564
The fallen petals stack like a tomb.

735
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:56,364
The comings and goings of spring
leave no trace

736
00:33:56,364 --> 00:33:57,763
except for a blurry dream.

737
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:03,283
Goodnight, my lady.

738
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:23,683
Goodnight, my lady.

739
00:34:36,884 --> 00:34:38,203
Good morning.

740
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:41,404
Wait, wait.

741
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:43,644
Drink this up.

742
00:34:43,763 --> 00:34:44,523
What is this?

743
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:45,443
Don't ask.

744
00:34:45,443 --> 00:34:46,523
Drink up, trust me.

745
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:52,804
This is my secret

746
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:53,884
hangover recipe.

747
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:56,523
It's a cure for your hangover.

748
00:34:58,003 --> 00:34:58,763
How is it?

749
00:34:59,003 --> 00:35:00,884
Feeling better, right?

750
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:02,644
I think I'm getting an upset stomach.

751
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:03,483
You're feeling sick?

752
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:04,483
I'll get you some more.

753
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:05,364
It's not necessary.

754
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:06,364
I'm feeling better now.

755
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:06,844
Okay, then.

756
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:08,604
Get yourself cleaned up now.

757
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:10,003
We're heading out in half an hour.

758
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:14,404
Where to? Today is Saturday.

759
00:35:14,604 --> 00:35:15,683
To my boss's place.

760
00:35:15,683 --> 00:35:16,644
You agreed yesterday.

761
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:19,003
You did ask me

762
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:19,884
this yesterday.

763
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,164
But I didn't say yes.

764
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:22,683
Besides, you haven't answered
my questions.

765
00:35:24,763 --> 00:35:26,164
What did you ask?

766
00:35:27,564 --> 00:35:28,683
You told me to keep
Luowei Yulan's affair

767
00:35:28,683 --> 00:35:29,644
as secret.

768
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:30,884
Is it because your law firm

769
00:35:30,884 --> 00:35:32,723
has something to do with the 25 million debt?

770
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:37,124
Did you ask this question?

771
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:38,243
I did.

772
00:35:38,963 --> 00:35:39,804
I don't think so.

773
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:40,483
I did.

774
00:35:40,683 --> 00:35:41,564
Nope.

775
00:35:42,003 --> 00:35:43,243
Anyway, I asked.

776
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:51,324
Can you tell me why

777
00:35:51,324 --> 00:35:52,324
you want to ask about this?

778
00:35:54,164 --> 00:35:54,683
You keep saying

779
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:55,763
that you're a good lawyer.

780
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:57,604
So I've always seen you

781
00:35:57,604 --> 00:35:59,084
as a good lawyer.

782
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:00,003
I'd like to know

783
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:02,404
if you're trying to preserve
the interest

784
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:05,443
of your law firm
and get the 25 million yuan back

785
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,364
in Luowei Yulan's affair.

786
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:10,683
If the interest of your law firm
violate the others' interests,

787
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:11,683
as a good lawyer,

788
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:12,763
what will you do?

789
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,443
First of all,

790
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:26,963
the 25 million debt doesn't exist.

791
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:28,203
Now, let's say

792
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:29,763
we owe such a debt,

793
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,243
I'll support my law firm for sure.

794
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:33,564
Because this is my work ethic

795
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:34,604
and my duty.

796
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:35,243
I didn't do anything wrong.

797
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:37,164
If a debt dispute occurs,

798
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:38,683
I have no obligation

799
00:36:38,683 --> 00:36:40,763
to remind the other assumed creditors
about it.

800
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:41,763
Especially when

801
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:44,043
they'll likely to have conflicts

802
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:45,003
of interest with the law firm.

803
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:45,723
Hence...

804
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,723
That's enough, stop it.

805
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:49,804
Are you satisfied

806
00:36:49,804 --> 00:36:50,723
with my answer?

807
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:52,924
Miss Qin,

808
00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:54,164
I really can't go with you.

809
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:56,283
I'm feeling sick,
I'd like to go to hospital.

810
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:57,804
How could you do this?

811
00:36:57,804 --> 00:36:59,124
I already answered your question.

812
00:36:59,124 --> 00:37:00,043
You're cheating.

813
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:00,963
Miss Qin,

814
00:37:01,164 --> 00:37:02,124
a good lawyer

815
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:03,483
doesn't judge things

816
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:04,523
with only right and wrong.

817
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:06,763
Why would you

818
00:37:06,763 --> 00:37:08,283
denounce me with morality?

819
00:37:08,283 --> 00:37:09,483
You're trying to say I'm selfish?

820
00:37:10,683 --> 00:37:12,203
If your so-called

821
00:37:12,203 --> 00:37:13,243
assumed creditors

822
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:14,683
are a bunch of ordinary people,

823
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:16,443
each of them makes an investment

824
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,324
with their hard-earned money.

825
00:37:17,324 --> 00:37:18,283
But in the end,

826
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:19,164
you cover the truth

827
00:37:19,164 --> 00:37:20,164
to preserve your interests.

828
00:37:20,483 --> 00:37:21,763
When they lose all their money,

829
00:37:21,763 --> 00:37:22,243
do you still

830
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:23,364
think you're a good lawyer?

831
00:37:24,324 --> 00:37:24,844
Excuse me.

832
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:28,283
I certainly think I am.

833
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:30,723
All investments are risky.

834
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:33,404
You should've expected
that one day,

835
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:34,924
it'll collapse when you aimed for

836
00:37:34,924 --> 00:37:36,043
high-rate return at the outset.

837
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:38,043
As a finance graduate,

838
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:39,523
how could you not have
such risk awareness?

839
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:42,924
Isn't it a mutual agreement?

840
00:37:43,203 --> 00:37:45,124
You must be too compassionate,

841
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:47,203
that's why you can only be

842
00:37:47,203 --> 00:37:48,324
a shareholder.

843
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:06,124
Xinhua Biology dropped eight percent.

844
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:06,523
Wait.

845
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:09,243
12 percent.

846
00:38:11,324 --> 00:38:12,043
16 percent.

847
00:38:12,763 --> 00:38:14,364
(What is exactly going on?)

848
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:16,164
30 percent first.

849
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:17,443
Okay.

850
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,844
(Quickly abandon Xinhua Biology.)

851
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:32,924
(His rival has just)

852
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:34,243
(launched a new product.)

853
00:38:34,243 --> 00:38:35,884
(Their company is worthless now.)

854
00:38:40,523 --> 00:38:41,164
All out!

855
00:38:41,924 --> 00:38:43,443
Go, go, hurry up.

856
00:38:44,564 --> 00:38:45,483
Go, go.

857
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:10,924
You're right.

858
00:39:10,924 --> 00:39:11,844
You didn't do anything wrong.

859
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:15,924
So can you get changed

860
00:39:15,924 --> 00:39:16,963
and go to Boss's place
with me now?

861
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:18,443
I don't think

862
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:19,523
I've complied with your request.

863
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:26,124
(When I first met you, I thought)

864
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:28,364
(you are the definition of beauty.)

865
00:39:29,003 --> 00:39:30,763
(Good night, my lady.)

866
00:39:30,924 --> 00:39:32,003
Good night, my dear.

867
00:39:33,644 --> 00:39:35,084
This love poem

868
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:36,844
sounds so romantic.

869
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:38,924
From now on,
I'd like to hear it everyday.

870
00:39:39,763 --> 00:39:41,644
I'll set it as my ringtone, okay?

871
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,884
Is this the last favor?

872
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:01,644
Of course.

873
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:03,443
I just need to smile,

874
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,203
that's all, right?

875
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:09,124
You don't even need to smile.

876
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,483
Just be a cool guy like you always do.

877
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:11,003
That will do.

878
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,644
Do I really need to delete
that recording?

879
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:15,804
I really want to keep it.

880
00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:20,644
Fine, I'll delete it.

881
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:22,844
By the way,

882
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:28,683
give me your hand.

883
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:43,203
Perfect.

884
00:40:47,324 --> 00:40:47,884
We're ready to go.

885
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:03,644
Hi.

886
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:04,723
Hui.

887
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:07,124
Hi, James.

888
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,604
It's been a long time.

889
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:14,203
Hello, Ms. Tang.

890
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,043
Don't call me Ms. Tang.

891
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:17,483
You're too formal.

892
00:41:17,604 --> 00:41:18,884
Just call me Hui

893
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:20,243
like Qin Shi does.

894
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:22,084
Well, this is

895
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:23,003
your gift from us.

896
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:25,644
We're close friends.

897
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:27,164
You don't have to do this.

898
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:28,564
Thank you.

899
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:30,884
I saw a renovation is taking place

900
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:32,283
outside your house on my way here.

901
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:33,683
Let's go in there.

902
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:34,324
Sure.

903
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:34,844
Let's go.

904
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,003
Fang and Shen are already here.

905
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:39,324
They're here too?

906
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:41,804
They are all candidates.

907
00:41:41,804 --> 00:41:43,003
Tao and his girlfriend

908
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:43,963
will come later.

909
00:41:43,963 --> 00:41:45,364
This is an intense competition.

910
00:41:46,243 --> 00:41:47,243
It's no joke.

911
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:51,683
Guys, look who's here.

912
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:54,763
I think you know Qin Shi.

913
00:41:55,043 --> 00:41:57,404
This is her husband, Yang Hua.

914
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,443
They are

915
00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:03,203
the backbones of Cheng & Hui.

916
00:42:04,924 --> 00:42:05,763
Why are they here?

917
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:07,644
How would

918
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:08,844
I know that?

919
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,443
I wonder what's on Jin's mind.

920
00:42:11,443 --> 00:42:12,243
I need to keep an eye outside.

921
00:42:12,483 --> 00:42:13,443
Do you need help?

922
00:42:14,404 --> 00:42:16,084
This is your stage here.

923
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:17,084
Do your best.

924
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:20,604
Jin.

925
00:42:22,404 --> 00:42:23,604
Take care of her.

926
00:42:23,604 --> 00:42:24,203
Mr. Jin.

927
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:26,483
Make yourself at home.

928
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:27,404
Let me finish this round.

929
00:42:33,003 --> 00:42:33,844
They are

930
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,124
Fang and Mr. Chen.

931
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,240
(Fang, Mr.Chen)

932
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:39,124
Fang is the lawyer
of the criminal case department.

933
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:40,564
He is my rival.

934
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:41,963
Mr. Chen is the co-founder.

935
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:44,404
Jin Cheng who just greeted me

936
00:42:44,404 --> 00:42:45,564
(Shen, lawyer, Mr. Ma, the co-founder)
is our boss.

937
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:45,723
(Shen, lawyer, Mr. Ma, the co-founder)

938
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:47,483
The person next to him is Mr. Ma.

939
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:48,884
The person who deals the cards is Shen.

940
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:51,683
What are you looking at?

941
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:53,523
I just think

942
00:42:53,523 --> 00:42:54,844
that it's meaningless to spend

943
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:57,243
that much money and effort on the construction.

944
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:00,483
You speak too softly.

945
00:43:00,483 --> 00:43:01,443
They can't hear you.

946
00:43:01,443 --> 00:43:02,364
Why don't you say it again?

947
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:07,043
Mr. Jin.

948
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,084
Yang Hua, Mr. Yang,

949
00:43:11,404 --> 00:43:12,483
I've heard so much about you.

950
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:13,124
Pleasure meeting you.

951
00:43:15,644 --> 00:43:16,364
What's the matter?

952
00:43:17,283 --> 00:43:18,003
Qin Shi,

953
00:43:18,644 --> 00:43:19,483
your husband

954
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:20,804
doesn't look so well.

955
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:24,683
This fool drank too much yesterday.

956
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,043
Understood.

957
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:28,003
I happened

958
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:29,084
to have black tea made in 1982,

959
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:30,084
it's the best hangover cure.

960
00:43:31,963 --> 00:43:32,604
Huihui,

961
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:34,644
help us brew a pot

962
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:36,164
of black tea
that Yan brought us last time.

963
00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:37,644
Sure.

964
00:43:37,844 --> 00:43:39,203
Go drink it at the garden.

965
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:39,723
Okay.

966
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:41,043
- Let's go.
- Mr. Yang.

967
00:43:44,963 --> 00:43:45,523
Ma,

968
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,043
let's go enjoy tea.

969
00:43:47,364 --> 00:43:47,804
Sure.

970
00:43:47,804 --> 00:43:48,164
