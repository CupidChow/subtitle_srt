What are you doing?

20
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:27,504
Tao Junhui, what are you doing?

21
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,064
This is the Men's room.

22
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,544
What are you up to?

23
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:35,424
You!

24
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:41,504
Let go of me.

25
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:42,784
If not, I'm going to yell for help.

26
00:02:58,185 --> 00:02:59,225
Why did you lie?

27
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:11,385
Why do you have

28
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:12,624
the invitation from Xi Mei PR?

29
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:14,504
Who do you know in that company?

30
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,225
If you stay silent,

31
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:21,504
I'll have someone to chuck you out here.

32
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:25,465
I know someone with the surname Wang.

33
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:26,784
Did you really investigate well?

34
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:28,745
No one with this surname

35
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:30,185
in the Marketing Department
of Xi Mei PR.

36
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:32,185
Also,

37
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:34,704
what's your intention

38
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:36,424
to approach Mr. Pang and Ms. Lan

39
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,144
in this charity gala?

40
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:41,945
Does it concern you?

41
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:44,385
Who do you think you're

42
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,465
to talk to me in this tone?

43
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:47,784
What's your relationship

44
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:48,624
with Yulan Group?

45
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:49,305
Are you here

46
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:50,544
to the legal service

47
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:51,624
of the Association
for Women Entrepreneurs too?

48
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:53,185
Have a guess.

49
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,025
You better give up.

50
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:58,185
Because our firm

51
00:03:58,185 --> 00:03:59,504
takes charge of it.

52
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:01,984
Take it.

53
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:03,825
Qin Shi.

54
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:05,865
To compete

55
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:07,064
a legal service

56
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:08,144
without benefits,

57
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:11,264
look at yourself.

58
00:04:12,105 --> 00:04:12,904
Are you putting on a show?

59
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:15,025
Don't you think

60
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,264
you look like a clown?

61
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:18,625
You were so ambitious back then.

62
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,505
What has happened to you?

63
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:20,224
I thought

64
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:21,224
when I saw you again,

65
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:21,785
you'd be

66
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:23,664
a big name in the legal industry.

67
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:24,384
How come

68
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:25,465
you wind up here now?

69
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,465
Have you done with your nonsense?

70
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:27,424
Not yet.

71
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:30,585
Listen.

72
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,544
When you fall and fail,

73
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:35,785
the happiest one is me.

74
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:43,305
Honey.

75
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:43,944
Are you alright?

76
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:45,704
I'm fine.

77
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:46,305
Let's leave.

78
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:18,384
Come on, fight them.

79
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:19,944
Why are you idling?

80
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:22,465
Oi, guys.

81
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:27,104
Bring them down.

82
00:05:27,104 --> 00:05:28,104
What are you doing now?

83
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:35,025
Ren Meimei.

84
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:37,465
It's been days.

85
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,625
Don't think that everything has passed

86
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:41,025
without saying anything.

87
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,824
You must apologise to me.

88
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:47,984
Why are you staring at me?

89
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:50,345
The rumours have it

90
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:51,305
that you've caught me

91
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:51,905
cheating on you

92
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:52,944
in the hotel.

93
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:53,704
People scold me

94
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:54,944
jerk now.

95
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:56,144
Don't think

96
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,505
I'll back down

97
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:58,865
when Qin Shi and you colluded.

98
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:07,505
Honey.

99
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,625
I was wrong at that time.

100
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:10,664
I apologise to you.

101
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,465
Yes.

102
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:20,704
You're supposed to apologise to me.

103
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,025
Yes.

104
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:29,944
Have you eaten yet?

105
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:32,384
Of course not, you didn't cook.

106
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:35,944
I'll cook now.

107
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:39,345
Hey, don't go.

108
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:41,905
I haven't finished talking yet.

109
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:45,905
Do you think an apology is enough?

110
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,264
Let me ask you this.

111
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:48,345
Why did you

112
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:49,544
fire Vivian?

113
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:51,025
She works so hard.

114
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:51,944
And now she's taking the blame.

115
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,505
She won't be able to find a job later.

116
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:56,264
Ren Meimei.

117
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:57,664
You shouldn't

118
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:59,025
be jealous of others.

119
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:00,144
Does everyone

120
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:01,264
seem dirty to you?

121
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:02,305
Knock it out, okay?

122
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:02,824
I'm telling you

123
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:03,984
to settle this as fast as possible.

124
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:04,824
What are you up to?

125
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,465
Hey, put the knife down.

126
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:08,264
Did Vivian complain about this

127
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:08,944
to you?

128
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:12,224
Don't ask.

129
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,505
Just tell me what are you going to do?

130
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:16,544
She has completed
the three-month probation

131
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:17,585
and failed to achieve her goal.

132
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:18,905
So, I fired her for a proper reason.

133
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:19,585
If she's not satisfied

134
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:20,264
with me,

135
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:20,865
she can file a complaint

136
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,384
at the Labour Department.

137
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:25,785
Anything else?

138
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:31,865
Out of my way.

139
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:33,544
Where are you going?

140
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:34,264
Sleep.

141
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:35,345
Don't you cook?

142
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:36,185
I lost my appetite.

143
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:37,384
But, I'm hungry.

144
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:50,625
What will you do

145
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,345
if I told you I'm not fine?

146
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:52,905
Fight him?

147
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:53,824
Don't be childish.

148
00:07:53,824 --> 00:07:54,585
Fighting won't be helpful.

149
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:55,944
Just call the police.

150
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:57,224
Ms. Qin.

151
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:01,865
You have so many troubles.

152
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:02,865
Your request of asking me
to be your husband

153
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:03,585
is for your work

154
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:04,664
and personal needs?

155
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:06,585
Knowing too much

156
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:07,704
isn't good for you.

157
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,065
Mind your own business.

158
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,025
The more audience we have,

159
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,264
the more natural we need to act.

160
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,424
Go and get some food.

161
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:21,305
Ms. Lan.

162
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:22,585
Could you spare me a few minutes, please?

163
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:27,305
Fine.

164
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:29,944
Ren Meimei.

165
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:31,424
I'm not afraid of you.

166
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,344
From today on,

167
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,424
we'll live separately.

168
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:37,024
This place is so comfy.

169
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,664
This is so comfortable.

170
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:42,344
It's so much better than the bed.

171
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,385
Dudu.

172
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,424
Dudu, come to daddy.

173
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,420
(Vivian)

174
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,020
(Vivian)
Dudu.

175
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,984
Dudu.

176
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:52,505
Come here. Come to daddy.

177
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,224
Dudu, come here.

178
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:56,385
Come to dad...

179
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:58,865
Come to daddy, Dudu.

180
00:08:58,865 --> 00:08:59,784
Dudu.

181
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:03,024
Dudu, come here.

182
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:16,065
Speaking of Qin Wenyu,

183
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:17,065
you know him very well.

184
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,625
He's playful and has got a big ego.

185
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:19,945
To tackle him,

186
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:21,745
you need some tricks.

187
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:23,664
You should play at being a nice girl
while being tough.

188
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,385
You should see

189
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,145
how she knelt and begged me.

190
00:09:58,305 --> 00:09:58,825
Yes.

191
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,584
She was crying and apologising to me.

192
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,024
She was holding by my legs and pleading

193
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:03,104
for my forgiveness.

194
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:05,584
Sure. No worries.

195
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:06,305
Concerning your work,

196
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,344
I'll settle it for you.

197
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,784
I've thought it over.

198
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:14,024
I must divorce her.

199
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:14,745
I can't stand

200
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:16,224
living with her.

201
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,344
Alright. Let's talk about something fun.

202
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,424
What are you doing now?

203
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:22,945
Meimei.

204
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:24,904
What are you doing here?

205
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:25,984
What am I doing here?

206
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:26,904
What are you doing here?

207
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:28,145
I...

208
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,024
I'm playing games.

209
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:30,505
You insist on divorcing me?

210
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,625
You insist on divorcing me?

211
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,145
No, Meimei.

212
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:32,984
- Come out.
- Let go of me.

213
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,024
You insist on divorcing me?

214
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:35,265
Who can't live without who?

215
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:36,224
What are you doing?

216
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:37,344
Tell me.

217
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:38,424
Who can't live without who?

218
00:10:39,145 --> 00:10:40,024
Ren Meimei!

219
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:42,065
Ren Meimei, are you insane?

220
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:43,945
Look at this.

221
00:10:50,145 --> 00:10:50,945
Stop looking into the mirror.

222
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,385
Tell me.

223
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:53,424
How dare you deny

224
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:54,385
your relationship with that woman?

225
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:55,024
What's the darned relationship

226
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,065
between you and her?

227
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:57,904
She likes me.

228
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,185
I, Qin Wenyu am a charming guy.

229
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,385
So, she falls for me.

230
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:01,464
Can I stop her?

231
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:02,825
Charming guy?

232
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:03,544
You even wake up

233
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:04,945
with your pants inside out.

234
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:05,705
You call yourself a charming guy?

235
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:07,185
She falls for you because she's blind.

236
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:08,625
Ren Meimei.

237
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:09,904
Can you

238
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:11,305
stop being jealous?

239
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,185
You fail to win over me

240
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:13,424
and yet you want to stop others
from loving me.

241
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:14,505
You should look in the mirror

242
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,625
and judge yourself.

243
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,784
You're not ladylike at all.

244
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:17,984
You keep bossing around

245
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:18,424
the others in the company

246
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,505
and now you boss me around.

247
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,305
Well done.

248
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:22,224
You even eavesdropped on me.

249
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:23,104
I'm telling you.

250
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:24,705
I deny my affairs before the others

251
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,945
because of you.

252
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:26,945
If I really have an affair
with other women,

253
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:28,185
you can't do anything to me.

254
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:29,945
Besides, you don't force me again.

255
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,424
If you force me...

256
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:33,065
What do you do then?

257
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:34,145
I...

258
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:34,984
You can't do anything to me.

259
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:35,784
Yes?

260
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:38,104
Don't push me.

261
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:40,065
What do you do if I push you?

262
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,185
Ren Meimei, I've had enough of you!

263
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:43,584
I want to divorce you.

264
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:44,745
I'm telling you, Ren Meimei.

265
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,464
I, Qin Wenyu

266
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:47,664
will marry that woman right now.

267
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,505
Also, you remember this.

268
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:51,305
I leave you this time!

269
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:01,984
Qin Wenyu!

270
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:29,024
Ms. Lan.

271
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:31,065
This is why I came here for.

272
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:33,265
I hope you give me

273
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:34,745
a fair chance to compete with others.

274
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:37,664
I appreciate your bravery

275
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:38,584
and I hope

276
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:40,544
to realise your wish.

277
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:41,984
However, regarding the association,

278
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:44,024
I've let Danping handle it.

279
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:45,984
If she chooses other lawyers,

280
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:47,625
I should respect

281
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,065
and support her choice.

282
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:50,984
Ms. Lan.

283
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:52,385
Dear.

284
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:53,544
Starting from sixteen years old,

285
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:55,185
I've been learning
to be an excellent woman.

286
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:56,945
I've worked on this goal for 40 years.

287
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:01,544
Let me tell you a secret.

288
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,984
Honestly, I don't like

289
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:04,904
being a strong woman.

290
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:06,104
I think I'm not the only one
have this thought.

291
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:06,984
All women

292
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,305
shouldn't force themselves

293
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:09,584
to be a strong woman.

294
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:10,625
Striving hard on work

295
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,385
are meant for men.

296
00:13:12,664 --> 00:13:15,344
Women should be elegant and dainty.

297
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:18,424
Don't be too ambitious.

298
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:20,505
There are many things
that don't work out

299
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:22,424
even if you put in so much effort.

300
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:23,904
You need to learn to settle
for what you get.

301
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:35,745
You even fail

302
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:36,865
to be the company's attorney.

303
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:37,984
How pathetic.

304
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:41,505
How come

305
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:42,984
you just showed up

306
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:44,145
secretly?

307
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:47,104
I learnt this from you.

308
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:49,104
People change as time passes.

309
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:50,265
You have become mean

310
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:51,544
when you're talking, haven't you?

311
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,344
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:55,865
This is the way

313
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:57,385
how my wife talks.

314
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:57,945
Besides, I think

315
00:13:57,945 --> 00:13:59,625
it's one of her charms.

316
00:13:59,625 --> 00:13:59,945
Are you alright?

317
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,024
I'm so hungry.

318
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,305
Mr. Yang.

319
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:10,584
It seems you don't know well

320
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,904
about your wife's taste.

321
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:14,185
My taste has changed.

322
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:15,464
Let me taste it.

323
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:21,505
It's so delicious,

324
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:22,424
honey.

325
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,544
It's so stuffy inside here.

326
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:27,584
Let's go back to our room.

327
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:49,344
Ice might be helpful.

328
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:53,705
Did you really

329
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:54,945
want to pretend to be strong
before your ex-boyfriend,

330
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,185
so you ate the beef

331
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:56,865
even if you're allergic to it?

332
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:58,385
You still can't let go of him, right?

333
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,065
I've told you many times.

334
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:03,024
No.

335
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:04,865
After the couple breaks up,

336
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:06,145
love disappears

337
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,544
and other emotions will come into place

338
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:08,544
which is normal.

339
00:15:10,464 --> 00:15:11,385
Why did you break up with him?

340
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:16,865
Do you want to know more about me?

341
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:18,745
Don't take me wrong.

342
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:20,305
I just want to

343
00:15:20,305 --> 00:15:20,945
play the role of your husband

344
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:21,865
with more clues.

345
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:22,584
Since you don't want to talk about this,

346
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:23,625
quit it.

347
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:25,185
Let's talk about the reason
for your failure.

348
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,185
Do you want to know the reason?

349
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:28,344
I'm not curious about this.

350
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:28,984
No way.

351
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,784
It's crucial to review your action

352
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:32,664
to avoid

353
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:33,904
the same mistake repeating.

354
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:37,984
Tell me then. What's the reason?

355
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,505
There are four reasons.

356
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,104
One,

357
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:41,505
you don't know well about your client

358
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:42,745
on her preferences, styles,

359
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:43,945
outlook on lives,

360
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:45,305
and the behaviours
she appreciates and dislikes.

361
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:47,065
You didn't prepare for these beforehand.

362
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:47,625
Two,

363
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:50,104
You...

364
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,145
Don't you want to note it down?

365
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:55,705
Go ahead. I'm listening.

366
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:58,265
The speech

367
00:15:58,265 --> 00:15:59,705
was indeed attractive.

368
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:00,984
However,

369
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:02,705
your colleague managed to persuade

370
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:04,344
not only because of her technique,

371
00:16:04,344 --> 00:16:05,984
but also the way she delivered
her intention.

372
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:06,784
Because

373
00:16:06,784 --> 00:16:08,265
majority of the women

374
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:09,305
was easily affected

375
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:10,305
by emotion than being rational.

376
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:11,664
Although I appreciate

377
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:12,904
your spontaneity,

378
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,065
however, petty tricks

379
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,265
aren't enough to handle those big names.

380
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:16,305
Here comes the third point,

381
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:17,865
you need to prepare
an alternative plan no matter what.

382
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,904
Because when you're conducting a plan,

383
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,544
accidents are inevitable.

384
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:22,344
Lastly,

385
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:24,344
you're too sentimental.

386
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,705
That's why the sudden appearance

387
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:26,784
of your ex-boyfriend

388
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:27,825
affected your performance.

389
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,224
This is the fatal flaw.

390
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,305
I think of something out of a sudden.

391
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,904
I have the antiallergic medicine
in my car.

392
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:42,344
Can you please bring it to me?

393
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:51,305
Car key.

394
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:30,464
Do you forget something?

395
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:37,984
Hello, are you Miss Qin?

396
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:39,224
Hi.

397
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:17,025
The information you provided

398
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:18,464
doesn't contain the payment method.

399
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:23,304
Let me check.

400
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:26,464
Got it.

401
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,860
(Ebastine Tablets)

402
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,020
(Best Before 2017/03/24)

403
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,064
Excuse me.

404
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:56,425
Are there any pharmacies nearby?

405
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:57,785
It's in the lobby on the second floor.

406
00:18:58,385 --> 00:18:58,905
Thank you.

407
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:20,745
He's my husband, Yang Hua.

408
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,905
I'm a lawyer from Cheng & Hui.

409
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:23,184
I'm Qin Shi.

410
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:23,824
Hello.

411
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:24,745
Hello.

412
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,145
Jun.

413
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:42,304
You have a parcel outside.

414
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,025
Come out and check it out.

415
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,104
Jun.

416
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:53,145
There's a parcel for you.

417
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:28,025
I've done packing your things.

418
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:29,505
As for the ownership of the house,

419
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:30,944
my brother will discuss it with you.

420
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:32,425
Goodbye.

421
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,145
Qin Shi.

422
00:20:57,745 --> 00:20:58,304
Text me

423
00:20:58,304 --> 00:20:59,665
once you reach there.

424
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:02,665
You must take good care of yourself.

425
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:04,745
Do you hear me?

426
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:06,104
Hey, I'm talking to you.

427
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:07,344
If you meet someone you like,

428
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:09,704
grab the chance, alright?

429
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:11,304
What are you doing?

430
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:12,344
Enough.

431
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:13,785
Don't make this emotional.

432
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:14,704
Well, enough.

433
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:15,944
Take care of yourself.

434
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:16,824
I know.

435
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:19,425
I'm leaving.

436
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,184
Get me a stepfather once I return.

437
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,584
Naughty boy.

438
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,224
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

439
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:25,785
Bye-bye.

The subscriber you dialled
is powered off.

450
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:03,224
Are you there? Can we talk?

451
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,025
Can we meet?

452
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,344

Hey.

455
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:14,344
Have you gone to bed?

456
00:22:16,304 --> 00:22:18,064
Are we really breaking up like this?

457
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:20,785
Give it some thought.

458
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:21,785
Does all the years we've been together

459
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:23,545
mean nothing to you?

460
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:31,265
Alright.

461
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:32,785
Got it.

462
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:36,064
Thank you.

463
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:37,665
Yang Hua.

464
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,104
Any drink you like? It's on me.

465
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:53,304
No need. What's the matter?

466
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:56,785
Mr. Yang.

467
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:57,944
What do you do for a living?

468
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:00,344
I suppose

469
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:01,344
we're not close

470
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:02,824
as we can have a casual talk.

471
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:05,025
What do you want from me?

472
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,425
I can feel your hostility towards me.

473
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:10,704
I guess Qin Shi

474
00:23:10,704 --> 00:23:12,184
bad-mouthed me a lot.

475
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:16,425
How long have you been married?

476
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:18,145
Two years.

477
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,104
Two years?

478
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:24,184
It's been two years, yet you don't know

479
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:25,224
she's allergic to beef.

480
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:29,865
People change.

481
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:31,304
However,

482
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:32,824
one's allergy won't simply change.

483
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:36,145
Well.

484
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,464
Even a confirmed bachelorette

485
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:41,304
would marry someone.

486
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:42,464
In this world,

487
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,184
nothing remains unchanged.

488
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:46,145
Forget it. Cut it out.

489
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:47,665
Congratulations to you.

490
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,025
She dumped you, right?

491
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:52,344
Obviously,

492
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:53,665
you still dwell on the past.

493
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,464
Before tonight,

494
00:23:54,464 --> 00:23:55,665
I didn't hear

495
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:56,625
about your name.

496
00:23:57,304 --> 00:23:58,865
It shows that you're insignificant

497
00:23:58,865 --> 00:24:00,304
to her.

498
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:01,385
It's true

499
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:03,984
that my wife is a nice person.

500
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:05,025
Nevertheless,

501
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:06,145
I hope

502
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:06,785
you can let go of the past

503
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:07,665
After all,

504
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:10,184
we got married.

505
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:13,984
You've overthought.

506
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,464
Anyway, Mr. Yang,

507
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:17,505
you have a great sense of humour.

508
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:19,184
One more thing to add,

509
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:20,824
my wife isn't averted to marriage.

510
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,224
At least, she's not in my case.

511
00:24:24,545 --> 00:24:25,824
You went to look for
the antiallergic medicine, right?

512
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:28,704
If you fail to find it,

513
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:30,104
it's in the medication box

514
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:30,824
in her car boot.

515
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:33,184
I bought that.

516
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:35,104
She has an allergy

517
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:37,464
but she always forgets
to buy the medicine.

518
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,304
So, I'll replace the medicine

519
00:24:39,304 --> 00:24:40,385
with a new one every two years.

520
00:24:41,224 --> 00:24:42,464
Do you still think

521
00:24:43,104 --> 00:24:44,865
that you know your wife well?

522
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:45,505
What a pity.

523
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:46,984
The medicine I bought is brand new.

524
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,785
And yours,
I guess it's already thrown away.

525
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:49,425
After all,

526
00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:50,785
it's expired.

527
00:25:17,464 --> 00:25:18,184
I got you the medicine.

528
00:25:27,464 --> 00:25:28,704
How come there's another box here?

529
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:35,104
Ms. Qin.

530
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:38,824
Ms. Qin.

531
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,505
I met Tao Junhui just now.

532
00:27:47,104 --> 00:27:47,865
Come on.

533
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:48,464
Give me the wine.

534
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:49,385
Drink up.

535
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:50,025
It's not enough.

536
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:50,665
Refill.

537
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:51,824
Come on.

538
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:53,464
Look.

539
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,584
The wine has finished.

540
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:55,944
Do you still want it?

541
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:58,025
Yes?

542
00:27:58,025 --> 00:27:59,704
Yes. Of course.

543
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:00,265
Waiter.

544
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:02,385
One more Royal Salute.

545
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:03,265
Hold on.

546
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:07,224
One bottle isn't enough.

547
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:09,545
I want two!

548
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,560
(RMB 16,900,00 was charged to your card
with the last four digits 5809 at 17:11)

549
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,700
(RMB 8,900,00 was charged to your card
with the last four digits 5809 at 22:30)

550
00:28:48,304 --> 00:28:48,745
Good morning.

551
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,064
The room is spacious.

552
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:14,865
Why are you sleeping in the car?

553
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,025
You're such a gentleman.

554
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:17,785
I fear that I'd disturb you.

555
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:20,025
Do you snore?

556
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:21,385
It's fine.

557
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,665
I'm a heavy sleeper.

558
00:29:22,665 --> 00:29:24,265
Even a ten-magnitude earthquake
won't wake me up.

559
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:27,385
I can see that.

560
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:32,505
Where are we going?

561
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:33,104
Home.

562
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:33,745
Safety belt, please.

563
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:37,265
I have something urgent to attend to,
so I have to go back now.

564
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:42,344
Mouthwash and wet wipes
are inside there.

565
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:43,145
Hope you don't mind.

566
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,304
Yesterday,

567
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:54,064
when I was going upstairs,

568
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:55,104
I saw Tao Junwei.

569
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:58,745
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:59,304 --> 00:30:00,104
It's fine.

571
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,865
You saw Tao Junhui?

572
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:03,505
What did you talk about?

573
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:04,905
Nothing that'd make him suspect, right?

574
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:07,745
Most of the time,

575
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:09,104
I was listening to him.

576
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:10,385
What did he say?

577
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:12,745
I think that Tao Junhui

578
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,785
cares about your marriage.

579
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:15,944
Besides, I can sense

580
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,984
that he is concerned about you.

581
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:22,665
No one believes in his words.

582
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:23,304
Ignore him.

583
00:30:40,824 --> 00:30:42,224
Are you sure Pang Dingfang
stays in this room?

584
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:43,824
I'm sure.

585
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:45,505
You know my ability well, don't you?

586
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:55,385
It's empty.

587
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:00,984
Junhui.

588
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:02,025
No one is here.

589
00:31:02,265 --> 00:31:03,545
Probably he didn't stay here

590
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:04,584
yesterday night.

591
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:06,344
He tricked us with a fake room address.

592
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:09,064
Sorry.

593
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:11,385
The subscriber you dialled
is powered off.

594
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:13,865
Pang Dingfang

595
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:14,665
turned off his phone.

596
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:16,464
What do we do now?

597
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:18,785
Did he

598
00:31:18,785 --> 00:31:19,865
discover something

599
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:20,944
and he left earlier?

600
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:25,064
Let's leave here.

601
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:34,464
I'm curious about

602
00:31:34,464 --> 00:31:35,545
why did Tao Junhui

603
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,224
attend this dinner?

604
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:39,425
He hates

605
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:41,064
socialising without an aim.

606
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:42,745
There must be

607
00:31:42,745 --> 00:31:43,704
someone or something he cares about

608
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:44,905
at the dinner.

609
00:31:50,704 --> 00:31:51,865
Is the book interesting?

610
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:53,824
I doubt

611
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:55,625
something's wrong with Luowei Yulan.

612
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:56,625
What's the problem with it?

613
00:31:58,265 --> 00:31:59,385
Oh, I haven't asked you

614
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:00,425
what you did for a living.

615
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,545
(Ren Meimei)

616
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,265
Meimei.

617
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:07,665
I'll be there soon.

618
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:08,545
I need one hour.

619
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:09,625
Please wait for me.

620
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:10,385
It's fine.

621
00:32:10,944 --> 00:32:12,304
No rush. Drive safely.

622
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:13,425
Be careful.

623
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,304
Now, I'm going to kill someone.

624
00:32:15,344 --> 00:32:16,025
Come and collect his dead body

625
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:17,104
an hour later.

626
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:18,865
Alright.

627
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:38,505
What did she say?

628
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:39,785
Kill someone?

629
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,505
Ms. Qin.

630
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:42,625
Aren't you a civil lawyer?

631
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:44,064
Why do you take criminal cases?

632
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,385
Let's...call the police.

633
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:53,224
Call the police.

634
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:54,344
Okay? Let's call the police.

635
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:55,625
It's a serious matter.

636
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,064
Hence, stop asking

637
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:58,344
or you'll be dragged into trouble.

638
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:58,984
Please rest assured.

639
00:32:58,984 --> 00:33:00,104
It's not my first handling such cases.

640
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:00,785
No, I can't rest assured.

641
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:01,545
I can't. Drive slowly.

642
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:02,625
Drive slowly.

643
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,344
Slowly.

644
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:04,584
I want to go home.

645
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:08,025
I want to go home!

646
00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:15,344
Look.

647
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:16,625
You've arrived home safely.

648
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:20,145
What's wrong with you?

649
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,540
(Changchun hotel)

650
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:38,704
Are you alright?

651
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:42,905
Take some water.

652
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:45,304
Do take care of your health.

653
00:33:45,304 --> 00:33:47,104
You're weak despite your young age.

654
00:33:51,704 --> 00:33:52,545
You're alright?

655
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:55,625
I'm leaving.

656
00:34:00,745 --> 00:34:01,385
By the way,

657
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:04,545
even though my business
didn't work out well,

658
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:06,224
I still want to thank you.

659
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,505
If you need help,

660
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:08,304
call me.

661
00:34:08,824 --> 00:34:09,425
I'm off.

662
00:34:27,544 --> 00:34:28,465
My luggage

663
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:30,865
is in your car.

664
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:49,264
Meimei.

665
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:51,344
What are you doing?

666
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:52,344
Hurry up

667
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:53,104
and move them out.

668
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:04,064
Meimei.

669
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:05,824
Wenyu is under the weather,

670
00:35:06,024 --> 00:35:07,425
so he came here to drink.

671
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:08,705
We were just drinking.

672
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:09,865
I was with him all the way.

673
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,024
We did nothing other than drink.

674
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:12,905
Boogie up.

675
00:35:13,465 --> 00:35:15,465
Let's roll a boogie, girls.

676
00:35:15,985 --> 00:35:16,625
Come on.

677
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:19,385
Wenyu.

678
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,225
Meimei is here.

679
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:26,824
Meimei.

680
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:29,425
Wow.

681
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,385
Royal Salute 21 years.

682
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:32,625
It's a premium wine.

683
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:35,425
This wine has been out of stock
for a month

684
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:36,744
and none of the dealers in Pujiang

685
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:37,865
could get this.

686
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:39,784
You have connections, Hu.

687
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:42,744
I welcome friends with open arms,

688
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,024
therefore,

689
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:45,185
I have many connections in the circle.

690
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:46,985
Wine, please.

691
00:35:48,344 --> 00:35:48,985
Wine.

692
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:55,425
Please have a sip.

693
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:06,425
You're indeed his good buddy.

694
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:09,185
4,000 yuan for a bottle of fake wine.

695
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:10,304
How lucrative your business is.

696
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:10,784
Meimei.

697
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:12,385
Please don't wrong me.

698
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:13,945
I never sell fake wine.

699
00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:15,264
It'll cost me a great loss.

700
00:36:19,865 --> 00:36:21,064
Meimei, what are you doing?

701
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:23,584
Whether it's fake wine or not,

702
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:24,465
Industry and Commerce Bureau

703
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:25,185
will examine it

704
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,064
and let us know.

705
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:26,824
Please don't.

706
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:28,705
Meimei. We're on the same side.

707
00:36:28,945 --> 00:36:29,784
No need to involve outsiders.

708
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:31,385
We can negotiate this together.

709
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:32,584
Negotiation is unnecessary.

710
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,784
Come on here.

711
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:38,504
Someone duped your brother
with fake wine.

712
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:39,344
He dupes...

713
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:41,304
Give me back my phone.

714
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:42,064
I won't.

715
00:36:42,385 --> 00:36:43,024
Wait.

716
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:43,905
Meimei.

717
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:45,465
Well, the legal person of this shop

718
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:46,344
is Wenyu.

719
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:48,865
It's fine if you make a scene here,

720
00:36:49,064 --> 00:36:50,344
but you can't harm your friend, right?

721
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:51,905
Are you threatening me?

722
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:55,504
I don't have the guts to do so, Meimei.

723
00:36:55,744 --> 00:36:56,905
Didn't I keep on calling you "Meimei"

724
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:58,465
to show my sincerity?

725
00:36:58,465 --> 00:36:59,225
Let's calm down

726
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:01,024
and negotiate about this.

727
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:02,865
Hello.

728
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:06,504
You can negotiate with me.

729
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:09,824
Qin Shi.

730
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:11,824
It's been a while.

731
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:13,905
You're more beautiful now.

732
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,784
I'm having some small talk
with Meimei.

733
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:17,905
Since everyone's here today,

734
00:37:18,064 --> 00:37:18,865
let me

735
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:20,504
treat you to a meal, okay?

736
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:21,865
Please.

737
00:37:22,104 --> 00:37:23,625
I still remember you.

738
00:37:24,824 --> 00:37:25,945
When you were in grade 10th,

739
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:27,385
you defrauded my brother of 500 yuan

740
00:37:27,385 --> 00:37:28,264
for fake test answers.

741
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:30,744
Besides, you sold pirated sports shoes
in grade 11th

742
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:32,905
and smuggled mobile phones
in grade 12th.

743
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:33,744
You do even better now.

744
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:34,584
Selling wine?

745
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,544
It's a misunderstanding.

746
00:37:36,544 --> 00:37:38,344
People will improve when they grow up.

747
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:39,425
How much is it?

748
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:40,705
4,888 yuan.

749
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:44,584
The figure isn't small.

750
00:37:44,705 --> 00:37:46,344
You'll be sentenced to seven years
in prison at most.

751
00:37:47,024 --> 00:37:49,744
Just now, you said my brother
is the legal person

752
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:51,104
and you're the operator.

753
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:51,705
Well.

754
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:52,905
My brother pays the fine
and you go to jail.

755
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:54,064
None of you can escape from this.

756
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:55,865
Keep that wine as a proof

757
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:56,945
and call the police.

758
00:37:58,865 --> 00:37:59,344
Let's go.

759
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,064
Please don't.

760
00:38:02,304 --> 00:38:02,865
Qin Shi.

761
00:38:03,145 --> 00:38:04,225
You...

762
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:05,024
Also,

763
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:06,905
You're suspected of embezzlement.

764
00:38:07,264 --> 00:38:08,584
Send an accountant here later

765
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:09,584
to audit ledgers.

766
00:38:13,145 --> 00:38:13,985
Meimei.

767
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:14,985
Qin Shi.

768
00:38:15,185 --> 00:38:16,385
I'm wrong.

769
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,145
I won't do this again.

770
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:18,945
I promise

771
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:20,945
I won't let Wenyu

772
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:22,344
enter this shop again.

773
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:25,225
I swear.

774
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:30,304
Are you proposing now?

775
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:34,024
Meimei.

776
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:35,544
Meimei.

777
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:36,945
Aren't you taking Wenyu with you?

778
00:38:43,665 --> 00:38:44,584
Qin Wenyu is the legal person here.

779
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:45,584
Smash it if you want.

780
00:39:07,905 --> 00:39:09,744
Luckily, I'm back alive.

781
00:39:11,945 --> 00:39:13,104
Miss Qin

782
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,504
is overweening ambition

783
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:17,425
and impulsive.

784
00:39:19,145 --> 00:39:20,985
I must stay away from her

785
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:22,425
and get it over with
as soon as possible.

786
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:31,344
Hua.

787
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:33,544
Why is your phone off?

788
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:35,985
Your mother is angry now.

789
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:38,625
Did you block her contact?

790
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:41,504
Hua.

791
00:39:42,185 --> 00:39:43,905
Did you block mine as well?

792
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,264
I'm determined

793
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:46,665
to be on your side though.

794
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:48,905
Hua.

795
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,104
It's fine that you've blocked us.

796
00:39:51,544 --> 00:39:52,465
For these few days,

797
00:39:52,544 --> 00:39:54,544
you better not contact us

798
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:56,185
and let your mother calm down.

799
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:58,665
I'll placate her and
put in some good words for you.

800
00:39:59,945 --> 00:40:00,705
Hua.

801
00:40:01,744 --> 00:40:03,385
Who are you talking to?

802
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:05,425
No. Nothing.

803
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:06,865
I didn't talk.

804
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:09,425
Hua.

805
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:11,425
How are you?

806
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:13,784
I've cooked something delicious.

807
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:15,264
Come back home when you're free.

808
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:17,625
I have something to talk to you about.

809
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:21,304
I can go home now.

810
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:22,985
God of Wealth, we can go home.

811
00:40:24,744 --> 00:40:25,544
God of Wealth.

812
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:26,945
We can go home.

813
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:29,705
Finally, we can go home.

814
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:43,185
Stop eating.

815
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:44,945
Just say something.

816
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:46,024
I'm not asking you here

817
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:47,344
to watch you eating.

818
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:56,264
Just shoot it.

819
00:40:56,264 --> 00:40:57,784
I think you've done wrong.

820
00:40:57,784 --> 00:40:58,665
I've done wrong?

821
00:40:58,824 --> 00:40:59,385
Uh-huh.

822
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,465
So what are the right things
I should do?

823
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:01,465
Your foolish brother

824
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:02,145
always

825
00:41:02,145 --> 00:41:02,905
hangs out

826
00:41:02,905 --> 00:41:03,985
with those fair-weather friends.

827
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:05,744
If it wasn't for me

828
00:41:05,744 --> 00:41:06,665
busy managing for his business,

829
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:07,744
he would've been swindled.

830
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:08,665
Still, did I do it wrong?

831
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:11,344
I wasn't mean

832
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,104
that it's wrong you manage his business.

833
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,584
But the way you've used
isn't wise enough.

834
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:16,865
Speaking of you,

835
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,185
you want

836
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:19,385
to continue your relationship with him,

837
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:20,225
however,

838
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:21,744
everything you did has pushed him away.

839
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:24,465
People are drawn to things that are kind
to them, instead of fierce ones.

840
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:26,104
An airheaded person
like my second brother

841
00:41:26,304 --> 00:41:27,705
would choose to run for sure.

842
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,465
Yet, you kept chasing after him.

843
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:30,784
Today you've made a scene in his shop.

844
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:32,064
Are you going to repeat this tomorrow

845
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:32,945
and the day after tomorrow?

846
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:34,185
What should I do then?

847
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,145
I sit tight

848
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:36,104
and see an easy mark like him
being duped?

849
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:37,705
Easy mark?

850
00:41:37,784 --> 00:41:38,625
Please don't demean

851
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,665
and misuse the word.

852
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:42,945
My brother is just stupid.

853
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:45,185
Speaking of him,

854
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:46,425
he was supervised by his mother
before he got married,

855
00:41:46,425 --> 00:41:48,504
and he lives under the control
of his wife after that.

856
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:50,104
He's 35 years old

857
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:51,665
but with a fifteen-year-old mind.

858
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:53,905
What an undeveloped adult.

859
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:56,185
However, you're not like him.

860
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:57,945
So, can you please think straight

861
00:41:57,945 --> 00:41:58,985
and get your brain into gear?

862
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,064
Which sides are you taking?

863
00:42:01,264 --> 00:42:02,824
Certainly, I'm on your side.

864
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:04,304
Why are you criticising me then?

865
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:07,504
Well, if you have made up your mind,

866
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:09,905
I'll have him by his throat

867
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,185
to sign the paper.

868
00:42:11,185 --> 00:42:12,504
But before that,

869
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:14,064
have you really made up your mind?

870
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:16,905
Do you want to divorce him?

871
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:21,824
I knew it.

872
00:42:23,185 --> 00:42:23,824
Your bark worse than your bite.

873
00:42:25,824 --> 00:42:26,544
Can you please think

874
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,504
about your Dudu?

875
00:42:27,905 --> 00:42:28,544
Dudu?

876
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,064
What do you

877
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:31,145
bring my dog up suddenly?

878
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:33,304
If you want to tame a dog,

879
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:35,225
what should you do?

880
00:42:36,665 --> 00:42:37,705
Reward-punish training?

881
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:39,665
Excellent.

882
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:43,425
Under the ham sausage and branch,

883
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:45,945
all dogs will surely be tamed.

884
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:48,824
This is a general truth.

885
00:42:48,824 --> 00:42:49,985
It's difficult when it comes to action.

886
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,104
Whenever I think of

887
00:42:51,104 --> 00:42:52,064
that stupid Qin Wenyu,

888
00:42:52,064 --> 00:42:53,985
I got flared up.

889
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:56,104
I got hot under the collar.

890
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:58,584
I think

891
00:42:58,584 --> 00:42:59,865
you need self-reflection.

892
00:42:59,865 --> 00:43:01,145
Pareto principle,
do you still remember that?

893
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:06,705
Hold tightly onto

894
00:43:06,705 --> 00:43:08,544
the twenty per cent
that's crucial to you,

895
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,064
as for the eight per cent left,

896
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:11,824
just leave it.

897
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:13,824
Spare me the principles.

898
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:14,784
Tell me.

899
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:15,385
What's it

900
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:16,185
in that twenty per cent?

901
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:17,145
I'll study it.

902
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:21,584
Anyway, let me be straight with you.

903
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:23,625
Your choice not to get married

904
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,064
is a wise choice.
