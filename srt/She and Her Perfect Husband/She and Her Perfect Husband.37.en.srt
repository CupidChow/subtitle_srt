19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Tao.

20
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:00,321
I heard

21
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,520
you went out drinking with Mr. Yin
till late at night.

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,041
I'm just doing my job.

23
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:06,560
Nanzhou Group

24
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,480
has gotten in touch with me.

25
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,481
Once Mr. Pu returns from his business trip,

26
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,121
we can sign this contract.

27
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,961
And we can conclude this case.

28
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,080
I will let Haitao

29
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,520
and the rest to tie the loose ends.

30
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:20,000
I have a business trip in Ningbo tomorrow.

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,601
I heard we'll have another labor dispute

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,440
to handle?

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,360
Yes.

34
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:27,481
I have left it to Haitao.

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,761
I received a call from Mr. Yin

36
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,080
of Tianhang this morning.

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,561
He insisted

38
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,321
that you must be in charge of this case.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,761
Madam Tang, the case

40
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,080
cannot be any clearer.

41
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,561
It's simple too.

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,720
The retainer fee isn't high either.

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,961
I'm sure Haitao and others

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,720
can handle it.

45
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,201
I also told them to ask me

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,561
if they have questions.

47
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:48,561
I...

48
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:49,520
I see.

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,080
We'll respect your decision.

50
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:54,280
Okay.

51
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,401
Thanks, Mr. Jin, Madam Tang.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,160
That's odd.

53
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,640
Chen told me

54
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:11,280
Tao Junhui and Mr. Yin

55
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,360
from Tianhang

56
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,601
were bonding yesterday.

57
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:14,401
They even

58
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,241
called each other brothers in the end.

59
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,041
Why is he so distant

60
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,241
this morning?

61
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,720
I think it's quite mature of Tao Junhui.

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,561
Tianhang is working with us.

63
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,280
The acquisition is an important deal.

64
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,920
And after we settle the acquisition,

65
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:35,241
there will be a new legal contract to be drawn.

66
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,401
Their internal legal department

67
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,961
could have handled it

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,401
but he let us take care of it and profit from it.

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,920
I guess he truly wants to do Yao Yao in.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,880
The labor dispute case

71
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,041
is not lucrative.

72
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,160
Using the attorneys
from the corporation department

73
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:54,561
is an overkill.

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,640
Other lawyers won't drop

75
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,080
whatever they are doing

76
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,360
for it, let alone Tao Junhui.

77
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,761
Our hot-blooded attorney here

78
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,280
can be quite cunning too.

79
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,800
Since he's letting Haitao handle it,

80
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,201
it means he isn't staying out of it.

81
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,121
You know what?

82
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,281
If it doesn't work,

83
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:19,080
we'll find another lawyer.

84
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Yes, Hui?

85
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,121
(Where are you?)

86
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,640
I'm outside. Why?

87
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,640
(Come see me once you're back.)

88
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:46,681
You want me

89
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:48,480
to handle Tianhang's labor dispute?

90
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:51,080
Yes.

91
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,001
I am just a legal assistant.

92
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:57,281
According to the rules here,

93
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,121
I have no right to take up any cases.

94
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,681
Qin Shi, we're both smart here.

95
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,320
Stop beating around the bush.

96
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,080
Who else in the family department

97
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:07,721
is more capable and experienced

98
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:09,881
than you?

99
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:12,561
You pissed Wu Fei off

100
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:14,881
and left a mess in the family department.

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,961
Don't go thinking that I didn't know.

102
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,480
Hui,

103
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,281
you can demote me

104
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,360
but you cannot insult my intelligence.

105
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:28,121
I have been thinking

106
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:28,881
a lot lately.

107
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,800
I hate to make you resign now

108
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:34,001
but I also hate

109
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,360
to make you work like that.

110
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:36,161
I admit

111
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:37,040
that our recruitment policy

112
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,520
is the root of the problem

113
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:40,441
but that policy isn't implemented

114
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,121
to specifically make you suffer.

115
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:42,721
It's for

116
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,080
the development of Cheng & Hui.

117
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,320
Am I wrong?

118
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:47,360
I am also a victim.

119
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,001
No matter how I handle this,

120
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,841
my personal dilemma

121
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:56,161
cannot be resolved.

122
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,080
Therefore,

123
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,961
I'll view it

124
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:01,600
from Cheng & Hui's perspective.

125
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,961
You are a talent.

126
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,200
A talent that we need.

127
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:07,401
Hui, I promise I will never

128
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:09,121
make the same mistake again.

129
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
I'm not done talking yet.

130
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,441
I don't want to hear

131
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:13,401
any promises now.

132
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:15,320
We need a lawyer

133
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,721
who's devoted to Cheng & Hui.

134
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,600
I can be one.

135
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:19,800
I know you can.

136
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,320
So

137
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,600
letting you handle Tianhang's labor dispute

138
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
will reassure me.

139
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,760
But...

140
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:29,401
Are we truly

141
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:30,281
taking in this case?

142
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,040
Are we the weapons

143
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,841
for the capitalists

144
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:34,001
to shoot at the innocent?

145
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,760
Mind your words there.

146
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,520
We don't have to take in this case.

147
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,640
You do.

148
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:46,360
Qin Shi.

149
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,001
An attorney

150
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,520
is not a defender of justice.

151
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:51,441
It's just a job.

152
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,480
It's just one party

153
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:53,881
offering legal advice to another.

154
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,721
We sell our experiences.

155
00:06:57,161 --> 00:06:58,401
We represent equality

156
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,281
but not fairness.

157
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,401
During this process,

158
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:02,080
what you have to do, what you should do,

159
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,881
is to protect your client's interest.

160
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,001
Not judge his or her character.

161
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,001
If

162
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
you refuse to handle this case,

163
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,681
then you don't belong in here.

164
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,161
Nor in any high-end law firm.

165
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:26,281
Maybe being a community legal advisor

166
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,401
will suit you well.

167
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,161
Hui, I'll handle it.

168
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:30,640
I will.

169
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:31,760
You will handle it

170
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:34,161
and you will win it.

171
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:35,800
If I can handle

172
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,441
this case well...

173
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,200
Welcome back to the 11th floor.

174
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,960
(Cloud Commercial Bank)

175
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,681
What?

176
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,040
Hu Ping asked you

177
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,520
to be his chief financial consultant?

178
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,040
I haven't...

179
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I can, Yang!

180
00:07:59,281 --> 00:07:59,841
What?

181
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:00,841
I can do anything.

182
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:01,721
Look.

183
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:02,881
If you're working for Hu Ping,

184
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,161
someone has to help you out.

185
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,080
Knowing your temper,

186
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:05,841
other than me,

187
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,080
no one else can put up with you.

188
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,080
Also, we can do what we always do.

189
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,040
Once you're there,

190
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:12,080
domestic assistant or workplace assistant,

191
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:13,480
I can be them all.

192
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:15,040
I don't care about the salary.

193
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,001
Just give me double or triple

194
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,681
my current salary.

195
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:18,520
I will be there to look after you.

196
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,320
I haven't...

197
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,721
Let me finish.

198
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,241
Think about it.

199
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
You are now 28.

200
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,520
Almost 30.

201
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,881
You are married.

202
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,480
You have a house.

203
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,561
And in the future,

204
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,160
you might have

205
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,201
a child.

206
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,521
It will change everything.

207
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,641
You need to think about your wife

208
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,641
and your child.

209
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,881
You need to be responsible

210
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:46,001
about my future, brother.

211
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,001
Think about it.

212
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:50,800
As a pillar of our nation.

213
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:52,521
I am divorced.

214
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:53,761
Divorced?

215
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,280
Stop joking around.

216
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,561
You're just telling me that

217
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
to shut me up.

218
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,241
For real?

219
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,761
But why?

220
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,761
Qin Shi isn't ready.

221
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:22,840
I want to give her more time.

222
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,920

Miss Qin.

246
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,121
Tell me.

247
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,960
Tell you what?

248
00:11:58,521 --> 00:11:59,641
Your demand.

249
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,280
We already did.

250
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:02,800
What's the matter?

251
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:05,561
We're trying to settle out of court today.

252
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:07,840
Please be serious.

253
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,800
If you're not here

254
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,600
to settle things,

255
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,761
let's not

256
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,081
waste each other's time.

257
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:14,800
Miss Yao, let's go.

258
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,040
Miss Li.

259
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,121
This is a simple case.

260
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:21,001
Tianhang invested a lot

261
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,040
in Miss Yao here

262
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,241
and they signed

263
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,840
a ten-year contract.

264
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,081
Miss Yao now wants to resign.

265
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,881
That's already a breach of contract.

266
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
In addition, she refused the post

267
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,800
her company assigned her

268
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:35,600
and refused to show up.

269
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:38,040
That was belligerent behavior.

270
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,681
Enough already.

271
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:41,600
There's no one else here.

272
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,040
Keep all those insults

273
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:44,441
to yourself.

274
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,280
Tianhang is just refusing to let her go.

275
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,960
Is that right?

276
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,081
(We can let her go)

277
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,561
(but several conditions have to be met.)

278
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,881
One, an enticing compensation.

279
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,201
You should know

280
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,360
that Yao Yao is a pivotal

281
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,480
individual at the management level.

282
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Her achievements

283
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,241
are the result of the investment

284
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,081
we put into her all these years.

285
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,681
How much

286
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,121
do you want then?

287
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:12,600
Two million yuan?

288
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:17,920
Are you low on cash lately?

289
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,641
Even if you are,

290
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,600
there's no need to be that greedy.

291
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,720
My client earns around 200,000 yuan per year.

292
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,321
Two million yuan is how much

293
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:31,400
Tianhang values Miss Yao here.

294
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:33,321
In their eyes,

295
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,321
she's worth that price.

296
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,001
I don't know

297
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:40,960
if I should be happy or angry

298
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,001
when I hear that.

299
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,600
Miss Qin.

300
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,040
Why is a huge company

301
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,441
refusing to let a staff member go?

302
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,960
And she even once

303
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,521
earned the company

304
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,641
good reputation.

305
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,280
This is not right.

306
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:01,241
I agree.

307
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,681
So we come up

308
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,321
with a clear-cut solution.

309
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,321
As long as Miss Yao pays for the damages,

310
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,280
she can then leave

311
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,201
and find another job.

312
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,201
Two million yuan is a deal-breaker.

313
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,040
Can we show some sincerity

314
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,121
and save each other's time now?

315
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Let me state this

316
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040
on Tianhang's behalf.

317
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,920
Tianhang insists

318
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,521
that the two million yuan

319
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:27,920
has to be paid.

320
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,160
Miss Qin,

321
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:30,600
what exactly did Yin Zhiqiang give you?

322
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:31,321
Do you know

323
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,201
what kind of person he is?

324
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,201
You are siding with the villain here.

325
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,441
You know what?

326
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,920
Let's call it a day here.

327
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:47,001
Miss Li,

328
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:48,360
I'm not done yet.

329
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:52,960
I did bring to Tianhang's attention

330
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,160
that two million yuan

331
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:55,160
does exceed

332
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,480
the national standard.

333
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,201
I then asked

334
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:58,441
for another solution.

335
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,001
Is there?

336
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,561
Yes.

337
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,121
But I suppose once you hear it,

338
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,321
you would rather pay

339
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,001
two million yuan.

340
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,280
Yao Yao has to make the promise

341
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,201
that she will not take up a similar position

342
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:20,720
in a similar industry for the next ten years

343
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:21,761
and she

344
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,920
has to pay back that 250,000 yuan training fee.

345
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,800
I'll let her go right away.

346
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:25,441
You mean

347
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:26,720
Yao Yao cannot work

348
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,201
in the hotel industry for a decade?

349
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,241
Not just the hotel industry.

350
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,960
The entire hospitality industry.

351
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,001
Is your wife crazy?

352
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,160
I don't think so.

353
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,001
So why did she

354
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:43,160
say something crazy in broad daylight then?

355
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,360
That's related to your profession.

356
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:47,241
I cannot provide a judgment on that.

357
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,681
However, from what I know,

358
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
an attorney is there

359
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,521
to defend her client's interest.

360
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:55,160
Both of you

361
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:56,600
are excellent lawyers.

362
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:58,321
I'm sure every decision you take

363
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:01,280
is to ensure your duty will
be executed to perfection.

364
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:02,840
Yang Hua,

365
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,321
I underestimated you.

366
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,641
Is that how one plays the nice guy?

367
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:09,681
Yes, as an attorney,

368
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,121
my job is to defend my client's interest.

369
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
But do you know

370
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,241
other than equality,

371
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,521
our professional ethic

372
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:19,081
also includes justice?

373
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:21,600
Tianhang uses its influence

374
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:23,360
and affluence

375
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:24,920
as a major corporation

376
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:26,441
to exploit its worker.

377
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,800
That's injustice.

378
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,561
Qin Shi told me

379
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:31,641
to take up this case.

380
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,480
The Qin Shi I know

381
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,800
will take pity on Yao Yao and help her.

382
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:38,600
But now,

383
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:40,360
representing Tianhang,

384
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:41,840
she comes up with this outrageous term

385
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:42,800
that goes against

386
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,600
the standard imposed by our legal system
and relevant authorities.

387
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,681
It's just a personal vendetta at this point.

388
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,600
You can't let this carry on.

389
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:51,360
I don't want to see her

390
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,840
become a lawyer without a moral compass.

391
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,081
Miss Li, you want me
to persuade Miss Qin?

392
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,720
How I enjoy talking

393
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:04,121
to a smart person like you.

394
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,241
If this carries on,

395
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:09,001
it'll be a dead end.

396
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:10,161
And you

397
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:12,680
are someone important

398
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,801
who can sway Qin Shi's mind.

399
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:17,121
You put me on a pedestal.

400
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,161
No, I didn't.

401
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:18,881
Look.

402
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,080
Yao Yao is your ex-girlfriend.

403
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,600
Qin Shi is your wife.

404
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,121
Both women have a deep tie to you.

405
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,560
Although some other factors

406
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,200
were in play when you got married,

407
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,401
but her feelings toward you are real.

408
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,200
And this case should be settled out of court.

409
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,641
As the representing lawyer,

410
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,041
Qin Shi's view on this matter is important.

411
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,960
I wonder if the change in her attitude

412
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,761
is the result of her knowing

413
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,560
your relationship with Yao Yao.

414
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:48,840
What do you mean?

415
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,560
It's simple.

416
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,801
I am a woman.

417
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,161
If I know

418
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:55,080
that my husband

419
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,161
still harbors a tiny bit of feeling

420
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,001
toward his ex,

421
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:00,881
I will be upset.

422
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,641
And if I'm upset,

423
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:04,001
my hormones will be all over the place.

424
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,641
And hormones will affect your judgment.

425
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:09,121
I'm not asking about this.

426
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:12,001
I just want to know

427
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,801
what do you mean by Qin Shi's feelings

428
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:16,641
towards me are real?

429
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,881
I mean it literally.

430
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,401
Didn't you guys pretend to be married

431
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,720
but ended up falling for each other?

432
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,720
She said that?

433
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,200
She would never admit it.

434
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,521
But does that even matter?

435
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:32,560
Look at how happy

436
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:34,720
she was.

437
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:36,801
No one would believe it was an unrequited love.

438
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,881
I don't get what

439
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,161
Cheng & Hui gives her

440
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,161
that makes her so loyal.

441
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
Yang Hua.

442
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,521
Help me out, will you?

443
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,840
If I lose this case,

444
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,641
Qin Shi won't be the winner.

445
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,281
She'll only earn

446
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,401
the biggest regret of her career.

447
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,881
And there will also be

448
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
another biggest victim,

449
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,041
Yao Yao.

450
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,480
You don't want

451
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:13,200
them to get hurt, do you?

452
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,960
- Miss Li...
- Tell me.

453
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,600
Tell me what you want.

454
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,200
Give me some time to think about it.

455
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:43,401
Sunny.

456
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:45,960
Hi. ID, please?

457
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:46,720
Sure.

458
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,401
Here you go. Thank you.

459
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,121
You're welcome.

460
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:51,840
I miss you so much.

461
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,881
Come. Careful.

462
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:53,761
Let me hug you.

463
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,241
Hugs.

464
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,560
Are you tired?

465
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,641
Are you all right?

466
00:19:58,921 --> 00:19:59,521
It's okay.

467
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,360
You can keep this. Thank you.

468
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,720
You promised to speak Chinese

469
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,440
when you see me.

470
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:05,801
All right, mommy.

471
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,001
Okay. Let's go.

472
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,001
What's the matter?

473
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:14,881
Mommy, I'm four already.

474
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,121
No need to hold my hands.

475
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,001
Only babies need to be held.

476
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:21,761
You don't want to hold my hands?

477
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm a girl.

478
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,881
A girl can always be a baby.

479
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,480
Fine.

480
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,161
Let's go.

481
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,080
I'll carry your luggage.

482
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:36,720
So?

483
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:37,761
Are you happy to see me?

484
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,320
Madam Tang.

485
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:45,121
Mr. Tao, what can I help?

486
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:48,761
All right, Madam Tang.

487
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:49,641
I'll deliver it now.

488
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,241
Okay.

489
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:58,281
Madam Tang.

490
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,161
Let me reply this on WeChat.

491
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,121
Go ahead.

492
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,521
Did you

493
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:05,840
ask Qin Shi to handle Tianhang's case?

494
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,161
Yes, I did.

495
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,440
Qin Shi is a legal assistant.

496
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,001
I think it's against the rules here

497
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:13,320
if she handles a case alone.

498
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,080
Don't you worry.

499
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:18,320
I know the rules here

500
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,560
better than you do.

501
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,680
Besides,

502
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:23,801
Qin Shi's title is just a formality.

503
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:26,761
If Tianhang Group knows

504
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:28,440
that a legal assistant is handling

505
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:29,521
an important case for them,

506
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm afraid...

507
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,080
If the people here keep

508
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:33,560
their mouth shut,

509
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,801
they won't know

510
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:36,241
Qin Shi's current status.

511
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,320
Besides,

512
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,680
she was in charge of

513
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:39,840
Tianhang's acquisition.

514
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:41,881
Madam Tang,

515
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,440
I still think Tianhang's

516
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,080
acquisition...

517
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:45,121
Junhui.

518
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,161
We're here to provide

519
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,600
legal service to our clients.

520
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,161
I don't care

521
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,320
if our client is working

522
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,960
for Party A today then switch to Party B tomorrow.

523
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,161
The nature and the principles of our service

524
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,440
will not change.

525
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,560
Compared to a standard procedure,

526
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,080
our profession deals with changes

527
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,840
and crisis all the time.

528
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:08,960
And that hones our ability.

529
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:12,840
Only the people in trouble turn to us,

530
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:14,200
isn't that right?

531
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,121
Junhui.

532
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:23,440
How goes the wedding preparation with Wu Fei?

533
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:26,680
I know

534
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:28,680
you'll be busy

535
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,641
before the wedding.

536
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:34,360
But don't just bury yourself in work.

537
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,641
For a woman,

538
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,200
her most important and happiest moment

539
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,320
is her wedding.

540
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,921
Learn to manage your time well and priority.

541
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,921
Some things can be mended

542
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,921
but some things are gone forever

543
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:54,720
if you miss them.

544
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,960
Do you get what I mean?

545
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,161
Of course.

546
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,761
Madam Tang, I'll get back to my work.

547
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
(Tsutaya Books)

548
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:52,161
Come.

549
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,560
Your favorite cranberry juice.

550
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,161
Drink it.

551
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:02,960
(The flower language of mint)

552
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,001
is eternal love.

553
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:27,720
Where is Miss Qin?

554
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,560
She went to gather statements.

555
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,761
(Why won't you pick up my call?)

556
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
(Call me)

557
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:16,200
(when you can.)

558
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,281
(I need to talk to you.)

559
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:21,200
When I just arrived in Tianhang,

560
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,720
if I encountered a problem,

561
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,881
Yao Yao will help me patiently.

562
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:26,480
She is very kind.

563
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:27,921
And she gets along

564
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:30,241
with all of us.

565
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,250
(Tsutaya Books)

566
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,440
So? What did Qin Shi say?

567
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,560
Will she speak to Yin Zhiqiang?

568
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,281
I haven't talked to her yet.

569
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,680
What? You haven't?

570
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,121
But you called me

571
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,001
and said

572
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:49,641
you had a new idea.

573
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,001
I know.

574
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:53,560
I want to share my idea to you.

575
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:54,840
It won't take up too much of your time.

576
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:55,960
Ten minutes.

577
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:58,720
All right.

578
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,521
I briefly analyzed your case.

579
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
Basically, your client

580
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,881
wants to resign as soon as possible

581
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,560
but Tianhang won't release her.

582
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,720
So you're using the lens

583
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,041
of labor dispute to settle it.

584
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,320
You will mainly invoke Labor Contract Law

585
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,921
and Labor Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Law etc.

586
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:15,480
Yes.

587
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
You know it very well.

588
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,281
It seems like you have done your research.

589
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,281
Pretend this to be a puzzle.

590
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,401
How will you solve it?

591
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,080
Solve it?

592
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:27,921
What do you mean?

593
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,641
Is this a labor dispute?

594
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,320
Miss Yao.

595
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,521
This isn't a labor dispute.

596
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:37,121
Miss Li,

597
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:38,960
I don't get it.

598
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:40,560
If this isn't a labor dispute,

599
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,560
what is it then?

600
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:44,161
This is a personal dispute

601
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,840
that presents itself

602
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,161
under the form of a labor dispute.

603
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,641
The root of the problem comes from someone.

604
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,360
The key player

605
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:52,521
in the whole debacle

606
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,641
is Yin Zhiqiang.

607
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,521
I don't know why

608
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,001
you are on bad terms with him.

609
00:26:57,761 --> 00:26:59,560
But do you think it's possible for you

610
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:01,080
to persuade him?

611
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,560
Technically,

612
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,480
Yin Zhiqiang is like a mentor figure.

613
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,161
Back then, I resigned, got married,

614
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,080
and gave birth to my child.

615
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,241
And then, I got divorced.

616
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,041
I was lost and didn't know

617
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,360
what to do or where to go.

618
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,080
He gave me a job.

619
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:21,161
At first, I couldn't accept

620
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,560
the sudden change.

621
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,440
Mr. Yin encouraged me

622
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,440
and sent me abroad

623
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,200
to undergo training.

624
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:28,720
Without his help,

625
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
I wouldn't be able to do all that alone.

626
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:34,200
Mr. Yin.

627
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
I have checked

628
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,801
Yao Yao's career history.

629
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,680
I realized

630
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,440
it was you who gave her a chance

631
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:41,761
and you became her superior.

632
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,241
Tianhang also

633
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:44,360
gave her many validations

634
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,600
for her stellar performance.

635
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,720
But she

636
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,241
resents Tianhang and wants to leave?

637
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,401
Why is there a huge rift

638
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:54,480
between you two?

639
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,881
Young people nowadays

640
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,440
think they are the boss.

641
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,600
In my era,

642
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,080
we didn't have employment benefits

643
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,281
or bonuses whatsoever.

644
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,041
He will definitely say
I'm doing this for the money

645
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:07,200
but he knows very well the true reason

646
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,840
why I'm doing this.

647
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,041
Should I answer it?

648
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,620
(Miss Qin)

649
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:25,281
Hello?

650
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:26,360
Yao Yao,

651
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,720
I have a question.

652
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,241
It took you three months

653
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,521
to go from a waiter

654
00:28:31,641 --> 00:28:33,440
to a client service executive.

655
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:34,921
After two months of working

656
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,200
in the Client Service Department,

657
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,161
you were sent abroad to undergo training.

658
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,720
Six months after you returned,

659
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,881
you became a senior manager

660
00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:43,881
in the Client Service Department.

661
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,801
(You rose so quickly)

662
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:47,281
(but you only became)

663
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:48,921
(the Head of Client Service this March.)

664
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:50,440
It took you three years to get to that position.

665
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,241
May I know why?

666
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Qin Shi.

667
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:57,600
Why do you need to know them?

668
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,881
We can't just use Labor Contract Law

669
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,161
to resolve this case.

670
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:03,560
(There is a conflict between Yao Yao)

671
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,281
(and Yin Zhiqiang.)

672
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:05,680
(Unless we solve that too,)

673
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,560
Yin Zhiqiang won't let her go.

674
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,080
(I have brought that up Yin Zhiqiang.)

675
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,840
(He said)

676
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:14,320
Yao Yao's promotion was

677
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:15,600
a case of exception.

678
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,241
He said you lacked experience

679
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:18,281
so you needed more time

680
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:19,401
to learn the ropes.

681
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,200
Of course, he would say that.

682
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,360
But in fact,

683
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Yin Zhiqiang always brings female workers

684
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,041
with him to business dinners.

685
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:26,200
(At first,)

686
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,281
(I thought it was part of the job scope,)

687
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:29,041
(to attend dinners with him.)

688
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,480
(But then I realized)

689
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,521
(he was doing it for his personal gratification.)

690
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:33,840
(When he's drunk,)

691
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,720
(he will harass the female workers.)

692
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,360
(I find this behavior disgusting)

693
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:41,720
so I refused to join

694
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,281
him to those dinners.

695
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,881
(At first, he gave me excuses.)

696
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,840
(And slowly,)

697
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,360
(he resents me.)

698
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,320
(He wants me to leave.)

699
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,881
But he can't do a thing

700
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:51,080
because Tianhang and I

701
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,680
signed a ten-year contract.

702
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,440
(It gradually devolves
into the current situation.)

703
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,401
Miss Li.

704
00:30:02,281 --> 00:30:03,161
Will this new info

705
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,720
help you in solving this case?

706
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:11,960
Hold on.

707
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,401
Hello. You heard everything?

708
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:21,641
Any suggestion?

709
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:23,761
(Tsutaya Books)
I'm coming out now.

710
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,600
Qiqi, what's the matter?

711
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:32,200
It's okay. Mommy's here.

712
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,241
Who bullied you? Tell me.

713
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,960
He hit me.

714
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,161
Wait.

715
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,161
How dare you run away after hitting my son.

716
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,801
I didn't hit him.

717
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,480
But my son said you hit him.

718
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,121
Children don't lie.

719
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
He ran into me.

720
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,200
He even broke my phone.

721
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:48,720
You broke your phone yourself.

722
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,121
Don't blame my son for it.

723
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,161
Is this a scam?

724
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:52,881
Your phone is already broken, to begin with.

725
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:54,881
There, there.

726
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:55,720
Don't be scared.

727
00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:56,881
Mommy is here.

728
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,840
What are you staring at?

729
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:00,960
Just so you know,

730
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,401
you hurt my son

731
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:03,840
and you will pay for his medical bill.

732
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
There, there, my baby.

733
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,600
This mister did not hit him.

734
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:09,480
You're just a kid.

735
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,921
What do you know?

736
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:12,921
Miss, you just said

737
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
children wouldn't lie.

738
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,121
So your son won't lie

739
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:21,121
but I will?

740
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,281
Nonsense!

741
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,241
What is your relationship with him?

742
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,761
I see it now.

743
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:29,320
He's your father.

744
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,281
Come clean now.

745
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,360
Is he your father?

746
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,080
Did he tell you to say that?

747
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,440
Mind your manner, please.

748
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,080
Miss, if you don't trust me,

749
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,680
there's a security camera there.

750
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:45,200
You can check the security footage.

751
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,360
Sure. I'm not afraid of you.

752
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:51,680
Come.

753
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:52,840
Unbelievable.

754
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,161
There, there.

755
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,241
Miss Li.

756
00:31:58,641 --> 00:31:59,921
Thank you for what you have done.

757
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:03,041
I will think hard

758
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,881
and come up with a solution.

759
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:07,360
Hopefully.

760
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,560
Sunny, where are you?

761
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:22,401
I'll come and pick you up.

762
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,560
The security room?

763
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:28,080
Why are you there?

764
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:29,401
Don't wander around.

765
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,281
I'm coming over now.

766
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,720
Don't go anywhere.

767
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:41,921
Sunny.

768
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:43,200
Mommy.

769
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:45,281
What's the matter?

770
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:46,641
I'm fine.

771
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:49,161
Bye.

772
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,440
Who said you could snoop around

773
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:21,480
in Tianhang?

774
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,281
I was just trying

775
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
to obtain the chain of custody.

776
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,281
Tianhang has its own legal department.

777
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,041
They can give you

778
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,480
whatever document you need.

779
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:34,881
Qin Shi, did we just meet or what?

780
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:36,680
Did you overestimate yourself

781
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,200
or me?

782
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,360
Hui, putting everything aside,

783
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,521
Yin Zhiqiang is sly.

784
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,360
What we're doing here

785
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:48,921
is helping him destroy the career

786
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:50,521
of a talented worker.

787
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,360
Qin Shi, you listen to me now.

788
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:54,440
Do not make me look dumb

789
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,881
and do not challenge me.

790
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,761
I gave you this last chance.

791
00:33:58,921 --> 00:33:59,560
Here in Cheng & Hui,

792
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
you tuck your agenda away.

793
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,440
I need a good lawyer,

794
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,121
not a journalist or a saint.

795
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,881
I don't even need you

796
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,840
to be kind.

797
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,640
Make your decision now.

798
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,440
Darling.

799
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:18,521
What are you doing?

800
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,841
Playing a game.

801
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,361
I have a present for you.

802
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,521
You have a present...

803
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,601
Today is our anniversary?

804
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,880
Not our anniversary.

805
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:34,081
Not my birthday.

806
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:35,480
Not your birthday either.

807
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:37,761
Why are you giving me a present?

808
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:41,680
I hope you'll like it.

809
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,041
What?

810
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:46,801
Of course, I'll...

811
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,041
What is this?

812
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,120
Two lines.

813
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,680
I'm pregnant.

814
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,521
When?

815
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,041
Our...

816
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:58,160
Our second honeymoon?

817
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,120
Did I win?

818
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,041
I...

819
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:06,041
You dummy.

820
00:35:06,281 --> 00:35:06,920
Come.

821
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:08,480
What are we doing?

822
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:09,841
Let's test it again.

823
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,400
I already did many tests.

824
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:12,920
One more time, please.

825
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Come with me.

826
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:17,281
I tested with every brand,

827
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,841
using urine from different times.

828
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,281
I did all that.

829
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,561
My dear.

830
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:28,081
Am I becoming a father?

831
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:30,120
What's the matter?

832
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,521
Am I becoming a father?

833
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,281
Stop crying.

834
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,160
You...

835
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:37,601
You don't want the baby?

836
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:38,521
No.

837
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,480
Then stop crying already.

838
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,041
I don't know how to be a father.
What should I do?

839
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,601
I don't know how to be a mother either.

840
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,001
I'll learn it.

841
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,200
Do you think I can learn it?

842
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm dumb and I can learn it.

843
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:53,720
I'm sure you can.

844
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,720
Stop it, dear.

845
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:58,640
You're scaring me.

846
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:01,120
I am scared.

847
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:11,720
Sunny, stop playing that.

848
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,200
Sorry.

849
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,841
My son is a vegetarian.

850
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:25,521
So you might have to...

851
00:36:25,841 --> 00:36:27,321
It's okay. Vegetable is good.

852
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:28,841
It's good for your health.

853
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:30,200
I'm a vegetarian too.

854
00:36:31,601 --> 00:36:31,960
Hello.

855
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,041
Can I have your order, please?

856
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:35,400
We have six sets

857
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:36,120
today.

858
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,281
Thank you.

859
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:42,400
No. 1 for me.

860
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:43,680
No. 4 for me.

861
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,081
Just pick one.

862
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,680
Can I have the main of No. 2

863
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,120
and the side of No. 3?

864
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:54,041
Can I mix them?

865
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:55,841
I...

866
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,841
Is it possible?

867
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,120
Unfortunately not.

868
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:00,841
Then...

869
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:02,081
No. 3.

870
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,680
No. 3, it is.

871
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:23,361
What are you doing?

872
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:26,241
You scared me, my dear.

873
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,601
But you didn't do anything wrong

874
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:28,561
so why are you afraid?

875
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,281
What are you looking at?

876
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,160
A ledger.

877
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:33,521
Why?

878
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,200
I was thinking.

879
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,720
This home needs me now.

880
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:42,200
My mom is getting old.

881
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,160
You are pregnant.

882
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,120
Someone has to look after the company.

883
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:49,200
Although I'm not as competent as you,

884
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,400
I can still try my best.

885
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:55,880
Isn't the accounting period around the corner?

886
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,361
I can't do many things

887
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,561
but checking the account?

888
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:00,920
I can do that.

889
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,801
Right? So I asked the finance department

890
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,400
to send me the ledger.

891
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,841
Do you understand it?

892
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,001
You're underestimating me.

893
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,720
Don't you forget

894
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,400
that I grew up in a restaurant.

895
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,601
When I could walk,

896
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,361
I followed my mom

897
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,440
to collect payments.

898
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:19,200
Do I understand it?

899
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:21,160
What if you don't understand something?

900
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:23,200
Even if I can't understand it,

901
00:38:23,361 --> 00:38:24,521
you're here.

902
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,960
I'll ask you.

903
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:26,880
That's precisely

904
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,200
what I want to hear.

905
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,081
I actually want to ask you something.

906
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:32,241
Come.

907
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:33,321
Come. Come.

908
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,720
Come what come?

909
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:36,960
Say please now.

910
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,880
I am expecting.

911
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,680
Right. Come with me, please.

912
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,400
Let me hold you.

913
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:42,041
Come.

914
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,241
I have a baby now.

915
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,680
Right. Calm down.

916
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:47,561
Oh, the table.

917
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:48,841
Careful.

918
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:49,680
Don't affect the baby.

919
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,640
Let me see.

920
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,200
- What's the problem.
- Over here.

921
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:53,960
There must be a mistake.

922
00:38:54,321 --> 00:38:56,001
It can't be this cheap.

923
00:38:56,241 --> 00:38:57,281
Is there a mistake?

924
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,361
Why didn't you reply my message?

925
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,081
People change.

926
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,601
People won't change.

927
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:55,640
Our nature won't change.

928
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,281
Sorry, Yao Yao.

929
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:00,920
I involved Yang Hua

930
00:40:01,281 --> 00:40:02,920
so that he could persuade Qin Shi.

931
00:40:06,241 --> 00:40:08,001
Sunny, go listen to music.

932
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,720
Put them on.

933
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:14,801
This side.

934
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:21,601
What a coincidence.

935
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,680
Miss Qin is your wife.

936
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,720
Do you want to know

937
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,361
my opinion regarding your case?

938
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,160
Go ahead.

939
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:38,920
I have looked into the laws

940
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,241
and similar cases.

941
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:42,400
If we take the legal route,

942
00:40:43,281 --> 00:40:44,480
regardless of the outcome,

943
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,841
you will lose.

944
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:47,561
The damages and the time

945
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:49,480
you have to pay up are huge.

946
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:53,841
Since the problem is Yin Zhiqiang,

947
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:56,001
let's deal with him.

948
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:57,680
How?

949
00:40:58,281 --> 00:40:59,081
Two solutions.

950
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:00,480
One, satisfy him.

951
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,720
Two, kick him out.

952
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:03,120
I suggest we go with the latter.

953
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,761
It comes with two advantages.

954
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:05,801
One,

955
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,041
your resignation will not

956
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:08,120
be decided by someone else.

957
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:08,720
And two,

958
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
you want to leave Tianhang

959
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,960
because of him,

960
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,241
not because of Tianhang.

961
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:13,680
If you have a better boss,

962
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:15,241
maybe you'll want to stay.

963
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,120
You're right.

964
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:19,480
So how do we get him out of the picture?

965
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:22,081
Like I said,

966
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,241
our nature won't change.

967
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,081
He is inherently

968
00:41:26,281 --> 00:41:28,001
misogynistic and chauvinist.

969
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,440
He will abuse his position

970
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,001
to establish inappropriate relationships
with others

971
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,321
and to maintain his power.

972
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,680
No one is there to keep him in check.

973
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:36,561
Do you think he'll ever stop?

974
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,241
It's a brilliant sabotage.

975
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,920
Let's gather more evidence

976
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:41,920
in this area.

977
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,160
It's just like He Dongna's case.

978
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,241
Hiding key evidence intentionally

979
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
can lose you the case.

980
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,521
I'll keep on looking.

981
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:51,920
He will have a lot of dirty history,

982
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,281
a bunch of scandals waiting to be discovered.

983
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,041
I have done the investigation.

984
00:41:58,321 --> 00:41:59,521
I can even tell you

985
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,281
who gave their consent

986
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,761
and who was forced to please him.

987
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:06,041
But you need to know this.

988
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,880
Even if you go to them,

989
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:09,720
they won't come forth.

990
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,601
For many years,

991
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,480
I fought against Yin Zhiqiang.

992
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,041
I used to have comrades

993
00:42:16,321 --> 00:42:18,801
but they gave up one by one.

994
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,601
I'm the only one left now.

995
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,640
And at the moment,

996
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:25,001
I am tired.

997
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,321
I just want to keep Sunny company.

998
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,361
I can't fight this battle anymore.

999
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:47,241
Have you thought about

1000
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:48,801
leaving?

1001
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,400
No.

1002
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,880
I don't think you fit in here.

1003
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:55,241
But I do.

1004
00:42:57,001 --> 00:42:58,001
I'm not joking.

1005
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,561
Me neither.

1006
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:06,920
If I wanted to leave,

1007
00:43:07,081 --> 00:43:08,001
I would have done that already.

1008
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,281
I invested so much time here.

1009
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,720
If I leave now,

1010
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,960
my hard work will go to waste.

1011
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,200
I haven't achieved my goal yet.

1012
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:18,480
So now is not the time for me to leave.

1013
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:23,601
I know

1014
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,200
Madam Tang gave you Tianhang's

1015
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:28,081
labor dispute contract.

1016
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,960
I am responsible for it.

1017
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,801
Give it to me now

1018
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,841
and don't follow up on it.

1019
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:36,160
Tao Junhui.

1020
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,521
Where do you

1021
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,960
get that confidence from?

1022
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:41,400
Can you lend me some?

1023
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:43,120
Do you truly think

1024
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:44,521
you are invincible?

1025
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:45,841
Are you willing

1026
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:47,041
to give up your principles

1027
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,561
and be Yin Zhiqiang's weapon?

1028
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,720
I am a lawyer.

1029
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:55,241
I have my own ethics.

1030
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:57,841
I remember

1031
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:59,041
our jurisprudence lecturer

1032
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,281
in the university

1033
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,521
told us that when a lawyer

1034
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
talked about ethics

1035
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,440
in a stoic face,

1036
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:07,480
he was just covering the fact

1037
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,200
