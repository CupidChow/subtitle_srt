has practised what he preached.

21
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,700
He cleaned it quite thoroughly.

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,740
Can you stop looking at your phone?

23
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,180
Are you done already?

24
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,340
Almost.

25
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,540
Stop staring at me, just talk it away.

26
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,180
Mr. Tao,

27
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,340
I'd like to sincerely discuss

28
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,980
a question with you.

29
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,340
It's not necessary,
just get to the point.

30
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,380
Look.

31
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,780
We're both rookies of the 11th floor.

32
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,380
I've worked hard

33
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,260
for two years to reach this position.

34
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,740
I know.

35
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,460
To disgust me,

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,500
Wu Fei got you in here.

37
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,260
You two succeeded, you did it.

38
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,500
You did disgust me.

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,380
Actually, I find

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,340
myself in an awkward position now.

41
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,620
Logically speaking,

42
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,300
Mr. Jin is my immediate supervisor.

43
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,900
But so far,

44
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,540
I only met him twice.

45
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,700
After the previous meeting,

46
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,860
I found

47
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,580
that I still got a lot to learn.

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,820
So can you...

49
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,940
You want me to lead you, right?

50
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,140
You're such a broad-minded man, Mr. Tao.

51
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,180
Let's forget

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,260
about our past.

53
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,020
From now on, let's get along well.

54
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,180
Qin Shi, you haven't changed a bit

55
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,820
over the years.

56
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,820
Just that I think

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,380
you've become more shameless.

58
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,820
One should move forward.

59
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,780
Look, whether it's the background

60
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,500
or the capability,

61
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,340
I'm no match to you.

62
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,180
I won't be a threat to you.

63
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,900
Stop.

64
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,900
You don't have to butter up me.

65
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,860
Logistic contract dispute,

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
construction contract dispute,

67
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,980
and shareholding contract dispute.

68
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,260
You'll start from reading the contracts.

69
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,220
Find out the bugs

70
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,060
and contradictions in the contracts
and list them all.

71
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,340
Also, analyse
the needed testimony content

72
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,620
from three different perspectives,

73
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,020
which are the perspectives
of the petitioner,

74
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,340
the defendant and the judge.

75
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,020
Okay, when do you need it?

76
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,500
Tomorrow morning.

77
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,380
That's harsh.

78
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,140
Just say it if you can't.

79
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,060
I can do it, there's nothing I can't do.

80
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,740
Where are you going?

81
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,140
Mind your own business.

82
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,420
Read it carefully.

83
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,300
I'll check it when I come back.

84
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:32,900
Mom.

85
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,860
Mom.

86
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,300
What is it?

87
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,980
This, this is...

88
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,020
It's pig brain.

89
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,660
You haven't eaten it before?

90
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,220
You didn't even eat this before.

91
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,300
Weren't you graduated

92
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,020
as a master
from the renowned university?

93
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,780
How could you not have eaten
pig brain before?

94
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,820
I was an undergraduate.

95
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,100
I didn't take master course.

96
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,260
You didn't get a master degree

97
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,580
because you didn't eat pig brain.

98
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,660
Let me tell you this.

99
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,500
This is

100
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,340
Shi's favourite food.

101
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,980
You've got to learn to cook it.

102
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,420
So you can cook for her in future.

103
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,940
Right,

104
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,860
I tell you what.

105
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
The year when she took
the university entrance exam,

106
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,100
about a month before the exam,

107
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,380
I braised one for her everyday.

108
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,860
Come, look.

109
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,420
We'll wash it first.

110
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,340
Then,

111
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,180
we can steam it,

112
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,180
we can also braise it in soy sauce.

113
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,700
By the way,

114
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,340
Shi likes to eat it

115
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,620
with a little spicy flavour.

116
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,100
Pickled chilli flavour,

117
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,820
spicy flavour and steamed pig brain.

118
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,460
All the flavours are right here.

119
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,620
You know what?

120
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,540
These are Shi's favourite flavours.

121
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,060
Here, try it.

122
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,340
Eat up.

123
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,660
People who work with brain like you guys

124
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,580
should eat more pig brains.

125
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,460
It can boost your brainpower.

126
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,380
Mom, actually, it is

127
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,540
not very scientific.

128
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,060
Because the main component

129
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,780
of pig brain is cholesterol and lipid.

130
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Anyway, it's good for you.

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,580
Here, try it.

132
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,340
Come.

133
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,940
How is it? It tastes good, doesn't it?

134
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,300
It's delicious.

135
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,420
Right, it's delicious.

136
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,020
I knew you would like it.

137
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:51,740
Come.

138
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,260
Taste every flavour.

139
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:55,940
Eat it.

140
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,540
Don't just eat this.

141
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,780
Try these two flavours.

142
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,060
Sure.

143
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,100
It's pickled chilli flavour.

144
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,060
I'm sure Shi will feel excited and happy

145
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,300
when she comes back tonight.

146
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,740
It tastes good, right?

147
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,700
It's delicious.

148
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,220
Have you found a house?

149
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,340
No, not so fast.

150
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,980
I saw this on the news.

151
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,660
The housing price has been
stable lately.

152
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,420
It's a perfect timing to buy one.

153
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,060
It depends on the location.

154
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,500
The well-located property

155
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,900
is expensive.

156
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,620
What do you mean?

157
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,460
They want you

158
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,220
to buy a property near them?

159
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,180
They didn't say that.

160
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,660
How much more do you need
for the down payment?

161
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,820
I don't have much money on my card.

162
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,180
You have no idea,

163
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,900
nowadays,

164
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,940
a random well-located property

165
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,100
costs over ten million yuan.

166
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
You knew how much I got

167
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,460
on my card.

168
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,820
Whoever pays is the boss.

169
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,740
If they want us to obey them,

170
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,660
they'll have to pay.

171
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,900
Didn't you say

172
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,420
they owned many houses?

173
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,060
Well,

174
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,380
I mean the first housing loan.

175
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,980
Geez.

176
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,100
We shouldn't have given

177
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,540
the house to Qin Shi.

178
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,580
Mom,

179
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,660
you're being unreasonable.

180
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,660
When I was with Qin Shi,

181
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
it was us who couldn't pay

182
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,660
for the house in full amount,

183
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,420
wasn't it?

184
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,300
It was Qin family who paid for it.

185
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,900
When we broke up,

186
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,980
they paid us at the highest market price.

187
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,540
You always told me to live
within our means.

188
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,580
Do things

189
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,540
according to one's ability.

190
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,780
You said so yourself.

191
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,460
That's right.

192
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,300
Let's just buy a small house.

193
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,140
I'll live there.

194
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,180
This big house can be used

195
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,180
as your matrimonial home.

196
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,260
It's unrealistic.

197
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,620
Our house is far away from the law firm.

198
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,180
It's troublesome for Wu Fei

199
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
to go back and forth between these two places.

200
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,340
What about your new workplace?

201
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,020
Is it nice?

202
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,620
Cheng & Hui is

203
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,620
one of the top ten law firms.

204
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,860
It's a promising company.

205
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,820
Maybe it'll rank first next year.

206
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,580
But I've got to remind you this.

207
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,540
You must not interact with Qin Shi.

208
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,420
You've said that many times.

209
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,700
Qin Shi is married.

210
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,180
And she's got a kid.

211
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Nothing can ever happen between us.

212
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,820
Son, I'm saying

213
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,100
that Wu Fei is a good kid.

214
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,060
She's pretty, young and simple.

215
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,460
And she's from a good family.

216
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,660
How is Qin family

217
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,540
a match to them?

218
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,460
Qin family is such a mess.

219
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:03,900
Geez.

220
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,660
So you've got to cherish her

221
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,020
as you meet a person like this.

222
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,860
Can you stop worrying about me?

223
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,180
I treat Feifei very well.

224
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,140
I love her.

225
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,380
Didn't you tell me

226
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,900
a good man can get a wife for sure?

227
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,980
Don't you think?

228
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,660
I've got a lot of admirers.

229
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,660
Here you go again,
you flatter yourself.

230
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,580
What is it?

231
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,620
Will you forget about me

232
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,460
after getting a wife?

233
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,660
I won't, Mom, I love you most.

234
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,940
Junhui didn't sign it?

235
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
I didn't show him this.

236
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,780
I don't want to sign it.

237
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,140
Feifei,

238
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,620
didn't we have a deal?

239
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,940
Dad, can you not bring this up?

240
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,660
I really love Junhui.

241
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,220
And did you use

242
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,620
Mr. Ding's case to test him?

243
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,620
If yes,

244
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,660
we won't take up this case.

245
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,620
You ask Mr. Ding to find someone else.

246
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,500
Don't do this.

247
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,100
Fine, just don't sign it.

248
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,100
This is the suggestion

249
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,180
from the legal department of the company.

250
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,460
I immediately showed it to you.

251
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,940
Besides, I've said

252
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,300
it's your decision to sign it or not.

253
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,460
I won't force you.

254
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,740
I have a lot of faith in Junhui.

255
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,180
But about Mr. Ding's case,

256
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,580
you've got me wrong.

257
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,140
I did introduce two lawyers to him.

258
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,340
But he still couldn't deal with his daughter.

259
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Then, he knew that I got

260
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,620
a son-in-law who's a lawyer.

261
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,420
So I referred him to the law firm.

262
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,140
Really?

263
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,180
Of course.

264
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,020
You can ask Mr. Ding about it.

265
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,380
See if I'm telling the truth.

266
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
That's more like it.

267
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,260
It's hard to be a good man.

268
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,620
I brought you business.

269
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,580
But I was wrongly accused.

270
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,340
Sorry, Dad.

271
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,420
By the way,

272
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,220
when will you

273
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,340
sign the contract with our company?

274
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,900
Madam Tang asked me
about it several times.

275
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,540
We're checking the contract.

276
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,660
Why do I feel like
I'm always deceived by you?

277
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,220
How could I deceive you?

278
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,660
This is a win-win.

279
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,780
A win-win.

280
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,860
Alright, then, a win-win.

281
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm leaving.

282
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,380
It's almost dinner time,
where are you going?

283
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,180
Your daughter is very busy.

284
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,740
I've got to collate the information.

285
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,580
You were right.

286
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,460
My daughter has returned the agreement to me.

287
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Wu Fei is naive.

288
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
It makes sense for her to return it.

289
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,460
(She seems to have noticed)

290
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,380
(that there's another intention
behind Mr. Ding's case.)

291
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,460
(Even my daughter could notice it,)

292
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,660
let alone Tao Junhui.

293
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,980
(I didn't think that much.)

294
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,020
(But what happened to Ms. Lan)

295
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,340
(was really alarming.)

296
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,420
(I've only got a spoiled)

297
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,100
(and silly daughter in my life.)

298
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,380
I'd rather be a bad guy now.

299
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,660
It's better than losing

300
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,860
my life's savings to the ungrateful man

301
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,060
when she's being taken advantage of.

302
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,580
Don't worry.

303
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,540
In any way,

304
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,860
the effect will be the same.

305
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,500
(Just rest assured, Mr. Wu.)

306
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,860
(I'll show you the result you want.)

307
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,180
Okay, that's all for now.

308
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,300
Goodbye.

309
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,500
What are you going to do with Qin Shi?

310
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,220
What's wrong?

311
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,660
You nominated her.

312
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,900
But you didn't vote for her.

313
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,620
You were the one who promoted her.

314
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,820
And it was you who suppressed her.

315
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,900
What are you planning to do?

316
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,220
You either train her well.

317
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,220
Or at this rate,

318
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,820
three months later,

319
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,940
I guess she would jump ship.

320
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,860
We would lose two hotshots

321
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,060
in the family department.

322
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,220
Why do that?

323
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,260
Qin Shi

324
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,260
is too ambitious.

325
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,260
She won't listen to anyone.

326
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,060
She'll do what we tell her not to do.

327
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,580
The cases she took up

328
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,500
in the family department

329
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,420
and that of the corporation department

330
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,900
are in a different league.

331
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,620
Based on her personality,

332
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,620
she'll be in troubles
sooner or later.

333
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,860
By then,

334
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,020
we can do nothing

335
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,820
but to clean up her mess.

336
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,020
Rest assured.

337
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,860
I'm not really going to suppress her.

338
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,020
I just want

339
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,980
to tame her

340
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,100
before she officially

341
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,820
becomes a lawyer

342
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,940
of the corporation department.

343
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,820
I heard

344
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,540
that you're going to work, right?

345
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,300
And you want to buy a house as well.

346
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,300
Yes.

347
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,460
Is this your idea?

348
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,340
Or it's because Qin Shi pressures you?

349
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,860
It's my idea.

350
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,980
That's more like it.

351
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,500
Yang,

352
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,740
as a man,
you should have your own career.

353
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,420
You can't just stay at home

354
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,020
and do houseworks.

355
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,660
I'm not saying

356
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,700
that it's bad to do houseworks.

357
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,860
The point is, look at you,

358
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,820
you're young,

359
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,260
handsome and smart.

360
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,260
Doing chores at home is

361
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,820
no better than establishing

362
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,220
your own career out there.

363
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,260
Don't you think?

364
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,700
The point is

365
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,700
if you go to work as well,

366
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,740
both of you will be busy,

367
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,180
no one can take care

368
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,580
of the household chores.

369
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,140
Rest assured, Mom.

370
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,860
I work a nine-to-five.

371
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,340
I'll be punctual,
nothing will be held up.

372
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,460
And I've promised
to take care of Qin Shi,

373
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,740
I'll be sure to keep my word.

374
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,020
I think

375
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,460
you can focus on your work,

376
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,700
I'll take care of the household chores.

377
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,540
I'll do the back-office work for you.

378
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,580
Just concentrate on doing

379
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,100
your business.

380
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,860
Right?

381
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,220
Thanks, Mom.

382
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,420
It's getting late.

383
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,180
I'm going back.

384
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,300
Mom, aren't you going
to wait for Qin Shi?

385
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,780
I won't wait for her.

386
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,460
She'll lose track of time

387
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,300
when she's working overtime.

388
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,380
Yang,

389
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,020
if she comes home late,

390
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,420
you go and pick her up.

391
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
It's not safe for a girl

392
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,900
to be alone at night.

393
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,860
Sure.

394
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,380
I'm leaving.

395
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,100
Okay.

396
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,820
Okay, go back inside.

397
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,740
I'll get going.

398
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,500
Alright.

399
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,420
Mr. Tao.

400
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,790
(Logistics Warehousing Contract)

401
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,220
Hello.

402
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,260
You're here for Miss Qin?

403
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,700
Yes.

404
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,460
She's working at the 11th floor now.

405
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,660
I know.

406
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,860
Miss Qin is very lucky.

407
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,660
There's someone

408
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,780
here to bring supper for her.

409
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,140
How's your hand?

410
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,900
It's getting better, I'm going in.

411
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
(Meeting Room)

412
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,940
Don't touch her.

413
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,060
Let's go.

414
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,020
Why are you here, Yang Hua?

415
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,060
What's the time?

416
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,140
It's already nine.

417
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,300
Go back to your office

418
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,300
if you want to sleep next time.

419
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,140
Let's go.

420
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,660
So this is your office.

421
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,060
Didn't someone

422
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,100
already tell you this?

423
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,580
I'm almost done.

424
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,580
It's just temporary.

425
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,100
Okay, let's go.

426
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,920
(Reference Room)

427
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,060
Why did you come

428
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,100
to my company?

429
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,660
Are you mad?

430
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,700
Is it because I didn't see the message

431
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,300
you sent me on Wechat?

432
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,580
(When are you getting off work?)

433
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,540
(Are you at the law firm?)

434
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,860
(I'll go there for you.)

435
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,260
(I'm on my way now.)

436
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,620
(I'll be there in about half an hour.)

437
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,380
I was reading the documents just now.

438
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,180
I felt sleepy so I fell asleep.

439
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,500
I didn't even know

440
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,860
when Tao Junhui came in.

441
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,780
I didn't tell you that Tao Junhui came

442
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,540
to our law firm, did I?

443
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,060
Or I can just

444
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,380
take a cab home.

445
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,740
He was brought in to the company.

446
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,780
No one knew about it.

447
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,260
I was busy a while ago.

448
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,860
So I didn't get to tell you about it.

449
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,740
Why are you explaining so much?

450
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,580
Do I look like I'm mad?

451
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,220
Of course not.

452
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,460
I think you've done a great job.

453
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,540
You're so broad-minded.

454
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,100
Such a model boyfriend.

455
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,300
Let me make a mark on you.

456
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,300
Thanks for coming to pick me up.

457
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,580
You should ask Mr. Guo

458
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,300
to stop dilly-dallying.

459
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,340
What did he mean he can't make it?

460
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,260
I'll go to the company tomorrow, okay?

461
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:32,820
Tell him

462
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,660
that I'll do it if he can't.

463
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,620
Hubby?

464
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,660
Qin Wenyu?

465
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,230
(Like)

466
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,420
It's so annoying.

467
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,220
No.

468
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,380
You're annoying.

469
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,420
What are you doing?

470
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,540
What do you want?

471
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,500
Dear,

472
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,020
I know it must be tough for you.

473
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,860
You've done so much for this family.

474
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,940
But I've done nothing.

475
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,140
So I feel sorry for you.

476
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
I decide

477
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,660
that from now on,

478
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,700
I must make

479
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,180
you happy every single day.

480
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:29,980
Wait a moment.

481
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,580
Did you do

482
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,380
something wrong again?

483
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Dear,

484
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,100
I've reformed for your sake.

485
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,220
You're my role model.

486
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,820
So from now on,

487
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,820
I'll always be your man

488
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,460
no matter what happens.

489
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,500
Geez.

490
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,260
Hubby,

491
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
did you prepare all this for me?

492
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Of course.

493
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,820
Let me ask you this.

494
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,300
How are you going to guarantee

495
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,700
that you can make me

496
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,620
happy like this every single day?

497
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,060
I'll make every day

498
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,900
like a holiday.

499
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,180
Everyday is like our wedding night.

500
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,180
Geez.

501
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,540
Put me down, Qin Wenyu.

502
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Let's go to our chamber!

503
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,620
Well,

504
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,100
the size of the office has nothing

505
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,580
to do with my capability

506
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,980
of fighting a legal battle.

507
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,180
What matters now is

508
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,740
that there are cases
and someone is there to lead me.

509
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,300
Otherwise,

510
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,460
it's useless to give me an office, isn't it?

511
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,740
Why are you mad at me?

512
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,580
Aren't you mad to work

513
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,540
at such a place?

514
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,900
The other have well-lit offices.

515
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,420
But there's no window in your office.

516
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,300
Aren't you mad?

517
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,100
Are you feeling bad for me?

518
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,620
You said

519
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,620
you want to do great things

520
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,340
and change the rules.

521
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,340
What have you achieved now?

522
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,460
Don't you think

523
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,460
you're being used?

524
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,740
Who's using me?

525
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,100
What could they use me for?

526
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,660
They're using your eagerness.

527
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,140
Just pretend that

528
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,100
you didn't make it through,

529
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,740
that you were ineligible

530
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,940
to take this position.

531
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,300
All your suffering is

532
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,580
caused by your desire of acting
to be proactive.

533
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,100
What's wrong?

534
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,340
I'm rebooting now.

535
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,580
I want to erase

536
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,660
everything you said just now.

537
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,300
I've worked all day.

538
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,380
I don't want to argue with you.

539
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,780
Ding Dong.

540
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,060
Okay.

541
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
We can start over again.

542
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,300
Are you feeling bad for me?

543
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,820
Let's eat.

544
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,140
What have you cooked for me?

545
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,900
Did you make it?

546
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,340
You're so virtuous.

547
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,860
Just now, I...

548
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,580
What had happened just now?

549
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
What did my mom tell you?

550
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,380
She asked you to eat more pig brains.

551
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,460
It can boost your brainpower.

552
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,540
Did she make you pig brains?

553
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,700
She's best at cooking pig brains.

554
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,340
No one can cook it better than her.

555
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,260
About desire,

556
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,260
we have different perspectives on it.

557
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,460
So let's not talk about it.

558
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,020
Besides having a problem

559
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,300
with my office,

560
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,300
do you also have a thing for Tao Junhui?

561
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,420
I'm not interested in men.

562
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,700
Good, then.

563
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,580
Then, do you think

564
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,060
that I have feelings for Tao Junhui?

565
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,940
Do you?

566
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,100
I don't.

567
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,180
Even if there's no Wu Fei,

568
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,260
I won't have

569
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,220
a thing for this guy as well.

570
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,860
In my current situation,

571
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,660
I can barely get

572
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
half of the case

573
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,340
by swallowing my pride.

574
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,460
Apart from him,

575
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,100
I can't steal the others' cases.

576
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,260
I took the opportunity and used

577
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,580
every means

578
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,980
to accumulate experiences.

579
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:39,980
Anyway,

580
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,380
I don't care what the others say.

581
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,660
As long as I have the capability.

582
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:45,740
Besides,

583
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,380
Tao Junhui won't necessarily stay
in our law firm

584
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,860
even if he passes his probation period.

585
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,580
Madam Tang even encouraged me.

586
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,140
Maybe the largest office

587
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:54,860
will be mine.

588
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,700
Tang Yihui is still treating you
like a lapdog?

589
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
How could you say that?

590
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,580
Woof woof.

591
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,260
Isn't a dog cute?

592
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,020
Actually, Madam Tang is nice to me.

593
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,260
With a boss who's willing to
give you a chance,

594
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,660
it's no big deal to be a lapdog.

595
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,340
I used to be

596
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,060
on the top spot
in the family department.

597
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,820
Now that I've come
to the corporation department.

598
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,580
I'm the weakest wolf
in the wolf pack.

599
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,180
I'm such a weakling.

600
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,580
So I certainly have to cozy up to the boss.

601
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,900
When I gain a firm foothold,

602
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,660
only then, I have time
to execute my plan.

603
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,820
Let me ask you a question.

604
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,820
Does Tao Junhui have
any thoughts on you?

605
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,380
He does.

606
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
He wants to choke me to death.

607
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,780
Why would he want to choke you?

608
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,580
I've broken up with him for two years.

609
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,500
And I've been with you for two years.

610
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,900
We even have

611
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,020
a two-and-a-half-year-old kid.

612
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,060
Of all things,

613
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,940
I forgot about this bug.

614
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,820
Well,

615
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,220
I can't explain it now.

616
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,060
To him,

617
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,020
I'm a slut who cheated on him.

618
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,300
Do you think he'll hate you?

619
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,100
I think so.

620
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,660
It was him

621
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,540
who couldn't handle his family
and hurt you.

622
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,380
What's the reason for him to hate you?

623
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
I guess

624
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,500
he must've thought an outstanding

625
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,060
and prideful person

626
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,820
like him

627
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,180
was outclassed.

628
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,500
Outstanding?

629
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,100
Prideful?

630
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,220
Hello?

631
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,980
(He must've thought)

632
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,820
(an outstanding and prideful person)

633
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,620
(like him)

634
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,980
(was outclassed.)

635
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:35,620
(Prenuptial Agreement (First Draft))

636
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,780
God of Wealth, Sprite,

637
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,020
I believe you've got

638
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
the ability and intelligence to discern
between truth and falsehood.

639
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,620
Now, you try to select

640
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,780
who's smarter and more outstanding.

641
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,140
Come on.

642
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,460
No rush, take your time.

643
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,140
See, I told you.

644
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,940
The answer is easy and obvious.

645
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,380
What are you doing, Sprite?

646
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
You've got to be rational.

647
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,700
Do you have time?

648
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,860
Help me check

649
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,940
if the company of Cao Yiren is

650
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,860
a profitable company

651
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,660
with good fund status.

652
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:41,940
I have no idea.

653
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,180
You don't know?

654
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,500
Didn't you say you can

655
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,020
figure it out as long as

656
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,380
there's a data?

657
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,020
Didn't you say

658
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,020
that the data won't lie?

659
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,700
You're talking about a barcode scanner.

660
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,020
If you really want to check

661
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,780
the asset report of a company,

662
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,740
that report of yours is far
from sufficient.

663
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,220
I'll go get more information.

664
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,820
Why do you look at me like this?

665
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,820
You came just to ask me

666
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,620
to check the documents?

667
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,460
I'm going to bed.

668
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,140
Close the door when you leave.

669
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,300
You're going to sleep?

670
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,780
Aren't you going to help me check
the documents?

671
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,700
Ask that outstanding partner of yours

672
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,020
to check it for you, I can't do it.

673
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,940
Are you jealous?

674
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,340
Are you jealous
because I said he's outstanding?

675
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,100
You've thought too much.

676
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,300
Only incompetent people will be jealous.

677
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,380
I've never been jealous of anyone.

678
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,060
I'll respect those
who are better than me.

679
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,900
I don't have to be jealous

680
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
of those who are not
as excellent as I am.

681
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,020
Very well.

682
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,300
I got it.

683
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,740
You're not jealous.

684
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,100
But you look cute

685
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,740
like this.

686
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:37,980
Good night.

687
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,940
God of Wealth and Sprite,

688
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,580
are you shopping?

689
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,500
What is this?

690
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,140
Did you draw it?

691
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,540
Self-potrait?

692
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,620
I thought

693
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,060
you asked God of Wealth and Sprite
to vote for you.

694
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,580
It's a good drawing.

695
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,980
Remember to draw one for me next time.

696
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,020
I don't like to compare with the others.

697
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,740
So they won't have
a feeling of inferiority.

698
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,820
But as we're having this conversation,

699
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:35,980
I'll make an exception

700
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,020
and give you a chance

701
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,020
to illustrate your point.

702
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,940
How great is Tao Junhui?

703
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,020
I tell you what.

704
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,780
Don't be so serious

705
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,940
about her ex-boyfriend.

706
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,980
He's no talent.

707
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,180
He's just a lawyer.

708
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,780
All he can do is paying lip service.

709
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,180
He's no match to us.

710
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,740
You know what?

711
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,020
We're the representatives
of high intelligent people.

712
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,220
In this age of the Internet,

713
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,620
we're the high-tech talents

714
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,380
that the society needs.

715
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,660
This is the only way to change the world

716
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,580
and create the future.

717
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,780
What's wrong?

718
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,420
Did

719
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,340
your Miss Qin feel

720
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,980
very ashamed

721
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,700
of herself?

722
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,300
Did she think

723
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,300
that she got a narrow vision?

724
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,180
In the end, she fell for you?

725
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,620
What did she say?

726
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,940
She said...

727
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,220
I don't think it's fair

728
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,820
to ask me to answer this question.

729
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,380
Good morning, Mr. Cai.

730
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,860
I'm impressed.

731
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
He held a dual masters in Laws.

732
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
He received one of it in England.

733
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,340
He was also the champion

734
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,740
of the math competition in Pujiang.

735
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,380
Impressive.

736
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,020
He was the debate team leader.

737
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,620
His team ranked first four times.

738
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,140
He won the best debater award thrice.

739
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,100
He's quite charming.

740
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,380
He even does judo.

741
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,420
He's quite good at fighting.

742
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,620
I understand you now.

743
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,060
But the truth is you've lost.

744
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:16,860
It's alright.

745
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,980
Anyway, you're Miss Qin's husband now.

746
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,860
You already won in this aspect.

747
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,820
Don't assume

748
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,380
that you can work
in this industry alone.

749
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,380
I tell you what!

750
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,980
If you dare to walk out that door,

751
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,740
don't ever

752
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,780
think of entering
the securities industry again.

753
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,980
Yang, there's a new ramen restaurant

754
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,100
next to our company.

755
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,060
The food is delicious.

756
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,060
I'll treat you to lunch.

757
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,860
Let's go together.

758
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,100
You look charming like this, I mean it.

759
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,260
Keep this.

760
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,700
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

761
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,620
Qiu Jianxiang, Mr. Qiu,

762
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,500
seldom comes to the bank.

763
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,180
I saw him once by accident.

764
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,300
I only realised our bank is

765
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,060
collaborating with him.

766
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,300
What is he doing at the bank?

767
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,020
Isn't he the boss of Fangyu Finance?

768
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,580
Our bank launches
and sells all the fund trust

769
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,340
of Fangyu Group on their behalf.

770
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,900
Besides, he's close to Jia

771
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,380
from the credit department

772
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,940
and our President.

773
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,980
Yang,

774
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,660
there are many people

775
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,180
we don't like in the world.

776
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,260
Let's just ignore him.

777
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,380
Also, there's

778
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,340
no interaction between you and him.

779
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,340
Are you going to resign?

780
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,020
I have six-month provident fund

781
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,540
to pay, why would I leave?

782
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,980
Six months.

783
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,100
Hello.

784
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,100
- Hello.
- Hello?

785
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,500
I'm here.

786
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,220
Where are you?

787
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,900
Look back.

788
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,700
Put me down.

789
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,220
You're late.

790
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,060
Put me down.

791
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,140
Let me introduce to you.

792
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,100
This is my childhood friend,

793
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,300
