Qin Shi.

20
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,679
You're so gorgeous.

21
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:17,199
Qin Shi, it's a waste for a gorgeous woman like you
to be with that pathetic Yang Hua.

22
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,839
I deserve you.

23
00:02:21,278 --> 00:02:22,399
If you come to me,

24
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,319
I promise

25
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:27,238
you'll live in heaven every day.

26
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,158
Is it?

27
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,998
Dongna,

28
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:36,039
why... why are you here?

29
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,319
Yes, why am I here?

30
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,358
You this backstabbing scoundrel!

31
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,518
Dongna, listen to me.

32
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:49,039
I was just playing along
with her, Dongna.

33
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:50,158
Cheng & Hui insisted
on pushing her to me.

34
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:50,718
My foot.

35
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:52,358
It's true, you're the only one for me.

36
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:53,358
Do you think I'm blind?

37
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:54,358
Since the first day

38
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,959
you met this woman,

39
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,718
you've started to hit on her.

40
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,718
Do you think I wasn't aware of that?

41
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:02,238
Dongna, Dongna, listen to me.

42
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:02,759
Both of us

43
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,479
must've been set up.

44
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,358
You're a scoundrel.

45
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:05,078
This must be a trap.

46
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:05,878
Dongna, listen to me.

47
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:06,759
This is a trap.

48
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:08,158
Quick, let's leave, Dongna.

49
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,039
Let go of me.

50
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,039
Mr. Hu, Mr. Hu, listen to me.

51
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,078
There's nothing between Dongna and me.

52
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:16,199
I was with Miss Qin...

53
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,599
I came here with Miss Qin to...

54
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:25,839
Hu!

55
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:27,759
Hu! Hu!

56
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:35,959
I'll ask someone to send

57
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,919
the divorce settlement
to your office tomorrow.

58
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:38,919
Also,

59
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,399
I'll get the custody of the kid.

60
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,158
As for the rest,

61
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,518
I'll have my lawyer talk to you.

62
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:57,638
Hu!

63
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,518
Bro, how long do you think
it'll take us

64
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,919
to buy a big house like this?

65
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:07,158
It takes forever.

66
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:10,679
Shi.

67
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:12,559
Miss Qin,

68
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,638
we're sorry you had
to go through this.

69
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:16,919
No need to be so polite.

70
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,558
This is my job.

71
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:20,079
Mr. Jin and Madam Tang

72
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,079
have told me to be

73
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,118
cooperative and complete the report.

74
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:25,359
I understand what your boss meant.

75
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,398
I'll go talk to him tomorrow.

76
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,319
Thank you.

77
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,118
See you.

78
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,718
Goodbye, Mr. Hu.

79
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:40,958
Shi,

80
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,118
what's going on?

81
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:45,799
I'm hungry.

82
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,678
I'd like to eat while talking about it.

83
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:48,958
I'll go get the car.

84
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,519
Why are you here?

85
00:04:55,558 --> 00:04:56,158
I've got too much free time.

86
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:58,199
Did you think before you act?

87
00:04:59,199 --> 00:04:59,599
Do you know

88
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,558
how dangerous it is to do this?

89
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,718
You must've been jealous
of me experiencing

90
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:04,479
this kind of adventure.

91
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,519
That's why you said this.

92
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,599
I fear nothing as I'm ignorant.

93
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:11,438
From now on, think before you act.

94
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,340
(Yang Hua 6 missed calls)

95
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,020
(Tang Yihui)

96
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,039
(Come to my office now.)

97
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,079
Sure.

98
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,438
This mansion is one of those properties

99
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,398
in Hangzhou that He Dongna bought

100
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:34,678
without telling Mr. Hu.

101
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,438
The house is registered

102
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,958
in He Dongna's mother's name.

103
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,558
They're usually very careful and cautious.

104
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:43,799
We've only got the information recently.

105
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,519
You're saying

106
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,118
that He Dongna and Wang Jiesen...

107
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,479
Miss Qin,

108
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,998
you used to litigate divorce cases.

109
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,479
I suppose you've dealt
with this kind of cases.

110
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:57,718
Wang Jiesen is really shameless.

111
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:58,718
He's a scumbag.

112
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:03,519
Now, Mr. Hu wants to divorce He Dongna.

113
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,678
But about the division of assets,

114
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:06,838
they just can't reach an agreement.

115
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,479
He Dongna knows

116
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,438
everything about Mr. Hu's company.

117
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,479
That's why Mr. Hu always suspects

118
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:15,079
that someone has betrayed him.

119
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,438
But the truth is more awful.

120
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,039
They've got a kid.

121
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,678
Mr. Hu wants the custody of the kid.

122
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:26,799
But He Dongna refuses to let go

123
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:28,039
and always makes things
difficult for Mr. Hu.

124
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,799
Has she fulfilled the raising obligation of the kid?

125
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:34,438
It's always been

126
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:36,319
Mr. Hu's parents
who take care of the kid.

127
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:39,718
These are

128
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:44,239
the records of the kid's daily life.

129
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,359
It's recorded

130
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:47,319
by the caretakers

131
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,759
and doctors Mr. Hu hires.

132
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,958
They can testify for Mr. Hu.

133
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,558
This kid has autism.

134
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:01,118
Yes.

135
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,118
Since He Dongna knew about this,

136
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:05,239
she has never talked

137
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,958
about her kid in public again.

138
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,599
In fact, she's been

139
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:10,359
taking anti-depressants

140
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,199
for a long time.

141
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,759
So about what happened

142
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,718
in Tianhang Hotel,

143
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,079
to the outsiders,

144
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,838
they thought Tianhang Hotel

145
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,039
was deeply problematic.

146
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:19,958
But we all knew

147
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,678
it was because of He Dongna's condition.

148
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,278
She can't take care of the kid.

149
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,838
Have you ever thought of settling it

150
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:31,278
through litigation?

151
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,359
My client said

152
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:36,079
once we take legal action,

153
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,519
those who are ill-intentioned

154
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,118
will pull on it.

155
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:40,718
By then,

156
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,398
the kid's condition will be exposed.

157
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:44,558
So Mr. Hu doesn't want to make

158
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:45,678
a big deal out of it.

159
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,519
Let's solve it at minimal risk.

160
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:56,319
Which means this is Mr. Hu's plan.

161
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:57,278
He Dongna thought

162
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,718
there was on loose ends in her affair

163
00:07:58,718 --> 00:07:59,678
with Wang Jiesen.

164
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:01,079
She didn't expect to be caught

165
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,799
red-handed by Mr. Hu.

166
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:04,079
Mr. Hu is impressive, what a great show.

167
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,759
That's why one mustn't do bad deed.

168
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,438
Or else they'll be punished by heaven.

169
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,438
Shi, what happened then?

170
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:12,678
I can't tell you about it.

171
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,519
I'll be sued.

172
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,479
You'll see it in the papers.

173
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,199
Are you done eating?

174
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,678
I've paid the bill, let's go.

175
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:23,278
I'm feeling better.

176
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:27,438
Gang,

177
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,039
take the luggage out for me.

178
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,919
You send Qin Shi home.

179
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:31,158
I won't see you off.

180
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:32,799
Thanks for today.

181
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,239
Don't mention it.

182
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,039
I didn't do anything.

183
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:37,999
Gang already told me

184
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:40,359
that you were busy
looking for me this afternoon.

185
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,078
Did you really think

186
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:45,158
that I'll give myself away for a job?

187
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,239
You should think before you act.

188
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,919
Don't do all sorts of things.

189
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,158
Let's go.

190
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,078
Hello.

191
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:44,439
Have you arrived in Shaoxing?

192
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,518
Just arrived.

193
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,359
I asked you to call me
when you arrived

194
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:52,559
but you didn't.

195
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:54,919
I forgot about it as I was busy.

196
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,359
Sorry.

197
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:58,838
How was it?

198
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:00,518
Did it go well?

199
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,078
Everything went smoothly.

200
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,718
(Don't worry.)

201
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:06,599
(Get some rest.)

202
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:10,718
I miss you.

203
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:14,479
I miss you too.

204
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,679
Stay safe.

205
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:23,679
Bye bye.

206
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,439
Tao Junhui.

207
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:33,919
Here, Shi.

208
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:36,479
Well,

209
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,718
you said Tao Junhui gave Yang Hua a call.

210
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:41,479
You have no idea

211
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,638
how anxious he was that time.

212
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:44,318
He was like

213
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,239
a cat on a hot tin roof.

214
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,999
He was really worried about you.

215
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:48,158
He was afraid
that you'd be in danger.

216
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:50,158
So he called your husband right away.

217
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:51,479
And asked him to come over

218
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,718
or to contact you immediately.

219
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:55,479
Yang Hua came too?

220
00:11:58,758 --> 00:11:59,359
Shi,

221
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:03,439
I tell you what.

222
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,078
I've never seen someone

223
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:08,439
so dull, timid and fearful

224
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:09,439
like your husband.

225
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,239
Well,

226
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:11,758
we told him

227
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,119
that you went to serve the client.

228
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,479
He wasn't worried.

229
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,518
Instead, he asked us

230
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:16,479
what we wanted him to do.

231
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,439
Well, he was acting

232
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,239
like you weren't his wife but my husband.

233
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:20,958
No, no.

234
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,278
I mean Junhui's wife.

235
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:23,758
I think this kind of man

236
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,679
doesn't deserve to have a wife.

237
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:33,718
Shi,

238
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:36,799
I don't know

239
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:37,838
what has happened

240
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,278
between you and Junhui.

241
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:40,879
But

242
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,919
I think if this goes on,

243
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,479
Junhui is most likely to suffer.

244
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:47,879
Both of you are smart people.

245
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,119
You're smarter than me.

246
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:50,398
So I'm sure you

247
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,638
can think of a better solution.

248
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,718
How did you bump your head?

249
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:03,398
It was an accident.

250
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,158
It's no big deal.

251
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,559
Does it hurt? Let me see.

252
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,119
I'm fine. Have you eaten?

253
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,119
I do.

254
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,679
I'll go get you some fruits.

255
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,838
Don't you have anything to ask me?

256
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,278
Ask you what?

257
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:25,999
I ran into Tao Junhui.

258
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,359
He told me everything.

259
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:28,638
He said you weren't

260
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:29,879
worried about me at all.

261
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:31,359
You weren't concerned about me.

262
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:34,278
What's there to be concerned about?

263
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,638
You won't give yourself away

264
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:36,718
for this trivial matter.

265
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,039
You have your principles.

266
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,879
How did you know that?

267
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,679
I care about nothing but money.

268
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,439
You never know.

269
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,439
Do you know what

270
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,919
Wang Jiesen has offered me?

271
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,599
It's none other than taking you
around the world

272
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:50,718
and buying stuff for you.

273
00:13:52,158 --> 00:13:54,679
He said he'll teach me how to invest

274
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,239
and lead me into the financial circle.

275
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,838
As long as I say yes,

276
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,439
I'll get an investment contract right away.

277
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,078
What a huge temptation.

278
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:03,999
You won't say yes.

279
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,439
Why?

280
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,679
Because you're a good lawyer.

281
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:15,838
Did you not worry
about me at all?

282
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,958
That you weren't nervous at all?

283
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,638
Or did you dare not come
and stop me?

284
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,119
This field is no cleaner than the others.

285
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:23,919
And it's no more complicated

286
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,799
than the other fields.

287
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,679
If you were an investor,

288
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,838
would you give up on a valuable

289
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,439
investment project for a woman?

290
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,398
Or let's put it this way.

291
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,958
Would you invest a worthless

292
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:33,999
project for a woman?

293
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,559
Wang Jiesen's purpose

294
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:37,398
is in fact to attack me.

295
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,879
I'm sure you can understand it.

296
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,799
What if I was blinded

297
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,119
by the benefits?

298
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,718
You're a warrior.

299
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:56,758
If you obtained everything

300
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,039
with the help of a man,

301
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:00,318
that would be violating your principle, right?

302
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,198
If you were a person like this,

303
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,398
why would you be with me?

304
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,239
I'm not a warrior.

305
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:09,879
I'm not happy.

306
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,479
You didn't worry about me.

307
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:12,599
You weren't worried at all.

308
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,439
Were you worried about me,

309
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,999
even just a little bit?

310
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,039
You must've been worried, right?

311
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:21,559
I was freaked out.

312
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,158
Actually, I was worried sick.

313
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:30,599
I was nervous too.

314
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,679
But I can only choose to believe you.

315
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,039
I'm sure you'll find the solution.

316
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:39,479
And I'm sure you'll be fine.

317
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:49,398
That's right.

318
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:49,999
I'm a strong

319
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,879
and independent woman

320
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:51,758
who's never failed.

321
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:52,799
Good night.

322
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,758
Infallible?

323
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,039
How could you call

324
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:11,879
your wife that?

325
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:13,679
Were you praising her?

326
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:14,718
Of course.

327
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:16,599
This is the highest honor.

328
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:21,838
Why would I have

329
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:23,359
a silly son like you?

330
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,838
None of the girls would like to hear

331
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,039
this sort of praise from others.

332
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,958
It sounds like she's a bodyguard.

333
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,278
Did I say it wrong?

334
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,318
Of course you did.

335
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,198
Speaking of praising a woman,

336
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:42,039
you can say she's

337
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:44,958
as beautiful as flowers,

338
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:47,999
as cute as a lark,

339
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:50,278
as tame as a kitty.

340
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:51,198
Right?

341
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,078
Even though she's

342
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:55,278
as tough as

343
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:56,638
an Amazon Warrior.

344
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,398
As long as she's a woman,

345
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:00,799
her soul is

346
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,479
as fragrant and delicate
as the rose.

347
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:08,038
Look.

348
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:11,599
Before getting married,

349
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,718
your mum was the eldest child
in the family.

350
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,838
She got four siblings.

351
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:17,759
Since she was 12,

352
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,519
she helped your grandparents

353
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,558
to take care of her siblings.

354
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:24,759
Your uncle was raised by her.

355
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:25,958
You thought she knew nothing.

356
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,599
Instead, she knew everything.

357
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:29,318
But now,

358
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:32,239
she leads a pampered life.

359
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,318
She's afraid of rats and cockroaches.

360
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,359
What do you think the reason is?

361
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:37,438
You spoiled her.

362
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:38,759
Bingo.

363
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,879
Those fierce animals like tigers

364
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:43,639
and lions

365
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,479
are reluctant to show

366
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,519
their tummies.

367
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:48,159
Because that's

368
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,958
their most tender spot.

369
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:52,678
Human are like animals.

370
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,359
No matter how tough she is,

371
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:59,678
she's got the tender spot as well.

372
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:01,599
Which is her heart.

373
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,798
When a strong

374
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,918
and resolute woman

375
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,038
is being unreasonable

376
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,639
before you and starts

377
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,599
to lose temper with you
and acts like a kid,

378
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:13,999
why is that?

379
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,759
It proves that I'm the person
she trusts most.

380
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,078
She not only trusts you,

381
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:23,678
she even relies on you.

382
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,078
And what you have to do is

383
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,639
not telling her how great she is.

384
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,519
All you have to do is

385
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,879
asking her to be herself

386
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,718
in front you.

387
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,759
Dad, you're amazing.

388
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:53,678
(A gift is a must to coax your wife.)

389
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,159
(While buying a gift,)

390
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,519
(you can't worry about the price.)

391
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,159
(More action is needed
if you can't express yourself.)

392
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,958
(You must be generous.)

393
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:02,678
(I've got some money.)

394
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:04,279
(I'll be your sponsor.)

395
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:05,279
This way.

396
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:09,838
Hello, Sir.

397
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:11,958
This is one of the new models in our store.

398
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:12,759
It's sold very well.

399
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,318
Is it for your girlfriend?

400
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:15,759
It's for my wife.

401
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,239
I see, it's suitable as well.

402
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:18,479
She can carry it when she's at work

403
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:19,318
or out for fun.

404
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,359
It's highly cost-effective.

405
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:21,838
How much is it?

406
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:22,838
RMB 29,800.

407
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:26,438
It's just a bag, that's expensive.

408
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,399
I'll take that.

409
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,558
Mr. Tao, Mr. Tao.

410
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:43,759
I was looking for you.

411
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:44,838
There'll be a meeting

412
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:45,999
at Mr. Jin's office in five minutes.

413
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:46,999
What is it about?

414
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:48,918
Didn't you watch the news?

415
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:49,879
What news?

416
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:51,599
There might be a great change

417
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,759
in He Dongna's case.

418
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,639
Miss Yao did a major deed yesterday.

419
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:57,678
What major deed?

420
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:00,318
I'll let the superiors tell you
themselves.

421
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:02,119
Alright, I'll be right there.

422
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:07,479
Yao Yao, you're here.

423
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,519
Come on, quick.

424
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,279
What do you need to see me about?

425
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:12,759
Sit down and talk.

426
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:19,999
How do you feel?

427
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:21,198
What did the doctor say?

428
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:23,359
I'm fine. It's just a flesh wound.

429
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:25,119
Gosh, good to hear that.

430
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:26,558
I was worried sick

431
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,198
when I knew you were injured.

432
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:30,718
No hurry in returning to work these days.

433
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:32,078
You can take a few days off.

434
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,759
I won't cut your salary

435
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:36,479
and allowances.

436
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:38,798
Last night,

437
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,359
the head office held a meeting.

438
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:42,838
We found that you've done great

439
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:43,918
in handling this case.

440
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:46,119
And it has defended

441
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:47,798
the public image of our company.

442
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,119
So the headquarter decided

443
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:50,879
to reward you

444
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:52,958
with RMB 100,000.

445
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,918
But someone pressed charges

446
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,239
against the company because of me.

447
00:20:56,678 --> 00:20:57,958
And I've embarrassed

448
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,119
the company in the court.

449
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,918
I don't think it's appropriate

450
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,399
to reward me at a time like this.

451
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,599
You don't have

452
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:04,999
to worry about the lawsuit.

453
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,279
Think about it.

454
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,438
You've worked at the hotel
for a so long.

455
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:10,038
The company has faith

456
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,399
in your way of doing things.

457
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,838
We're in service industry

458
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:16,519
but we can't let the others

459
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,159
turn things upside down, can we?

460
00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:19,958
Rest assured.

461
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,279
The company will strive to protect you.

462
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:23,359
By the way,

463
00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:25,558
I've found the video you mentioned

464
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,599
last time.

465
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:28,198
What video?

466
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:29,718
The vehicle camera footage

467
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:30,999
of the night when you took

468
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,999
He Dongna to the hospital.

469
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,198
If they don't drop the charges,

470
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,918
we'll publicize this evidence.

471
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,599
Everyone will know

472
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:41,879
who's telling the truth by then.

473
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,838
It's really shameful.

474
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:44,678
That's right.

475
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:46,838
This woman is shameless.

476
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:48,438
I want all those responsible

477
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,279
to make public apologies.

478
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:50,198
Of course.

479
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:52,678
A while ago, they spread the rumour

480
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,198
to the media.

481
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:56,918
This has caused bad influence

482
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:58,718
to our company and you.

483
00:21:59,159 --> 00:21:59,879
They should apologise.

484
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:00,599
Mr. Yin,

485
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:04,519
what I mean is you should apologise.

486
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:05,519
Me?

487
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,359
You abused your authority

488
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,198
to force the employees

489
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,438
to make false testimony in the court,

490
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:10,359
hide the evidence, distort facts.

491
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:11,718
You even colluded with the plaintiff,

492
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,399
causing damage
to the company's reputation.

493
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,639
What you did is more shameful.

494
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:16,198
Yao Yao,

495
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,718
you're talking irresponsibly!

496
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:18,838
Don't... Don't think

497
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:19,838
that you're great

498
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:20,838
because of what you've done.

499
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:22,119
That you can make
groundless accusations.

500
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,479
I'll take responsible for what I said.

501
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:25,038
I dare you to take responsible
for what you did.

502
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,159
That's more.

503
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,438
You allowed the VIP customers

504
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,639
to sexually harass the servant

505
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,239
and surpressed the staff
who made complaints.

506
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:31,558
You should make
a public apology for that too.

507
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:32,159
You...

508
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,639
You're out of line.

509
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:37,999
(Resignation Letter)
This is my resignation letter.

510
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:38,220
(Resignation Letter)

511
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,438
Before I receive your public apology,

512
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,038
I won't accept any reward

513
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:43,119
from the company.

514
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,100
(Resignation Letter)

515
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:57,359
This is...

516
00:22:58,078 --> 00:22:58,639
A gift.

517
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:04,318
Well,

518
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:05,798
the lady boss asked me to choose this

519
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,479
for you this morning.

520
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:08,798
You know what, Miss Qin?

521
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:09,798
Only the partners have

522
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:10,759
this kind of benefit.

523
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:15,479
This is for me?

524
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:16,639
Yes, it is.

525
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:18,678
The car is parked at our underground garage.

526
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,119
And this.

527
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:24,038
What is this?

528
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:25,718
This is a token of appreciation

529
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:26,838
from Madam Tang and Mr. Jin.

530
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,279
There are RMB 100,000 in it.

531
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:33,838
No, I can't take it.

532
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:34,438
Wait, wait.

533
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:36,687
What's going on here?

534
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:38,006
I won't take it
if you don't make it clear.

535
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:38,447
Here.

536
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:39,006
No, no.

537
00:23:39,727 --> 00:23:41,607
Miss Qin, you deserve this.

538
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,087
This is a little compensation for you

539
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:43,807
and your husband

540
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:45,526
from Madam Tang.

541
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:48,967
My husband?

542
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:52,406
Is the car yours?

543
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:53,366
It's my car.

544
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:54,927
But... but I didn't drive it.

545
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:57,166
It's your car.

546
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:58,807
But you didn't drive it.

547
00:23:58,967 --> 00:23:59,567
Ah...

548
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:00,886
This... this guy...

549
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:01,847
(Yang Hua)
He drove it.

550
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:02,727
Where's the driver?

551
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:03,967
Driver?

552
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:06,047
He... He's got something urgent.

553
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:07,166
He's left his identity card.

554
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:09,406
You got nine penalty points on your license.

555
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:10,766
If you're not the driver,

556
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:12,047
go get the driver over now.

557
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:13,246
Otherwise,

558
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:14,486
this driving license will be suspended.

559
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:15,486
Sus... Suspended?

560
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:17,766
Contact him now.

561
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:19,207
Will do.

562
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:21,727
I even wanted to kill him.

563
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:23,727
But I can't reach him.

564
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:28,166
Shouldn't you go to hospital first?

565
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,807
Do you know where Qin Shi is?

566
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:33,886
I don't care what method you use.

567
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:34,967
Get her back right now.

568
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:36,567
No matter what Wang Jiesen writes

569
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:37,567
on the evaluation report,

570
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:38,687
it won't be adopted.

571
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:40,607
How do you...

572
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:43,087
Why are you so certain of it?

573
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:45,807
Qiu Jianxiang's daughter gave this to me.

574
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:48,886
The evidences and documents
about Wang Jiesen gaining benefits

575
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:50,567
through Yongli 21

576
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:51,967
by rat trading four years ago,

577
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,687
including the entire progress

578
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:55,006
of Wang Jiesen threatening

579
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,766
Qiu Jianxiang to purchase Haibo Biology.

580
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,366
All of these will be handed to Hu Ping tomorrow.

581
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,327
Since you got this information,

582
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:07,886
why didn't you hand it to the police?

583
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:09,166
I'm not interested in

584
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:10,486
whether this guys succeeds or fails.

585
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:12,886
As Qin Shi is involved in it,

586
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:14,486
I didn't get to do it.

587
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:16,406
Get her back now.

588
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,246
If anything happens to Qin Shi,

589
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:20,967
I'll try everything I could

590
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:21,967
to drag you down with us.

591
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:22,807
You have my word.

592
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:24,486
You threaten us?

593
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,366
Listen, he's threatening us.

594
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:27,727
He's threatening

595
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:28,727
the best lawyers in Pujiang.

596
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:29,927
Is he out of his mind?

597
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:31,607
I tell you what.

598
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:33,406
We won't be threatened by you.

599
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:34,567
That's enough.

600
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:35,486
Stop making fun of him.

601
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:36,727
Look at him.

602
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,286
Don't worry, Yang Hua.

603
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,207
Qin Shi is safe now.

604
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:41,406
Let me take you to the hospital.

605
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:42,807
I'll explain to you on the way.

606
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:43,327
Okay?

607
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:51,047
He's a perfect match for Qin Shi.

608
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:54,286
They made a fuss

609
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,687
because of each other.

610
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:00,406
Miss Qin,

611
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:02,807
is there anything you want to say?

612
00:26:03,286 --> 00:26:04,486
Just say it.

613
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,607
I hope Wang Jiesen could

614
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:12,207
disappear forever
from the financial circle.

615
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:13,166
Why is that?

616
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:16,406
Do you have a beef with Wang Jiesen?

617
00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:19,807
There's a huge feud between me and him.

618
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:22,286
Okay.

619
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:24,006
With the information

620
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:25,246
I have now,

621
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:27,207
I can tell you

622
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:28,847
that Wang Jiesen

623
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:31,366
can never engage

624
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:32,886
in any work related

625
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:34,207
to financial business.

626
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:39,207
Why are you following me?

627
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:39,927
Why are you following me?

628
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:42,327
It's lunch break, where are you going?

629
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:42,967
Lunch break?

630
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:43,886
Where am I going?

631
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,006
I'm heading to the traffic unit.

632
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:46,286
My car and license

633
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:47,366
have been held back.

634
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,567
I take time out of my busy schedule

635
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:52,166
to handle a traffic accident
that is not related to me.

636
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:53,727
It was a special case last time.

637
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:54,687
Let's eat first, okay?

638
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:55,327
I'll go with you after that.

639
00:26:55,486 --> 00:26:56,406
I don't want to eat.

640
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:58,006
Let me tell you this.

641
00:26:58,207 --> 00:26:58,886
From today onwards,

642
00:26:59,087 --> 00:26:59,687
you don't know me.

643
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:00,406
I don't know you.

644
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:01,246
Let's cut ties.

645
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:02,087
Everything is over.

646
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:03,486
By the way,

647
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,366
I spent RMB 20,000 on repairing the car.

648
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:09,286
How am I supposed to explain it
to my wife?

649
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:09,927
Tell me.

650
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:10,766
Don't worry.

651
00:27:11,126 --> 00:27:12,766
I'll pay you back the repair fees.

652
00:27:13,286 --> 00:27:13,687
Really?

653
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:25,286
The password of the bank card is 666666.

654
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:27,006
The money in it is all yours.

655
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:27,807
I'll pay for your car.

656
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:28,727
I'll compensate all the loss.

657
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:30,047
Are you for real?

658
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:32,447
Look how generous and straightforward

659
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,207
Miss Qin is.

660
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:33,807
Look at you.

661
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:37,406
I'll check on the car.

662
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:42,246
Why didn't you tell me

663
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:43,366
you went to Hangzhou?

664
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:44,766
Why didn't you tell me

665
00:27:44,927 --> 00:27:45,567
that you got into an accident?

666
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,607
And why didn't you tell me

667
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:48,847
you went to Madam Tang

668
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:49,486
and Mr. Jin?

669
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:52,166
Isn't that what I should do?

670
00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:00,180
♪Go away with me tonight♪

671
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,140
♪The moon and the stars shut their eyes♪

672
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,660
♪Go away with you tonight♪

673
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,460
♪A love in morandi colors♪

674
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:24,447
I'm sorry that I couldn't do more for you.

675
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:27,406
It's alright, you're right.

676
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:28,207
I'm a woman

677
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,687
who's never failed.

678
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:31,646
Do you know

679
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:33,927
why I've never failed?

680
00:28:35,286 --> 00:28:35,847
Why?

681
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:39,166
Because I have you.

682
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:43,166
With you,

683
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,207
I can succeed in everything.

684
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,260
♪Even though it can be painful♪

685
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,500
♪It's still worthy to go for it♪

686
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:53,967
Does your company

687
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:54,687
give you this car?

688
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:55,526
Yes.

689
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:57,327
They should.

690
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:58,766
As you've done a great job.

691
00:28:59,366 --> 00:28:59,886
I suppose they'll give you

692
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:00,967
anything you want.

693
00:29:05,486 --> 00:29:06,646
So, Miss Qin,

694
00:29:07,486 --> 00:29:09,207
how much is there in this card?

695
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:10,646
RMB 100, 000.

696
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:12,447
Yang,

697
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:14,207
I'll treat you to Japanese food tonight.

698
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:15,246
Have a nice chat.

699
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:23,220
♪Go away with you tonight♪

700
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,940
♪A love in morandi colors♪

701
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:30,406
This is...

702
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:31,447
A gift for you.

703
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:34,847
I know I should buy you a bag.

704
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:37,286
But I think this is more usable.

705
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:38,766
I hope you could sign more contracts

706
00:29:39,047 --> 00:29:41,366
with this pen and make more money in future.

707
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,567
I like everything you give me.

708
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:48,766
Especially what you said just now.

709
00:29:49,766 --> 00:29:50,246
Thank you.

710
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:51,006
You're welcome.

711
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:54,526
It's time to feed you.

712
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:57,246
Eat more.

713
00:30:02,486 --> 00:30:03,687
It's time to feed you as well.

714
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:05,927
Here.

715
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,327
It's also time for me to feed myself.

716
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:14,126
By the way, your law firm has

717
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:15,366
given you so many stuff.

718
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:16,366
It's not only because

719
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:17,486
of He Dongna's case, is it?

720
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:21,246
You know what?

721
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:23,687
The corporate culture of Cheng & Hui is

722
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:26,087
to take action with clear target.

723
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:28,807
As they could spend RMB 100,000 on you,

724
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:30,327
it means that you're worth

725
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:32,886
at least a million yuan to them.

726
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:35,126
Mr. Hu has reached

727
00:30:35,246 --> 00:30:36,447
the first financing agreement

728
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:38,087
with Madam Tang and Mr. Jin.

729
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:40,607
Wang Jiesen is shameless

730
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:42,927
but he does do good
in writing the evaluation report.

731
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:45,207
So I can do whatever I want

732
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:47,207
in Cheng & Hui now.

733
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:49,886
I guess I can use

734
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:51,526
this gift very soon.

735
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:52,727
Thank you.

736
00:30:53,087 --> 00:30:53,847
You're welcome.

737
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:57,927
Let's eat.

738
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,140
(Entrustment Agreement)

739
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:04,327
Tianhang mergers and acquisitions?

740
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:06,886
The M&A attorney of Tianhang is

741
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:07,486
not competent.

742
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:09,166
Mr. Yin from their company is

743
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:11,366
close to Ms. Liang.

744
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,486
So Ms. Liang recommends us to him.

745
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:15,486
I'll be in charge of this case?

746
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:16,967
It's dominated by you.

747
00:31:17,246 --> 00:31:18,526
You'll get to choose your own team.

748
00:31:18,607 --> 00:31:21,047
By then, Jin and Chen will assist you.

749
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:22,687
Our law firm will be paid

750
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:24,766
at fixed rate in this merger.

751
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,406
But Tianhang has agreed that

752
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:28,687
if we could enable the collaboration

753
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,607
between them and their favourite
strategic partner,

754
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:31,847
we'll be able to get extra

755
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,447
one percent of the price
in the M&A contract

756
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:34,327
as a reward.

757
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,087
How is it, Miss Qin?

758
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:39,166
Are you sure you can handle
this case well?

759
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:42,047
This is unquestionable.

760
00:31:42,246 --> 00:31:43,927
I must handle it well.

761
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:46,366
But, Mr. Jin,

762
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:50,126
I've got a small request.

763
00:31:50,927 --> 00:31:51,687
What is it?

764
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,126
So they agree?

765
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:02,006
As long as I handle this case well,

766
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:03,847
the position of partner is within
my grasp.

767
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:04,886
By then, the plan I've prepared

768
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,246
for two years can finally be
implemented.

769
00:32:07,047 --> 00:32:07,727
Congratulations.

770
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:09,246
Thank you, see you at home tonight.

771
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:10,447
I'm leaving, bye bye.

772
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:11,447
Goodbye, Miss Qin.

773
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,486
I can't believe there'd be such a coincidence.

774
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:27,766
And, about Yao Yao,

775
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:28,967
you didn't tell Miss Qin, did you?

776
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:32,286
I want to ask you a question.

777
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:34,126
If Miss Qin fights Yao Yao

778
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:35,246
one-on-one, who will you help?

779
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:40,166
Tell me, I won't tell her.

780
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:48,006
Let's go eat together.

781
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:52,766
Forget it.

782
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:54,967
I'd like to be alone.

783
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:55,967
Are you not feeling well?

784
00:32:57,847 --> 00:32:58,847
I'm fine.

785
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:03,047
Just go and eat.

786
00:33:05,286 --> 00:33:06,486
If you're not feeling well,

787
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:07,567
I'll take you home first.

788
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:09,526
I'll help you

789
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:11,006
with the work.

790
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,140
(Qin Shi)

791
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,060
(Qin Shi)

792
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:36,366
Hello.

793
00:33:37,126 --> 00:33:39,087
Meet me in my office in half an hour.

794
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:40,366
What is it about?

795
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,607
It's about Tianhang Hotel merger.

796
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:44,567
I want you to be my co-counsel.

797
00:33:46,406 --> 00:33:48,006
Okay, I got it.

798
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:49,327
See you later.

799
00:33:55,006 --> 00:33:55,646
Who was it?

800
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:58,687
She called me for a meeting.

801
00:33:59,126 --> 00:33:59,847
Our law firm is

802
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:00,927
handling Tianhang merger.

803
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:07,366
Did I ask you what it was about?

804
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:11,766
I asked who you were talking to
on the phone?

805
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:18,647
It was Qin Shi, wasn't it?

806
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,407
Both of you help

807
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:22,567
and promote each other.

808
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:24,286
What a team.

809
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:28,446
Feifei,

810
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,446
I'll take you home first.

811
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,047
You went to Hangzhou yesterday,
didn't you?

812
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:35,847
You went to play hero, right?

813
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:44,127
Why are you so quiet?

814
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:45,686
Why did you lie to me?

815
00:34:45,847 --> 00:34:47,407
Why would you lie to me?

816
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:52,567
Tao Junhui.

817
00:34:54,446 --> 00:34:55,167
You don't even care

818
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:56,887
to explain it now, do you?

819
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,286
Let's go home and talk.

820
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,167
I don't want to work
for Cheng & Hui anymore.

821
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:10,887
I'm giving you a chance now.

822
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:12,047
Leave with me.

823
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:13,966
Resign now.

824
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:15,327
Whether to start your own business

825
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:16,726
or to work in my dad's company,

826
00:35:16,887 --> 00:35:18,407
I promise it'll be better
than working here.

827
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:30,966
Tao Junhui,

828
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:34,647
this is your last chance.

829
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:37,486
Are you leaving with me?

830
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:58,167
You don't want to participate
in this case?

831
00:35:58,607 --> 00:35:59,327
Are you sure?

832
00:35:59,647 --> 00:36:00,246
I'm sure.

833
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:03,367
Are you insane?

834
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:13,807
I tell you what.

835
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:15,726
The little girlfriend of yours

836
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,647
is getting personal.

837
00:36:17,966 --> 00:36:18,446
You're going to do this

838
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:19,367
with her, aren't you?

839
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,286
After this financing,

840
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:23,367
there are many lawyers applying
for jobs in our law firm.

841
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:24,686
You know that?

842
00:36:25,127 --> 00:36:26,526
There are many people envious

843
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,526
of my success in getting
this case, you know?

844
00:36:29,206 --> 00:36:30,726
You can't afford to be picky

845
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:32,766
in a fierce competition like this.

846
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,647
Why did you ask for my help?

847
00:36:36,926 --> 00:36:38,167
You've participated in M&A cases.

848
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:39,327
I need your experience.

849
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:41,607
To be honest with you,

850
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:43,286
in the case of Hu Ping and He Dongna,

851
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,206
Madam Tang is

852
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:46,486
very unsatisfied
with Wu Fei's performance.

853
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:48,006
It might implicate you as well.

854
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:49,807
Unless you no longer want

855
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:51,327
to work at this law firm.

856
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:52,286
Otherwise, I suggest you

857
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:54,006
to think clearly.

858
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:55,567
This is Cheng & Hui.

859
00:36:56,206 --> 00:36:57,847
The power group
and those who have backgrounds

860
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,567
have different ways of survival.

861
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:00,887
But no matter which gang you're in,

862
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:02,966
you'll have to bear the consequences

863
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:03,847
of the mistakes you made.

864
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,327
You've saved me before.

865
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:07,567
So this time,

866
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:09,446
let's consider it
as a mutual assistance.

867
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:13,486
I know.

868
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:18,006
I'm not yet considered as

869
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:19,167
a great lawyer now.

870
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:21,286
And I don't have
solid foundation as well.

871
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:22,726
But I'm the only female lawyer

872
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:24,006
at the eleventh floor.

873
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:25,246
I want to make

874
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:26,847
this case my masterpiece.

875
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:29,047
Only then, I can publish

876
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:30,367
all the truth openly.

877
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:31,807
What truth?

878
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:33,167
Is it about your marriage?

879
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:35,966
I didn't mean to create this lie.

880
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:38,047
After all, it's been so long.

881
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:40,607
I don't wish to achieve

882
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,246
my ultimate goal through a lie.

883
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:47,286
What's your ultimate goal?

884
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:48,847
To be a partner.

885
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,087
In Cheng & Hui,

886
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,486
there are many unreasonable rules.

887
00:37:54,966 --> 00:37:56,446
The most unreasonable one is
the regulation

888
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,766
of job advancement
for female lawyers.

889
00:37:58,127 --> 00:38:00,167
So I want to be a partner

890
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:02,006
and radically change

891
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:02,847
this kind of situation.

892
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:04,807
Will you help me?

893
00:38:24,966 --> 00:38:25,647
Feifei.

894
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:28,766
Why are you back

895
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,407
so early today?

896
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:33,006
What's wrong, Feifei?

897
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:37,887
Feifei.

898
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:41,966
Why do you go straight to bed
as soon as you're back?

899
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:43,526
What's wrong?

900
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:46,966
Feifei.

901
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:48,567
I received a call today.

902
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:50,327
They said the renovation is almost done.

903
00:38:50,766 --> 00:38:51,567
When are you and Junhui

904
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:52,607
going to check it out?

905
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,407
What's wrong? Are you not well?

906
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:01,367
Mom, I'm very tired.

907
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:03,367
Can you please leave me alone?

908
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:04,486
I'd like to get some sleep.

909
00:39:05,286 --> 00:39:06,127
Okay.

910
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:07,407
Get some sleep, baby.

911
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:08,686
Call me if you need anything.

912
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:18,686
Miss Qin,

913
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:20,327
give us a brief summary

914
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:21,686
of the condition of this merger.

915
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,167
Due to some well-known reasons,

916
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:26,327
I like to study my clients.

917
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:28,726
So that I can understand their demands.

918
00:39:28,726 --> 00:39:29,847
And there's no exception this time.

919
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:30,607
As everybody knows,

920
00:39:30,607 --> 00:39:32,607
Tianhang Hotel is a private enterprise

921
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:33,926
after being restructured.

922
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:35,526
Since the 2008 Olympics,

923
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:37,206
it has led to the rapid growth
of the domestic hotel industry.

924
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:38,206
In comparison,

925
00:39:38,446 --> 00:39:39,607
Tianhang building is old,

926
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:40,367
its management is underdeveloped.

927
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:42,167
So about a month ago,

928
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:44,446
Tianhang Hotel started
to proactively look

929
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:45,726
for a strategic partner.

930
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:47,246
Hoping to reach a merger agreement.

931
00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:49,526
Mr. Su was interested in Xingji Group.

932
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:51,567
Xingji Group will provide
management system

933
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:52,367
in the aspect

934
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,847
of product design and service.

935
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:56,847
Both of them were satisfied
with each other.

936
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:58,407
They prepared to privately issue
an additional H stock

937
00:39:58,407 --> 00:39:59,567
to reach the merger agreement.

938
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,087
But it was just then

939
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:03,327
that an unexpected opponent
appeared halfway.

940
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,807
(Tian Ansheng's Profile)
Mr. Tian from Anlyu.

941
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:09,726
(Tian Ansheng's Profile)
Mr. Tian used to work

942
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:11,006
for Tianhang.

943
00:40:11,526 --> 00:40:13,647
He was under Su Chongfa back then.

944
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,367
But he was squeezed out

945
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:17,246
of the management
as they had disagreements.

946
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:18,446
Then, he came to Anlyu

947
00:40:18,446 --> 00:40:19,327
and was entrusted with important task.

948
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:20,807
So, the reason Tianhang Group

949
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:22,526
lost the case on purpose

950
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:23,966
was not only because

951
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,407
they didn't want to pay Yao Yao
the termination money.

952
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:27,847
Meanwhile,

953
00:40:27,847 --> 00:40:29,407
they wanted to mark down the shares.

954
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,686
Allowing Xingji to buy
the shares at a lower price.

955
00:40:31,686 --> 00:40:32,607
Qin Shi,

956
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:35,647
Yang Hua is good at this.

957
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:37,647
Ask him to be our special consultant.

958
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:40,006
Well,

959
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,766
he bumped his head.

960
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:45,087
He gets dumber because of that.

961
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:45,887
No, it won't do.

962
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:47,167
Even so,

963
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:48,726
he's smarter than me.

964
00:40:49,006 --> 00:40:49,926
Mr. Jin,

965
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:52,127
there's another way.

966
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:53,486
What is it?

967
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:55,286
Whoever started the trouble
should end it.

968
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,567
Yao Yao has assisted the police

969
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:57,766
in capturing the plaintiff.

970
00:40:58,087 --> 00:40:59,647
This happens to be a good chance.

971
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:01,246
We can make use of it.

972
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:22,246
Yao Yao.

973
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:24,407
I know that you've suffered

974
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:26,966
a lot a while ago.

975
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:28,047
Of course.

976
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:29,327
My approach is wrong either.

977
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:30,847
So, today, I'd like

978
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:32,887
to sincerely apologise to you.

979
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:38,206
Miss Yao,

980
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:41,167
Mr. Yin proactively did self-reflection

981
00:41:41,407 --> 00:41:42,766
at the high-level meeting the other day.

982
00:41:43,446 --> 00:41:45,286
He even requested an award for you.

983
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,567
Total price RMB 100,000.

984
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:49,367
There's more.

985
00:41:49,686 --> 00:41:50,926
Mr. Yin also encouraged

986
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:52,926
the housekeeping department

987
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,686
to learn from you.

988
00:41:57,686 --> 00:41:59,087
This is my job.

989
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:00,087
It's not necessary

990
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:01,526
to make a big deal out of it.

991
00:42:02,926 --> 00:42:04,206
Stop being so humble.

992
00:42:04,686 --> 00:42:05,607
The company has decided

993
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:07,087
to relaunch

994
00:42:07,286 --> 00:42:09,246
the butler service as a special service.

995
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,047
You're the leader.

996
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:12,367
You can pick your own team members.

997
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:14,246
And you'll be the trainer.

998
00:42:14,647 --> 00:42:15,446
The group is considering

999
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:17,607
to set foot
in high-end residence management.
