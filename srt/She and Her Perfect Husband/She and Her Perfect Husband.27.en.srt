19
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,011
Excuse me,
please get me two flasks of sake.

20
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:01,091
- One flask.
- One flask.

21
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:05,132
Let's just take one flask.
Nurse your drink.

22
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:09,051
He can't tell story.

23
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:10,292
I should do it.

24
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,411
Back in the day, there were many people

25
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,531
hoping to work under Qiu Jianxiang.

26
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:17,811
Do you know that?

27
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:20,772
It was like the contestants
of audition now.

28
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:23,492
Like the show Produce 101.

29
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:25,051
Is it an exaggeration?

30
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:26,251
It's not.

31
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:28,171
I remember that back then,

32
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:29,531
there were about 20 fund managers

33
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:30,331
working under him.

34
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:32,372
Everyone was the best of the best.

35
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:34,492
But half of the people

36
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:35,691
didn't even get to see his face.

37
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:37,451
Because there were only eight people

38
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:38,531
who got into his core team.

39
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:40,372
Among these eight people,

40
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,292
no more than three persons

41
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:43,772
can be trained by him.

42
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:45,212
Among these three people,

43
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:46,292
the youngest person

44
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,212
who was the least experienced

45
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:49,411
but eventually

46
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:51,492
managed most of the trust accounts

47
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:54,051
was my buddy.

48
00:02:58,652 --> 00:02:59,171
If it wasn't because

49
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:00,732
of the Yongli Number 21 incident
back then,

50
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:01,891
he would've become

51
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:05,171
the king of trust now.

52
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:16,451
Thank you, Junhui.

53
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:20,451
Mrs. Tao,

54
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:22,811
actually, both of our families

55
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,292
should've sat down and
had a meal together.

56
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:27,171
But a while ago,

57
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,891
Feifei's grandfather was in poor health.

58
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:30,852
Then, her grandmother fell sick.

59
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,092
I was really busy that time.

60
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:35,012
I can only get over it
after taking a break for two weeks.

61
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,372
So Mrs. Tao,

62
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:37,811
please don't take that to heart.

63
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:39,411
No, I won't.

64
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:40,292
Well,

65
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,811
you should pay attention
to the elderly's health.

66
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:44,251
How are they doing now?

67
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:45,212
Are they getting better now?

68
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:47,012
They're fine.

69
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:48,932
They were really happy
when they heard Feifei is going

70
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:50,012
to get married.

71
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,251
But you never know

72
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:55,492
what will happen

73
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,811
due to their health condition.

74
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:59,492
So, what I mean is

75
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,251
if there's no problem

76
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:03,012
with the kids' marriage,

77
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,251
I think we should hold it earlier.

78
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:06,852
What do you think, Mrs. Tao?

79
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:09,372
I... I'm fine with it.

80
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:11,292
As long as the kids are happy.

81
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,171
I... I won't have an opinion.

82
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,291
We've been house-hunting lately.

83
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:21,331
We'll buy it soon.

84
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,131
The entire process may take

85
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:24,492
until the end of the year.

86
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,212
Right, Junhui?

87
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:27,611
Hmm.

88
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:40,051
Feifei,

89
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:41,131
look,

90
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:44,331
this is the wedding gift for you from Dad.

91
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,100
(Binjiang Number One)

92
00:04:50,252 --> 00:04:51,731
Dad, you bought a house?

93
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,092
Which layout?

94
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,011
What else could it be?

95
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,972
It must be your favourite one.

96
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,731
Gosh, thanks, Dad.

97
00:04:58,932 --> 00:04:59,851
You're the best.

98
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:03,092
Feifei,

99
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:06,772
quickly sit down.

100
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,492
This kid is going to get married

101
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:11,011
but she acts like a child.

102
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,451
Well, it's different between raising

103
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:15,812
a son and a daughter.

104
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:18,212
We have to raise a daughter
like a princess.

105
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:21,092
She has been spoiled.

106
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:23,291
Let's do it this way, Mrs. Tao.

107
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:26,571
If there's no other problem,

108
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:29,331
let's set the date of their marriage today.

109
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:31,731
If you haven't found a house,

110
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,692
you could use this
as your marital home by then.

111
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:34,692
What do you think?

112
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:35,571
Yes.

113
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:38,492
I... I don't have a problem.

114
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:40,652
I'll let the kids decide it.

115
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:42,652
Well, it's your call.

116
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:50,212
Uncle, Aunt, I'm fine with it.

117
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:51,532
I'll let Feifei decide it.

118
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:54,412
That's great.

119
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,492
Okay, that's the deal.

120
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:57,891
Come on, let's do it together.

121
00:05:58,372 --> 00:05:58,772
Come.

122
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:59,212
Okay.

123
00:05:59,372 --> 00:05:59,772
Come on, Mrs. Tao.

124
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,171
Uncle, I've got to drive.

125
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:02,131
I'll just drink juice.

126
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,011
Drink liquor today,
just get a designated driver.

127
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:06,412
Okay.

128
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,212
Let's listen to Mrs. Tao.

129
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:09,851
Mrs. Tao,

130
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,611
let's meet more often from now on.

131
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:12,772
Wish you a good health.

132
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:22,092
Come, eat up.

133
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,891
You usually don't drink.

134
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,692
Why do you drink so much today?

135
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,492
Don't you think

136
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,212
Mr. Wu is a little strange?

137
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:36,212
He used to take no stance on it

138
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:37,731
when I talked about the purchase

139
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:39,652
of the marital house.

140
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:41,291
But it was interesting today.

141
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:43,092
He gave us a luxury property

142
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:44,412
that is worth over ten millions yuan.

143
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:48,772
Junhui, do you think

144
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:50,051
we still need to buy a house?

145
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,131
Of course we do.

146
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:52,851
Mr. Wu bought

147
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:53,932
that house for his daughter.

148
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:54,932
It wasn't for me.

149
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,131
Besides, it's a marriage

150
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:58,252
between me and Wu Fei.

151
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:00,051
Didn't you always tell me

152
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:02,412
to achieve what is feasible

153
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:03,932
and live within our means?

154
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,291
Junhui, you know what?

155
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:10,011
I'm really happy
that you could think it this way.

156
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,331
I'm proud of you, good job.

157
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:13,171
Take a bite.

158
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:13,812
Don't.

159
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,891
Are you having a fight with Feifei?

160
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:21,252
What do you mean?

161
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:23,131
What makes you think
we're having a fight?

162
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:25,212
From what I know of you,

163
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:28,372
you were faking your smile

164
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:30,131
at the dinner today.

165
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:31,412
It was a forced smile.

166
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:36,171
What has happened?

167
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:40,611
Tell me about it.

168
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:42,932
I'm always on your side.

169
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,532
Well, Wu always told me
to take my time

170
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:50,412
when we talked about the purchase
of the marital house.

171
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:52,131
But I got this feeling today

172
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,731
that he was in a bit of a hurry.

173
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:55,011
He looked guilty.

174
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:56,891
What's going on?

175
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:01,652
I'll tell you.

176
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,451
Prenuptial agreement?

177
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:07,652
Have you signed it?

178
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:08,291
I do.

179
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:10,891
Why didn't you discuss with me?

180
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:12,451
I'm a grown-up, I can make the decision.

181
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:15,731
Then, show me the agreement.

182
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:19,131
I've already signed it,
it's pointless to read it now.

183
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:22,011
Is there a shady condition on it?

184
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:25,131
They're richer than us.

185
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:26,692
We have nothing to lose.

186
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:27,932
So what?

187
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,532
Does it mean they can bully us?

188
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:31,412
Let me tell you this.

189
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,292
If he really bullies you,

190
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:33,131
I'll go settle this with him.

191
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,371
Why are you making a fuss?

192
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:37,891
I'm a lawyer.

193
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:41,131
I've read every clause
of the agreement.

194
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:42,612
I know you're a lawyer.

195
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:44,491
And I'm a reasonable person.

196
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,011
It's alright to sign
a prenuptial agreement.

197
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:50,891
Son, to be honest with you.

198
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:52,451
When it comes to me,

199
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:53,131
well,

200
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:56,371
it makes an unspeakable feel in my heart.

201
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:57,371
I mean it.

202
00:08:57,732 --> 00:08:58,652
I'll tell you the truth.

203
00:08:58,852 --> 00:08:59,451
Well,

204
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:00,972
Wu Fei

205
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:03,292
is indeed better

206
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,891
than Qin Shi in all aspects

207
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:07,052
be it family background or age.

208
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:09,371
Qin family is no match to hers.

209
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:10,571
Don't you think?

210
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:12,691
But I've never wanted you

211
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,571
to degrade yourself

212
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:15,811
and be a social-climbing person.

213
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:17,891
I'm well aware

214
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,331
of how you get this far.

215
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,172
You reach this position step by step.

216
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,412
We're on our own.

217
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:24,052
It relies on our efforts.

218
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:27,011
Son, actually, I want to tell you

219
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:29,251
that it doesn't matter
if you're rich or not.

220
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:30,931
What matters is that you two live

221
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:31,931
a good life together.

222
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:32,732
Do you get it?

223
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,212
I know that you've got my back.

224
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:38,972
Of course.

225
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:41,852
It hurts.

226
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:43,331
You're drunk.

227
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:44,652
You hit me hard.

228
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:45,331
There, there.

229
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:46,131
It really hurts.

230
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:47,612
Geez.

231
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:49,732
You little brat.

232
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:57,451
Drink some water.

233
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,131
Why are you crying?

234
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:02,212
I'm not.

235
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:05,931
Miss Qin.

236
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:08,891
I've never heard Yang

237
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:10,052
talking about this before.

238
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:10,852
He wouldn't tell me

239
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:11,972
when I asked him this.

240
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:13,811
I'm sure of it now.

241
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,931
That Yang has fallen out

242
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:17,131
with Qiu Jianxiang because of

243
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:17,972
Yongli 21 incident.

244
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:19,652
You didn't know

245
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:21,011
how Yang looked like back then.

246
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:22,292
He was stalwart.

247
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,412
As his buddy, I really

248
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:25,772
wanted to burn myself

249
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,092
and light up his world.

250
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:28,532
But I'm not bright enough for him.

251
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:29,571
From now on,

252
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:30,652
you're his light.

253
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:33,652
Please, take care of him.

254
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:35,491
I beg of you.

255
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:38,612
Yang.

256
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:40,412
Come.

257
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,011
Yang, you've got a good wife.

258
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:45,811
I'm leaving.

259
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:46,972
Bye bye.

260
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:49,652
Are you drunk?

261
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:51,331
Hands.

262
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:54,371
Let's go home.

263
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:03,652
I believe you.

264
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:05,931
Believe me about what?

265
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:10,092
I believe that the failure of Yongli 21

266
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:11,052
wasn't because of you.

267
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:13,852
It was years ago.

268
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:15,092
You didn't know me in the past.

269
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:16,292
How did you know it wasn't my fault?

270
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:17,652
Who said I didn't know you?

271
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:19,092
Don't you forget

272
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:19,852
it was you

273
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:20,852
in those days who I fell for.

274
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,131
You're better at figures than me.

275
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:26,972
But I'm a better judge
of characters than you.

276
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:28,212
I trust myself.

277
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:29,811
That's why I believe you.

278
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:33,412
No one is always right.

279
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:35,931
So,

280
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:37,811
it really was your fault?

281
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:40,972
Yongli 21 was the best trust

282
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,691
in Hengli that time.

283
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:44,852
It contributed 17 percent
of the average yield

284
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:46,052
during 20 years of its founding.

285
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:47,292
It was also the proudest creation

286
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:48,412
of Qiu Jianxiang.

287
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:50,412
But two years
before the incident happened,

288
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:53,451
he entrusted me with 21.

289
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,532
And I was the actual operator.

290
00:11:56,852 --> 00:11:58,011
A year after taking over it,

291
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,852
I raised the yield up to 37 percent.

292
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:02,612
I was 22 that time.

293
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:05,371
My commissions alone
costed tens of millions yuan.

294
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,371
But I didn't expect

295
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:09,292
that I would suffer

296
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:11,852
a sudden loss ten months later.

297
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,212
It was a heavy loss.

298
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:20,732
Actually, making mistakes isn't
that scary.

299
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:23,811
It shows

300
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:25,212
that you've fallen short.

301
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:26,811
That there's room for improvement.

302
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,212
Because these mistakes and failures

303
00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:31,532
can bring benefits to you.

304
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,532
What's truly scary is the people,

305
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:35,371
jealousy and greed.

306
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:52,811
Whose baby is this?

307
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:53,852
Are you lost?

308
00:12:57,972 --> 00:12:58,532
Dear,

309
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:00,891
I think we've got a kid.

310
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:07,212

he calls me Dear.)

by many people back then.

322
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:46,772
That I can get whatever I want.

323
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:49,292
Until one day,

324
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:52,772
I realised that
I was a nobody.

325
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:55,331
I was even worse than this dog.

00:14:21,852 --> 00:14:22,491

00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:48,371
(Someone is going to die!)

341
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,092
(Hurry over.)

342
00:14:56,732 --> 00:14:57,852
Calm down, okay?

343
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,412
Calm down, Meimei.

344
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,451
One more step, I'll jump.

345
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:00,972
No, don't.

346
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:01,732
Stay back.

347
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:02,811
Don't make me do this.

348
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:03,652
I'll stay back.

349
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:04,691
Put the knife down first.

350
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:05,691
I'll jump, I'm telling you.

351
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:06,571
I'm not kidding.

352
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:07,691
Come back, will you?

353
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:08,612
Stay back, or I'll jump.

354
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,212
Don't!

355
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:10,772
Don't!

356
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:12,172
Meimei.

357
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,092
What's going on?

358
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:14,251
Quick, Qin Shi.

359
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:15,371
All of you, stay back!

360
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:17,331
One more step, I'll jump.

361
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:18,852
You're going to jump off the building?

362
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:19,691
Let me tell you this.

363
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:20,652
Your house is on a high floor.

364
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:22,451
You'll become a mess if you jump.

365
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:24,732
And the money you spent
on your facial care

366
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:26,092
back then would be wasted.

367
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,011
Just go ahead and jump.

368
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,251
What are you talking about?

369
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,412
Shut up, it's all because of you.

370
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,052
I tell you what. If you jump,

371
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:33,331
this guy will get off easy.

372
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:34,292
He'll continue to have a good time

373
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,371
and go unpunished.

374
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:36,972
You'll lose everything
if you throw yourself off.

375
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:37,891
Why don't you just go ahead
and do it?

376
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:41,412
You've changed, Qin Shi.

377
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,292
You treat me in the same way
as he treats me now.

378
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:45,292
After all, both of you are
brother and sister.

379
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:46,571
Both of you join hands

380
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:48,251
to force me and bully me.

381
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:51,371
Meimei, Meimei.

382
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:52,571
Buzz off!

383
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:58,451
Go away!

384
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:07,412
Have some water.

385
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:08,972
Thank you.

386
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:09,732
You're welcome.

387
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,331
Look, this is what a good man is like.

388
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:18,772
Look at him.

389
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:20,972
I was wondering

390
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:22,292
why he's been very active lately.

391
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:24,412
After everything,
it was because his mom said

392
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:25,371
she'll buy him a sport car

393
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:27,052
as a reward if he has a kid with me.

394
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:28,451
Isn't it scary?

395
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:31,612
In order to get a sport car,

396
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,131
he could even drug someone

397
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,251
who sleeps with him everyday.

398
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:36,931
Is it even something a human will do?

399
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:39,931
What pill did you feed her?

400
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:49,371
It was a pill to speed up pregnancy.

401
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:51,931
They said it's an effective pill.

402
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:53,852
It stimulates ovulation.

403
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:55,652
I thought it was like vitamin

404
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:57,212
that it won't cause side effects.

405
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:58,011
Qin Wenyu,

406
00:16:58,172 --> 00:16:59,652
are you out of your mind?

407
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,011
How dared you feed her

408
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:03,331
some unidentified pills?

409
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:05,532
What if anything happens to her?

410
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:07,292
You hear him, right?

411
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:08,932
It's unimaginable.

412
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:10,692
Will he take my life

413
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:12,412
to get something else next year?

414
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:13,292
Is there no line

415
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,172
you won't cross to achieve
what you want?

416
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:17,611
Don't make it sound like

417
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:19,491
I'm the only one
who has ulterior motives.

418
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:20,652
Don't assume that I don't know

419
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:22,052
you've signed an agreement

420
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,131
with my mom behind my back.

421
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:24,332
As long as you have a kid with me,

422
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:25,371
she'll give you 20 percent

423
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:26,292
of the shares in the company.

424
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,491
You didn't treat me
like a human at first.

425
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:31,091
Do you see me as your husband?

426
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,091
You're just treating me like a breeder.

427
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:35,011
You're wrong about that.

428
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:35,971
You made my face look like this.

429
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:37,172
Enough, stop arguing.

430
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:46,812
I always suggested you to get divorced

431
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:47,611
because I thought

432
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:48,532
you two can't.

433
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:49,452
Bickering is the way

434
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,772
how you two get along
with each other.

435
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:52,292
I'm impressed by you guys.

436
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:53,491
You plot against one another.

437
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:54,932
Impressive.

438
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:15,572
Brother and Sister,

439
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:19,172
let's do it today.

440
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,292
I'm not daring you.

441
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,971
As your friend,

442
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:23,011
kin and lawyer,

443
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:24,251
I sincerely think

444
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:25,292
it's not necessary

445
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,491
for you to spend your life together.

446
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:27,332
Just sign it.

447
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,300
(Signature of Man: Qin Wenyu)

448
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:04,891
It's your turn.

449
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,780
(Signature of Man: Qin Wenyu)

450
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:14,652
She's right.

451
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:17,971
We should've signed it back then.

452
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:19,731
You've signed it

453
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:20,812
many times, haven't you?

454
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:23,452
But it didn't succeed.

455
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:24,572
It must be boring.

456
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:28,611
I'll fulfill your wish this time.

457
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:32,211
I won't hold you up anymore.

458
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,371
Stop pretending to be a great man.

459
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:51,412
Don't think that I can't leave you.

460
00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:54,412
I'm sure you can.

461
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:56,731
All this time,

462
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:57,851
it's always been me

463
00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:58,772
who can't leave you.

464
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:00,891
I know.

465
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:03,332
You think that I'm ridiculous

466
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:04,491
and foolish.

467
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:06,332
That you look down upon me.

468
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:08,452
But this is the truth.

469
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:11,812
As I have an obedient brother,

470
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,332
a sister who wins award every year.

471
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:17,932
A fool like me can do nothing

472
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:20,251
besides playing second fiddle
between you two.

473
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:23,772
Mom loves my brother.

474
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:24,851
Dad pampers my sister.

475
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,011
I'm caught in the middle again.

476
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:29,091
Since childhood,

477
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,332
I've never heard them praising me.

478
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:33,371
I'm not smart.

479
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:35,532
But I've worked hard.

480
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:37,131
My grades were bad.

481
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,251
So I burnt the midnight oil.

482
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,251
Yet,

483
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:41,772
I worked so hard to improve

484
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,371
my score from 6 to 56.

485
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:47,292
To you, I was still a trash
who failed the exams.

486
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:49,211
A trash.

487
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:51,091
A trash, you know?

488
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:52,211
Qin Wenyu.

489
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:52,971
That's enough.

490
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,412
You don't have to pity me.

491
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:57,052
Smart people like you

492
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:58,932
can pull things off easily.

493
00:20:59,131 --> 00:21:00,692
All of you are the winner of life.

494
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:01,412
And me?

495
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:04,052
I'm a good-for-nothing.

496
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:05,412
My dad thinks I'm a fool.

497
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:06,652
My mom thinks I'm an idiot.

498
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:08,251
I finally got a pretty wife.

499
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:10,851
But she always prepares
to sign the divorce settlement.

500
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:12,131
I'm a human too.

501
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:13,692
I've got my dignity, okay?

502
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:16,532
I can be the supporting role
for you the leading roles.

503
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:17,971
You want a kid,

504
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:19,932
I'll give you one,
what's wrong with that?

505
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:21,572
Can you spare me

506
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:24,011
and treat me like a person?

507
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,611
Stop it, dear.

508
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:30,532
Don't put it this way.

509
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:33,091
I truly love you.

510
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,211
I married you

511
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:35,652
because I liked you.

512
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:37,532
I've seen you being cool.

513
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:39,172
I've also witnessed you being foolish.

514
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:41,091
I've seen everything about you.

515
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:42,851
I love you

516
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,532
for everything you are.

517
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:46,572
Don't say that about yourself.

518
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:48,652
You're the best in my heart.

519
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:51,772
I really mean it.

520
00:21:57,052 --> 00:21:58,371
Dear, I know I've done wrong.

521
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:00,412
I'm a lousy person.

522
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,532
I even drugged you

523
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:02,692
and wanted you to have babies with me.

524
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:04,611
What if the baby is like me?

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:05,971
It doesn't matter.

526
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,452
As long as it's our baby,

527
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:08,891
I'll love him no matter what.

528
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,332
I don't want the shares anymore.

529
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:11,812
All I want is you.

530
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:13,052
I don't want the sports car either.

531
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:14,172
All I want is you.

532
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:16,052
Sorry.

533
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:21,091
Then, why did you sign it?
You were so cruel.

534
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:35,011
Should I just stop interfering
in the affairs

535
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:36,971
between Meimei and Qin Wenyu?

536
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:39,172
I always act like their instructor.

537
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:40,611
Yet, I'm still a rookie.

538
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:41,932
I'm not that experienced.

539
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:44,091
Maybe in their relationship,

540
00:22:44,452 --> 00:22:46,412
they don't need
pertinent comments from you,

541
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:48,971
but your perspective as a bystander.

542
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,172
I hope so.

543
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:54,891
I hope that from now on,

544
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:55,851
they could get along well.

545
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:56,891
Stop making a scene.

546
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,292
Everytime when they had a fight,

547
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:00,491
they'd act like kids

548
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:01,932
to get others' attention.

549
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:03,131
They've been married for a long time.

550
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:04,932
They should move on to the next stage.

551
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:06,452
There are many ways to maintain

552
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,652
freshness in a relationship.

553
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:09,532
They can just distract themselves.

554
00:23:13,491 --> 00:23:14,851
I don't agree with that.

555
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:15,692
A good relationship

556
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:17,011
doesn't need a distraction.

557
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:20,052
Well, let me ask you this.

558
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:21,932
Loving a person,

559
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,011
can you guarantee
that you'll always love her?

560
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:25,932
It depends on the person.

561
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:27,932
I guess I can if it's you.

562
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:31,251
You guess?

563
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,572
Who else is on your shortlist?

564
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:35,611
Tell me about it.

565
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:36,971
No, there's only you.

566
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:37,731
Tell me the truth.

567
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:39,091
Seriously, it's only you.

568
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:39,412
There are others.

569
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:40,131
No.

570
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:41,011
Tell me.

576
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:10,251
I've thought a lot about it last night.

577
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:11,851
I don't have many friends.

578
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:13,692
You're the only one

579
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:15,292
who can get along with me
for years

580
00:24:15,611 --> 00:24:16,452
and doesn't give up.

581
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:19,251
Back then,

582
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:21,532
I thought I was

583
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:22,572
softening the terms of being my friends.

584
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:25,011
But I suddenly realised

585
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:26,692
that you must've felt stressed

586
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:28,891
about being my friend, don't you?

587
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:39,532
This wasn't part of it yesterday

588
00:24:40,452 --> 00:24:41,371
when I left.

589
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:43,891
What happened

590
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:44,932
between you two after I left?

591
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:47,011
How did things reach this point?

592
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,692
That you started to have
a serious talk

593
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:50,011
about life feeling?

594
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:54,211
Anyway, I apologise for being

595
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:56,692
so arrogant and prideful back then.

596
00:24:57,611 --> 00:24:58,292
I know.

597
00:24:58,572 --> 00:24:59,491
It's stressing you out

598
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:00,532
as I work here.

599
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:02,211
If you can't do it,

600
00:25:02,371 --> 00:25:03,091
I can quit.

601
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:03,572
Stop.

602
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:10,891
You're well-intentioned.

603
00:25:11,731 --> 00:25:12,692
But I'll punch you to death

604
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:14,812
if you put it this way.

605
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:17,131
I beg of you.

606
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:18,292
Just treat me like you used

607
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:19,412
to do, okay?

608
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:20,772
Just be

609
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:21,851
self-righteous like you were.

610
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:22,891
I'm already used to it.

611
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:25,172
Now that you use a new trick

612
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:26,211
to insult my character

613
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:27,332
and intelligence.

614
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:28,611
I... I can't take it.

615
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:51,251
Yang,

616
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:54,731
if you really want to be nice to me,

617
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:56,292
from now on, you...

618
00:25:57,611 --> 00:25:58,332
This tastes good.

619
00:25:58,652 --> 00:25:59,971
From now on,

620
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,011
stop doing things

621
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:02,692
that you thought it was good to me.

622
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:03,652
Will you?

623
00:26:04,452 --> 00:26:06,851
And don't talk about the resignation again.

624
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:08,572
Today morning when I was at work,

625
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:09,692
the President called me over

626
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:11,572
and asked about your everything.

627
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:14,971
I guess it was about your promotion.

628
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:16,731
Promotion?

629
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:19,172
I've thought of it.

630
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:22,292
The Head of Capital Markets.

631
00:26:23,091 --> 00:26:24,371
You've got a great promotion
after joining

632
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:25,692
the company for less than a month.

633
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:26,812
Only you can do it.

634
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:30,932
It's not right, he was clamouring

635
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:31,772
to fire me yesterday.

636
00:26:32,052 --> 00:26:32,731
Why did he suddenly...

637
00:26:34,772 --> 00:26:35,772
What do you mean suddenly?

638
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:39,731
Don't you know that?

639
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:41,172
What?

640
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:01,891
When did Mr. Qiu get arrested?

641
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:06,251
Today morning.

642
00:27:06,932 --> 00:27:07,891
Mr. Jia was summoned by the President

643
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:08,891
to the meeting.

644
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:11,011
All the products of Fangyu

645
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:12,091
are suspended now.

646
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:13,692
Those products they launched in our bank

647
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:16,251
are still in the payment cycle.

648
00:27:16,692 --> 00:27:17,731
Luckily, the volume is not large.

649
00:27:18,491 --> 00:27:19,692
I guess it won't affect us.

650
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:21,772
If anything happens,

651
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:23,692
our bank has nothing to do with it.

652
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:24,932
You know what?

653
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:26,572
I'm afraid things won't be easy

654
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:28,772
for this manager of ours from now on.

655
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:38,091
What are you thinking?

656
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:40,251
As such things happen,

657
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:43,211
people from the credit department
like us have

658
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:44,091
to carry our tails between our legs.

659
00:27:44,572 --> 00:27:47,211
Mr. Cai must be the happiest person.

660
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,011
I already handed
the schedule in last week.

661
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:16,412
No, Mr. Yang.

662
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:18,172
I'm not here for this.

663
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,290
(The executive of Fanyu Finance is
suspected of benefit of transfers)

664
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,611
I got an attitude problem back then.

665
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:20,930
(The executive of Fanyu Finance is
suspected of benefit of transfers)

666
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,292
I hope you won't take offence.

667
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:22,730
(The executive of Fanyu Finance is
suspected of benefit of transfers)

668
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:25,011
Well, you've joined our department
for quite some time.

669
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:26,891
But we didn't hold
a welcoming party for you.

670
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:28,731
We'd like to treat you

671
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:31,131
to a meal this afternoon.

672
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:31,932
Do you...

673
00:28:35,611 --> 00:28:36,292
I'm not...

674
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:37,971
It's alright if you're not free.

675
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:39,292
I was just asking.

676
00:28:39,932 --> 00:28:41,211
Keep up the good work.

677
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:46,772
I mean I have no money with me.

678
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:48,452
It's alright.

679
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:49,851
Never mind, we've got money.

680
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:51,091
We've got it, it'll be our treats.

681
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:52,452
Let me pay for it.

682
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,011
You've worked hard lately.

683
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:57,091
But I've got work to do later.

684
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,491
I can only buy you canteen food.

685
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:00,412
Canteen food?

686
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:00,891
Sure.

687
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:03,491
Canteen food is good and healthy.

688
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:05,052
Yes, it's healthy.

689
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:05,932
No problem.

690
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:16,532
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

691
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:18,211
Go back to work.

692
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:19,491
Let me tell you this.

693
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:20,292
If Mr. Jin knows this,

694
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:21,371
we'll lose the bonus this month.

695
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:23,731
Do your works.

696
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:24,532
Miss Qin.

697
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:28,491
Miss Qin. Miss Qin.

698
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:30,251
Don't be so furious, okay?

699
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:31,131
It's bad for your health.

700
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:31,971
I'm just an employee.

701
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,052
I've got to listen to the boss.

702
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:33,692
Right?

703
00:29:33,812 --> 00:29:34,851
Besides, it also hurts me

704
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:36,011
to see you in this situation.

705
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,292
But today, I've got

706
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:38,292
a very important...

707
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:51,580
(Reference Room)

708
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:04,611
Miss Qin,

709
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:10,692
I've got a good news for you.

710
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:11,692
Don't, Qiao.

711
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:13,052
I don't have the guts
to hear your good news.

712
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:14,851
Look.

713
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:19,412
I really have a good news for you.

714
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:23,572
Lady Boss has said

715
00:30:24,131 --> 00:30:24,812
that Mr. Zhang

716
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:26,452
will be based in Wuhan next week.

717
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,532
This vacant office will be yours.

718
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:36,091
Look.

719
00:30:36,532 --> 00:30:39,412
I fully support you in this bet.

720
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,091
How much did you stake?

721
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:44,292
Two hundred?

722
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:48,452
We should play with our limits.

723
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:49,131
Twenty.

724
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:50,131
Get out.

725
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:54,491
Let's do it this way.

726
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,491
When you move to this new office,

727
00:30:56,692 --> 00:30:57,731
I'll use my own money

728
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:58,572
to buy you a big

729
00:30:59,932 --> 00:31:01,371
flower basket, okay?

730
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:08,932
It occurs to me

731
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:10,652
that last time when you told Li Dai

732
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:12,971
about the 25 million yuan,

733
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:15,091
I didn't get to tell anyone about it.

734
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:16,731
And... and a box of champagnes.

735
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,731
Well, I want the brand
that starts with letter M.

736
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:23,011
Okay.

737
00:31:23,572 --> 00:31:24,491
Sure.

738
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:26,532
Let me ask you this.

739
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:29,172
Why is it crowded at the entrance?

740
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:30,131
Who is here?

741
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:32,532
It's He Dongna.

742
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:34,251
The star?

743
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:35,292
Yes.

744
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:37,971
What is she doing here?
For a lawsuit?

745
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:38,971
Is she a plaintiff or a defendant?

746
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:40,332
Last night,

747
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:41,611
she was kicked out by Tianhang Hotel.

748
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:42,932
Why?

749
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,131
You don't know about this?

750
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,812
The news conference is streaming live

751
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:46,731
on the internet now.

752
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:48,772
She has dominated the trending searches.

753
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,540
(He Dongna)

754
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:17,692
Hello, my dear media friends.

755
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:19,491
I, as the spokesperson

756
00:32:19,652 --> 00:32:20,332
(Press Conference)
of Miss He Dongna,

757
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:22,971
(Press Conference)
will make a public statement

758
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,532
(Press Conference)
about Tianhang Hotel evicting Miss He Dongna

759
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:26,932
(Press Conference)
at 3 in the morning on 31st of May.

760
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:29,412
Be careful.

761
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:32,932
Hello.

762
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:35,251
What are you doing?

763
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:36,332
You hurt me.

764
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:37,611
I can walk by myself.

765
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:41,412
Follow her.

766
00:32:45,971 --> 00:32:46,652
Be careful.

767
00:32:48,052 --> 00:32:49,332
Here, over here.

768
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:52,011
(He Dongna)
On June 1st, Miss He Dongna

769
00:32:52,211 --> 00:32:55,211
was invited to the charity event
for AIDS Relief.

770
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:56,851
The previous night,

771
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:58,091
she checked in to Tianhang Hotel.

772
00:32:58,692 --> 00:33:00,652
When Miss He was showering
at the room,

773
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:02,731
her hands were injured
due to the burst

774
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:05,011
of the glass in the bathroom.

775
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:08,891
Tianhang Hotel didn't provide
her timely treatment.

776
00:33:08,891 --> 00:33:09,251
(Press Conference)

777
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:12,091
Instead, they forced her to
check out at 3 in the morning.

778
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:14,172
Causing Miss He being evicted
from the hotel.

779
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:17,772
Here, over here.

780
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:19,011
The car is here.

781
00:33:22,572 --> 00:33:24,172
Do you know how to take luggages?

782
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:25,172
Miss He,

783
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:26,371
let them do it.

784
00:33:26,491 --> 00:33:27,172
Let them take it for you.

785
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:28,371
I won't go anywhere.

786
00:33:28,532 --> 00:33:29,211
I'll stay here.

787
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:30,812
I'll be here waiting for my assistant.

788
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:31,692
We'll take you to the hospital.

789
00:33:31,891 --> 00:33:32,292
I won't go.

790
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:34,011
I'll take the luggage by myself.

791
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:35,211
Watch your hands.

792
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:37,011
Let us do it, we'll help you.

793
00:33:37,412 --> 00:33:38,091
Hurry up.

794
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:39,371
Help her.

795
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:40,371
Here, over here.

796
00:33:40,692 --> 00:33:41,052
Don't touch me.

797
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:42,011
I won't go anywhere.

798
00:33:42,412 --> 00:33:42,891
I'm not going.

799
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:44,371
Let's get in the car with us first.

800
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:46,292
The car is already here.

801
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:52,100
(Press Conference)

802
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:56,851
I stand here on behalf of Miss He Dongna,

803
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:57,971
to protest and condemn

804
00:33:58,172 --> 00:34:01,412
these insolent behaviours
of Tianhang Hotel.

805
00:34:02,412 --> 00:34:04,052
We've failed to communicate with them.

806
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:06,491
That's why we publicize this matter.

807
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,451
To protect our legitimate interest.

808
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:10,011
Our request is simple.

809
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:12,372
Which is to ask Tianhang Hotel
to make a public apology,

810
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:13,731
fire the related staff

811
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,451
and make reparation for the injury
caused to Miss He.

812
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:18,171
Before we reach a settlement,

813
00:34:18,451 --> 00:34:21,092
we'll reserve the right to take legal action.

814
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,572
I've been to many places.

815
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,411
I've stayed in all kinds of hotels.

816
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,691
I've never been insulted like this.

817
00:34:28,772 --> 00:34:29,971
It's really ridiculous.

818
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:33,971
Tianhang is a huge domestic brand.

819
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:36,052
How could they treat
the customers like this?

820
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:37,772
How could they provide
this kind of service?

821
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,772
I'm never a person
who likes to take advantage

822
00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:42,171
of my identity and enjoy a privilege.

823
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:44,451
What I want is fairness.

824
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:50,171
Dongna, I can really understand your anger.

825
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,372
I'm a consumer too.

826
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:54,052
If I encounter something like this,

827
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,011
I'll be furious as well.

828
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:59,532
What do you want us to do for you?

829
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:05,052
I'll only give Tianhang three days.

830
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:07,651
If Tianhang doesn't make

831
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:08,971
a public apology in three days,

832
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:11,211
I'll press charges against them.

833
00:35:14,132 --> 00:35:15,372
Sure, that's a must.

834
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,812
The hotel must make a public apology

835
00:35:17,971 --> 00:35:18,892
and compensation for moral injury.

836
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:19,852
In such a case,

837
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:21,451
as long as the plaintiff's evidence
is conclusive,

838
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:22,171
we'll win the lawsuit for sure.

839
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:26,892
And the public opinion
likes to exacerbate the situation.

840
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,251
He Dongna has a good image

841
00:35:29,332 --> 00:35:30,691
and she's the Goodwill Ambassador.

842
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:32,092
This must get the hotel into troubles.

843
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:33,491
Who was the person in charge

844
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:34,691
of the hotel management that night?

845
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:35,892
What background she's from?

846
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:39,132
Look.

847
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:41,651
I think there's something fishy
in this case.

848
00:35:42,491 --> 00:35:45,011
It's a recession
for the hotel industry now.

849
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:46,332
They rejected a person

850
00:35:46,372 --> 00:35:47,691
who can promote the hotel for them?

851
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:50,292
Did something else happen in it?

852
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:52,132
That remains to be seen.

853
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:55,171
There are many local hotels
that do provide

854
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:56,852
bad quality of service now.

855
00:35:58,011 --> 00:35:59,971
But it depends on
the background of the hotel

856
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:00,852
and the hidden game.

857
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:02,011
It doesn't matter at all.

858
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:04,052
What matters is
that they did kick her out

859
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,052
at 3 in the middle of the night.

860
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:06,812
This alone can bring a suit against them.

861
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:10,052
But,

862
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:14,372
this kind of non-profitable lawsuit

863
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:17,532
normally won't draw
Madam Tang's attention.

864
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:19,011
There's no way He Dongna

865
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:19,971
would come to us.

866
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:20,772
Is there some kind

867
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:21,532
of connection in between?

868
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,931
Clever, you've got the point.

869
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:28,332
I tell you what.

870
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:29,852
I heard that He Dongna is

871
00:36:30,572 --> 00:36:32,971
the friend of Xi Mei PR's boss.

872
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:34,372
So it's Xi Mei

873
00:36:34,532 --> 00:36:35,812
who's in charge of the public relation.

874
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:37,772
How professional they are.

875
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:39,852
It's Xi Mei again.

876
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:46,731
Xi Mei has brought
his future son-in-law a hot case.

877
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,852
Tao Junhui took up a star's case
as soon as he joined us.

878
00:36:48,852 --> 00:36:50,251
I don't think this is the only reason.

879
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:52,572
I heard

880
00:36:52,812 --> 00:36:54,211
that Mr. Tao is not
the only lawyer in it.

881
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:00,931
Dongna,

882
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:02,731
let me introduce to you.

883
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:05,251
This is Tao Junhui, Mr. Tao.

884
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:06,971
Ma Taiqi, Mr. Ma.

885
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,451
Chen Jun, Mr. Chen.

886
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:10,251
Three of them are the best lawyers

887
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:11,572
in our corporation department.

888
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:13,332
Mr. Ma and Mr. Chen are also

889
00:37:13,491 --> 00:37:14,852
the partners of Cheng & Hui.

890
00:37:15,971 --> 00:37:17,852
Since the founding of our law firm,

891
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,251
we've never provided this level

892
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:21,372
of legal team for any of our clients before.

893
00:37:22,612 --> 00:37:23,411
This shows

894
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:25,171
our attention to this case.

895
00:37:25,572 --> 00:37:26,651
I hope you could rest assured.

896
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,731
Well, I guess you know her.

897
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:31,651
Wu Fei has a great task this time.

898
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:33,372
She is your spokesperson.

899
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,651
She's also the legal representative

900
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:36,132
in the legal team
who's in charge of communication.

901
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:38,572
Then,

902
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:40,532
I'll count on you, lawyers.

903
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:41,971
This is our jobs.

904
00:37:44,772 --> 00:37:45,411
If there's nothing else,

905
00:37:45,572 --> 00:37:46,332
I'll get going.

906
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:48,251
Wait.

907
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:52,332
It's not right.

908
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:55,532
What do you mean?

909
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:56,532
Nothing is right.

910
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,171
This case sounds huge,

911
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:03,731
but in terms
of the practical economic benefits,

912
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:05,852
the law firm doesn't earn much from it.

913
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:08,292
But Yihui assigned three lawyers

914
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:09,612
in this case at once.

915
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:10,931
And two of them are partners.

916
00:38:11,812 --> 00:38:13,251
This is unlike her.

917
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:17,132
Does He Dongna have a backer?

918
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:20,892
Just spit it out.

919
00:38:26,612 --> 00:38:27,171
Look.

920
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,092
Here's the thing.

921
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:29,852
This is purely hearsay.

922
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:30,971
Of course, it includes

923
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:32,292
my speculation as well.

924
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:33,572
Well, it's just for fun.

925
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:34,451
Get to the point.

926
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:47,931
Do you know who He Dongna's husband is?

927
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:49,572
Who is it?

928
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:50,572
Hu Ping,

929
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:52,011
the boss of a venture capital firm.

930
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,411
He keeps a pretty low profile.

931
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:55,251
Only people in the industry know him.

932
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:57,332
He made his fortune primarily
in financial investment.

933
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:58,772
He hit the big time abroad.

934
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:00,451
His nickname is Golden Finger.

935
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,211
He invested in the domestic petrol

936
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:03,451
earlier than Buffett.

937
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:04,971
After he returned to China,

938
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:06,691
he was in financial securities.

939
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,892
Meanwhile, he also invested in several

940
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:11,292
internet companies with his keen eyes

941
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:13,171
and helped them to list overseas.

942
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,132
This guy is kind of
an invisible big boss.

943
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:19,132
It's extremely hard to see him.

944
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,251
What does it mean?

945
00:39:22,812 --> 00:39:24,092
Hu Ping is the reason...

946
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:26,372
Why they accept this case.

947
00:39:28,892 --> 00:39:29,572
You're the smartest one.

948
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:30,372
Of course.

949
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:33,211
Is the financing of our law firm
not going well?

950
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:34,691
Are they short of money now?

951
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:37,292
We can't say this.

952
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:41,092
Are you meeting Hu Ping
for dinner today?

953
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,171
- No.
- Where?

954
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:47,332
Where?

955
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:54,171
Yunding Club.

956
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:57,251
But... But, Miss Qin,

957
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:58,651
a word of advice for you.

958
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:01,052
If Madam Tang

959
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:02,451
didn't tell you about it,

960
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:04,691
just stay out of it.

961
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:19,332
(It's no big deal)

962
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,812
(to make a case for myself.)

963
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:22,572
(The chances are slim.)

964
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:25,572
(But I never know if I don't try.)

965
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:27,812
(I'm getting familiar with the cases)

966
00:40:27,812 --> 00:40:29,132
(in the corporation department now.)

967
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:31,491
(Why must I join in the fun?)

968
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:35,132
(And I have to compete
with Tao Junhui for it)

969
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,772
(and tolerate Wu Fei's hostile stares.)

970
00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:38,011
(So why bother?)

971
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:41,292
(Qin Shi,)

972
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:42,211
(you came to 11th floor)

973
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:44,491
(just to read contracts everday.)

974
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:48,132
(The media exposure of this case is high.)

975
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:50,731
(It's a good chance
to make a name for myself.)

976
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:54,971
(What I need now is reputation. Reputation!)

977
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:56,931
(Calm down.)

978
00:40:57,651 --> 00:40:58,852
(There must be a way.)

979
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:01,491
Madam Tang.

980
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:08,011
No.

981
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:09,532
You can't leave tonight.

982
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,892
We're going to meet Hu Ping

983
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:13,612
and He Dongna today.

984
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:14,532
You can't leave.

985
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:16,451
Something comes up
with the cases in Wuhan.

986
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:18,292
Chen and I have to rush over there.

987
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:20,731
Chen is leaving too?

988
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:24,772
It's not that urgent in Wuhan.

989
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:27,011
Can't you two wait
until tomorrow morning?

990
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:28,691
We can't, I've got to leave now.

991
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:31,372
Can either one of you go?

992
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:35,651
Look, among the partners
of our law firm,

993
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:36,451
it's only you and Chen

994
00:41:36,612 --> 00:41:37,892
who are good at dealing with businessmen.

995
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:40,052
Jiang is in Singapore today.

996
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:42,052
Ma is going to have dinner
with the director tonight.

997
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:44,052
Tao Junhui is the only one left.

998
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,812
He's not specialised
in talking business.

999
00:41:46,411 --> 00:41:47,971
Well, we've paid a lot of efforts

1000
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,171
just to see Hu Ping.

1001
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:50,532
If we couldn't meet him,

1002
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:52,092
our efforts would be wasted.

1003
00:41:52,372 --> 00:41:53,132
Dear,

1004
00:41:53,332 --> 00:41:54,852
you've underestimated yourself.

1005
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:57,491
Chen and I are not

1006
00:41:57,691 --> 00:41:58,812
as good as you in talking business.

1007
00:41:59,292 --> 00:42:00,132
Shoo.

1008
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,011
I'm not joking.

1009
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:04,092
All I do is to make friends with others.

1010
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:05,572
But when it comes to investment,

1011
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,812
I seriously know nothing.

1012
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:10,651
Why don't we reschedule it?

1013
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:13,251
Dear Mr. Jin,

1014
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:16,011
it's very hard to invite Hu Ping over.

1015
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:17,971
I couldn't make
another appointment with him.

1016
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:19,092
Then, forget it.

1017
00:42:20,011 --> 00:42:20,572
Didn't we postpone

1018
00:42:20,731 --> 00:42:21,892
our plan for half a year?

1019
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,572
It's not that urgent.

1020
00:42:27,731 --> 00:42:28,772
The venture capital firm withdrew

1021
00:42:28,852 --> 00:42:29,812
their fund on ad hoc basis.

1022
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:31,852
Or else, we would've gone
public already.

1023
00:42:32,372 --> 00:42:34,132
I know which company
that firm invested in.

1024
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:36,532
They invested in Century.

1025
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:39,731
Century is not as good as us.

1026
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,532
It developed several years
earlier than us.

1027
00:42:45,211 --> 00:42:47,292
Fine, I admit

1028
00:42:47,852 --> 00:42:49,251
that Century is better than us.

1029
00:42:51,052 --> 00:42:52,971
Among the new listings
of companies in this year,

1030
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:56,372
they've managed 40 percent
of their legal affairs for IPO.

1031
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:59,052
But our portion is growing every year.

1032
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:00,812
Our Civil Department is
in the top three in Pujiang.

1033
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:03,171
They were established
only five years earlier than us.

1034
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:04,491
If I was given five-year time,

1035
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:06,332
I would've done better than them.

1036
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:08,612
I'm absolutely sure of that.

1037
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:12,372
We've got a lot of talents
in our law firm.

1038
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:13,411
Is there no one

1039
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:14,892
who can talk about investment
with Hu Ping?

1040
00:43:16,372 --> 00:43:17,491
Even if we can't make a deal
this time,

1041
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:19,691
we can take it as a chance
to show our company strength.

1042
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:21,572
If Hu Ping is really

1043
00:43:21,772 --> 00:43:22,892
as amazing as advertised,

1044
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,052
he should be able to identify it.

1045
00:43:26,132 --> 00:43:28,892
Funding is consensual.
