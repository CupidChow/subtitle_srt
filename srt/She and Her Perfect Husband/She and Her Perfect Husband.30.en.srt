19
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:57,106
Is it something serious?

20
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,945
That you even solemnly discuss it with me.

21
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:02,625
For your record, I'm not going to do dirty things.

22
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:04,585
But if you want me to look into

00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,786
your Jin's hidden reserves,

24
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,700
just leave it to me,
there won't be a problem.

25
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,420
You're puffing yourself up.

26
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:16,506
Hello, Qiao.

27
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:19,306
Bring the person to my office.

28
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:20,306
To my office.

29
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:21,545
Sure.

30
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,346
Qin Shi. I don't think it's necessary

31
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:31,226
to introduce him to you, right?

32
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,385
Miss Qin.

33
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,665
We meet again.

34
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:43,426
Yes.

35
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,706
We meet again, Mr. Wang.

36
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:47,465
From today on,

37
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,066
Mr. Wang is coming to Cheng & Hui

38
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:50,545
for a project inspection.

39
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,986
Regarding administrative
and financial affairs,

40
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,146
you can ask Qiao.

41
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:55,545
As for the operation

42
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:56,545
and the business of the firm,

43
00:02:56,986 --> 00:02:58,665
you can go to Miss Qin.

44
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:00,946
Please look out for me, then.

45
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:02,465
Please don't say that.

46
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:03,665
It's our duty to help you.

47
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:05,465
I've come across the project plan

48
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:07,025
and it's really enticing.

49
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,265
After a night of discussion with Mr. Hu,

50
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:11,185
I decided to come here to justify.

51
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:12,706
It's necessary

52
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:13,745
for our company to go on a field trip

53
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:15,586
at the company we're going to invest in.

54
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:17,265
Don't worry.

55
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:18,146
I came here

56
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:19,346
not to supervise your work

57
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,426
or find faults with you.

58
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:21,426
I'll evaluate

59
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:22,706
the operation of your company

60
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:24,586
impartially and objectively.

61
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:25,586
At the same time,

62
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:27,426
I'll carry out the inspection

63
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,385
as unobtrusively as possible.

64
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:30,426
Mr. Wang.

65
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,105
That's very kind of you.

66
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:33,745
As for the working space,

67
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,506
please use that small visitor's room.

68
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:39,825
Mr. Wang, we'll cooperate with you

69
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:41,825
with great sincerity and transparency.

70
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:51,825
People don't often come here

71
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:52,745
and it's a quiet place.

72
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:53,665
I'll send over

73
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:54,665
the things you need later.

74
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:55,665
Feel free to ask

75
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:56,706
if you need anything.

76
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:57,786
Sure.

77
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,745
This is my name card

78
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:01,625
and my number is on it.

79
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:02,665
Tell me

80
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:03,625
(Qin Shi)
you need help.

81
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,260
(Qin Shi)
OK.

82
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:06,226
Miss Qin.

83
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:08,905
Yes, Mr. Wang?

84
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:10,905
Don't be so courteous.

85
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:12,025
Please don't call me Mr. Wang.

86
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:13,586
Just Jiesen.

87
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,265
How's James going?

88
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:17,225
Does he feel better?

89
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:18,906
He's fine. Thank you for your concern.

90
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:20,866
That day, he left in a hurry

91
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:22,586
and I didn't get a chance to talk to him.

92
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,105
Perhaps we can grab a bite

93
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,345
to catch up some other day.

94
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:30,105
He has the stomach flu.

95
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:32,345
I suppose you have to postpone the meal.

96
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:34,265
It's fine if we can't have
a meal together.

97
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:35,626
I just want to catch up with him.

98
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,225
I heard from Madam Tang

99
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:39,586
that he's not working now

100
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,866
but taking care of your child
at home.

101
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:44,345
It's the working hours,

102
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,265
let's not talk about personal matters.

103
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:47,746
My apologies.

104
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:48,586
Miss Qin.

105
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:50,545
If you have free time,

106
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:51,466
I'd like to ask about

107
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:53,825
the business affairs.

108
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:56,065
Sure, Mr. Wang.

109
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:57,825
Come and sit.

110
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:05,265
Well.

111
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:05,945
I've read

112
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,065
some information about the law firm

113
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:08,906
and I found out

114
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,186
you have a standard
when choosing the case

115
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,146
that's somewhat different from other firms.

116
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:14,866
Hence, I'd like to know

117
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:15,866
what's the decisive factor

118
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,306
you rely on

119
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:19,225
when choosing the case?

120
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,505
Money.

121
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:25,866
Oh, Miss Qin.

122
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:27,306
I thought you were going to say

123
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:28,345
it was for justice.

124
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,466
Are you kidding me?

125
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,026
Actually, lawyer might seem

126
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:36,426
to be a posh profession

127
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,986
as it's related to fairness

128
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:39,825
and justice.

129
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:41,345
Truth be told,

130
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,065
we're just a bunch of professionals

131
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:45,225
who provide legal services

132
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,065
on an hourly rate.

133
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:49,426
We provide services with
professional legal knowledge and help

134
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,545
that match well with the charges

135
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:53,746
and protect the right

136
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:55,906
of our clients as well as possible.

137
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:57,665
This is how things work in a law office.

138
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,466
Miss Qin, you're talking like

139
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,626
the law firm is a sordid merchant.
Do you think it's appropriate?

140
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:04,626
It's fine if you're the one listening.

141
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,385
Do you mean that I'm a crude man

142
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:08,825
in your eyes?

143
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,545
You're a businessman.

144
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,225
Talking about money

145
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:14,545
will arouse the interest of businessmen.

146
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:17,065
Don't tell me you were expecting

147
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:18,665
some motivational talks from me.

148
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:23,586
Regarding He Dongna's case,

149
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:24,706
how much can you reap from it?

150
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:26,186
In truth?

151
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,846
Of course.

152
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:31,345
Honestly, the lawsuit case
of a celebrity

153
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:32,225
is a tough job.

154
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:33,706
Besides, we can't get many benefits

155
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:34,665
from it too.

156
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:37,785
So, Cheng & Hui chooses the celebrity cases

157
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,906
very cautiously.

158
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:41,186
But, celebrity cases

159
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:42,466
will earn attention from the public.

160
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:43,665
By taking it, the firm

161
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:45,146
gets to introduce to more people.

162
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,265
Benefits come in
when one becomes famous.

163
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:50,825
Mr. Jin used to tell us

164
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:52,426
that our profession

165
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:53,706
shouldn't get much attention
from the public.

166
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:55,466
Why?

167
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,385
Because we protect
what's fair to someone

168
00:06:58,665 --> 00:06:59,626
not justice of the world.

169
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,026
Our clients could be a good person

170
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:03,105
or a bad person.

171
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:06,105
They may be perpetrators or victims.

172
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,906
Our duty is to protect

173
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:09,665
their fundamental rights.

174
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,026
However, laymen

175
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,785
who don't possess legal knowledge

176
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,505
might find this unacceptable.

177
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:19,785
Hopefully, from today on,

178
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,146
I'm not a layman

179
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,065
in your eyes, Miss Qin.

180
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:42,105
What the heck is this?

181
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:53,105
Miss Qin.

182
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:56,906
Hello, Mr. Wang. What's the matter?

183
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:58,146
Nothing.

184
00:07:58,385 --> 00:08:00,026
Just now, you left in a hurry

185
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:01,105
and I didn't get to ask

186
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:02,505
if you're free tomorrow at noon.

187
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:04,186
Let's have lunch together.

188
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:07,626
I don't think so. I'm busy.

189
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:10,586
Still, you have to eat
even though you're busy.

190
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:11,706
After all, a lawyer needs to rest too.

191
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:12,945
Miss Qin,

192
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:13,906
please don't turn me down.

193
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,746
When I want to look into a company,

194
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:17,626
I'll start

195
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,426
with the employees of the company.

196
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,065
Now I have the interest

197
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:21,986
to learn more about you.

198
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:24,825
Let's invite the rest too.

199
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:26,225
You can learn more about
the employees altogether.

200
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:27,545
There's no need.

201
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:29,825
I just want to stay alone with you.

202
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,145
I don't think it's a good idea.

203
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:33,986
Well,

204
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:35,386
James will get jealous

205
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:36,705
and I'll be in trouble.

206
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:37,826
Blimey.

207
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:38,986
There is always one thing

208
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:40,386
to overcome another.

209
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:42,785
I didn't expect

210
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:44,025
an interesting lady like you

211
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,545
will be submissive

212
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:48,826
to what James has said.

213
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:49,946
Fine.

214
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:51,585
You can think about it.

215
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:52,866
If you refuse to go with me,

216
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:54,506
I'll get permission

217
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,506
from Madam Tang

218
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:58,066
to dine out alone with you.

219
00:08:58,345 --> 00:08:59,266
I think James

220
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:00,386
won't say anything about this then.

221
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,426
I'll let you get on.

222
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:22,585
(Hello, is this Miss Li?)

223
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:23,826
(I'm Yang Hua.)

224
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:25,105
(I've received the files.)

225
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,826
(Before I make the decision,)

226
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,266
(I'd like to meet with Mr. Qiu.)

227
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:29,626
We meet again.

228
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,626
Life is always unpredictable.

229
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,225
Two days before, I just told you
that I could help you,

230
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:40,665
yet you're now coming to my aid.

231
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:47,506
Miss Li told me

232
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:48,866
that you're married

233
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,826
and your wife is a lawyer.

234
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:56,145
That's good.

235
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:58,025
I'm happy for you.

236
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,705
I only have two questions for you.

237
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,105
Why did you ask me

238
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:07,905
to buy most of the shares
of Haibo Biology suddenly?

239
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:11,465
It was a long time ago.

240
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:12,506
Why do you still...

241
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:13,946
Did you make a profit from that?

242
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:38,986
Yang Hua.

243
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,986
I, Qiu Jianxiang

244
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:45,025
never touch the money
I shouldn't touch in my life.

245
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:46,785
If I do,

246
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,186
let heaven strikes me down.

247
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:19,705
If there's nothing else,

248
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:20,545
I'll get going.

249
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:23,986
Where are you going?
I can give you a ride.

250
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:25,066
No, thanks.

251
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:28,866
What about the thing you promised me?

252
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:30,905
I only promised you to meet with him

253
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,386
and that's all.

254
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:34,946
You!

255
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:49,665
Come out.

256
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:51,145
I have something to tell you.

257
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,145
Qin Shi.

258
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:05,465
You went overboard.

259
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,345
How could you

260
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:10,345
act ridiculously and go off-limit?

261
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:12,145
You lied about your marital status.

262
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,266
And now you even lied about

263
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:15,465
the background of your husband.

264
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:18,145
Don't you remember you have the firm

265
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:20,225
to take advice from your husband

266
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:21,545
who has been crouching at home
for four years?

267
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:22,665
You devious cat.

268
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,345
How dare are you laughing?

269
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,626
How can you think this is funny?

270
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:30,465
Believe it or not,

271
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:32,266
I'm going to Madam Tang

272
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:33,506
and expose you before her.

273
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:35,545
Well, believe it or not,

274
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:36,826
I'll ask Yang Hua to stop helping you.

275
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:37,905
You promised me that.

276
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:39,866
What's it?

277
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:40,946
You promised

278
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,626
if I didn't expose you

279
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:44,626
and you'd have Yang Hua to help me.

280
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,225
Apart from reviewing the documents,

281
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:47,986
he'll also be the expert witness.

282
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,025
This is what you promised.

283
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:51,785
When did I?

284
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:53,145
You did. Just now.

285
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,545
I heard it from the horse's mouth.

286
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:56,705
I'm intelligent and understanding.

287
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:58,585
You better play fair.

288
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:37,826
God of Wealth, Sprite.

289
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:40,105
I understood what my dad
was trying to tell me.

290
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:40,986
But, deep inside me,

291
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:41,986
there are two different voices.

292
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:43,266
I need your help now

293
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:44,225
in making the decision.

294
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:45,465
Alright?

295
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:46,665
Let's do it.

296
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:48,506
God of Wealth, you first.

297
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:53,105
God of Wealth, please choose.

298
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:54,665
No

299
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:57,186
or yes.

300
00:13:58,465 --> 00:13:59,145
Please choose.

301
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:03,585
Time to choose.

302
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:13,186
Chop-chop, make your choice.

303
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:17,186
God of Wealth, are you sure?

304
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:18,186
This is just one.

305
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,266
But this is a pile.

306
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:23,545
How come you chose this one?

307
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:25,866
I bet you must be full now.

308
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:27,186
I'm going to change it.

309
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:28,585
It's your turn, Sprite.

310
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:30,225
Your choice doesn't work.

311
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:32,105
Sprite, choose it.

312
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,306
Alright?

313
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,145
Come on.

314
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:39,345
No or yes.

315
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:40,545
Choose either one.

316
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:25,946
You're back.

317
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:27,225
Are you hungry?
I can cook something for you.

318
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:29,186
No.

319
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,426
I've been working the whole day.
I'm tired.

320
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:48,946
You've been wearing heels all day.

321
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:49,946
Your feet must be sore.

322
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:51,186
Get a foot soak.

323
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:54,386
It helps to relieve pressure

324
00:15:54,826 --> 00:15:55,746
and stimulate blood circulation.

325
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:58,665
I've added some mugwort and saffron

326
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:02,585
that's good for your health.

327
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,066
You're so considerate.

328
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:07,986
Well, not really.

329
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:14,025
Today,

330
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:15,105
I went out with Li Dai.

331
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:17,746
Did you meet Qiu Jianxiang today?

332
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:18,746
How was it?

333
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:22,266
I asked him some questions.

334
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:23,426
But,

335
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:24,585
it made no difference by asking him.

336
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:26,585
Never mind that.

337
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,866
What about you? How was your day?

338
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:32,345
Today, I met one of your acquaintances.

339
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,105
Wang Jiesen.

340
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:40,746
He came to the company
as the vice president

341
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,426
for an inspection
on behalf of Hu Ping.

342
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:44,426
I'm already preoccupied with work

343
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:45,426
and I have to entertain him.

344
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:50,946
What's wrong with you?

345
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:53,306
I'm thinking

346
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:55,506
that perhaps I can be of your help

347
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,746
if I were Yang Hua I used to be.

348
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:02,826
Come here.

349
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,945
You've already helped me a lot.

350
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:09,626
If you're going to do my work,

351
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:10,746
what do I do then?

352
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:14,345
If I were Yang Hua before,

353
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:15,986
would you like me more?

354
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:24,386
This question,

355
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,825
I can't answer you.

356
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,146
Because I know nothing about

357
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:32,105
how proud and wonderful

358
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:33,225
Yang Hua was.

359
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,345
All I know

360
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,425
is that you're who you're.

361
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:39,105
You never change

362
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:41,185
all the time.

363
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:43,825
No matter how much you've been through,

364
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:47,705
you're able to stay clean and kind.

365
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:49,065
The Yang Hua I like

366
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:50,866
is someone like this.

367
00:17:59,026 --> 00:17:59,585
By the way,

368
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:01,026
does Wang Jiesen

369
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:01,986
have any weak spots?

370
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:06,225
How could he come this far

371
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,786
if someone got his weak spot?

372
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:10,465
He's deathly devious.

373
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:12,386
Don't go near him.

374
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:18,386
But, we're in the same building now

375
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:19,666
and we'll see each other around.

376
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:21,666
I have nowhere to hide.

377
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:24,105
Most importantly, Hu Ping

378
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,266
is the target of the firm.

379
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:26,506
Besides,

380
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:27,906
I'm not someone who evades problems.

381
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:29,866
Had he really bullied you before,

382
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:31,305
I'd never let him off easily.

383
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:33,746
Perhaps I get to catch his weak spot

384
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:34,666
and beat him to the punch.

385
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,225
I won't let those who framed you

386
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,266
to go unpunished.

387
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:38,825
You have a kind soul

388
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:39,465
and you choose to forgive them.

389
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:41,225
But I'm not. I'm vindictive.

390
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:43,866
I will never let those who bullied you

391
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:45,585
off the hook easily.

392
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:48,705
Why are you so kind to me?

393
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:51,065
Because you're kind to me too.

394
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:52,546
This is mutual.

395
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:56,185
This is expensive, right?

396
00:18:57,825 --> 00:18:58,866
Let's not waste the whole bucket
of foot bath herbs.

397
00:18:59,065 --> 00:18:59,666
Let's soak our feet together.

398
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:00,705
Faster.

399
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:01,666
I give you half of the space.

400
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:04,986
Your feet are really big.

401
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,906
You stepped on mine.

Where are you going? I can drive you.

411
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:12,666
Can you really drive
with your hand hurt?

412
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:14,705
You drive the car then.

413
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:16,866
Hop in.

414
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:20,986
Do you know where am I going?

415
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:23,305
I do. You're going to
investigate the truth.

416
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:37,266
Miss Qin...

417
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:40,506
Mr. Qiao.

418
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,185
Why are you here?

419
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:44,305
Where's Miss Qin?

420
00:20:44,906 --> 00:20:46,546
Miss Qin went to the courthouse.

421
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,786
There's a trial this afternoon.

422
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,185
Before she left, she asked me

423
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:51,626
to help you with your problems.

424
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:52,705
If I can't answer it,

425
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:53,825
I'll note it down

426
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:55,225
and reply to you after she returns.

427
00:20:56,065 --> 00:20:58,225
Is that okay?

428
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,225
Of course.

429
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:03,065
Please have a seat.

430
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:14,345
The truth of the case

431
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:16,225
isn't just tied to one's responsibility,

432
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:18,506
but the case has already been moralised

433
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:20,386
and only authenticity is allowed.

434
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,345
Once her persona is found blemished,

435
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,945
the credibility of our law firm will be drained.

436
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:26,105
You're thinking this way, aren't you?

437
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:32,146
Don't ask me why I knew this well.

438
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,065
No secret can be hidden in the law firm.

439
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:38,705
I don't intend to grab your case

440
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:39,626
nor will I interfere in it.

441
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,386
I just think

442
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,746
that your hands are hurt
because of me.

443
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:45,225
So,

444
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:46,185
I should repay your kindness.

445
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,786
Therefore,

446
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:50,585
I'll help you to search for the clue,

447
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:52,425
drive the car and serve you water
for the time being.

448
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:53,986
You can see me as your assistant.

449
00:21:57,465 --> 00:21:58,386
Still staying silent?

450
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:03,626
Between Yao Yao and He Dongna,

451
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:06,225
which of them do you trust more?

452
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:09,425
Both of them have a reason to lie.

453
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:11,266
But most of all,

454
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:12,425
we have to find a trustable

455
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,465
testimony from the third party,

456
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:14,866
a voice recording, a footage

457
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:17,225
or the guests of the hotel.

458
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:32,666
What do you say?

459
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:33,906
Gorgeous.

460
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:45,386
I'm off.

461
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:46,866
Good luck.

462
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:04,266
Are you Miss Qin
of Huanlong International?

463
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,026
Please come with me.

464
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:10,825
In the hotel,

465
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:12,585
the common guest room is located
on the third floor to seventh floor.

466
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:14,305
The eighth floor is the executive floor.

467
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:15,585
As for the presidential suite,

468
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:16,666
it's located on the west side
of the eighth floor.

469
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,386
There's only one room on this side

470
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:19,986
and with a separate room key

471
00:23:20,185 --> 00:23:20,906
to get access to it.

472
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:24,305
This way, please.

473
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:38,305
Please come in, Ms. He.

474
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,546
Just put the things over here.

475
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:47,465
Be careful.

476
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,825
Our hotel is located at a strategic place

477
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,786
and it's near the downtown

478
00:23:57,026 --> 00:23:57,705
and the airport.

479
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:00,866
Both Chinese and Western restaurants

480
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:02,465
are well-known too.

481
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:03,705
The chef of Western cuisine

482
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:05,026
is from Italy

483
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,506
and has worked

484
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:07,825
in a Michelin three-star restaurant before.

485
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,225
Miss Qin, may I know

486
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:14,026
how long would your boss stay?

487
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:17,705
It'll be a long stay.

488
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:19,345
At least one year, I suppose.

489
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,746
But, this hotel isn't the only choice.

490
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:24,666
Because my boss is kind of demanding.

491
00:24:24,986 --> 00:24:27,105
I need to have more options
for him to pick.

492
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,185
Of course.

493
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:30,425
Only the best hotel stands out
from the comparison.

494
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:31,866
However, our hotel

495
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,705
offers a professional butler service.

496
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:36,386
There are many hotels claim

497
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:37,465
that they have butler service.

498
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:38,546
We're different from them.

499
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:39,825
The butlers here

500
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:41,465
is certified by
The International Butler Academy

501
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,225
of Netherland.

502
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,786
Moreover, our customers
are very satisfied

503
00:24:43,986 --> 00:24:44,945
with the service.

504
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:47,705
My boss is a fastidious one

505
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:48,506
and I'm sick of it.

506
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:50,345
We're in the service industry

507
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:51,866
and this is our work.

508
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:54,065
Honestly, many customers

509
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:56,626
have their own special lifestyle habits.

510
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:58,546
All we have to do

511
00:24:58,866 --> 00:24:59,825
is to provide the best service

512
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:01,225
as possible as we could.

513
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,305
Hello, sir.

514
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:03,866
Yes.

515
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:05,546
I'm choosing the hotel for you.

516
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:08,305
Sorry.

517
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:09,786
But, can you leave me alone?

518
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:10,786
Sure.

519
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:19,386
Can you see it?

520
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:21,825
Yes, very clearly.

521
00:25:23,386 --> 00:25:25,185
(Yao Yao said she offered He Dongna)

522
00:25:25,386 --> 00:25:28,506
(the butler service in this suite that day.)

523
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,146
Go to the bathroom
where the accident happened.

524
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:54,666
Miss Qin.

525
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,626
Do you need my help?

526
00:25:57,906 --> 00:25:58,585
No.

527
00:25:58,866 --> 00:25:59,546
This way, please.

528
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:06,986
I heard that the staff of your hotel

529
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:08,585
has once driven out a female celebrity.

530
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:09,506
Is that true?

531
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:11,465
Miss Qin.

532
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:14,266
I'm not sure about you what said.

533
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,626
Tianhang Hotel has many branches.

534
00:26:17,345 --> 00:26:18,506
But, I can assure you

535
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:19,866
that you'll receive

536
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:20,866
the most worthy service

537
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:23,065
if you choose us.

538
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:25,825
This way, please.

539
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,580
(Tianhang Hotel Limited Company)

540
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,225
How was it?

541
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:41,585
I've checked it.

542
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:44,386
Except for the surveillance camera
in the lift,

543
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:46,345
there is only the camera
at the end of the corridor

544
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:47,786
near the presidential suite
on the top floor.

545
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:50,146
It's unlikely that there's a camera
in the room.

546
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:52,026
Do the security and staff

547
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:53,825
have any evidence in their hands

548
00:27:54,146 --> 00:27:55,146
that day?

549
00:27:55,786 --> 00:27:56,506
I've asked the staff.

550
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:57,945
They're not allowed

551
00:27:58,185 --> 00:27:59,386
to film and record
the voice of the customer

552
00:27:59,585 --> 00:28:01,546
when they're on duty.

553
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:04,386
Hence, it's impossible for them
to hold any evidence.

554
00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:13,185
(But I have found the witness.)

555
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:14,986
(I've spent some time)

556
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:16,705
(to search for the staff who was on duty
at that time)

557
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:18,026
(and the person agreed
to be the witness.)

558
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:20,105
Nowadays, not many people

559
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,305
are willing to stand out for others.

560
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:22,786
- Curl this up.
- Sure.

561
00:28:23,146 --> 00:28:23,746
Glad to hear that.

562
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:24,506
Dongna.

563
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:25,906
When can we meet

564
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,225
with the witness?

565
00:28:29,746 --> 00:28:30,425
Why?

566
00:28:31,506 --> 00:28:33,146
Don't you trust me?

567
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,626
I didn't mean that.

568
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,705
We're your attorneys.

569
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,465
We should look into
every detail of the case

570
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:41,465
in order to be fully prepared.

571
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:42,666
If possible,

572
00:28:42,746 --> 00:28:43,746
I'd like to meet with the witness

573
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:44,425
as soon as possible.

574
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:46,026
As far as we know,

575
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,105
the people on the scene that day

576
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,465
were all from the hotel.

577
00:28:48,906 --> 00:28:50,305
If the witness is reliable,

578
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:51,866
we'd like to confirm all the evidence

579
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,146
and testimony as fast as possible

580
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:54,465
to avoid any changes.

581
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:56,266
No worries.

582
00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:58,146
(The witness was at the scene that day.)

583
00:28:58,506 --> 00:28:59,945
His testimony is trustable.

584
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:01,465
Sure.

585
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:10,105
You've been looking at this
the whole day.

586
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:11,866
Did you find anything from it?

587
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:15,825
Our strategy

588
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:18,026
is to find out the flaws

589
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:18,986
in the hotel's system

590
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:20,825
that'd cause personal injuries.

591
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:21,786
That'll work.

592
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:23,305
But, if you see from this view,

593
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,825
the prosecution can only be the hotel.

594
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:27,866
I'm trying

595
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:28,866
to figure out other plans.

596
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:33,026
I suppose the client comes after Miss Yao.

597
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:35,506
I think there would be

598
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:36,425
others witnesses on that day.

599
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:37,705
Let's try and

600
00:29:38,386 --> 00:29:39,546
get something out of the others.

601
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:40,945
I can do it myself.

602
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:45,506
They're the staff of the hotel

603
00:29:46,105 --> 00:29:47,345
and we're not sure

604
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:48,185
if they'd tell the truth.

605
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:50,185
You'll never know until you try.

606
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:51,266
What if they tell the truth?

607
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:53,506
I'll work something out

608
00:29:53,945 --> 00:29:54,546
like searching for the clue

609
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:55,546
and asking around.

610
00:29:55,906 --> 00:29:57,266
No need. I have someone to help.

611
00:29:58,585 --> 00:29:59,345
Do you mean Gang?

612
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,345
I've worked with him before.

613
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:03,465
You'd better leave it to me.

614
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,666
It's better to get more people
to look for the clue.

615
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:10,185
Can you please don't eat

616
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:10,906
like a hungry ghost?

617
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:12,825
You eat like a dog.

618
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:14,266
Please behave elegantly.

619
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:18,266
If I eat like a dog,

620
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:20,585
you're actually

621
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:21,786
eating at the same table
with a dog then.

622
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:22,465
What would you be?

623
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:23,546
Do you think you're any better?

624
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:32,146
You're back.

625
00:30:36,906 --> 00:30:37,825
Where have you gone?

626
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:38,986
I've waited for you
this afternoon.

627
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:42,825
What has happened to your hand?

628
00:30:43,585 --> 00:30:44,746
I got scalded
when I was eating with a friend.

629
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:47,026
Who was that friend

630
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:47,786
that got your hand scalded?

631
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:53,506
Your girlfriend, right?

632
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:55,546
Is it Feifei

633
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:58,026
or Miss Qin?

634
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,065
It's all becoming clear now.

635
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:02,986
Speaking of girlfriends,

636
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,386
a man can't receive more care

637
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:06,666
even if he has many girlfriends.

638
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:08,866
Girlfriends

639
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:10,266
can only exist in the singular term,

640
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,305
if it becomes a plural term...

641
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:13,386
What nonsense are you saying?

642
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:15,026
Open it.

643
00:31:17,065 --> 00:31:17,666
Shoot it.

644
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:28,786
Is Miss Qin your ex-girlfriend?

645
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:34,705
I'm talking to you.

646
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:35,705
Stop pretending you're not hearing me.

647
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:36,585
Scram.

648
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:39,425
Get out of my sight.

649
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:42,746
Well.

650
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:43,746
I'll leave.

651
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:45,705
Don't get your injury wet.

652
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:53,825
What were you going to tell me?

653
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,026
Do you know Feifei

654
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:11,185
ask me to look Miss Qin's husband up?

655
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:17,026
What's this?

656
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:18,425
You don't even give me the name
of the company.

657
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:19,825
Where should I start?

658
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,105
Fine. I'll look for another person.

659
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:24,225
Hey, no.

660
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,866
I didn't say that I couldn't do this.

661
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:29,105
But I need some time.

662
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:30,626
This is what I found.

663
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:35,305
What's this?

664
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:36,425
The resume.

665
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:39,105
Yang Hua's resume four years ago.

666
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:40,425
Four years ago?

667
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:41,506
Why do you give me this?

668
00:32:41,786 --> 00:32:42,986
It's the resume of this year too.

669
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:46,506
Look at this.

670
00:32:46,786 --> 00:32:48,786
There's only one information
about his work experience.

671
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:50,705
What has he done over these years?

672
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:53,786
It's written on it.

673
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:56,105
Finance elite from overseas.

674
00:32:57,506 --> 00:32:59,386
It's fake. Not true.

675
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:01,105
After some research,

676
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:04,146
he's just an authentic jobless man.

677
00:33:05,146 --> 00:33:05,746
Are you sure?

678
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:07,906
Of course, I'm sure.

679
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:10,305
You have a friend

680
00:33:10,345 --> 00:33:11,026
working at
the immigration administration, right?

681
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:12,225
If you don't believe what I said,

682
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:13,305
you can ask your friend to look into

683
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:14,986
his travel records in recent years

684
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:15,906
and you'll know it.

685
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:19,386
You better stay tight-lipped on this.

686
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,185
Keep it from Feifei.

687
00:33:22,225 --> 00:33:23,425
What should I tell

688
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,305
if she asks me about this?

689
00:33:24,746 --> 00:33:26,026
You have a smart brain
and you should know what to do.

690
00:33:29,585 --> 00:33:30,266
Alright.

691
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:32,345
I don't know.

692
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:33,986
I'll tell her that I know nothing.

693
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:37,986
You're a smart guy,
I must say.

694
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:48,666
I'm back.

695
00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:54,825
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

696
00:33:55,345 --> 00:33:56,026
Not yet.

697
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:56,786
Great.

698
00:33:56,986 --> 00:33:57,546
Give me a second.

699
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:02,585
What are you doing?

700
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:06,666
Don't come any further.

701
00:34:07,305 --> 00:34:07,626
Just wait for it.

702
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:08,506
I'll show you my skills.

703
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:10,225
You should go there and sit down.

704
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:11,185
You can play video games or watch TV

705
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:11,625
as you want.

706
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:12,425
Just leave me alone.

707
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:14,425
You're cooking?

708
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:17,665
Don't you believe me?

709
00:34:17,986 --> 00:34:19,145
What's with that face?

710
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,465
Previously, it was just a mistake.

711
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,425
Now,

712
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:23,546
I've fully prepared for it.

713
00:34:24,385 --> 00:34:25,145
You may leave now.

714
00:34:35,145 --> 00:34:36,665
Surprise!

715
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:39,385
Today, I went to the malatang store

716
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:40,506
to ask for the ingredient.

717
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:41,865
As I saw

718
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:42,945
that you enjoyed that very much
last time,

719
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:43,746
so, I reproduced

720
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:44,665
the same malatang for you.

721
00:34:45,106 --> 00:34:46,546
It's not oily and spicy

722
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,185
with bone broth as the base.

723
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:50,066
You don't like meat,

724
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:51,465
so I only put in vegetables.

725
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:52,346
Look.

726
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,905
There are all kinds of mushrooms,
beancurd sheets

727
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:54,905
and kelp knots.

728
00:34:58,185 --> 00:34:58,746
As for the sauce,

729
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:00,465
I went to buy it from the store.

730
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:01,865
Have a taste. Does it taste the same?

731
00:35:05,185 --> 00:35:06,185
How's it? Is it nice?

732
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:07,425
Yes.

733
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:08,546
Does it taste the same?

734
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:10,546
Eat more.

735
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:11,826
This is a limited edition of malatang.

736
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:12,865
You don't have this chance every day.

737
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:16,746
Qin Shi.

738
00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:17,865
I want to ask you something.

739
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:20,066
Just go ahead, why do you
ask for my permission first?

740
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:21,986
You...

741
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:29,106
Does your firm really need

742
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:30,066
funding from Hu Ping?

743
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:31,586
We don't really need it.

744
00:35:31,786 --> 00:35:32,705
We're just dying to get it.

745
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:35,986
Why do you ask this?

746
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,346
Do you have the plan to get it?

747
00:35:37,865 --> 00:35:38,506
No, I don't.

748
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:40,546
Why are you so serious?

749
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:43,546
If you fail to get the funding,

750
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,425
will it affect your chance

751
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:45,306
of obtaining the partnership
with the firm?

752
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:48,665
Well.

753
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:50,145
Actually,

754
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:51,625
my position in the firm becomes awkward

755
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:53,546
after Tao Junhui came.

756
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:55,506
If he makes it

757
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:56,625
in the case of He Dongna,

758
00:35:56,826 --> 00:35:57,786
all credits will go to him

759
00:35:58,346 --> 00:35:59,506
and I'll be in a rather
disadvantageous place.

760
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:00,546
If the case doesn't pan out,

761
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:01,506
I won't have to take the fall.

762
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:04,225
However, the connection of Hu Ping

763
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:05,185
can't be of my help then.

764
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:08,586
The firm is going to be turbulent

765
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:10,145
and I can't see what will happen.

766
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,066
Why do you ask this out of a sudden?

767
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:19,586
Nothing, just asking.

768
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:24,306
No worries.

769
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:25,106
For the time being,

770
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:27,106
they don't suspect your identity.

771
00:36:27,425 --> 00:36:28,746
We still have time.

772
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,346
I'm not anxious, so why would you?

773
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:32,546
Dig in.

774
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:33,826
Is it nice?

775
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:34,346
Nice.

776
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:34,945
It tastes good, right?

777
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:35,865
Yummy.

778
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:36,546
Eat more.

779
00:36:38,425 --> 00:36:38,986
Is it salty?

780
00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:40,665
No.

781
00:36:41,225 --> 00:36:41,746
It's tasty.

782
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:42,905
Please cook this for me again.

783
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,425
Did Li Dai know you have a beef
with Qiu Jianxiang

784
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,266
when she asked you

785
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:53,225
to be the expert witness?

786
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:54,346
She did.

787
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:55,945
Why did she ask you for the favour then?

788
00:36:56,786 --> 00:36:58,425
She must be making use of your sympathy

789
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:00,026
saying that you're the only one

790
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:01,306
in this world to help him

791
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:02,465
and how pitiful Qiu is

792
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:03,506
as he might be living behind bars

793
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:04,586
for the rest of his life.

794
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:06,346
She then asked you
to repay the evil with your kindness

795
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,026
so that you can be someone

796
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:10,185
who's holy and virtuous.

797
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:12,266
You know her quite well.

798
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:12,986
Of course, I do.

799
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:13,786
Just reject her

800
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:15,185
and give her no chance.

801
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:17,225
Besides, Qiu Jianxiang

802
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:18,786
probably deserves it. Serve him right.

803
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:20,746
It's not his fault this time.

804
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:22,506
He's wrongly accused.

805
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:24,546
Really?

806
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:26,266
You're not the one to save him, though.

807
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:28,106
I'm the only one who can help him.

808
00:37:30,786 --> 00:37:31,465
Did you say yes?

809
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:33,306
Not yet.

810
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:35,786
It's fine.

811
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:36,385
Anyway,

812
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:37,786
don't feel stressed.

813
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:38,786
No matter what decision you make,

814
00:37:38,905 --> 00:37:39,665
I'll support you.

815
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:43,546
What if I turn him down?

816
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:44,465
Sure.

817
00:37:47,026 --> 00:37:48,346
It was him who harm you

818
00:37:48,506 --> 00:37:49,106
for being unemployed for years

819
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:50,586
and endure such a big hit.

820
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,945
Over the years,

821
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,986
he didn't lend you a helping hand

822
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:56,026
when you were suffering

823
00:37:56,225 --> 00:37:57,026
in desperation,

824
00:37:57,306 --> 00:37:58,986
why would you help him?

825
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:04,625
You're a decent man

826
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:05,905
when you don't hit him hard now.

827
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:07,625
A man should be vindictive.

828
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:08,625
Good one.

829
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:12,586
What if I accept his request?

830
00:38:14,385 --> 00:38:14,986
Sure, too.

831
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:16,225
It shows that you're

832
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:17,546
big-hearted and generous

833
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:19,665
and you have a kind soul
who doesn't hold grudges.

834
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:22,266
You're generous to forgive
those who've framed you before.

835
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,465
You have a high-principled conscience.

836
00:38:29,346 --> 00:38:30,066
Anyway,

837
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:31,905
don't feel pressured

838
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:33,945
no matter what you do.

839
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,546
Follow your heart
and be yourself.

840
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,066
You promised if I didn't expose you

841
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,026
and you'd have Yang Hua to help me.

842
00:38:46,546 --> 00:38:47,586
Apart from reviewing the documents,

843
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:49,546
he'll also be the expert witness.

844
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:50,465
This is what you promised.

845
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:56,786
I want to make some amendments
to what I said.

846
00:38:58,106 --> 00:38:59,306
There are times

847
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,026
when we should be righteous

848
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:02,905
to fight against evil.

849
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:15,425
Why are you staring at me?

850
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:18,905
Say it. What has happened?

851
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:22,185
Nothing.

852
00:39:25,185 --> 00:39:26,066
Well, I'll own up.

853
00:39:26,306 --> 00:39:27,506
I was threatened

854
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,945
when I met with Li Dai.

855
00:39:30,306 --> 00:39:31,385
But, I was sincere

856
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:33,865
when I told you to be yourself.

857
00:39:35,385 --> 00:39:36,746
It's just that I think

858
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:40,865
it'll be good if you be the witness.

859
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:47,066
You're tired now.

860
00:39:47,266 --> 00:39:48,786
I'll do the washing.

861
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:50,705
Alright, I'll go sleeping.

862
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:52,986
Don't play tricks on me

863
00:39:52,986 --> 00:39:54,145
like how you trick others.

864
00:39:54,346 --> 00:39:54,905
Make your stance clear

865
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:56,066
before you talk to me.

866
00:39:59,986 --> 00:40:01,786
What's wrong with you?

867
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,106
It's rare for me to let my guard down

868
00:40:04,306 --> 00:40:06,705
and be frank with you with pure sincerity.

869
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:07,986
How could you

870
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:09,986
be so indifferent?

871
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:11,786
I'm not going to wash the plates then.

872
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,940
(Work well)

873
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:35,266
(Work well)
Be relaxed in your work.

874
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:03,786
What did you just say?
Say it again.

875
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:06,225
I told the director

876
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:07,306
that I'm not going anywhere.

877
00:41:07,786 --> 00:41:08,306
In the remaining time

878
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:09,826
of four months and twenty-eight days,

879
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:11,346
I return to my original post

880
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:12,266
and continue my work.

881
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:15,266
Oh, please.

882
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:16,546
You rejected the investment department

883
00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:18,786
which's the fourth level?

884
00:41:20,346 --> 00:41:21,665
I didn't come here to work,

885
00:41:21,865 --> 00:41:22,746
I came here for the provident fund.

886
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:23,746
What about me?

887
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:24,945
What do you mean?

888
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:27,266
I'm here to pursue my career.

889
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,185
I haven't been promoted
for the last five years.

890
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:31,346
Take me to the investment department with you.

891
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:32,986
But you know nothing about investing.

892
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:33,826
Why do you go there?

893
00:41:33,986 --> 00:41:34,826
But you do.

894
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:37,026
I do but it doesn't concern you.

895
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:41,945
Gosh, I'm screwed.

896
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:43,586
I told my wife

897
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:45,185
that I'd be promoted
and my salary will raise.

898
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:48,066
You want a promotion and a high salary?

899
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:58,465
Well, please go on.

900
00:42:03,026 --> 00:42:04,145
Something's up now.

901
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:05,145
- I'll get back to you later.
- Tell me

902
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:06,185
why did you look my client up

903
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:07,465
behind my back?

904
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:08,506
Answer me.

905
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:18,826
Feifei.

906
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:19,746
About this,

907
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:20,586
please listen to me.

908
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:22,826
Listen to you?

909
00:42:23,586 --> 00:42:24,986
So, it turns out
you knew about this too.

910
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:27,225
The pair of you!

911
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:28,465
It was me who asked Miss Qin
to look the client up

912
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:30,346
and I gave her the material.

913
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:36,586
Qin Shi.

914
00:42:36,865 --> 00:42:37,986
I knew you were someone

915
00:42:38,145 --> 00:42:39,465
who resorted to every possible means
for the case.

916
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:41,346
I didn't expect
that you could be so disgraceful

917
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:43,066
and manipulate Tao Junhui.

918
00:42:43,306 --> 00:42:44,945
How could you be so shameless?

919
00:42:53,185 --> 00:42:55,145
Wu Fei, we're in the firm now.

920
00:42:55,346 --> 00:42:56,066
This is not your home.

921
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:57,945
You're a lawyer,

922
00:42:58,106 --> 00:42:58,986
not a shrew.

923
00:42:59,106 --> 00:43:00,106
Law studies

924
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:01,266
taught you to swear without vulgar words

925
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:02,465
instead of tossing things.

926
00:43:02,986 --> 00:43:03,945
What's the problem
if I manipulated Tao Junhui?

927
00:43:04,546 --> 00:43:04,986
You can ask him

928
00:43:04,986 --> 00:43:06,026
whether he's willing to listen to me.

929
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:08,385
Feifei, let's leave.

930
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:09,346
Leave me alone.

931
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:10,066
Qin Shi.

932
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:12,586
Let go of me.
Who are you calling a shrew?

933
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:13,826
She wasn't calling you that.

934
00:43:16,106 --> 00:43:17,066
It's not what you think.

935
00:43:17,225 --> 00:43:17,746
I've asked you

936
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:18,865
to cooperate with
the public relation department

937
00:43:19,145 --> 00:43:19,945
and never let Qin Shi

938
00:43:20,145 --> 00:43:21,145
to interfere in this.

939
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:22,625
Why didn't you listen to me?

940
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:24,865
Why did you investigate the client
secretly?

941
00:43:27,465 --> 00:43:28,066
Calm down.

942
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:29,346
Tao Junhui, don't ever try

943
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:30,905
to convince me with those craps.
