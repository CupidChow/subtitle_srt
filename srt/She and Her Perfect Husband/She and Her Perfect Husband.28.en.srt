=Episode 28=

19
00:01:58,106 --> 00:02:00,026
We've got a lot of talents
in our law firm.

20
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:01,066
Is there no one

21
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:02,585
who can talk about investment
with Hu Ping?

22
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,145
Even if we can't make a deal
this time,

23
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:07,346
we can take it as a chance
to show our company strength.

24
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:09,225
If Hu Ping is really

25
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:10,546
as amazing as advertised,

26
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:12,705
he should be able to identify it.

27
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:16,546
Funding is consensual

28
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:17,865
instead of a hard sell.

29
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:21,065
Before the case ends,

30
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:23,985
I guess he won't reveal any clues to us.

31
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,546
Therefore,

32
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:27,266
all we have to do is to try our best

33
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:30,145
and wait for the result
with a peaceful mind.

34
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:31,785
Hold on.

35
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:35,345
I think

36
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,106
I have a person in mind.

37
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,466
I, Qin Shi, have been devoting myself
to the company diligently

38
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,705
and seeking justice
for the people and world.

39
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,865
Please grant me a big case.

(2103 Followers @Qin Shi)
and my wish comes true.

42
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,380
(Hui)

43
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,026
Hello, I'm Qin Shi.

44
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:09,425
It's me.

45
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,466
Come to my office now.

46
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:13,946
Sure.

47
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,306
I've been thinking about
this for a while.

48
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:19,225
I suppose only Yang Hua

49
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,466
can do me this favour.

50
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,666
He majored in this profession

51
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:25,225
and had worked in
an international investment company

52
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:26,425
for a couple of years.

53
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:28,666
Besides, he's travelled
across the world.

54
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:30,985
Perhaps he might've met Hu Ping before.

55
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,065
He's the only one who has an edge

56
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:34,585
to deal with someone like Hu Ping.

57
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:36,186
Qin Shi.

58
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,145
I'd like to ask Yang Hua
to do me this favour.

59
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,785
(Gosh.)

60
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:42,466
(The man with real skills
is going to meet the fake one.)

61
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:43,906
(No doubt he'll be exposed.)

62
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,546
Yang Hua has left

63
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,505
the industry for some time.

64
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:53,666
Besides,

65
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:55,785
he returned home from overseas

66
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:56,906
as he encountered some problems at work.

67
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:58,666
I don't want to rub it in.

68
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:00,306
So,

69
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:02,466
he might not be able
to do you the favour.

70
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:05,225
This reason

71
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,186
might seem convincing.

72
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,026
If I know nothing about you,

73
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,666
probably I'll just buy it.

74
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:13,145
Little fox,

75
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,546
tell me what's your condition.

76
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:17,305
I'm fine with offering you
some customers and resources.

77
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:20,025
I meant it. Why don't you believe in me?

78
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:21,625
I didn't ask for that.

79
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:22,785
I'm content with what I have now.

80
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:25,465
Are you sick?

81
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:27,745
You're just fine.

82
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:29,065
Are you the Qin Shi

83
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:30,345
I used to know?

84
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:33,465
Did you say so

85
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:35,025
because I've been pressing you
previously?

86
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:37,345
No.

87
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:39,866
What about this?

88
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,065
Tonight,

89
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,785
bring Yang Hua to the dinner.

90
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,305
We just don't want Hu Ping to be bored.

91
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,745
I'll talk to him

92
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:49,586
about the matters of the firm.

93
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,706
Regarding the case of He Dongna,

94
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:56,266
Tao Junhui and you
will take charge of it together.

95
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:57,386
What do you say?

96
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,100
(Beijing)

97
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:10,905
Mr. Yang.

98
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:16,946
May I have a word with you?

99
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,740
(Beijing)

100
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,410
(Cordyceps sinensis)

101
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:28,266
What?

102
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:30,305
Are you going out somewhere?

103
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:32,106
What about the company?

104
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,785
You're taking care of it, aren't you?

105
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:34,905
What do I do then?

106
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:37,065
You're doing great.

107
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:38,025
That's right.

108
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:39,146
Look at mom's new jewellery,

109
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,065
earrings and necklace.

110
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:40,785
They're gorgeous.

111
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:41,465
Gorgeous.

112
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,785
She doesn't look like her age
when wearing them.

113
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,025
She looks younger.

114
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:46,025
Besides, Meimei

115
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,706
has been working every day

116
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,106
since she married me

117
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,225
and never rest.

118
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:51,386
Therefore, we decided

119
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:52,986
to go for the second honeymoon.

120
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:54,305
Is that okay?

121
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:58,905
Right. I agree.

122
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:01,065
It's true that you two

123
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:02,266
have worked really hard previously

124
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:03,345
and you should go on travelling.

125
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,025
I mean it.

126
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,345
You should go out
to enjoy yourselves and relax.

127
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,946
Also, you should give birth
to my grandson

128
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,785
as soon as possible.

129
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:12,185
Mom.

130
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,905
Meimei and I have talked
about this before.

131
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:16,866
Both of us are satisfied with our current life

132
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:18,225
and we're not anxious about
having a child for the time being.

133
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:21,426
You don't want a child?

134
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:23,745
Whose idea is this?

135
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:25,546
Do you agree with this too?

136
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:27,065
Mom.

137
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,546
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:33,106
I can't fulfil
what we promised before.

139
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:35,666
I don't want the shares.

140
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:36,905
I just want

141
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:37,986
to lead a good life with Wenyu.

142
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,625
Previously, I was preoccupied with work

143
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:40,866
and I had neglected him.

144
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:42,065
Let me make it up to you.

145
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:43,386
You have to make up for me.

146
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,146
- You ought to.
- Good boy.

147
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:47,586
Qin Wenyu, you little brat.

148
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:48,706
What do you think about this?

149
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:50,345
Don't you want anything too?

150
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:51,465
Mom.

151
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,546
I can't abandon my wife

152
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:55,146
just for the money, right?

153
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:57,345
My wife is the most important person to me.

154
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,266
You're the most important one.

155
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:03,505
Enough.

156
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:05,065
I can see that.

157
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:07,625
The two of you actually gang up

158
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:08,826
to tackle me, right?

159
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:10,345
Mom.

160
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:12,025
Why would we do that?

161
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:12,946
We're family.

162
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:14,106
Don't blame Meimei for this.

163
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,185
It's my idea.

164
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:17,146
I still see myself as a kid.

165
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:18,266
Why would I want another kid?

166
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:19,586
I can't manage to be a good father.

167
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:22,305
My priority now

168
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:24,586
is to be a good husband.

169
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:26,546
So, you don't have to pry into us

170
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:27,666
from now on.

171
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,266
You're just worried for nothing.

172
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:30,666
How could you say that to your mother?

173
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,345
I'm just telling the truth.

174
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:33,465
You should say it politely.

175
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:34,706
Fine, I'll say it politely.

176
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:37,745
Scram.

177
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:39,345
Hurry up.

178
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:40,706
The pair of you,
just get out of my way.

179
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:42,185
Go wherever you want.

180
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:43,225
Never appear before me again.

181
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:44,905
Mom asked us to scram.

182
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:46,146
- She asked us to scram.
- You!

183
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:47,146
Where should we go?

184
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:47,826
Where?

185
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:48,986
I go where you go.

186
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:50,106
But I don't know where to go.

187
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:51,106
Where?

188
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,025
Mr. Yang.

189
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:25,905
Please help me.

190
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,785
I'm in a pickle now.

191
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,826
Only you can help me.

192
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,305
What do you need from me?

193
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:35,545
Mr. Yang.

194
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:38,586
Can you cut me some slack
to the investment department?

195
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:41,226
You want to go to
the investment department?

196
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,625
I know I'm lacking.

197
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:50,146
I'll improve myself.

198
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:51,946
As long as you're willing to guide me,

199
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,386
I'll strive to learn.

200
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:55,266
I've registered for

201
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:56,146
the Chartered Financial Analyst exam.

202
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:58,826
I'll get the certificate for level one
by the end of this year.

203
00:08:59,266 --> 00:08:59,946
Please, Mr. Yang.

204
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:01,505
The entry level of
the investment department is eighth.

205
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:02,386
But now you're only at the tenth.

206
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,185
Do you think you're qualified for that?

207
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:05,185
Also, what makes you think

208
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:05,985
that I'll guide you?

209
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,625
I don't even go to
the investment department, though.

210
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:09,146
Besides, you make this request

211
00:09:09,185 --> 00:09:09,745
to a person from a different department

212
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:11,146
and you've violated the company rules.

213
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:16,985
Mr. Yang.

214
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:19,545
I knew something about you.

215
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:20,946
What's it that you knew?

216
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:23,185
Yongli 21 incident.

217
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,906
Even though the news didn't mention

218
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,665
about the fund manager
who led to that massive problem,

219
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:38,185
I know it was you.

220
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:40,065
The timeline of your resignation

221
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:41,706
and that incident fits.

222
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,185
So?

223
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,625
Mr. Yang, no one is perfect.

224
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,706
Every one of us makes a mistake.

225
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,346
Therefore,

226
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:55,386
we all are entitled

227
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:56,545
to correct the mistake we made.

228
00:09:58,346 --> 00:09:59,105
Just like you.

229
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:01,425
Humans make a mistake

230
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:02,505
and therefore,

231
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,266
we have to pay for the mistake.

232
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:06,386
Regarding your request,
that's your own business.

233
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,786
Thank you for the coffee.

234
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:35,425
Didn't I ask you to wait at the cafe?

235
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:36,185
Why did you come out?

236
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:37,946
I thought you'd be arriving soon,

237
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:39,386
so, I came out.

238
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,346
Find a place and change your clothes.

239
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:42,026
What's this for?

240
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:44,826
There's an important dinner tonight.

241
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:46,505
Yihui asked me to bring you along.

242
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:47,386
Bring me along?

243
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:49,545
You'll see it later.

244
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,706
Do those in the bank
put you on the spot again?

245
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:52,745
No one dares.

246
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,665
What do you mean? Are you mocking me

247
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:55,745
that I'm a tigress?

248
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:57,906
I didn't say that.

249
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,026
If I were a tigress,

250
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:00,745
what would you be then?

251
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:01,665
Never think that you're the breeder.

252
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,266
The king of the beasts

253
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:06,266
doesn't need a breeder though.

254
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:07,386
Anyway,

255
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:09,545
it seems good

256
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:10,586
living under the protection
of a tigress.

257
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:11,985
Yuck.

258
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:28,625
That's right.

259
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:31,706
I referred to this analysis report

260
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,425
when I made the decision at that time.

261
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,305
I've handed over this analysis report

262
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:38,665
to three security experts.

263
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:41,826
All of them firmly proposed

264
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:43,386
not to sell off the shares.

265
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,305
It's ill-advised
to sell off all the shares

266
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,786
when the company

267
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,386
possessed a promising future.

268
00:11:51,665 --> 00:11:52,266
However,

269
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,745
a majority shareholder like you

270
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:56,745
chose to sell off eighty per cent
of them

271
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:58,226
just in one month.

272
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,505
As far as I can tell,

273
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:01,665
there was a conflict sparkled

274
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,185
in your company.

275
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:06,826
May I know on what basis

276
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:08,466
did you make this decision?

277
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:12,665
I made this decision

278
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:14,505
according to my thirty years of
experience dealing with this industry.

279
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:17,425
As for the so-called experts,

280
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:18,665
what do you think they'd know?

281
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,386
They're merely

282
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:22,105
a bunch of fraudulent con artists.

283
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:24,505
Instead of believing them,

284
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:26,105
it's better to believe

285
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:28,786
those women who buy vegetables
in the market.

286
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,665
The stock surged up to thirty per cent

287
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:36,346
after you cleared yours.

288
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:39,266
If you were to answer

289
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,745
what you said just now
to the public prosecutor,

290
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,505
I can promise you

291
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,625
that we'd lose the case for sure.

292
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:54,105
I'm an investor, not a prophet.

293
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:55,865
It's out of the question for me
to estimate

294
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:57,425
all possible emergencies.

295
00:12:58,105 --> 00:12:59,946
I only made the right decision

296
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,706
in line with the data support
at that time.

297
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:03,745
The reason why I managed to dodge

298
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,985
the stock market crashes of 1998 and 2008

299
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:08,586
was because of my experience.

300
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,545
If you determined

301
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,105
that I took black money
and play illegal tricks,

302
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:15,586
I welcome you to look me up.

303
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:18,026
This isn't the first time

304
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,786
I've been suspected and interrogated.

305
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:20,906
Look what has happened to me.

306
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:22,946
Over the past thirty years,

307
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:25,745
I still stand firmly in this circle.

308
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:26,906
What do you think is the reason?

309
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:28,625
It's because I, Qiu Jianxiang

310
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:29,786
am a clean investor.

311
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:31,625
I don't fear that
if they want to investigate me.

312
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:47,105
Previously,

313
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,786
most stocks you sold off

314
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,425
were absorbed by a private placement,

315
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:53,386
named Qilin Foundation.

316
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:55,346
By that time,
it was only established two years

317
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:57,386
and most of the product are worthless.

318
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,146
Its fund manager

319
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,425
was someone obscure in the industry.

320
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:02,305
May I know

321
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:05,386
how was that possible

322
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:09,786
for them to luck out and pick

323
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:11,545
the potential surging stocks

324
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:13,745
amongst all the stocks?

325
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:17,425
I don't know.

326
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:32,586
Mr. Qiu.

327
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:36,146
The reason why you're under indictment

328
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,505
was because this foundation

329
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:40,065
was being interrogated by
Securities Regulatory Commission

330
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,226
due to illegal trading business.

331
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,545
The person in charge
of the foundation said

332
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:47,146
the stock purchase

333
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,185
was on a mutual agreement.

334
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:50,386
And for this,

335
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:53,065
they've paid you money.

336
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:55,985
How much money did they tell you
that they paid me?

337
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,305
Eight hundred thousand.

338
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:58,706
United States dollar?

339
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:01,826
Chinese Yuan?

340
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,586
Oh, my. What a king's ransom.

341
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:12,425
Do you know

342
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:16,266
how much money
I deal with every day?

343
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:18,706
The money I've seen

344
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,545
is way more innumerable
than the road you've walked.

345
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:21,865
Would I, Qiu Jianxiang

346
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,865
give up on thousands of millions
of interest

347
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,706
merely for eight hundred thousand?

348
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:27,346
That's hilarious.

349
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:29,026
How amusing.

350
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:31,105
Miss Li.

351
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,946
Don't you ever think

352
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:35,586
they're framing me?

353
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:43,505
Mr. Qiu.

354
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:47,105
I'm not seeking the truth,

355
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:49,505
I'm helping you to gain
the biggest probability

356
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:50,745
of winning the case.

357
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:52,266
Judging by the current situation,

358
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:56,026
their story is more convincing than ours.

359
00:15:57,985 --> 00:15:59,266
If you still refuse

360
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:02,146
to be honest with me,

361
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,625
you should at least

362
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:06,425
give me a trustable reason

363
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:10,625
or get someone who can help you.

364
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:14,146
Otherwise,

365
00:16:16,146 --> 00:16:17,665
it's out of my depth to help you.

366
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,266
Miss Li.

367
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:36,946
I've never accepted the black money

368
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,586
and I'd never conduct

369
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:40,026
such a silly act.

370
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:42,745
What I've done is
to make the correct decision.

371
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,105
If you ask me who can vouch for me,

372
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:49,545
I'm afraid there's only one person

373
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:50,466
in this world

374
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,865
who can understand why I did so.

375
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:54,466
However,

376
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,226
I suppose he won't help me.

377
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:09,545
Yang Hua.

378
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:10,986
Have you thought about

379
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:12,025
getting your old job back?

380
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:13,946
What's it?

381
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,905
Being a fund manager
in the finance company.

382
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:19,346
No.

383
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,145
Don't you think it's a shame?

384
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:24,545
For what?

385
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,506
Think about this.

386
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:28,785
You've studied so much

387
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:30,946
and you're gifted and intelligent.

388
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,025
Despite having these,

389
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,425
you're leading a normal life now.

390
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:34,946
Don't you think

391
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:36,305
the effort you've made
has turned futile?

392
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:38,746
Reading is my hobby.

393
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,145
As for the good test result,

394
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:41,986
I think it's because the questions

395
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,185
don't seem difficult to me.

396
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:47,946
I'm just thinking

397
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:49,866
that your wisdom and knowledge have wasted.

398
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:52,265
How could you say they're wasted?

399
00:17:52,665 --> 00:17:54,466
Isn't that being smart

400
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:57,145
is to make our life easier?

401
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,385
On the contrary,
the more desire you have

402
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:02,226
the higher the social cost
you have to pay.

403
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,065
Including your time and your health.

404
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:05,746
When you come around to this,

405
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:07,065
you won't think

406
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:09,305
that being that twenty percent
higher class

407
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:10,466
is something worthy.

408
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:12,385
Well, have you ever thought

409
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:13,385
of using your wisdom and knowledge

410
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:14,466
to do something?

411
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:17,785
To influence society

412
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:18,785
or to leave something useful
for the world.

413
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:19,905
That's the concern

414
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:20,826
of those successful people.

415
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:21,665
But I'm not one of one.

416
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:22,746
I'm just a common person.

417
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,305
Why not? You can be one of them.

418
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,740
(Li Dai)

419
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:34,385
It's almost time. Let's go.

420
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,060
(Annual Investor Award Ceremony)

421
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:31,145
Is it here?

422
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:37,065
Qin Shi.

423
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,106
Hi.

424
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:41,346
Let's go.

425
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:47,346
James.

426
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:50,065
It's been a while.

427
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,106
Why did she come here?

428
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,385
You look refreshed

429
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:53,265
and more gorgeous.

430
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:55,506
They said
'absence makes the heart grow fonder'.

431
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:56,746
That's very true.

432
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:58,025
You look more like a married couple

433
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:00,385
when both of you stand together.

434
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:01,425
Hui.

435
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:03,145
I didn't know

436
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:04,305
they'd be so many people here.

437
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:06,586
I forgot to tell you.

438
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:09,065
Mr. Jin and Mr. Chen have to go on
a business trip out of a sudden.

439
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:10,986
So, Madam Tang wants Yang Hua

440
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:12,025
to be the lobbyist today.

441
00:20:12,905 --> 00:20:14,466
How could she make the two
to be lobbyists?

442
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:17,025
This pair is stealing the thunder.

443
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:22,145
You're supposed to be the man of honour today.

444
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:24,986
My dad and I have put in so much effort
to set up this event

445
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,425
not to be their stepping stone.

446
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:29,586
Even though we prepared the venue here,

447
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,425
it was hard to get the entry ticket though.

448
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:32,905
Wu Fei has gotten the tickets for us.

449
00:20:33,185 --> 00:20:35,425
My husband Jin is resting at home

450
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:36,905
to give you a place.

451
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:38,145
Hence,

452
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,905
you must get it together tonight.

453
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:41,545
Don't be angry.

454
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:43,626
It's fine as long as
I'm the man of honour to you.

455
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:44,305
Come on.

456
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:46,866
Let's go say hi to Mr. Hu, alright?

457
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:50,706
Both of you must do your best tonight.

458
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,185
I thought

459
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:55,425
we hosted the dinner for Mr. Hu.

460
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,025
I'd love to if I could.

461
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:58,905
Anyway,

462
00:20:59,106 --> 00:21:00,425
it's good as things
have turned out this way.

463
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,065
It's a rare chance

464
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:04,145
to meet with so many elites
of the investment community.

465
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:06,866
Do you smell that?

466
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:10,665
The air is filled

467
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:12,466
with the smell of money.

468
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,106
Stop it.

469
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:16,586
Please excuse me, Yang Hua.

470
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:18,065
I'm sorry about that.

471
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,665
I suppose you can adapt to this occasion

472
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:21,986
better than we do.

473
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:24,145
Maybe you can meet

474
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:25,265
your ex-colleagues here.

475
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:25,746
If you meet them,

476
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,986
please introduce them to me.

477
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:37,265
Thank you.

478
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:40,185
Are you nervous?

479
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:44,065
You're nervous?

480
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:46,826
It'll be alright. Relax.

481
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:48,506
Just put on a smile. Like me.

482
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:49,586
It'll be alright.

483
00:21:49,946 --> 00:21:50,905
Don't worry

484
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:51,466
that you'll be exposed.

485
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:52,746
Relax. Act natural.

486
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:54,065
Act natural.

487
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,626
But you seem unnatural.

488
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:56,986
Do I?

489
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:00,665
Let's go home then.

490
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:02,305
I'll tell them
that I have a stomach ache.

491
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:04,106
No, you pretend to be sick

492
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:04,905
and I send you home.

493
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:07,025
I'm fine,
why should I pretend?

494
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:08,545
You...

495
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,025
You're allergic to crowds, aren't you?

496
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:12,185
You can't stand

497
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:12,866
when they're up to six people.

498
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,305
There are more than six people now.

499
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:17,946
Why do you look rather calm?

500
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:20,065
You must be freaking out inside, right?

501
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,586
Are you alright?

502
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:23,506
Yes. Don't worry about me.

503
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:24,665
We're not here

504
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:26,025
to trick anyone and cheat them
out of their money.

505
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,466
Though my identity is fake,

506
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:28,905
my experience is genuine.

507
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:30,665
Look at them.

508
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:31,545
All of them

509
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:32,986
look like elites from the outside.

510
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:33,785
However,

511
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,025
nothing is great about them.

512
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:36,946
In fact, they're the elites

513
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:38,305
of bluffing and conning.

514
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:42,626
Tonight, all you need to do
is to put on a smile.

515
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,586
As for the rest,

516
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:45,545
leave it to me.

517
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:51,185
Hi, long time no see.

518
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:53,425
Have we met before?

519
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:54,665
Oh my god.

520
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:55,706
You forgot me.

521
00:22:57,346 --> 00:22:57,866
Sorry?

522
00:22:57,866 --> 00:22:59,626
The night in New York,

523
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:00,946
you got drunk.

524
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:04,385
It was me who took you home.

525
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:06,106
Oh, I see.

526
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:07,385
It was you.

527
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:09,065
I thought it was Roger.

528
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:09,946
Yes, it was me.

529
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:11,946
This is my wife.

530
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:16,185
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

531
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:20,305
Please look out for us.

532
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:22,545
You flattered me.

533
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:30,265
You've finally come, Dongna.

534
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:31,866
Sorry for being late.

535
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:32,866
Dongha.

536
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:33,785
I was having an interview just now.

537
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:34,425
I'm worn out.

538
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:35,746
What do you like to eat?

539
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:37,385
I eat anything except meat.

540
00:23:38,145 --> 00:23:39,185
Go take the food for her.

541
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:40,425
You must've worked very hard.

542
00:23:40,706 --> 00:23:42,065
It's my job, isn't it?

543
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:42,905
As compared to the rest,

544
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:44,145
it's not trouble work to do.

545
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:45,746
Sorry, Madam Tang.

546
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,385
I feel bad to tell you this.

547
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:48,626
What has happened?

548
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:49,545
Hu can't make it today.

549
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:50,506
Something has come up.

550
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:52,185
He has to go to Hong Kong, China
for an emergency event.

551
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:53,866
He made this decision just now.

552
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:55,065
As for the award later,

553
00:23:55,265 --> 00:23:56,185
the vice president of the company

554
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:56,665
will accept it on his behalf.

555
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:59,025
Well, you've prepared a grand dinner
to meet him,

556
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:00,626
yet it's wasted.

557
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:02,545
Dongna, don't be so courteous.

558
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:06,425
We have many chances to meet Hu later.

559
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:08,665
Anyway,

560
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,385
Hu's aware of what you ask for.

561
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:11,506
You can interact

562
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:12,665
with the vice president too.

563
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:14,346
Most of the investment projects

564
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:15,826
depend on his call now.

565
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:17,506
That's great.

566
00:24:17,785 --> 00:24:19,185
Come on, take a seat.

567
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:20,346
Have a seat, Dongna.

568
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:27,986
Here's your food.

569
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:28,746
Thank you.

570
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:33,960
It's been a while, Mr. Wang.

571
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:34,665
Hello, it's been a while.

572
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,025
This way.

573
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:36,545
Mr. Wang.

574
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:38,265
It's been a while.

575
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:39,305
Hello, hope you enjoy the event.

576
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:48,106
James.

577
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,305
James Yang.

578
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:07,305
Do you know

579
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:08,586
if I didn't stop

580
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,185
the reporters
from bringing up your name,

581
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:11,425
you would've been doomed?

582
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:12,746
What you need to do now

583
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:13,946
is to shut your mouth.

584
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:16,785
That's how things go
in the press.

585
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:18,185
This topic won't last for long.

586
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:19,986
We can start everything anew later.

587
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:22,986
I've been through these a lot.

588
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:25,545
I, Qiu Jianxiang have never been scared
of anything before.

589
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:29,946
This is my resignation letter

590
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:32,106
and all of the commission.

591
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:33,106
I've booked a flight ticket

592
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:33,986
and I'm going to leave later.

593
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:37,226
Don't you ever think

594
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:38,506
you can continue in this industry
by yourself.

595
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:39,586
I'm telling you

596
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:41,466
if you step out of the door,

597
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:42,106
from now onwards,

598
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,746
you can never be
in the security industry anymore.

599
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:48,425
James.

600
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:53,506
Are you leaving?

601
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:56,025
What a shame.

602
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:57,706
But, I have to say

603
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:00,905
that you made the right decision
to leave now.

604
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:04,506
When the board question me later,

605
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:05,425
I'll tell them

606
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,826
that the mass purchasing
of Xinhua Biology's shares

607
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:09,385
is your decision.

608
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:12,385
You're leaving, anyway.

609
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:13,946
It's fine for you to take the fall.

610
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,826
After all, someone who's about to leave

611
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:18,425
is in no place to speak for themselves.

612
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:21,226
Very good.

613
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:22,946
I'm not going to hit back.

614
00:26:25,226 --> 00:26:26,626
However, I'd like to tell you something, James.

615
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:28,305
In this room,

616
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,305
there are cameras.

617
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:35,185
The punishment
for intentional torts isn't light.

618
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:54,626
This food

619
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:55,986
is all decided by Feifei.

620
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:57,626
The necklace you're wearing

621
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,506
- is so beautiful.
- You've done a great job.

622
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:00,145
Feifei.

623
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:01,545
You've lost weight, haven't you?

624
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:02,265
Have I?

625
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:03,106
Yes.

626
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:05,626
You're on a diet?

627
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:09,185
Mr. Wang.

628
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:11,626
Do you know Yang?

629
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:12,785
I do.

630
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:14,305
We were colleagues before.

631
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:15,466
James,

632
00:27:16,106 --> 00:27:16,785
Yang Hua,

633
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:18,826
is the most talented fund manager

634
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:19,706
I've seen before.

635
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,746
How long has it been
since we last met?

636
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:24,746
It's about five years, I think.

637
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:26,706
You met each other before?

638
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,226
I can't believe what I see now.

639
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:31,346
This brat

640
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:33,425
looks exactly the same as
he used to be.

641
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:34,586
He doesn't change a little.

642
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:36,025
Otherwise, I can't recognise him

643
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:36,986
at the first glance.

644
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:43,145
Mr. Wang.

645
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:44,746
Do you mean you were colleagues

646
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:46,185
in Hengli before?

647
00:27:46,385 --> 00:27:46,785
Yes.

648
00:27:49,106 --> 00:27:50,425
Do you know Qiu Jianxiang?

649
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:51,425
Of course.

650
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:53,385
Mr. Qiu is my teacher.

651
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:54,905
He taught me all the knowledge

652
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:55,905
so that I managed

653
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:56,946
to survive in the investment
and finance circle.

654
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:58,265
While James

655
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:00,466
is his last student.

656
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:02,346
Besides, Mr. Qiu

657
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:03,466
imparted all of his knowledge to him.

658
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:07,866
I can't believe

659
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:08,466
that both of you

660
00:28:08,545 --> 00:28:10,025
are students of Mr. Qiu.

661
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:11,425
What a small world!

662
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,506
Come on.
Let's raise our glasses for this.

663
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:14,425
Of course.

664
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:14,866
Come on.

665
00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:16,506
To the unexpected reunion

666
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:18,185
of James and me.

667
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:18,905
Also,

668
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:20,506
to the collaboration with Cheng & Hui.

669
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:22,106
Cheers.

670
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:22,946
Cheers.

671
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:23,706
Mr. Wang.

672
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:25,545
Cheers.

673
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:26,626
I'm sorry.

674
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:27,506
I'm feeling unwell.

675
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:28,545
Please excuse me.

676
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:36,466
Mr. Wang.

677
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:37,626
It's my pleasure to meet you.

678
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:38,226
It's my pleasure too.

679
00:28:38,506 --> 00:28:39,226
I'm delighted.

680
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:03,626
Mr. Yang.

681
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:04,986
I knew something about you.

682
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:07,586
Yongli 21 incident.

683
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:11,706
When the board question me later,

684
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:12,665
I'll tell them

685
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:14,545
that the mass purchasing
of Xinhua Biology's shares

686
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:16,305
is your decision.

687
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,260
(Yang Hua)

688
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:03,425
Who are you?

689
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:05,586
Hello, I'm Li Dai.

690
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:07,425
You're Yang Hua's father, right?

691
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:08,586
Yes, I am.

692
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:09,905
I'd like to talk

693
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,586
about Yang Hua with you.

694
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:12,305
May I?

695
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:14,905
Are you his friend?

696
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:16,106
Yes.

697
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:22,385
Also, I'm the attorney of Qiu Jianxiang.

698
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:26,545
Please come in.

699
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:27,305
Thank you.

700
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:37,626
Tianhang Hotel has yet to give us

701
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:38,905
an exact answer

702
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:40,226
since the press conference.

703
00:30:40,665 --> 00:30:41,826
But, I heard

704
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,746
that the higher-ups
are figuring out the option.

705
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:46,305
Also, someone is trying
to solve it quietly

706
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:47,425
by deploying personal connections.

707
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:49,506
I never accept

708
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:50,626
any forms of reconciliation

709
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:52,305
and their apology and compensation

710
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:53,626
must be open to the public.

711
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,665
Besides, I've told the media

712
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:57,346
that the compensation

713
00:30:57,586 --> 00:30:59,065
will be donated for charity.

714
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:00,065
Regarding this matter,

715
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:01,425
there's no room
for reaching a compromise.

716
00:31:02,506 --> 00:31:03,185
Dongna.

717
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:04,586
Cheng & Hui

718
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:06,185
will support you fully.

719
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,145
Miss Qin.

720
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,626
I heard that James

721
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:21,265
has been a househusband

722
00:31:21,466 --> 00:31:23,946
since he returned.

723
00:31:25,706 --> 00:31:27,946
He learnt from a great teacher
like Mr. Qiu

724
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:29,145
and he possesses

725
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:31,025
such an outstanding ability.

726
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:33,025
Isn't it a waste

727
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,385
to hide him in the house?

728
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:35,586
If possible,

729
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:37,506
I'll ask him out for a little chat.

730
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:38,826
Who knows

731
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:39,785
if we'll collaborate in the future?

732
00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:42,626
Sure. Hope so.

733
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:48,065
Mr. Wang.

734
00:31:48,665 --> 00:31:49,866
I heard that Qiu Jianxiang

735
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:51,626
is being interrogated recently.

736
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:53,106
Do you know about this?

737
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:55,305
Really?

738
00:31:55,785 --> 00:31:56,866
I just reached here the day before.

739
00:31:57,106 --> 00:31:58,106
What has happened to Mr. Qiu?

740
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:01,946
It's about the tunnelling

741
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:03,185
and has caused quite a stir.

742
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:04,785
It's been a hot topic in the media.

743
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:07,665
The finance circle

744
00:32:07,946 --> 00:32:09,466
is a place in constant danger.

745
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:10,905
Imagine there's a knife

746
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:12,305
hanging above our heads.

747
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:17,065
I heard that Mr. Qiu returned from Canada

748
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,506
because he lost a great fortune

749
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:20,905
from the foundation.

750
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:21,986
You know about this, right?

751
00:32:24,305 --> 00:32:26,425
Did James tell you about this too?

752
00:32:27,466 --> 00:32:29,106
There's no secret
between husband and wife.

753
00:32:30,106 --> 00:32:31,106
I heard

754
00:32:31,305 --> 00:32:33,586
it was because of the sudden selling-off
of Mingxing Foundation

755
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:36,265
which was related

756
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:38,025
to a young fund manager.

757
00:32:39,185 --> 00:32:40,986
I found it weird.

758
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,826
Since Hengli has experienced investors

759
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:46,466
like Mr. Qiu and you,

760
00:32:46,785 --> 00:32:48,425
why would they task a novice

761
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:52,065
to manage a huge foundation?

762
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:54,506
Is there any secret inside this?

763
00:32:55,545 --> 00:32:56,305
Miss Qin.

764
00:32:56,826 --> 00:32:57,986
Let me put it to you this way.

765
00:32:58,626 --> 00:32:59,385
At that time, Hengli

766
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:00,946
has a famous foundation,

767
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:02,226
that's Yongli 21,

768
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,025
and the most outstanding

769
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,065
fund manager of our company

770
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:06,866
was James.

771
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:08,826
He was able to raise
the annualised return

772
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:10,746
up to twenty per cent and above.

773
00:33:15,065 --> 00:33:17,506
It doesn't sound
like an impressive figure.

774
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:23,785
Regardless of the bull and bear markets,

775
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:25,586
he managed to raise it up
to over twenty per cent.

776
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:27,346
Isn't that amazing?

777
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:38,265
Mr. Wang.

778
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:41,385
Do you mean that the fund manager

779
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,986
who led Yongli 21 to liquidation

780
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:44,665
was Yang Hua?

781
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:46,265
Miss Wu.

782
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:48,106
I didn't say that.

783
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:55,665
Hey.

784
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:57,545
The man of honour should be Mr. Hu.

785
00:33:58,025 --> 00:33:59,706
We can't steal his thunder.

786
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:01,706
Come, let's congratulate Mr. Hu

787
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:02,665
for winning the title

788
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:03,986
as the Best Investor this year again.

789
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:05,706
Let's raise our glasses to Mrs. Hu,

790
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:07,025
Dongna.

791
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:07,706
- Cheers.
- Dongna.

792
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:08,105
Thank you.

793
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:09,986
Congratulations, Mr. Wang.

794
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:10,385
Thank you.

795
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:11,506
Feifei.

796
00:34:19,506 --> 00:34:20,425
Yes?

797
00:34:21,905 --> 00:34:22,946
I can't help you this time.

798
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:24,466
I need to go now.

799
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:25,946
You've taken the wine.

800
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:27,506
Don't drive.

801
00:34:28,145 --> 00:34:28,746
Call for a designated driver.

802
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:32,066
Where are you?

803
00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:35,946
Hello.

804
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:37,466
Hello.

805
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:50,706
Hui.

806
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:52,105
Well.

807
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,786
Yang Hua told me

808
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,385
that he was feeling unwell.

809
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:56,905
Really? Is it serious?

810
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:57,825
Do you want

811
00:34:57,825 --> 00:34:59,026
to send him to the hospital now?

812
00:34:59,185 --> 00:35:00,665
I need to check on him now.

813
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:01,786
- Sure.
- I'll get going.

814
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:02,625
Please excuse me.

815
00:35:02,905 --> 00:35:03,665
Enjoy your dinner.

816
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:04,506
It's fine.

817
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:06,185
Miss He, I need to go now.

818
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:07,185
I'll leave you all to it.

819
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:07,746
Bye-bye.

820
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:08,546
Take care.

821
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:10,306
I'm leaving first.

822
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:15,625
Mister.

823
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,266
Please pull over at the front.

824
00:36:38,026 --> 00:36:38,625
Why are you here?

825
00:36:42,306 --> 00:36:43,706
Are you feeling unwell?

826
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:45,226
Do you want to go to the hospital?

827
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:48,700
(Fight Club)

828
00:37:48,786 --> 00:37:49,825
(Chili Chill)
Ma'am, I'll get going.

829
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:50,026
(Chili Chill)

830
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:50,946
(Chili Chill)
Please come again.

831
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,546
Safe trip home.

832
00:38:02,786 --> 00:38:03,145
Here.

833
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:04,625
Less sesame sauce and more chilli.
As usual.

834
00:38:05,026 --> 00:38:05,905
The sesame sauce is over there.

835
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:06,746
Tell me if you need more.

836
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:07,865
The second child is attending
elementary school, right?

837
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:09,266
Yes, he starts this year.

838
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,665
It's been some time since you last came.

839
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:11,466
Enjoy your food.

840
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:12,105
Sure.

841
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,580
(Malatang)

842
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:17,145
I tell you what, the malatang here

843
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:18,706
is the most delicious
in Pujiang Poli-sci.

844
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,026
Hadn't the students

845
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:21,665
moved to the new campus,

846
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,665
we wouldn't have gotten a place here.

847
00:38:24,226 --> 00:38:25,066
Try

848
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:27,105
the sesame sauce.

849
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,145
And this. Add some of this too.

850
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:41,185
Taste the soup.

851
00:38:41,706 --> 00:38:43,345
It's different from other stores.

852
00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:44,786
Taste it.

853
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:53,345
It's good, right?

854
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:57,345
Try this too.

855
00:38:58,865 --> 00:38:59,345
This one.

856
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:06,986
Sliced potatoes.

857
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:14,345
That's too much for me.
You can have more.

858
00:39:16,425 --> 00:39:17,145
Previously,

859
00:39:17,345 --> 00:39:19,266
I got to survive
those torturous study nights

860
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,145
because of this hot malatang.

861
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:23,946
Let me tell you this.

862
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:24,585
There must be two people

863
00:39:24,825 --> 00:39:25,905
came here together
during my university time.

864
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:26,946
Do you know why?

865
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:29,306
Because there was
always a long queue here.

866
00:39:30,026 --> 00:39:31,746
One of us must come here to wait

867
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:33,226
and only got the seats
after forty minutes.

868
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:36,546
I heard that your campus

869
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:37,625
serve delicious food too.

870
00:39:37,946 --> 00:39:38,986
Take me there next time.

871
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:42,946
Let's eat.

872
00:39:58,345 --> 00:39:58,986
Is it spicy?

873
00:39:59,786 --> 00:40:00,385
Delicious.

874
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:18,466
Did you win any prizes?
Why are you so happy?

875
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:22,506
Seeing someone I loathe running off

876
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:23,865
really makes me thrilled.

877
00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:29,546
Mr. Wang is so interesting.

878
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:31,026
He's really interesting.

879
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:34,105
It seems the true colour

880
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,266
of the Great Yang Hua
will be exposed soon.

881
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,466
You better spend your energy

882
00:40:38,665 --> 00:40:39,786
on He Dongna's case

883
00:40:40,466 --> 00:40:41,385
rather than wasting your time

884
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:42,105
on both of them.

885
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:43,385
But I'm pleased to.

886
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:45,746
Regarding that matter,

887
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:46,986
they're two schools of thought.

888
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:47,905
One,

889
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:49,946
he's the student Qiu Jianxiang
most valued.

890
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:51,506
So, Qiu Jianxiang took the blame for him

891
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,306
to stop the media from reporting him

892
00:40:53,466 --> 00:40:54,226
to protect the student.

893
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:55,266
Another one

894
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:57,425
is that Qiu Jianxiang made this mistake

895
00:40:57,786 --> 00:40:58,746
and he had someone to be his scapegoat.

896
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:01,385
Which do you think is possible?

897
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:04,905
There is all hearsay without evidence

898
00:41:05,306 --> 00:41:06,145
and we know nothing

899
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:07,986
about what has happened then,

900
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:09,226
so I can't make a judgement.

901
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:10,145
That's right.

902
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:11,625
That's what I thought.

903
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:14,746
Hence, I went to ask Mr. Wang.

904
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:17,786
Miss Wu.

905
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:19,425
It seems you're curious

906
00:41:19,706 --> 00:41:20,746
about what has happened in the past.

907
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,585
I'm asking out of sheer curiosity.

908
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:25,066
I took finance

909
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:26,345
as an elective course back then.

910
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:28,466
The failure of Yongli 21

911
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,226
was the classic case we used to study.

912
00:41:30,665 --> 00:41:32,185
Now that the man related
is right before me.

913
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:34,425
Hence, I can't help
but stick my nose into it.

914
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:36,185
Miss Wu.

915
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:38,546
Mr. Qiu is my teacher.

916
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:41,066
I won't gossip about him.

917
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:44,145
Actually, the people outside

918
00:41:44,345 --> 00:41:45,746
have their own judgment on this.

919
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:47,385
After that incident,

920
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,706
Mr. Qiu left Hengli

921
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,665
which was a big hit to Hengli

922
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:53,706
and the company fell from
the leading position in the industry.

923
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,706
Afterwards, they spent a great fortune

924
00:41:55,865 --> 00:41:56,905
recruiting a new fund manager

925
00:41:57,105 --> 00:41:58,185
from Walls Street

926
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,145
and managed to survive for another year.

927
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:01,425
Yet, the company still collapsed
in the end.

928
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:04,825
You know quite detailed about this.

929
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:07,026
Of course, Mr. Wang.

930
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,306
When did you leave Hengli?

931
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:12,946
I suppose it was three months

932
00:42:13,145 --> 00:42:15,145
Mr. Qiu left the company.

933
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:17,425
Because the person from Walls Street

934
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:19,185
has a different way of working.

935
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:20,746
Most members of Mr. Qiu's old team

936
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:22,345
were abandoned by that person.

937
00:42:22,946 --> 00:42:25,145
After all, subordinates have to change
as the ruler changes.

938
00:42:25,865 --> 00:42:27,625
I had no choice but to leave.

939
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:31,625
Then,

940
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,746
when did Yang Hua leave?

941
00:42:37,746 --> 00:42:38,306
Miss Wu.

942
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,066
It seems

943
00:42:40,665 --> 00:42:41,905
you're very inquisitive.

944
00:42:43,385 --> 00:42:45,905
Take a guess. When did Yang Hua

945
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:47,145
leave Hengli?

946
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:51,585
Around that incident happened, I guess.

947
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:52,466
Correct.

948
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,345
Therefore, we can conclude that

949
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:58,345
Yang Hua was the fund manager
who led to the chaos.

950
00:42:58,706 --> 00:42:59,226
Am I right?

951
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:02,425
Maybe.
