=Episode 22=

19
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:57,918
Ultimately, this is your fault.

20
00:01:58,558 --> 00:01:59,198
My fault?

21
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,079
If you were willing to marry me,

22
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,679
I wouldn't have been divorced
four times?

23
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,639
Don't you think?

24
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:04,918
Ding,

25
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,878
you still won't behave
after being divorced four times.

26
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:08,878
If you agree to marry me,

27
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:10,039
I promise I'll behave.

28
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:13,798
Miss Qin.

29
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:15,679
I have something to talk to Mr. Ding.

30
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:16,839
Give us the room, please.

31
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:18,319
Sure, I'll let you two talk.

32
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,679
I won't interrupt.

33
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:23,119
Do you have time now?

34
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:24,319
Sure.

35
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:25,479
Ding, down to business.

36
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,638
This time, it's not about me,

37
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:29,518
but my daughter.

38
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,039
Fangfang? What has happened to her?

39
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,399
My daughter is getting married soon.

40
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,399
My daughter is exceptional.

41
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:50,798
(I sent her to study in Canada)

42
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,559
(when she was in senior high.)

43
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,559
(She worked very hard)

44
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,199
(when she studied oversea.)

45
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,319
(Except for the first year)

46
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,119
(when she had a language barrier,)

47
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:01,919
she scored straight As every year

48
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,798
and got admitted to the school
with a full scholarship.

49
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,559
I don't need to worry about her.

50
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,878
Now that she's running

51
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:09,798
an investment company

52
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,279
and a furniture agency.

53
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:14,358
She earns money

54
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,839
to feed and house herself.

55
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:19,158
This little girl fully inherited

56
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,078
my wisdom in doing business.

57
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,638
Ding.

58
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,199
Are you talking about your daughter

59
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:26,839
I knew?

60
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:28,158
Of course.

61
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,479
She's my only daughter.

62
00:03:31,238 --> 00:03:32,598
Don't think that I'm not a decent

63
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:33,438
as I like pretty ladies.

64
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,078
I'm a decent man.

65
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:37,319
My heart is only spoken for one person
each time.

66
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,358
I was married to my first wife

67
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:40,518
for thirty years

68
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,199
and she's the only daughter I have.

69
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,078
Fangfang

70
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:47,438
has stopped buying luxurious bags
or fangirling over celebrities?

71
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,238
Did she turn over a new leaf
and start up her own business?

72
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:51,358
Miss Qin.

73
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:52,839
How long has it been
since you last saw her?

74
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,518
Two or three years.

75
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:57,798
That's the thing.

76
00:03:58,158 --> 00:03:59,438
People always change.

77
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,638
Fangfang has a knack with investing.

78
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,199
Several of her projects

79
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,358
have made some money.

80
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:07,878
However,

81
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:09,598
her mom's wisdom on choosing a husband

82
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:12,078
didn't rub off on her.

83
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,798
Mr. Cao, this is your coffee.

84
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,839
Please enjoy it.

85
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,719
Thank you, dear.

86
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,198
Is there a lot of work left?

87
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,358
It's almost done.

88
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,679
I promised

89
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:30,758
to make steaks

90
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,999
for my dear Fangfang tonight.

91
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,798
Well done, Cao.

92
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:38,559
I've been searching for true love.

93
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,399
But, it's hard to find one.

94
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:44,159
There are not many

95
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,839
frank men like me

96
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:47,318
in this world.

97
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:48,439
Oh geez.

98
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,439
Those rascals.

99
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,279
I have no idea

100
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,478
they came for love or money.

101
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:55,119
My daughter

102
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,758
is as pure as snow.

103
00:04:58,318 --> 00:04:59,279
Back then, I told her

104
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:01,478
not to study much,

105
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,518
she should see more men outside.

106
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,798
I'm fine with everything

107
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:07,679
as long as she protects herself well.

108
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,599
If something happens,
I'll clean up after her.

109
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:10,839
You see.

110
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:11,999
It's rare that
have such open-minded fathers

111
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:12,959
like me.

112
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,879
Mr. Ding.

113
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,318
Please drink some water.

114
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,599
Thank you.

115
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,358
After hearing from you,

116
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,238
I'd like to know

117
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,599
what kind of service

118
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:28,078
do you look for?

119
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:29,959
It's simple.

120
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:31,358
I'm thinking

121
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:32,879
to have them sign
a prenuptial agreement

122
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:34,839
before they get married.

123
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,399
As her father,

124
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,719
I must protect her.

125
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:41,318
Wu and I

126
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:42,719
have been friends for a couple of years.

127
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:43,839
I'm sure the lawyer he recommended

128
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,119
must be reliable.

129
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,959
That's good that Miss Qin is here too.

130
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:49,119
Then,

131
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,439
I'll have no worries.

132
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,679
Why allow Qin Shi

133
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,959
to join this case?

134
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:01,159
That's my dad's client

135
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:01,999
and connections, though.

136
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,719
It's my father who gets this case.

137
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:05,959
Keep it down.

138
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:08,159
Didn't we agree

139
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,599
not to throw a fist

140
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:10,559
when we're eating?

141
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:11,279
Rage hurts your health.

142
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,879
Why can't I?

143
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:14,518
Don't let her take this case.

144
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:15,839
Have her stay away from this.

145
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:17,358
I said yes.

146
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:19,798
Why?

147
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,518
Qin Shi knows Mr. Ding and Ding Fangfang

148
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:24,839
better than I do.

149
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:26,758
She isn't the only one

150
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:27,599
who knows Ding Fangfang.

151
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,318
I know her too.

152
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,279
Why don't you

153
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,238
take me as your assistant?

154
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:32,599
Second, Mr. Ding

155
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,119
has been divorced four times before.

156
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:35,238
Out of three times,

157
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,159
Qin Shi was in charge of his cases.

158
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,279
She drafted

159
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:39,279
the prenuptial agreements for him.

160
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:40,999
If the man

161
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,879
is after the money of Mr. Ding,

162
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:45,119
he won't sign the agreement.

163
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,078
Besides, Qin Shi

164
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:49,238
was the lead attorney
in the family department.

165
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,198
She has more experience in this
than I do.

166
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,999
Before Mr. Ding came to us,

167
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:55,198
he went to other lawyers too.

168
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,798
However, Ding Fangfang
turned all of them down.

169
00:06:57,798 --> 00:06:58,758
Ding Fangfang's wedding

170
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,518
is already fixed.

171
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:00,559
The 9th of next month.

172
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:02,879
That's fast.

173
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:04,798
We only have less than two weeks left.

174
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,559
Do you have the confidence

175
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:08,798
to convince Ding Fangfang
in two-weeks time?

176
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:13,279
I don't care.

177
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,518
Anyway, I'll join this case.

178
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,559
No rebuttal.

179
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:18,758
Aye, aye.

180
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:20,279
Let's eat first, okay?

181
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,839
Three lawyers

182
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,078
for one prenuptial agreement?

183
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:37,038
Did Mr. Tang agree with this?

184
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,679
Miss Qin, I also think

185
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,038
that three lawyers are too much.

186
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,399
But, Junhui said

187
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,999
you need a case now

188
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:48,358
as you can't be of help

189
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:49,518
to other lawyers.

190
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,159
Besides, you know the client.

191
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:52,238
So, I said yes.

192
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:54,358
Besides, I brought the client here.

193
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,238
Madam Tang won't say anything

194
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:56,879
to my decision.

195
00:07:58,638 --> 00:07:59,198
Alright.

196
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:00,839
I'll take charge

197
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,839
of Ding Fangfang,

198
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,038
while you'll take charge
of her boyfriend.

199
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:04,758
Wait.

200
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,559
I'm sorry, Miss Qin.

201
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:07,518
I need to remind you

202
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,559
that I'm no longer

203
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,679
your legal assistant.

204
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,999
And Junhui is the person-in-charge

205
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:12,879
of this case.

206
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:14,478
Therefore, you don't have
to trouble yourself

207
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,559
to arrange the task for us.

208
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:16,959
Junhui.

209
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:18,599
We'll go for dinner

210
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,879
with Fangfang and her boyfriend tonight.

211
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,599
Miss Qin, you may leave first.

212
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,599
If you're needed,

213
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,078
Junhui will inform you.

214
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:26,679
Sure.

215
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,660

She started biting just after teething.

217

Shi.

218

(Fangfang.)

219
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:08,959
I heard that you're getting married soon.

220
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,638
How come you didn't inform me

221
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:10,678
on such an important occasion?

222
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,599
Why did you know about this?

223
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:16,159
Did my father tell you?

224
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,438
But I just let him know.

225
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:19,959
Don't deflect.

226
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:21,399
Why didn't you tell me

227
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,518
about your wedding?

228
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:24,078
You rotten pal.

229
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,438
You're not the friend

230
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:27,719
I accompanied you to Beijing
for the concert

231
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:28,959
without letting your dad know.

232
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,039
Tsk-tsk.

233
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,239
I'm at fault.

234
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:35,959
Can we meet?

235
00:09:36,438 --> 00:09:37,479
Give grant me a chance

236
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:38,719
to buy you coffee.

237
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:39,919
Fine.

238
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,039
Good, see you later.

239
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,180
(Cloud Commercial Bank)

240
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,959
Mr. Yang.

241
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:07,118
I've reviewed your resume.

242
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,518
You have outstanding qualifications

243
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:12,078
and you meet the requirement
of our company.

244
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:13,919
But, I have a question.

245
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:14,998
I'm curious about something.

246
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:16,959
Your last job

247
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:18,438
was four years ago.

248
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,799
May I know

249
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:20,799
what were the reasons

250
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:21,799
you left the company

251
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,558
and why didn't you get a new job

252
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,878
in these four years?

253
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:26,998
Because I don't like

254
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:27,799
interacting with others.

255
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,799
Mister, you have my respect.

256
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,599
You could've told him that you
were setting up your own business

257
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,758
or was being a financial advisor

258
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,799
for your friends.

259
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,758
Why did you say that to him?

260
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,438
I was just telling the truth.

261
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:52,558
I beg of you.

262
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,839
Please restrain yourself.

263
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:55,399
Okay?

264
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,599
Could you please

265
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,118
pretend to be an elite

266
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,359
and say something that sounds polite?

267
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:02,399
How many

268
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,839
human resource managers
have you confronted?

269
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,118
How am I going to introduce jobs
to you later?

270
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:06,839
I don't like telling lies.

271
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,039
You don't?

272
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,599
You did that a lot back then.

273
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,599
I don't like lying on small matters.

274
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:13,998
Small matters?

275
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,399
Is getting employed something small?

276
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,878
It's really hard to get a job

277
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:20,318
in the finance industry now.

278
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,599
It's a different situation
compared to ten years ago.

279
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,638
If you're not

280
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:24,318
a Chartered Financial Analyst,

281
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:25,719
you don't even earn a chance
for an interview,

282
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,599
do you know that?

283
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,359
What do I do now?

284
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:29,159
I don't know.

285
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,198
Don't ask me.

286
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:31,919
Fine.

287
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:34,758
Where are you going?

288
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:37,039
Home.

289
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:37,919
Since you can't help me,

290
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:39,159
I should look for another way.

291
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,399
Are you just leaving like that?

292
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,678
Not even threatening me?

293
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:47,318
We've been friends for years,

294
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:49,159
I know you've helped me

295
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:50,959
in your power.

296
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:55,638
Sorry.

297

298
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,599
I do have a vacancy here.

However,

300
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,758
this job is beneath you.

301
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:07,518
If you're not willing...

302
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,279
I'll do it.

303
00:12:14,758 --> 00:12:15,518
Do you know

304
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:16,599
what job I offer you?

307

Sit.

308
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:45,558
I have no worries

309
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:47,839
about your capability.

310
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:49,799
Many of our VIP clients

311
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:51,279
are highly-educated

312
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,039
and have a nice salary.

313
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,399
They might be more well-versed
than you

314
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,599
in terms of financial knowledge.

315

However,

316
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,159
rookies aren't able

317
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,399
to manage such clients.

318
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:01,839
Therefore, our department
is in urgent need

319

of elite talents like you

320

to deal with high-end clients.

321
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,839
But,

322
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:11,919
I have one request.

323
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,758
Keep your temper in check.

324
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:14,919
Okay?

325
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:17,678
Don't ever be harsh

326

to the clients.

327
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:19,719
Don't ever

328
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,558
challenge their intelligence.

329
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,078
If you're being complained

330
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:24,959
by demanding clients

331
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,479
and the complaint rate increases,

I can't protect you

333
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:29,839
and the bonus of our branch the month

334

will be gone.

336
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:33,198
This is my only request.

337

No worries, I won't.

338
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:37,039
Really?

339
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,198
You better not break your promise.

340
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:51,078
Hello.

00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,518
Is this Madam Wang Xiaoji?

Do you have a minute?

00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,758
I'm your financial advisor.
My name is Yang Hua.

346
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:02,438
Sure.

347
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:04,558
Sorry, Madam Wang.

348
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,078
Hello, is this Mr. Xu Kai?

349
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,359
Hello.

350
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,399
I'm the financial advisor from the bank.

351
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,159
Yes, you're the VIP of our bank.

352
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,719
Even a hermit like you

353
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:22,959
can be pulled out
by a ten-thousand salary per month.

354
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:25,599
Yang.

355
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:26,959
Yang.

356
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:27,758
I'm here.

357
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:28,518
I can't believe this.

358
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:29,118
What has happened?

359
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,959
Our son has gone to work.

360
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:31,878
Look at this.

361
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:32,758
Work?

362
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,118
What is his job?

363
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:37,318
Are you sure this is our son?

364
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:39,919
Of course, I'm.

365
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:40,518
He's working

366
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,878
at Cai Liang's bank right now.

367
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:43,279
Cai Liang said

368
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,318
he is looking for a job
to get a loan.

369
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:46,719
Get a loan?

370
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:47,998
What loan is it?

371
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:49,839
He wants to buy a house.

372
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,479
He wants to buy a house?

373
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,919
I wonder how did Qin Shi

374
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:56,878
manage that?

375
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,599
Two months ago, this brat

376
00:14:58,638 --> 00:14:59,318
told me

377
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,839
that he wanted to end up
in the house.

378
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,518
How come a man
who doesn't work, interact

379
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:03,518
or pursue materials

380
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,839
change out of a sudden?

381
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:08,919
This is the power of love.

382
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:13,039
The magic of love, spin.

383
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,438
- Spin.
- Enough.

384
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,758
This is grand, Junhui.

385
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,919
Look at this big meeting room

386
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,438
and the scenery.

387
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:38,878
Junhui.

388
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:41,959
You've jumped into the right ship.

389
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,118
You made the right choice.

390
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:45,359
Judging by this great place,

391
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,919
only big business deals worth
hundreds of millions

392
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:48,959
are worthy of this place.

393
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,078
Erm...Feifei.

394
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,039
Can you please

395
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,438
raise my consulting fee?

396
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:56,758
Put that aside,

397
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,799
do the work first.

398
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:58,839
Well.

399
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:00,758
You can count on me.

400
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,039
Where's the material?

401
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:05,758
Ding Fangfang

402
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:06,479
met Cao Yiren

403
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:07,359
when she went study

404
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,399
in Canada.

405
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:09,799
As for Cao Yiren,

406
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:10,878
he's literally

407
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:11,878
the elite.

408
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,438
Graduated from a prestigious university
in Canada

409
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,239
majoring in finance.

410
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:15,758
After graduation,

411
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:16,719
he worked on Wall Street.

412
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:19,078
Aside from that, he's ten years
older than Ding Fangfang.

413
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:22,518
Fangfang said

414
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,318
their first met at an art exhibition.

415
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:25,839
Nowadays, Asian students

416
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,039
like holding small-scale art exhibitions.

417
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,518
Besides, the event

418
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:31,318
runs an invite-only system.

419
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,239
Cao Yiren's divorced.

420
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,799
It's true that Yiren's divorced

421
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,839
and he has a daughter.

422
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,159
But isn't it

423
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,599
that divorce a common thing now?

424
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:50,078
My dad has been divorced four times.

425
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,638
When did you know each other?

426
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,078
Shi,

427
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:56,479
I know what you're going to ask.

428
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,479
When I met Cao Yiyen,

429
00:16:58,878 --> 00:16:59,839
he has already

430
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:00,878
separated from his wife.

431
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,479
He and his wife went to
the university together

432
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:04,959
and they got married
right after graduation.

433
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,158
After that, Yiren has been

434
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,278
focusing on his career

435
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:09,198
and neglected the family.

436
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,119
When he wanted to mend the marriage,

437
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:12,959
he found that someone
has been taking care of his wife.

438
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,558
I think that's the reason

439
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,318
why he holds

440
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:20,158
me dearly.

441
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:22,678
I suppose your dad and him

442
00:17:22,678 --> 00:17:23,839
should share some common ground.

443
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:24,759
My dad?

444
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,318
To him,

445
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,599
he thinks

446
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,558
all men who approach me

447
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,918
just for my money.

448
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,239
I, Ding Fangfang,

449
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,879
have no desirable qualities

450
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:39,959
people are fond of

451
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,078
except for my deep pocket.

452
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:42,839
After Cao Yiren and his ex-wife

453
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,599
got divorced,

454
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,839
he transferred all his property to her.

455
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,599
Besides, he gave up a high-paying job

456
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,678
from a big company
after he came back

457
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,999
but work as a real estate agent.

458
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:52,359
What do you think?

459
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:53,719
He's exceptional, isn't he?

460
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,558
However, he quit the job

461
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:56,759
after half a year

462
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:57,678
and set up his own business.

463
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,239
He combined

464
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,798
the internet mode
into the real estate business

465
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:01,999
and created an online business mode

466
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:02,959
with low commission.

467
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:04,918
As he was in the finance field before,

468
00:18:05,198 --> 00:18:06,438
hence, he got one hundred million

469
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:07,798
for Series-A funding

470
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:08,879
just in seven months.

471
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:10,999
I've seen similar business mode

472
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,318
in our country too.

473
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:13,759
It's a pirated version?

474
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:16,158
It was at first.

475
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,158
But, after he realised

476
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:17,798
the business couldn't adapt well,

477
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:18,918
he changed his plan

478
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,438
and brought in physical retail outlets.

479
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,359
Plus, he gave up

480
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,558
on the competitive market
in the first-tier cities

481
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,918
and aimed
at the second-tier cities market.

482
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,398
Currently, the retail outlets

483
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,879
are around one hundred.

484
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,158
He's a successful businessman.

485
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:30,959
What about his financial condition?

486
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,759
Oh, impressive.

487
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:34,519
Cao Yiren

488
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,438
doesn't need

489
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:36,479
funding support from Ding's family.

490
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,278
Moreover, the furniture store
of Ding Fangfang's

491
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,798
runs well

492
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:40,359
depending on his connections.

493
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:41,759
Shi, think about this.

494
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:44,119
Yiren has helped me a lot

495
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:45,398
yet my dad treats him badly.

496
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,639
For the first time

497
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:47,759
in my life,

498
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,639
I'm truly ashamed of my dad.

499
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,599
Regarding this,

500
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:53,839
I think

501
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,078
you lack communication with him.

502
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:56,479
You know

503
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,359
your dad well.

504
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,479
Over the years,

505
00:18:58,918 --> 00:18:59,879
he has suffered a lot

506
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:00,639
because of women.

507
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:01,798
Therefore,

508
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:03,999
you should cut him some slack.

509
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:05,359
He has concerns

510
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,198
when it comes to relationships.

511
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:07,278
He's to be blamed.

512
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:09,119
Look what he has done to my mum.

513
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:10,719
He betrayed his wife

514
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,678
and has affairs with other women.

515
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,479
Luckily, my mom came back to her sense

516
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:15,119
and decided to leave him.

517
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:16,759
So, she divorced him.

518
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,719
I witness their marriage ends with my eyes.

519
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,479
Hence, I don't have expectations

520
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:25,318
for marriage.

521
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,558
My dad always asks me to date

522
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,599
and see new men.

523
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:31,198
However,

524
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,438
I have no interest

525
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,398
in them at all.

526
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:37,359
I've even thought

527
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,798
that it was my problem

528
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:40,359
and something is wrong with me.

529
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:41,678
I almost

530
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,798
made an appointment
with a psychiatrist.

531
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:51,839
And then

532
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,759
I met Yiren.

533
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:57,599
He's so different from all of them.

534
00:19:58,639 --> 00:19:59,599
He has been helping me

535
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:01,158
and concern about me

536
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:02,318
from the get-go.

537
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:03,719
And I can't be of his help

538
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,078
in his business.

539
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:06,359
He can actually choose a woman

540
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,278
with finer qualities.

541
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:08,359
But he chose me.

542
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:09,119
Shi.

543
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:10,318
I think I just luck out.

544
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,359
I don't understand

545
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,519
what my dad actually wants.

546
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,158
Well, I'm not a lobbyist

547
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,999
sent by your dad.

548
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:19,239
In my opinion,

549
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:20,438
well,

550
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,519
marriage is an important thing in life.

551
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,038
Isn't it great

552
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,558
if you receive blessings

553
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:26,558
from both of your parents?

554
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:29,759
So,

555
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:32,359
do you mind hearing my advice?

556
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:33,999
Yes.

557
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,558
I think

558
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:39,798
if you have complete trust

559
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:41,119
on your relationship

560
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,558
and the character of Cao Yiren,

561
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,519
why don't you use it as a requirement

562
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,359
to make a deal with your dad?

563
00:20:48,398 --> 00:20:49,078
Make a deal?

564
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:52,519
Think about this.

565
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,879
Your dad

566
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,999
is good at doing business.

567
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:56,278
And Cao Yiren

568
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:57,318
is a wise businessman too.

569
00:20:57,678 --> 00:20:59,158
Businessmen

570
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:00,719
can become friends

571
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:02,038
if their common interest is found.

572
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,879
But what's the interest
they share in common?

573
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:08,599
Their common interest

574
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,759
is you.

575
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,239
The company serves good food.

576
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:18,278
Why did you waste your money to eat out?

577
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,798
It's good

578
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:21,479
but you'll be fed up
eating too much of it.

579
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:23,119
You need a palate cleanser.

580
00:21:25,678 --> 00:21:26,678
Settling in?

581
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,759
Prett well. But...

582
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,318
What's it?

583
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,078
Why do they keep looking at me?

584
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:36,798
Why do they

585
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,239
keep looking at me?

586
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:44,959
When I registered you,

587
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,119
I didn't tell them
that you're married.

588
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:48,158
Why?

589
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,759
Why?

590
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:52,959
A single man's identity

591
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:55,078
will make us more convenient in sales.

592
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:56,759
I tell you what,

593
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,359
in this industry,

594
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:00,479
the man-to-woman ratio
is out of proportion

595
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,438
where women outnumber men a lot.

596
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:03,639
Especially in our bank,

597
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:04,759
those at the service counter

598
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,158
are all single ladies

599
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,078
who have a small social circle

600
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:11,519
and long working hours,

601
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:13,959
so they don't have many chances
to meet guys.

602
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:18,119
Hence, single male staff with common looks

603
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,359
would be a match

604
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,398
after they come here.

605
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,519
You should open yourself up

606
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,759
and make more friends.

607
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:25,798
Try to fit in the group.

608
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,198
One with low competency fits in the group

609
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:31,398
to gain a better survival chance.

610
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:32,639
Besides, in our entire life,

611
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,158
the people we get to know
is limited.

612
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:35,558
Regardless of how long
your contact list is,

613
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:37,198
you only manage to keep in contact with

614
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,198
twenty per cent of them.

615
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,318
And that suits the Pareto principle.

616
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:40,678
A workplace isn't a place

617
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:41,558
to seek friendship.

618
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:42,278
Besides,

619
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:44,359
I'm a married man.

620
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,158
I don't need socialisation.

621
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,558
He's married.

622
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:49,479
He's got married.

623
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,398
What a shame.

624
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,359
No chance.

625
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:56,999
Why would I

626
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:58,198
request you to make more friends?

627
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:00,479
I'm at fault and I admit it.

628
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,198
Shi, thank you.

629
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,438
I feel better after talking to you.

630
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:13,678
I'm only willing

631
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:14,879
to speak my heart to you.

632
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:16,158
Previously,

633
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:17,038
the lawyers he hired

634
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,479
were chased away by me.

635
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,879
Thank you for your trust.

636
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:24,599
Shi.

637
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,839
Will Yiren be upset about this?

638
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,359
Actually, he has a lot of choices

639
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:30,278
instead of me.

640
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:31,959
But for me,

641
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:34,119
I can't meet a better man

642
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,158
than him.

643
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,318
I think,

644
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:39,839
as a human,

645
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:41,359
we're most likely to be alone.

646
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,239
It doesn't concern
whether you're married or not.

647
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:46,078
It's a long shot

648
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:47,879
to find partners who love each other.

649
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:49,798
If you understand this,

650
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,798
you'll cherish your partner even more.

651
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,318
Cao Yiren has lost his wife before,

652
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:55,759
hence,

653
00:23:56,078 --> 00:23:57,398
he'll understand this for sure.

654
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,359
You're right, Shi.

655
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,119
Yiren once told me

656
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,759
that he'd choose family

657
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,719
over career

658
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:05,438
if any conflicts spark.

659
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:07,198
Because a career is meaningless

660
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:08,798
if one loses the family.

661
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:10,879
And with what he said,

662
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:12,398
I'm more confident

663
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:14,479
that he's my true love.

664
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:27,839
Hello.

665
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:29,678
Have you eaten yet?

666
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:32,519
No.

667
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:34,119
Good. Let's eat together.

668
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,038
I'll go fetch you.

669
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:36,119
It's fine.

670
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:36,999
Give me the location.

671
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:38,158
I'll be right there.

672
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,318
Alright. See you later.

673
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:41,639
Okay, bye-bye.

674
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:45,359
Where are you going?

675
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,558
I'm off for lunch.

676
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,599
You can have this.

677
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,278
It seems you did well

678
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,318
on your first day.

679
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:00,198
How's it? Settling in?

680
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,318
There's nothing to be settled in.

681
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,678
I just need to do my best.

682
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,599
But, working in the bank

683
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,999
needs to interact with others a lot?

684
00:25:08,078 --> 00:25:08,959
You have social anxiety...

685
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:10,359
I don't have social anxiety.

686
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:11,759
Instead, I reject all kinds

687
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:12,959
of invalid socialisation.

688
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,839
However, if my work

689
00:25:14,918 --> 00:25:16,038
involves interaction with clients,

690
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,479
I can cope with it very well.

691
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:21,918
That reminds me of the dinner

692
00:25:22,158 --> 00:25:22,999
of Luowei Yulan before

693
00:25:23,318 --> 00:25:24,119
when Pang Dingfang

694
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,359
couldn't get his head around
on what you said.

695
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,198
Yang Hua.

696
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:30,599
Don't strain yourself.

697
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:32,918
If you get bogged down

698
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,759
with this problem,

699
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:34,599
you'll have no time

700
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:35,999
to ask me the question in your mind.

701
00:25:39,198 --> 00:25:40,078
If it wasn't for you

702
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:41,278
to sit in front of me

703
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,759
and I can see and touch you,

704
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:44,198
I doubt

705
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,318
that you're a real human.

706
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,278
Is this a compliment or criticism?

707
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,038
A compliment.

708
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,959
I have something to ask you.

709
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:54,398
Can you please

710
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,798
evaluate true love

711
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,599
from an economic point of view?

712
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,158
First of all,

713
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,558
you have to know

714
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:05,519
what's the standard
that makes up true love.

715
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:07,678
I reckon

716
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:08,719
the true love you said

717
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,479
is pure love

718
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,198
without the influence of money.

719
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:12,719
Am I right?

720
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:13,359
Yes.

721
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,519
Well, every decision you make

722
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:16,999
in this realistic world

723
00:26:17,198 --> 00:26:18,198
including love relationships

724
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:20,479
is based on

725
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,038
assumptions to certain extent.

726
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:22,198
Even if you have
no financial expectations

727
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:24,078
for your loved one currently,

728
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:25,599
you'll still hope

729
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:27,558
that the partner has a promising future.

730
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,158
After all, no one likes

731
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,438
a person with a dark future.

732
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,798
And that's the so-called

733
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:32,678
diamond in the rough mean.

734
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:33,879
Such considerations stem from

735
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:36,239
the survival instinct of living beings.

736
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:38,959
A love relationship
that goes against instincts

737
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,479
never exists.

738
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:44,119
If so,

739
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:44,959
can I say

740
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:47,398
that true love is a false dilemma?

741
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,959
Perhaps you can think this way.

742
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:51,038
Even if it's true love,

743
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:51,999
it still needs justification.

744
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:58,078
I think I can understand now.

745
00:26:58,639 --> 00:26:59,798
Thank you, Yang Hua. You're awesome.

746
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,038
I'll give you a stamp.

747
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:04,158
Dig in.

748
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:10,959
Who wrote this?

749
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,078
No one who's in their right mind
will sign this.

750
00:27:14,678 --> 00:27:15,879
What has happened?
Let me see.

751
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:17,558
Haven't you read it yet?

752
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:18,798
It gives me

753
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,038
a sense of arrogance

754
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,759
after reading it.

755
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,239
If the information of Cao Yiren is true,

756
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,278
it means that Fangfang has met a man

757
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:26,798
who's too good for her.

758
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:28,678
Is it?

759
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,398
I know a thing or two about Fangfang.

760
00:27:31,678 --> 00:27:32,719
The finest quality of her

761
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,359
is that she has no illusions
about what she is.

762
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,119
She also has said this many times

763
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:37,719
that the only thing good
about her family

764
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:38,879
is money.

765
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,719
Cao Yiren is outstanding in every way.

766
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:43,918
Most importantly, he's well-off.

767
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:47,558
I think their love relationship is real.

768
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:50,678
Who says that one shouldn't
talk about money

769
00:27:50,678 --> 00:27:52,119
when it comes to true love?

770
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:54,558
Can love be genuine

771
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,519
if it's evaluated

772
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,639
by appearance, money and ability?

773
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:58,398
What are you trying to say?

774
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:02,359
I'm saying

775
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,918
that we're lawyers, not priests.

776
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:06,839
We can't identify what true love is.

777
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,879
Besides, apart from true love,

778
00:28:09,158 --> 00:28:09,918
the reasons for one to get married

779
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:11,918
can be bizarre and aberrant.

780
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:12,719
That's why

781
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,278
the prenuptial agreement comes in.

782
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,198
Prenuptial agreements help protect
one's property,

783
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:18,318
not their relationship.

784
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,519
All we have to do

785
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,999
is to let Cao Yiren sign the agreement
as soon as possible.

786
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,839
At this point,

787
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:24,239
he won't have concerns about this
if his feelings for her aren't genuine.

788
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:28,999
Junhui.

789
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:30,479
Is she the one...

790
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:35,479
I think he signs the agreement
without concerns

791
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,959
if he truly loves her.

792
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,639
Have you two signed it?

793
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:43,918
We're talking about the case.

794
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:45,278
Why deflect?

795
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:48,158
Calm down. I'm just asking.

796
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,398
Is it?

797
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,479
Given your indifference,

798
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:53,678
objective and calm nature,

799
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:55,599
have you and your husband
have signed it?

800
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:56,519
We did.

801
00:28:58,398 --> 00:28:59,359
You're married?

802
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:00,678
Mind your own business.

803
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,198
Qin Shi.

804
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:10,759
Let me remind you one last time.

805
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,639
We lead this case.

806
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,639
Leave this place if you're done.

807
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:15,798
- Feifei.
- I'm so tired.

808
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:17,599
I need to rest.

809
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:20,999
Nothing will work out well

810
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,119
even if we have a debate on this.

811
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:23,519
That's right.

812
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,278
I can draft the agreement.

813
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:26,839
If Ding Fangfang

814
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:27,839
is willing to communicate with us,

815
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:29,479
we can meet her again.

816
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,438
What if the negotiation breaks down?

817
00:29:31,678 --> 00:29:32,798
We can't always

818
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:33,719
succeed in every task.

819
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:35,359
Wrong.

820
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,398
We won't accept all kinds of cases.

821
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,239
But we should accomplish it
if we accept the case.

822
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,318
Well, a lawyer

823
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:42,239
isn't someone

824
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,558
in a nicely furnished room

825
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,438
in a nice suit

826
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,359
and does simple jobs like taking calls

827
00:29:47,438 --> 00:29:48,639
and typing.

828
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:00,278
What's wrong?

829
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,719
What's wrong with your girlfriend?

830
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:05,239
What do you think?

831
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:07,759
Search me.

832
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:09,119
I'm not your girlfriend, though.

833
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:10,479
Cheer up.

834
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:11,519
You got this.

835
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:21,558
I'm not your girlfriend as well.

836
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,318
I don't know either.

837
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,519
Breaking news.

838
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:45,479
In the duel between
the princess and the queen,

839
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:46,999
the princess is defeated.

840
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,479
Never mess up with the queen.

841
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,479
She never loses.

842
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,438
No.

843
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,879
I think the queen

844
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:56,959
isn't having a good time too.

845
00:30:57,158 --> 00:30:59,158
Small potatoes like us better stay out of this.

846
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:00,599
I heard

847
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:02,839
that the queen is the ex-girlfriend
of the prince consort.

848
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,959
Is it true?

849
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:05,918
The queen and prince consort

850
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:07,278
is the couple in Pujiang Poli-sci

851
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,158
and everyone is aware of this.

852
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:11,558
Is the prince consort blind?

853
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:13,479
Obviously, the queen is better.

854
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,078
Why did they break up?

855
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:16,198
You're blind instead.

856
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,798
Being a prince consort

857
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:19,239
is way better
than a self-reliant commoner.

858
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:20,318
Get it?

859
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:21,038
True though.

860
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:22,719
Oh my, your ugly mind.

861
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,239
It was the queen

862
00:31:24,438 --> 00:31:25,239
who dumped the prince consort, okay?

863
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,599
As expected from the queen.

864
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:29,918
If so,

865
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:32,719
does the princess

866
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,959
stand toe to toe against the queen

867
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,558
as she's protective of her boyfriend.

868
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:38,398
Hasn't the statute of limitations
been over yet?

869
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,558
Oh, true love.

870
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:43,918
I'll get back to work.

871
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,239
Go now.

872
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:46,318
Oh, love.

873
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:35,479
Prenuptial agreements help protect
one's property,

874
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:36,719
not their relationship.

875
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:37,999
All we have to do

876
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,558
is to let Cao Yiren sign the agreement
as soon as possible.

877
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,119
At this point,

878
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:42,558
he won't have concerns about this
if his feelings for her aren't genuine.

879
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:02,359
Junhui.

880
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:05,038
I think the lady was right.

881
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:06,798
I think we should
look at the bright side.

882
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,558
I'll go and investigate more

883
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:09,398
about Cao Yiren.

884
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:10,479
Go ahead.

885
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:13,078
Bring along the material.

886
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:23,479
Hi.

887
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:27,479
You asked for me?

888
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,999
You have a special office.

889
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:34,678
Close the door.

890
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,198
What's your name?

891
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,438
I'm Qi Dagang.

892
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:44,359
You can call me Gang.

893
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,398
Gang.

894
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,158
Are you a legal investigator?

895
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:51,999
Kind of.

896
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,759
I'm just helping my friends
to work through their issues

897
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,678
and counsel them.

898
00:33:57,438 --> 00:33:57,879
How would you like

899
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:58,759
to collaborate with me?

900
00:33:59,678 --> 00:34:00,119
With you?

901
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,678
Is it lucrative?

902
00:34:08,638 --> 00:34:09,719
It's lucrative

903
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,239
if you're capable enough.

904
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,039
That's good, then.

905
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,158
Well.

906
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:15,319
As you said just now,

907
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:17,279
I won't accept

908
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:18,799
all kinds of requests.

909
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:21,039
But I'd accomplish it

910
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:22,678
if I accept the request.

911
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:43,319
Are you alright?

912
00:34:43,678 --> 00:34:44,079
Are you fine?

913
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,039
Are you okay?

914
00:34:45,198 --> 00:34:45,878
Are you alright?

915
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,239
Be careful.

916
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,358
Careful.

917
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:49,438
You should be careful.

918
00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:50,118
Are you alright?

919
00:34:50,678 --> 00:34:53,239
Yes, thank you.

920
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:54,198
Thank you.

921
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:58,838
You can do it.

922
00:35:09,198 --> 00:35:10,598
Someone filed a complaint against you.
Do you know that?

923
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,638
Me?

924
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,118
Who did that?

925
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:17,918
Aren't you aware

926
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:18,959
of what you've done?

927
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:20,959
No, I'm not.

928
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:22,759
Some complained about you

929
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,239
that you tripped a female staff.

930
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:26,319
Did you really believe this?

931
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,678
Of course not.

932
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:29,598
I tell you what,

933
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,279
just now, the head of
the credit department

934
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:32,319
came to me

935
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,398
and said Zhen of his department

936
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,279
was tripped.

937
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,598
He complained a lot to me.

938
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:36,559
As you know,

939
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:38,158
that department always talks

940
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:39,598
with their noses in the air,

941
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,039
why would I bother to care?

942
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:42,519
But, I must

943
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:44,039
stand up for my buddy.

944
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:46,239
Hence, I brought him

945
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,239
to check on the camera.

946
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:48,759
Who's Zhen?

947
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:50,719
The prettiest girl

948
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,158
in the bank.

949
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,158
The one

950
00:35:56,158 --> 00:35:57,158
who fell in front of you.

951
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,759
Did she tell you
that I tripped her up?

952
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,079
No, she didn't.

953
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:03,678
I've watched the footage.

954
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:05,449
A pretty girl

955
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:07,559
fell down in front of you,

956
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:08,838
why didn't you help her up?

957
00:36:09,158 --> 00:36:09,838
If you weren't my friend,

958
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:10,959
I'll see you as a madman.

959
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:12,759
Let me tell you this.

960
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:14,039
Zhen is the most beautiful girl

961
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:15,918
in the bank.

962
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:17,999
She has a pretty face
and a sweet tongue.

963
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:19,198
Everyone likes her.

964
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,638
After she came here,

965
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:21,519
all single men here

966
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:23,079
go crazy for her.

967
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,719
Despite this,

968
00:36:25,678 --> 00:36:26,438
she has a nice soul.

969
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:28,319
She doesn't simply date them.

970
00:36:29,158 --> 00:36:29,799
What has her personal matter

971
00:36:29,878 --> 00:36:30,838
to do with me?

972
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,158
Just jump to the conclusion.

973
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:33,039
The conclusion is this.

974
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:34,959
Can you please

975
00:36:35,198 --> 00:36:36,039
treat others nicer?

976
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:37,838
Look at

977
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,118
your cold aura

978
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:40,638
and there's lively atmosphere
in other departments.

979
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:41,999
Everyone wants a lovely person

980
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:43,039
in their departments.

981
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:44,519
Even I'd love that.

982
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:47,398
Are you plotting

983
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,358
to transfer her to your department?

984
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:49,559
Of course.

985
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:51,039
But, she's not willing to.

986
00:36:55,118 --> 00:36:55,638
What are you doing now?

987
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:57,398
I'm buying a present for your wife.

988
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:58,999
What?

989
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:00,799
Why do you buy a present

990
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:01,799
for my wife?

991
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:02,719
This...

992
00:37:03,158 --> 00:37:04,598
A hairdryer that costs 3,000 yuan.

993
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:06,559
The money will deduct
from your account.

994
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,198
Why is that so?

995
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:12,559
It's a reflex.

996
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,479
Whenever you praise other girls,

997
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:14,759
it makes me want to buy presents
for your wife.

998
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:15,638
I feel this way every time.

999
00:37:15,878 --> 00:37:17,479
I just can't help myself. Strange.

1000
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:18,438
Wait.

1001
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:20,198
I'm your friend.

1002
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:21,799
I praise that girl

1003
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:22,878
just because of the work purposes.

1004
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:23,479
Okay?

1005
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,719
She just fits well
in the sales department.

1006
00:37:25,598 --> 00:37:26,878
This a friendly reminder for you.

1007
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:29,079
Never be too close to female colleagues.

1008
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,198
You have to know

1009
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:31,959
that you're a married man all the time.

1010
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,198
You bite the hand that feeds you.

1011
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,398
The righteous guardian of marriage.

1012
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,580
(Corporate Law)

1013
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,638
Do you remember that?

1014
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:31,519
Sorry to interrupt you.

1015
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:36,279
You were really in the zone just now.

1016
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:37,198
Are you alright?

1017
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:38,358
Gosh. I'm fine.

1018
00:38:38,638 --> 00:38:39,959
Couldn't you make a noise
before coming in?

1019
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:41,118
I was loud. Didn't you hear me?

1020
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,198
Fine, you did.

1021
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:43,398
Why are you staring at my face?

1022
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,319
Is there any information up here?

1023
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:45,079
Stop looking at me.

1024
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:45,999
Help yourself with the documents

1025
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:46,918
and leave.

1026
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:47,479
I'm occupied now.

1027
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,079
Are you?

1028
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:48,719
Yes.

1029
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:49,678
Well, then.

1030
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:52,678
I wanted to discuss with you

1031
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:54,158
the prenuptial agreement draft.

1032
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,559
No, I'm not busy.

1033
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:00,838
Prenuptial agreement, right?

1034
00:39:01,118 --> 00:39:01,638
Let's go.

1035
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:02,719
After you.

1036
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:04,438
Sure.

1037
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:05,999
Welcome.

1038
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:11,158
Yes.

1039
00:39:11,398 --> 00:39:12,158
Many clients

1040
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:13,079
have purchased the financial product.

1041
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:14,158
If you're interested in this,

1042
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:14,959
I can reserve it for you.

1043
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:16,319
How much do you prefer?

1044
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:18,799
Please photocopy this for me.

1045
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:20,799
Alright.

1046
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:22,158
How much do you want?

1047
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:24,039
58,000.

1048
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:24,719
Sure.

1049
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:26,678
What the heck?

1050
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:28,959
I'm sorry.

1051
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:30,319
I wasn't saying to you.

1052
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:31,638
You must be the newcomer

1053
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:32,398
from the account management department.

1054
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:33,678
Have you seen the link

1055
00:39:33,878 --> 00:39:34,598
I sent to the group chat?

1056
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:36,158
The voting link. This one.

1057
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:38,239
Please vote for my son.

1058
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:38,999
He's number 5.

1059
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:39,959
This one.

1060
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:41,319
Please vote for him.

1061
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:42,559
I've sent it to the group chat.

1062
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,559
It's obvious that number 1
is better than number 5.

1063
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:46,838
But my son is number 5.

1064
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:48,878
I remember that there's a rule

1065
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:50,079
about not distributing messages

1066
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:51,438
regarding personal matters.

1067
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:01,479
Yang Hua.

1068
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,519
Recently, Mr. Zhang from our branch

1069
00:40:03,598 --> 00:40:04,239
is badly injured.

1070
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:05,918
So, we chip in some money

1071
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:07,198
to pay him a call.

1072
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,759
Do you want...

1073
00:40:10,638 --> 00:40:11,198
But, I just come here

1074
00:40:11,438 --> 00:40:12,519
and I don't know Mr. Zhang.

1075
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:14,158
I'm not in.

1076
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:16,799
Well, okay.

1077
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:20,719
Mr. Cai.

1078
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:34,239
He's crazy.

1079
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:35,678
I'm crazy too.

1080
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:36,319
You're done.

1081
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,838
Yang Hua, you're done.

1082
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,158
You're screwed.

1083
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,959
I'm screwed too.

1084
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:45,479
I must be insane to recruit you.

1085
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:48,118
Thank you.

1086
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:51,918
Yang Hua.

1087
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,198
Have you handed in

1088
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:53,878
the work plan for the next quarter?

1089
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:55,398
I didn't inform me.

1090
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,358
Perhaps I miss out on you.

1091
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,279
Please do it now

1092
00:40:58,438 --> 00:40:58,918
and hand it to me later.

1093
00:40:59,198 --> 00:40:59,838
I'm off work now.

1094
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:00,799
I'll hand it in tomorrow.

1095
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:03,118
No, you must do it today.

1096
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:03,959
Hurry.

1097
00:41:04,118 --> 00:41:04,719
Sorry, I can't.

1098
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:07,559
You didn't inform me beforehand

1099
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,638
and now something comes up.

1100
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:09,398
I came here to work

1101
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:10,398
not to solve your problem.

1102
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,158
You should solve it yourself.

1103
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:21,838
Hello, who's speaking?

1104
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:23,598
Hello, it's me.

1105
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,479
I'm Qin Shi's mother.

1106
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,559
Mom, why do you call me?

1107
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:29,999
Why aren't you at home?

1108
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,158
I'm outside.

1109
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:35,039
I'll be right there soon.

1110
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:44,799
Yang.

1111
00:41:45,158 --> 00:41:46,279
Here, take this too.

1112
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:46,918
Alright.

1113
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:47,479
Put the plastic bag

1114
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:48,678
in the waste funnel.

1115
00:41:59,158 --> 00:41:59,759
Today,

1116
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,319
I went to the pharmacy
to buy medicine.

1117
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:03,519
And I've bought some for you too.

1118
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:06,519
Qin always

1119
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,118
forgets the medicine until it's expired.

1120
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:10,398
It'll be troublesome if she falls sick.

1121
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:11,959
You should prepare some, just in case.

1122
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:13,118
Store the medicine

1123
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:13,999
in that drawer.

1124
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:14,918
Thank you, Mom.

1125
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:16,719
Miss Qin...

1126
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:19,198
Qin Shi will be late

1127
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:20,519
from work, so...

1128
00:42:22,118 --> 00:42:22,759
I know.

1129
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:25,158
She's the busiest person
in this world.

1130
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,358
I'm not here for her.

1131
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,999
I just came to check around.

1132
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:32,438
I go to the bathroom.

1133
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:33,438
Sure.

1134
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:56,559
Your mom comes here.

1135
00:42:58,838 --> 00:42:59,918
Why did she come?

1136
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,479
To give us some food.

1137
00:43:19,438 --> 00:43:21,118
You should enjoy the food then.

1138
00:43:21,118 --> 00:43:21,799
My mom

1139
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:23,319
