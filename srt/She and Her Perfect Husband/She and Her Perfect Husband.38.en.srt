19
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,060
When a lawyer talks seriously

20
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,620
about professional ethics,

21
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,660
he's just trying to cover up the fact

22
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,380
that he has become

23
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,850
a gunman of money or power

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,380
or a legal technician.

25
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,410
Okay, I admit it.

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,690
I have no principles

27
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,460
other than winning the case.

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,940
You have no principles?

29
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,820
You refused me

30
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,900
because of your principles.

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:24,940
Sorry.

32
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,610
I was drunk that day.

33
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,300
But I remember every word

34
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,410
I told you.

35
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,330
I respect your choice.

36
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,020
But let's look at the relationship
and career separately.

37
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:37,970
Please don't refuse

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,660
my help with your work.

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,100
Let's go to the spicy hot pot restaurant

40
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,260
at the school gate.

41
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,180
It's on me.

42
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,770
I still have work to do.

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,770
I'll wait for you

44
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,130
at the school gate at ten o'clock.

45
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,330
How's your mother recently?

46
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,740
My mom passed away three years ago.

47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,850
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,540
It's okay.

49
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,850
I think

50
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,330
it's a relief for her.

51
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,490
How are you doing?

52
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,900
The situation was
a little special last time.

53
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,490
I haven't had time to ask you.

54
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,740
I'm all right.

55
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,540
I can tell it.

56
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,050
I thought

57
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,570
you and Mr. Qiu's daughter have...

58
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,100
I won't do so.

59
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,410
I've said it earlier.

60
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,690
I recall that

61
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,410
I once cursed you angrily that

62
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,260
your career and marriage

63
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,130
would be ruined

64
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,700
and you'd regret

65
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,540
everything you've done.

66
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,980
But then

67
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,010
I saw the news

68
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,980
of Qiu Jianxiang's accident.

69
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,050
I was scared and happy at the same time.

70
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,540
I thought I cursed him too hard.

71
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,890
Look.

72
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,820
I'm not doing well now.

73
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,580
Recalling what happened in the past,

74
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,290
I even thought

75
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,820
it was right that

76
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,450
we weren't together.

77
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,890
I mean it.

78
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,700
I was too stubborn before.

79
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,050
Actually, I feel inferior.

80
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,170
I always feel that

81
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,660
I'm not as good as others.

82
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,700
I was competitive in every aspect.

83
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,860
Even if I got it,

84
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,260
I still felt uneasy.

85
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,140
I think what others give me

86
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,380
is not mine.

87
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,660
I feel insecure.

88
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,940
And I don't know how to cherish it.

89
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,420
What are you going to do after this?

90
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,290
Wait for the verdict.

91
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,330
And then find a way to raise money.

92
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,100
Have you found a way?

93
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,770
I'll give it a try.

94
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,170
Our house relocated before.

95
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,580
I got a small house.

96
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,890
It should be worth

97
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,450
about one million yuan now.

98
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,010
Take a look.

99
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,980
Is there anything you like to eat?

100
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,330
Chocolate flavour.

101
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,010
Give me a piece. Thank you.

102
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,140
You're welcome.

103
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,420
Be careful.

104
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,890
Say goodbye to Uncle and Aunt.

105
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,580
Goodbye, Uncle. Goodbye, Aunt.

106
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,540
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

107
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,450
Thank you.

108
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,380
There's no need.

109
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,860
I didn't help you much.

110
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,050
I appreciate your kindness.

111
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:23,980
We're leaving.

112
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,890
Let's get in the car.

113
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:26,610
Goodbye.

114
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,290
Be careful.

115
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,380
Goodbye.

116
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,210
Goodbye.

117
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,330
I seem to know something amazing.

118
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,940
But I don't have any evidence.

119
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,170
It's hard to say.

120
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,770
And I don't dare to ask.

121
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,380
Do you think

122
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,010
I should tell Qin Shi?

123
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,450
Is he a gentleman,

124
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,140
or he's good to every girl?

125
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,380
(It's true.)

126
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,140
(If you see Yao Yao's son,)

127
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,580
(you'll also doubt it.)

128
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,580
(He looks just like Yang Hua.)

129
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,050
(Yang Hua is serious about this case.)

130
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,890
(No wonder.)

131
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,380
(Yao Yao is his ex-girlfriend, after all.)

132
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,490
Now she's a single mother.

133
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,490
And a weak woman

134
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,210
suffering from social bullying.

135
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,540
It makes me want to protect her as well.

136
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,380
You called me just to tell me this.

137
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,170
Are you getting so bored now?

138
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,450
Isn't it worth gossiping about?

139
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,050
Let me remind you.

140
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,100
You have to be more vigilant

141
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,820
and keep an eye on Yang Hua.

142
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,890
(You know what you think of him.)

143
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,540
(I just kindly remind you.)

144
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,100
It's hard to find

145
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,010
a suitable boyfriend

146
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,450
in this society.

147
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,940
If you let go of him,

148
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,820
they will be a whole family.

149
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,940
These photos don't look good.

150
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,580
That's my skill.

151
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,010
What else do you want it to look like?

152
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,450
Can you take

153
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,260
that kind of photo

154
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
that is casual but beautiful?

155
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,610
Give it a try.

156
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,530
Casual?

157
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,260
Not this kind of angle.

158
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,730
Be natural.

159
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,650
Be natural.

160
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,220
If you keep doing this,

161
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,170
I'll be more unnatural.

162
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,020
Be natural.

163
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,220
Okay. Like this.

164
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,340
Good.

165
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,170
Like this?

166
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:52,900
No.

167
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,820
Delete it.

168
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,970
Delete it.

169
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,410
Miss Qin, the thin face filter

170
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,050
is too over.

171
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,730
I'm out of shape.

172
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,490
Your hair is messy.

173
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,460
Come on. Let's take another photo.

Hello.

183
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,020
Where are you?

184
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,700
I'd better not go.

185
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,530
It's not right.

186
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,630
(Meimei)

187
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,260
Thank you so much.

188
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,140
Let's not say anything else.

189
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,460
Don't think too much.

190
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,530
I'm waiting for you at the company gate.

191
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,000
(Call hold)

192
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,700
Hello.

193
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,580
(Your second brother is missing.)

194
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,820
Hello, Cai Liang.

195
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,290
About the loan application.

196
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,820
Stop it.

197
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,410
Don't rush me, okay?

198
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,780
I made it urgent for you.

199
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,940
You both have divorced, anyway.

200
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,140
What's the hurry?

201
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,730
Please withdraw the loan application for me.

202
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,380
You're not going to buy it?

203
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,490
No, Yang Hua. Think it over.

204
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,580
You've paid the deposit.

205
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,170
(You'll suffer losses)

206
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,700
(if you're not going to buy it.)

207
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,780
Please explain this to the landlord for me.

208
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,730
I'm hanging up.

209
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,380
Hello?

210
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,970
Hello.

211
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,220
Yang Hua? Why are you here?

212
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,170
Meimei asked me to come.

213
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,700
You're finally here, Shi.

214
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,700
I can't get through to your brother.

215
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,820
I'm so worried.

216
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:47,940
What should I do?

217
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,970
Don't worry.

218
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,650
It's about 10 p.m.

219
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,610
What can happen to a man?

220
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,380
Don't you know that

221
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,530
he went to collect the money today?

222
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,580
Your brother carries a cheque of millions.

223
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,460
There are many people at the collection place.

224
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,650
Will something happen to him?

225
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,460
I'm afraid.

226
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,490
Did he go alone?

227
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,140
No, with Bai
from the finance department.

228
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,290
But Bai came back long ago.

229
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,970
He brought back the gifts from

230
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,610
the customers of
the seafood market to me.

231
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,410
He said Wenyu

232
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,780
went to the last shop himself.

233
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,850
Which shop?

234
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,650
I think it'd be safer

235
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,140
to call the police first.

236
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,140
The police don't have
to do anything else

237
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,850
if they go to the bar

238
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,730
to catch a husband fooling around.

239
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,700
Can you drive faster?

240
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,140
Okay.

241
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,530
After I get in,

242
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,220
if someone stops me,

243
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,020
pull him away from me.

244
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,730
Let me do it.

245
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,900
I'll do it.

246
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,530
What are you doing?

247
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,650
- Leave me alone.
- Are you kidding me?

248
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,220
The security guard

249
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,410
may not let you in if you're like this.

250
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,580
Can you use your loaf?

251
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,460
Then what should I do?

252
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,290
You're looking for your brother, right?

253
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,260
I'll go. Wait for me here.

254
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,820
Thank you for coming.

255
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,260
Thank you.

256
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,900
Come on. Let's drink.

257
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,490
What's wrong?

258
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,970
What's the matter?

259
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,140
Why are you standing there?

260
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,170
Go and have a look.

261
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,730
You too.

262
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,900
We'll deal with it immediately.

263
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,490
We'll deal with it right away, okay?

264
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,460
We'll deal with it immediately.

265
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,780
Don't go.

266
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,020
We'll deal with it.

267
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,530
Immediately.

268
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,700
Don't worry, everyone.

269
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,780
Don't go.

270
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,700
Boss, is it all right?

271
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:48,730
It's not all right.

272
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,290
Didn't we pay the electricity bill?

273
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,900
I don't know either.

274
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,140
You don't know?

275
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,260
Go and solve it.

276
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,700
Hurry up. Don't just stand here.

277
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,090
Honestly.

278
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,490
It's been a while.

279
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,820
(Where is he?)

280
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,380

286
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,050

Meimei.

302
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,900
Is it this room?

303
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,410
Room card.

304
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:52,850
Meimei.

305
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,460
We just saw the surveillance video.

306
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,780
Wenyu is really drunk.

307
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,730
He's drunk. He...

308
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,090
Room card!

309
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,250
She has to face this.

310
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,740
(It's said that women are weak
until they become mothers.)

311
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,940
(But how many people know that)

312
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,740
(the moment a woman becomes a mother)

313
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,770
(is also her most vulnerable moment?)

314
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,580
(If there was no one to rely on,)

315
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,650
(no room for retreat and in danger,)

316
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,890
(who would burst out of a small universe)

317
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,460
(in a peaceful life?)

318
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,010
(But as a mother,)

319
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,250
(she has to become)

320
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,250
(the strongest fortress in the world.)

321
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,650
(And she has the softest heart in the world.)

322
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Sunny.

323
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,050
Do you know that I love you?

324
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,460
Go to sleep. Goodnight.

325
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,820
Goodnight, Mom.

326
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,580
I'll turn off the light.

327
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,370
Mom.

328
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,170
I hope you can still be a soldier.

329
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,100
The enemy I meet now is too strong.

330
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,050
What if I lose?

331
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,100
Mom, you told me

332
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,980
victory or defeat is temporary.

333
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,940
If you lose this time,

334
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,250
you'll know what your shortcomings are.

335
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,100
You'll become stronger next time.

336
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,220
So it's not terrible to lose.

344
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,620
She's asleep.

345
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,010
Then I...

346
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,650
Are you hungry?

347
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,820
Let me order something for you to eat.

348
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,580
You're eating takeout again.

349
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,250
You know my cooking skill.

350
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,370
Have you moved back home?

351
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,410
Not yet.

352
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,130
I rented a house temporarily.

353
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,700
Do you get used to it?

354
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,010
Not really.

355
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,650
But I may adapt to it.

356
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,050
By the way, I finally understand

357
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,250
why you're afraid of getting married.

358
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,650
The last time when they had a conflict

359
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,980
and caused chaos,

360
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,650
I could feel that

361
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,940
Meimei actually enjoyed it.

362
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,700
But she was unusually calm this time.

363
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,890
But I think her calmness

364
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,460
is more terrifying than her outburst.

365
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,860
A marriage with problems

366
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,580
will really wear a person out.

367

You know clearly what you did.

452
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,820
Are you here today

453
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,820
to talk about business

454
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,940
or personal matters?

455
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,890
I know

456
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,890
you're in a bad condition.

457
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:09,980

458
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,250
make Yang Hua misunderstand

459
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,220
that he's the father of your child?

460
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,890
It's shameless of you to do so.

461
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,860

462

you look like a good student

465
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,740
Reading more is a good thing.

466
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:28,890
But people who read a lot

467

They're very reasonable.

469
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,290
It's no use being only reasonable
in this society.

470
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,290
Shameless. Shame on you.

471
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,050
I didn't use such childish lines

472
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,170
in quarrelling

473
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,580

474
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,250
And how do you know

475
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,250
I mislead him?

476
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,340
What are you trying to say?

477
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,820
Turn off your recording.

478
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,820
What recording?

479
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,130
One more.

480
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,940
I don't know how much

481
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,890
you know about Yang Hua.

482
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,250
He seems very open-minded

483
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,620
about everything,

484
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,740
but he cares about

485
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
the people he loves.

486
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,050
Do you agree with that?

487
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,410
In fact, there's a turning point

488
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,370
in this case.

489
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,010
As long as you cooperate with me,

490
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,940
I can win over it.

491
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,500
Cooperate with you?

492
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,700
As far as I know,

493
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,500
you've always been

494
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,530
on the side of Yin Zhiqiang.

495
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,740
But I'm not Yin Zhiqiang's lawyer.

496
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,740
I'm Tianhang's lawyer.

497
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,500
What I have to do

498
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,770
is to protect the interests of Tianhang

499
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,340
to the greatest extent.

500
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:57,820
Miss Qin.

501
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,010
What are you trying to say?

502
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,170
I want you to withdraw the lawsuit.

503
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,410
I look forward to working with you.

504
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,220
Me too.

505
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,100
And I don't care about
your past relationship with Yang Hua.

506
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,770
Whether Sunny is his son or not,

507
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,530
he's mine now.

508
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,170
If you dare to lay hands on him,

509
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,130
I won't let you go

510
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,220
whether I can beat you.

511
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,290
She left. Why haven't you come out yet?

512
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,820
You heard what Miss Qin said just now.

513
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,740
What's wrong with you two?

514
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,130
Why didn't you tell your wife

515
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,340
before you did anything?

516
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,580
She looked like

517
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,050
she would eat me alive.

518
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,460
She's always so reckless.

519
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,170
I didn't know

520
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,250
how she became a lawyer.

521
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,250
For goodness' sake.

522
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,700
I'm annoyed enough.

523
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,890
Yet, you come to me

524
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:13,890
and show off your affection.

525
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
But Yang Hua,

526
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,130
you were not so considerate before.

527
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,980
I used to be annoying, right?

528
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,650
A little.

529
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,410
You changed so much

530
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,500
because of her, right?

531
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,340
If Miss Qin really did

532
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,820
what she just said,

533
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,530
would her law firm make things
difficult for her?

534
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,740
That's what I should worry about.

535
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,170
Then can I trust her?

536
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,250
Absolutely.

537
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,890
She's a good lawyer.

538
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,890
I'll try then.

539
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:52,940
Oh, right.

540
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,740
Take the money back.

541
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,650
There's no need.

542
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,370
You don't owe me anything.

543
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,650
Take the money.

544
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,500
You'll use it later.

545
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,460
I can earn it more.

546
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,340
But don't tell Qin Shi

547
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,770
what I just said.

548
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,740
It seems you really like her.

549
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,340
I'm leaving.

550
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,340
Meimei.

551
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,100
You're not up yet.

552
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,890
She's not here.

553
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,530
That's great.

554
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,340
I was scared.

555
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,100
Really.

556
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,830
(Portfolio Qin Wenyu)

557
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,020
(Missed call Qin Shi Missed call Meimei)

558
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,570
(I'll send the photo to Mrs. Qin)

559
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,090
(if you don't give me a rent reduction.)

560
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,540
Pick up the phone.

561
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,020
(Hello, the number you've dialed)

562
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,980
(has opened the inquiry reminder service.)

563
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,060
Meimei.

564
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,260
I'm home. Where are you?

565
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,780
Well.

566
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,850
Come back and tell me
what you want to say.

567
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,410
I know I was wrong.

568
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,130
You can beat me or scold me
when you come back.

569
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,460
Let me explain it.

570
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,130
I really know I was wrong.

571
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,700
Come back first.

572
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,990
(Qin Wenyu
The message has been sent but rejected.)

573
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:00,540
I...

574
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,170
Hello.

575
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,540
Where did you hide Meimei?

576
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,170
(Let me tell you.)

577
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,540
(Meimei is now pregnant.)

578
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,060
If something happens to her,

579
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,330
I won't spare you.

580
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,330
I was framed.

581
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,370
I really went to collect
the rent yesterday.

582
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,020
Hu set me up.

583
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,460
I don't know anything.

584
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,540
I don't even know

585
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,370
how I got into the hotel.

586
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,330
What can I do?

587
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,570
I didn't do anything.

588
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,740
Qin Shi, please.

589
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,540
Trust me.

590
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,850
Every word I said is true.

591
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,980
If I lied,

592
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,370
I'd be hit to death by a car

593
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,330
or killed by thunder.

594
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,220
I trust you.

595
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,090
Thank you.

596
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,060
You're my sister, indeed.

597
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,300
Where's Meimei?

598
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,370
I don't know where Meimei is.

599
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,500
Qin Shi!

600
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,130
It's what Meimei told me.

601
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,260
Listen to it.

602
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:52,090
(Qin Shi, I'm going out for a walk.)

603
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,850
(Don't worry.)

604
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,740
(I won't do anything stupid.)

605
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,740
(I understand all the situations)

606
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,220
(you analyzed with me.)

607
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,650
(I know)

608
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,650
(you may be right.)

609
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,540
(Wenyu might be drunk)

610
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,700
(and was set up.)

611
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,260
Go upstairs first.

612
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,980
I'll go home and pack some clothes

613
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,170
before I come to accompany you.

614
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,650
It's okay. I can go up myself.

615
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,940
Well, I'm not going back.

616
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,170
I'll go upstairs with you.

617
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,460
Well, I'm really all right.

618
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,410
I want to be alone for a while.

619
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,850
Please.

620
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,650
(I couldn't fall asleep.)

621
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,740
(I lied in bed thinking a lot.)

622
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,980
(I forgave him again and again.)

623
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,090
(I was betrayed again and again.)

624
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,700
(I was heartbroken again and again.)

625
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,370
(We reconciled again and again.)

626
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,370
(What do I love,)

627
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,060
(look forward to,)

628
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,940
(and what can't I let go of)

629
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,300
(in this marriage?)

630
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,090
(The answer is simple.)

631
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,540
(I love Wenyu.)

632
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,780
(This kind of love has become a habit)

633
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,610
(and a dependence.)

634
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,410
(I was really scared)

635
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,130
(when I knew that I'm pregnant.)

636
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,060
(I don't know)

637
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,370
(if Wenyu can be a good father.)

638
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,500
(I have no confidence at all.)

639
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,220
(When I stood in the hotel room,)

640
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,130
(this fear)

641
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,090
(turned into a great fear.)

642
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,940
(I didn't know how to face)

643
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,220
(what I was going to see.)

644
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,740
(If he cheated on me,)

645
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,370
(how could I face all this?)

646
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,460
(How can I take care)

647
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,130
(of my child alone?)

648
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,810
(But it's not the most horrible thing.)

649
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,940
(The most horrible thing is that)

650
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,410
(even if Wenyu doesn't cheat this time,)

651
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,810
(how about the next time?)

652
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,020
(And the next time?)

653
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,330
(When I thought of this,)

654
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,610
(I found that)

655
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,300
(I had completely lost)

656
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,890
(my trust in Wenyu.)

657
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,850
(Many people say that)

658
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,460
(it's either cheating several times
or not even once.)

659
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,220
(I believe it.)

660
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,540
(I don't want)

661
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,260
(to be a resentful wife.)

662
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,060
(I hate to be suspicious)

663
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,810
(and check his phone)

664
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,810
(all day long.)

665
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,810
(I don't want to play)

666
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,300
(the chase game anymore.)

667
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,020
(Shi.)

668
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,170
(I'll leave the rest )

669
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,780
(to you.)

670
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,740
(Wenyu may not stand it)

671
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,540
(and come to me.)

672
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,370
(Persuade him.)

673
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,170
Meimei won't go.

674
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,130
How about the company if she leaves?

675
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,980
She won't leave the company behind.

676
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,650
She won't leave Mom alone.

677
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,540
And me, right?

678
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,370
She just went out for a walk in anger.

679
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,570
Qin Shi.

680
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,850
Take me to find Meimei back.

681
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,740
Qin Wenyu.

682
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,500
I really can't help you this time.

683
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,060
A completely disheartened woman

684
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,780
can leave in many ways.

685
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,410
No.

686
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,130
If you hadn't instigated Meimei,

687
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,940
she wouldn't have left.
You're responsible for it.

688
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,460
You asked me to be responsible for it?

689
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,540
It's your marriage.

690
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,220
Did I make Meimei angry again and again?

691
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,220
Did I ask you to hang out

692
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,810
with those bad friends every day?

693
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,980
Did I make you surrounded

694
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:54,980
by so many women every day?

695
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,570
How dare you tell me that.

696
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,570
You don't deserve anyone to help you

697
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,370
just because you said that.

698
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,330
I was not worried every time

699
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,980
you quarreled with each other,

700
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,810
no matter how fierce it was.

701
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,170
I don't think

702
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,780
you two will be apart at all.

703
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,220
I know how much

704
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,700
you love each other.

705
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,810
Because every time

706
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,020
you look at each other,

707
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,060
there's light in your eyes.

708
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,170
But it's different this time.

709
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,410
It's useless for me to say anything.

710
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,060
I think I can't help you this time.

711
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,330
I know you feel bad.

712
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,850
The one who left may feel upset too.

713
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,890
Whenever you feel

714
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,410
you should reconcile,

715
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,980
it consumes your trust and affection.

716
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,940
Take responsibility for your life.

717
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,130
I've said enough

718
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,570
about this.

719
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,060
I don't want to say anymore.

720
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,060
No matter what decision Meimei made,

721
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,980
you'd better

722
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,300
live your own life first.
