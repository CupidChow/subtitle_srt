19
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:56,619
Listen to me.

20
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:57,738
It's not what you think.

21
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:58,418
I've asked you

22
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,579
to cooperate with
the public relation department

23
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:00,619
and never let Qin Shi

24
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:01,818
to interfere in this.

25
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,299
Why didn't you listen to me?

26
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,538
Why did you investigate the client
secretly?

27
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,738
Calm down.

28
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:10,178
Tao Junhui, don't ever try

29
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:11,578
to convince me with those craps.

30
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:13,139
You're the prosecuting attorney.

31
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:14,979
You represent the interest of Dongna.

32
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:15,818
Of course I know

33
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,018
whose interest I'm representing.

34
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:18,859
Avoiding the wrong strategy

35
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:20,419
to cause dire consequences

36
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:22,298
is also for the sake of the client's interest.

37
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:23,619
We don't have evidence now.

38
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:25,098
Making a quick buck will

39
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:26,499
only cause a bigger problem.

40
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:28,178
How am I making a quick buck?

41
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,018
The incident happened in the room.

42
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:31,738
If Yao Yao performed

43
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:32,979
any improper behaviour,

44
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,658
we don't have any evidence.

45
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:36,458
But we have an independent witness.

46
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:37,499
You mean Mr. Duan?

47
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:38,059
Yes.

48
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:39,658
Do you know why he clashed with Yao Yao?

49
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:40,178
Why?

50
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:41,578
He went to the hotel

51
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,619
and ordered room service.

52
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:43,658
When the servant went to his room,

53
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,339
he was naked
without feeling ashamed.

54
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:45,938
What is this called?

55
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,259
It's called sexual harassment.

56
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,059
Are you a fool?

57
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:50,979
You even believe in this kind

58
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,779
of rumour and false accusation.

59
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,298
I've verified it from many sources.

60
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,139
It's not only in Tianhang,

61
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:57,139
Mr. Duan's personality is also

62
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:59,378
well known in the industry,
everyone knows

63
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:00,818
that he has this kind of proclivity.

64
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:02,458
Same thing will happen

65
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,859
in every hotel he goes.

66
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,818
Yao Yao was the only one
who turned on him.

67
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:07,899
If you admit what this guy said

68
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,818
as testimony,

69
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,178
what will happen in the end?

70
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:12,339
I don't care.

71
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:14,219
It's the third day already.

72
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,178
If Tianhang Hotel

73
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:16,139
doesn't respond to this,

74
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:17,059
we'll press charges against them.

75
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:18,419
Sueing them is unfavorable to us.

76
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,339
The best is to settle out of court.

77
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,339
I've said it.

78
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:27,098
I don't accept

79
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,378
any form of settlement.

80
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:31,339
Wu told me

81
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:32,699
that you Cheng & Hui

82
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:33,938
is the best law firm.

83
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,499
That you can surely help me.

84
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,298
You agreed with everything
I said back then.

85
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:39,738
Now, you actually tell me

86
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:40,979
to reconcile with them.

87
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:42,938
In the face of this kind of injustice,

88
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:44,979
tolerance will become
the connivance of bad deeds.

89
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,059
The prime law firm? My foot.

90
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:48,619
You can say it
if you don't want to help me.

91
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,298
There are many lawyers

92
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:50,818
out there willing to be
my defense attorney.

93
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:52,699
Calm down, Dongna.

94
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:53,899
We found that this is

95
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,378
the best solution for you

96
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:57,578
after our internal discussion.

97
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,539
You're quite skillful.

98
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:27,698
That you're able to find

99
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,258
this evidence in just a few days.

100
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,059
Which side are you on?

101
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:35,418
Dongna,

102
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:36,779
you're our client.

103
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:38,978
We're certainly on your side.

104
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:42,779
Ms. He,

105
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:44,578
we have to prepare

106
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:46,298
all the offensive
and defensive materials.

107
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:47,698
We must not only prepare

108
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:48,698
our offensive materials.

109
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:49,978
We also need to stand
in their point of view

110
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:51,619
to close our defensive loopholes.

111
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:53,499
So that we can ensure foolproof

112
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,819
and increase our chances of success.

113
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:55,978
Yes.

114
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,978
The hotel has the original version of the video.

115
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:00,738
If we press charges against them,

116
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,858
they'll hand this evidence to the court.

117
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,539
The court won't care about this,

118
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,298
but the media will be
interested in such a twist.

119
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,858
Of course, you don't have to worry.

120
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:14,738
You were injured in the hotel.

121
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:15,899
This is an undeniable fact.

122
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,138
I'm sure there won't be a problem
to ask for compensation.

123
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:20,099
After consideration of the case,

124
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:21,779
I think settling it out of court is

125
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,138
the most feasible solution.

126
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:26,978
Not a chance.

127
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:28,659
Sue them right now.

128
00:05:33,738 --> 00:05:34,379
Ms. He.

129
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:35,339
Dongna.

130
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:36,138
Let's do it this way.

131
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,619
I'll discuss with my dad.

132
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,738
We'll change the PR strategy.

133
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,418
No, there's no need to change anything.

134
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:42,939
Let's do it as we planned.

135
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,738
Even if we file a lawsuit,

136
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:46,899
as the final result,

137
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:48,539
they'll only pay for your medical bills.

138
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:49,939
We've spent

139
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,619
so much time and efforts.

140
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:52,978
The point is it'll cause

141
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,539
impact to your personal reputation.

142
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:56,178
This is the most adverse effect.

143
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,298
It's not that I want this.

144
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:03,018
But someone forces me to do this.

145
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:09,978
Who?

146
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:14,619
Tianhang Hotel.

147
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:16,659
Qiao,

148
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,178
why did you tell Wang Jiesen

149
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,339
things about me?

150
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:21,258
Qin Shi,

151
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,018
I wasn't talking about you.

152
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:24,619
We were just talking

153
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,738
about the formation
of the lawyer of the law firm

154
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:29,339
and a number of initiatives

155
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:30,219
aimed at talent mobility.

156
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:32,099
I only took you as an example.

157
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:34,418
Why would you use me as an example?

158
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:35,738
Well, then,

159
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:36,458
who else should I use
as an example?

160
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:37,539
You're the best example.

161
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,298
It's lively, distinct and active.

162
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,059
Isn't it?

163
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:42,258
What else did you tell him?

164
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:43,219
Don't worry.

165
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:44,258
I only answered his questions.

166
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:49,578
Let me tell you this.

167
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:53,458
I am clear-minded, right?

168
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:54,339
You know me.

169
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:55,178
I'll be sure to say

170
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,258
something good about you.

171
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:58,738
You're smart and talented, right?

172
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:01,138
Your husband is a business elite.

173
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:01,819
Right?

174
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:02,819
In order to pursue your careers,

175
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:04,499
you two would rather live separately.

176
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:07,178
But you're still loyal
towards each other.

177
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,339
You strike a balance
between love and career.

178
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,779
You're the model of the career women.

179
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:11,858
Right?

180
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:18,899
Qiao, you must not be held captive.

181
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:21,099
The enemy won't have to torture you.

182
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,258
And you'll surely tell them everything.

183
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:25,819
Well,

184
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:27,298
you can't say that about me.

185
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,379
I'm tight-lipped.

186
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,219
Right?

187
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:31,339
Moreover,

188
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:32,819
how could Mr. Wang

189
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,298
be our enemy?

190
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:36,539
He's our ally.

191
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:39,659
We don't necessarily take up He Dongna's case.

192
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:41,059
Why does he become our ally?

193
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:42,698
Why?

194
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:44,819
He sent one over

195
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,138
to do an in-depth study.

196
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:47,418
From investigation to investment,

197
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,099
there are many things in between.

198
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,059
If we don't do well in this case,

199
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:51,738
how could her husband

200
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,178
continue to invest in us?

201
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,978
Not quite.

202
00:07:59,458 --> 00:07:59,939
Mr. Wang.

203
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,099
Quick, please take a seat.

204
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,379
I remember that Miss Qin told me

205
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,458
that whether the client is a victim

206
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:11,659
or a perpetrator,

207
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,819
the lawyer will put them
on an equal footing.

208
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:15,458
This is the duty of a lawyer.

209
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,458
And as an investor,

210
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,698
the only reference point to consider

211
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:22,258
whether an enterprise or a project is

212
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,499
worthwhile to invest in is

213
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,099
its earning potential
and development prospect.

214
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:28,138
Besides, as far as I know,

215
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:29,819
Mrs. Hu seems to have

216
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:31,418
a great conversation with Madam Tang.

217
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,138
That everything has gone smoothly.

218
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,938
So I don't understand

219
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,979
why Miss Qin has so little confidence
in this case.

220
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,779
Did you know something else

221
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:42,899
that you can't talk about?

222
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:44,698
I have no idea.

223
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:45,779
I'm not in charge of this case.

224
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:48,099
This way, please.

225
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:53,618
I'm okay from here, Madam Tang.

226
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,979
Dongna, everything will go

227
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,419
according to the solution we agreed.

228
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:58,739
Just rest assured.

229
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,018
Wu Fei, send Dongna off for me.

230
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,859
(It's not right, it shouldn't be.)

231
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:14,378
See?

232
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,138
Everything goes well.

233
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,899
Is there something I can do for you?

234
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:20,818
Yes.

235
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:23,138
Perfect, you guys continue.

236
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:24,058
I'll get going.

237
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:24,818
Don't go, Qiao.

238
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,659
Mr. Wang must've wanted
to talk about work.

239
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:28,339
It's related to you.

240
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,058
It's a private affair.

241
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:34,339
See?

242
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:35,378
Okay, then, I'll let you guys talk.

243
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:36,058
I'm leaving.

244
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,000
(Indictment)

245
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:03,859
What do you want from me,
Mr. Wang?

246
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:06,419
Miss Qin,

247
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,419
I think you've been

248
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:10,539
very hostile towards me
for a long time.

249
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:12,058
Can I know why?

250
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,578
I don't.

251
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:17,458
You're our potential investor.

252
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,018
Why would I be hostile towards you?

253
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:19,859
It's not right.

254
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:21,698
To me,

255
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:23,618
you're a strong woman

256
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:25,979
who dares to speak out, act
and take responsibility.

257
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,539
Being polite is unlike you.

258
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:30,419
We're going to spend

259
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:32,258
a long time together in future.

260
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:34,018
So I hope that you could

261
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:36,818
always remain honest with me.

262
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:40,818
Honesty is not a unilateral action.

263
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:43,099
Of course.

264
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:44,539
I'll also tell you
everything I know

265
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:45,419
without reserve.

266
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,058
Then, can you please tell me

267
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,458
if the person who made Yang Hua invest

268
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:54,779
in Haibo Biology back then was Qiu Jianxiang?

269
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:57,018
Yes.

270
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:00,539
You said you'd testify for him that time.

271
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:03,779
Why did you pass the buck
to him in the end?

272
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,938
You're indeed a lawyer.

273
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,018
The question you raise is different.

274
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:10,299
Please answer my question.

275
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:13,339
The reason is simple.

276
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:15,659
Even if I told the truth,

277
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,618
there wouldn't be any changes either.

278
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,179
After all, we were working for Mr. Qiu.

279
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:23,899
Only defending Mr. Qiu
can promise us a better future.

280
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:25,299
Moreover,

281
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,899
the matter of a subordinate taking
the blame

282
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,179
for the boss has happened before.

283
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:33,018
Besides, Mr. Qiu was very nice to us.

284
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:34,818
Without Mr. Qiu,

285
00:11:35,138 --> 00:11:37,179
I wouldn't have built my reputation.

286
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:39,938
And who else would let a kid

287
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,018
like Yang Hua operate the trading?

288
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:46,458
Our industry seems glamorous,

289
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,539
but it all depends on our achievements.

290
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:51,179
Yang Hua was too young back then.

291
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:53,058
He didn't understand this.

292
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:56,219
You could even sugarcoat

293
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,779
such a shameless matter,

294
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:58,859
I'm impressed.

295
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:02,058
With Miss Qin's intelligence,

296
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:05,458
I suppose you should understand this.

297
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,179
I'm not proud of

298
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,979
what I did back then.

299
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:10,779
But all I can say is that

300
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,979
I'd still do the same thing if I was given

301
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:15,938
another chance.

302
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:19,299
Okay, I got it.

303
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,258
Is there anything else?

304
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:22,179
Yes, there is.

305
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:23,378
Same thing.

306
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:25,899
I'd like to invite you to dinner.

307
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:30,378
If you're worried
that Yang Hua'd be jealous,

308
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:32,018
you can ask him to join us.

309
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:36,578
I was going to invite you two

310
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:38,979
with sincere heart.

311
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,258
I also sincerely

312
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,339
think it's not necessary.

313
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:44,818
Qin Shi,

314
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,018
Yang Hua is a talent

315
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:48,018
in the investment area.

316
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,018
Don't you think it's a shame

317
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,498
to let a talent like him

318
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:53,618
sit at home everyday and stay jobless?

319
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,378
I'd really like to help him.

320
00:12:57,739 --> 00:12:59,378
Who said Yang Hua is jobless?

321
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,339
He's very busy.

322
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:02,539
Qin Shi,

323
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:04,258
actually, the investment industry is

324
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,058
not huge, it's not small either.

325
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:07,419
What I know is

326
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:09,618
way more than you think.

327
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:13,899
There's a question that I just

328
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:14,739
couldn't understand.

329
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,219
Why must you package

330
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,779
a person who doesn't work as an elite?

331
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,138
What good would it do you?

332
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,258
Is it simply just to feed

333
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:27,339
your ego and vanity?

334
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:29,458
Then,

335
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:30,859
I heard from Qiao

336
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,258
that you got married

337
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:34,018
with Yang Hua in foreign country.

338
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:35,859
You even got a kid.

339
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,018
It makes me more confused.

340
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:40,659
Why would you tell so many lies?

341
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:44,458
I like to figure things out.

342
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:46,899
These questions keep lingering

343
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:48,339
in my mind.

344
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,138
I can't find the answer.

345
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,938
Who should I ask?

346
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,458
Should I just ask Madam Tang?

347
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,419
Mr. Wang,

348
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:05,979
I think there's a misunderstanding.

349
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:09,938
Oh,

350
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:11,258
is that so?

351
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:12,899
There's a misunderstanding?

352
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:14,539
Maybe.

353
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:16,698
Rest assured, Miss Qin.

354
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:18,258
This is the secret

355
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:19,179
between us both.

356
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:21,018
I won't tell anyone about it.

357
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:23,539
You set up a time.

358
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,618
I'll pick the location.

359
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:26,138
But this time,

360
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,779
(Partner Counsel)
do not stand me up.

361
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,640
(Partner Counsel)

362
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,378
(Partner Counsel)
Or I'll get mad.

363
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:45,899
I'm done eating.

364
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,539
What is it? Just say it.

365
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,099
Are you still mad?

366
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:50,458
Didn't you think

367
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:51,258
everything you do is right?

368
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,779
Why would I be mad?

369
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:55,258
I'm not going to be

370
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:56,378
He Dongna's attorney.

371
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,219
Why?

372
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:00,339
As the case

373
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:01,859
has progressed to this point,

374
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:04,539
it might be better to leave it
to someone else.

375
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,099
Are you out of your mind?

376
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:09,219
If it wasn't you who handled this case,

377
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:10,339
why would I ask Dongna

378
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:11,498
to come to Cheng & Hui?

379
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:14,018
I know, this is for my own good.

380
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:16,299
- Just that...
- No.

381
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:18,339
It must be you
who handles this case.

382
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,179
The situation has become clear now.

383
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,058
It's a sure win.

384
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:24,219
Why do you refuse to take it?

385
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:27,339
My dad and I have worked so hard.

386
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,739
It's for nobody else but you.

387
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,899
What are you laughing at?

388
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,458
This is not a complicated case.

389
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,419
There are many big cases
in my hands.

390
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:40,899
You were quite smart back then.

391
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:42,578
Why are you so silly now?

392
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,899
I didn't want to say this.

393
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:52,498
But now, I must say it.

394
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:55,299
Madam Tang promised me

395
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:57,179
that as long as you solve this case

396
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:58,138
and handle Hu Ping,

397
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,458
you could immediately become a partner.

398
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:05,018
When did this happen?

399
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:12,659
Thank you.

400
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,138
Wu Fei already told me

401
00:16:25,138 --> 00:16:26,219
the term when she gave me

402
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:28,539
this case of He Dongna.

403
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:31,859
The inheritor of the family business is

404
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:33,498
not necessarily sophisticated

405
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:35,458
but when it comes to quid pro quo,

406
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:36,698
she's quite skillful.

407
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,299
Tao Junhui is their future son-in-law.

408
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,258
It's normal for them to pave his way.

409
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:43,659
Yes.

410
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:45,698
Tao Junhui is very lucky

411
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,099
to be able to get a wife like this.

412
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:49,659
He's got a great future.

413
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:52,258
What do you think?

414
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:57,419
What do you think?

415
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:00,698
This question of yours is misleading.

416
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:04,218
No.

417
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:08,978
I've told you that I was looking into the leads

418
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,258
of He Dongna's case.

419
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:11,218
I didn't do anything rash.

420
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,098
Of course, I know.

421
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:15,098
So I was close to Tao Junhui

422
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:17,459
just to complete the task you assigned me.

423
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,498
That's right.

424
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:20,978
But do you two really already

425
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:23,579
cut ties with each other?

426
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:26,419
I won't go back to him.

427
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,018
I'm not interested in him.

428
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,338
Great, then.

429
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:35,218
A person of business is

430
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:36,939
most afraid of experiencing
setbacks in relationships,

431
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:38,978
regardless of gender.

432
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:41,378
Look at those bosses of large firms.

433
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:44,098
All of them are very smart.

434
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,579
They're quick-witted
while talking business.

435
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:47,419
They've avoided many traps

436
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:48,459
and experienced a lot of failures.

437
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:51,179
They struggle until they're fifty

438
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:52,138
and finally achieve success.

439
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,138
Yet, they meet

440
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:54,899
those 20-year-old young girls.

441
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:55,738
Game over.

442
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:57,738
As they've never dated before,

443
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:59,498
it's shown

444
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:02,059
that they're inexperienced in relationships.

445
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:03,819
You're right.

446
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:06,498
I've handled at least hundreds

447
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:07,618
of divorce cases like this.

448
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:08,899
I've seen enough of it.

449
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:12,098
It's easy to be a bystander.

450
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:14,338
It sounds like famous last words.

451
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:15,819
Do you think

452
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,179
only men would fall for this?

453
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:18,819
So would women.

454
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:19,699
Besides, women are more likely

455
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:21,498
to get carried away in a relationship.

456
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,138
They'll easily fall in love

457
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:27,579
no matter it's in the commercial
competition or at the workplace.

458
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:30,258
Well, Yang Hua and I always

459
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,978
have a great relationship.

460
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,218
We get along so well.

461
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:35,738
We always will.

462
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:37,618
Okay, fine.

463
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:39,978
Since you already put it this way,

464
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:41,819
let me give you some warning.

465
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:44,059
Tao Junhui is not the only person

466
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,378
benefited from Wu Fei's doing.

467
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,779
Tell me, what else is it?

468
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:49,738
I want you to fire Qin Shi.

469
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:56,179
What are you laughing at?

470
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:58,699
Just tell me if you'll do it or not.

471
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:04,258
You knew how much legal fee

472
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:07,299
we can earn from He Dongna's case.

473
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:09,459
But do you know

474
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,978
how much money Qin Shi makes

475
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:11,738
for Cheng & Hui in a year?

476
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,098
With a case like this,

477
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:15,939
you want me to fire a competent staff?

478
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:19,218
Would you do this if you were me?

479
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,659
He Dongna's case is just a starter.

480
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:26,939
Do you know

481
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:28,018
who her husband is?

482
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:29,659
Who is he?

483
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:31,738
It's someone

484
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,498
who you want most.

485
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:40,779
No wonder you care so much

486
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:41,939
about this case.

487
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:43,498
It turns out you have
an ulterior motive.

488
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:45,659
So you already promised her?

489
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:49,978
We've known each other for so long.

490
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:51,899
Don't you know me?

491
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,338
I'm not into office politics.

492
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:56,258
I hate to stab people

493
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:57,378
behind their backs.

494
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:59,618
Since she wanted to set you up,
well,

495
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:00,858
then, I'll give you

496
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,218
a chance to fight back.

497
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:03,779
Or it's unfair to you.

498
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:05,858
That's why you asked me

499
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:07,138
to approach Wang Jiesen.

500
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,338
She's his lover.

501
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:12,939
I'm nobody.

502
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:13,939
How can I compare with her?

503
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,299
Besides, I won't use the casting couch.

504
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,738
What nonsense is this?

505
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:23,098
Come here.

506
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,378
He Dongna is getting divorced.

507
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:27,779
He Dongna is getting divorced?

508
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:28,699
Is that for real?

509
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,218
They're negotiating terms now.

510
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:32,659
But it seems like

511
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:33,779
she just won't budge.

512
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:34,978
Her attorney is

513
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:36,659
Liang Weihong from Sida Law Firm.

514
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:40,299
Miss Liang?

515
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:42,539
Then, I guess this is true.

516
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,299
No wonder Wang Jiesen told me

517
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:48,618
that He Dongna's case has

518
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,579
nothing to do with their consideration
of the investment.

519
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:53,218
So do you understand it now?

520
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,018
Then, do you still want me

521
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,098
to get someone else
to assist Wang Jiesen?

522
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:10,098
Someone has never been in court before.

523
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:12,699
So it's normal to feel a bit nervous.

524
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,779
Li Dai is not bad
at fighting a court case.

525
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,539
She'll lead you.

526
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:18,738
Just say what you should by then.

527
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,939
Ignore the rest.

528
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:21,699
That case of Qiu Jianxiang

529
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:23,018
is the public prosecution.

530
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,018
The other party will ask you
questions as well.

531
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:26,699
Just say what you know.

532
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:27,419
And ignore the others.

533
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:28,539
Got it?

534
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:33,539
I think you shouldn't go.

535
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:37,779
I'm alright, don't worry.

536
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:43,659
I trust you.

537
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:54,699
Here he comes.

538
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,500
(Impartial justice)

539
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:09,819
Witness, please testify.

540
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:12,498
Mr. Yang Hua,

541
00:22:13,338 --> 00:22:14,539
according to your resume,

542
00:22:14,978 --> 00:22:16,618
you used to work for Canada

543
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,338
Hengli Finance Co. Ltd before.

544
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,659
May I ask what was
your job position that time?

545
00:22:20,978 --> 00:22:22,018
I was a fund manager.

546
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,179
Do the prosecutors admit

547
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:25,738
the identity of the expert witness?

548
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:26,978
We don't.

549
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:28,659
As they were superior and inferior,

550
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,138
so we doubt

551
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:32,299
about the impartiality
of the witness's testimony.

552
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:34,899
(Chief Judge)
The tribunal authorises it.

553
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:37,939
(Chief Judge)
Expert witness, please state your opinion.

554
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:39,618
All rise.

555
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,820
(Attorney Plaintiff)

556
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:43,819
(Judge Chief Judge Judge)
The point of contention of this case is

557
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:45,858
whether Yao Yao has fulfilled
the obligation

558
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:47,738
(Defendant Attorney)
to serve the in-house guests

559
00:22:47,738 --> 00:22:47,978
(Defendant Attorney)

560
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,179
(Defendant Attorney)
as the hotel manager.

561
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,138
If she has performed improper behaviour

562
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:52,899
like invading the consumer's right.

563
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:54,258
The point of contention of this case is

564
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:55,218
whether the defendant has

565
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:56,899
a proper reason to make the decision

566
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,659
to sell off the stock he managed.

567
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,498
Only the people who are familiar
with his operational ideas

568
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,659
can give the right answer.

569
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:04,059
It's right for the defendant

570
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,659
to decide to divest the holdings

571
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:07,939
in Meimei Healthcare.

572
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:11,539
Did you get bitten

573
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:12,899
(Defense Counsel)
by Ms. He Dongna?

574
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:13,978
It was my fault.

575
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:15,858
I was notified to go

576
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:16,939
to the suite room.

577
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:18,779
I saw Miss Yao having

578
00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:20,699
a great fight with the customer.

579
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:22,018
Miss Yao asked me

580
00:23:22,018 --> 00:23:22,899
to hold the customer for her.

581
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:25,098
Maybe it was because

582
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:27,179
I pulled her too hard.

583
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:28,378
Tong, don't talk nonsense.

584
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,258
Defendant,

585
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,179
don't influence the statement
of the witness.

586
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,138
Based on the data

587
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:36,618
from the enterprise analytical report

588
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,930
(Witness Prosecutor)
of Meimei Healthcare you provided,

589
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,459
the conclusion I've come up is

590
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:41,179
the same with that of the defendant.

591
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:42,899
There's a high mobility of staff

592
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:43,978
in medical aesthetic industry.

593
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:45,978
But this report shows

594
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:48,138
that Meimei Healthcare has
increased its turnover

595
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:49,258
up to 50 percent

596
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:51,299
for three consecutive years.

597
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:52,858
(Chief Judge)
With such a good sales condition,

598
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:55,299
it shouldn't be a negative growth
in the number of staff.

599
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:58,138
(Defense Counsel)
So it's a false accusation

600
00:23:58,419 --> 00:23:59,659
towards my client.

601
00:24:00,258 --> 00:24:02,138
That day, I received call
from Miss Yao.

602
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:03,738
She asked me to go
to the Presidential Suite.

603
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:05,498
She said there was
an agitated customer.

604
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,419
Causing a scene.

605
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:08,018
When I arrived at the scene,

606
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:10,179
I found that the customer was injured.

607
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:12,338
Miss Yao asked me to transfer
the customer as soon as possible.

608
00:24:12,738 --> 00:24:13,699
Why didn't you send

609
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,018
the customer to the hospital
after that?

610
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:17,299
The customer was agitated.

611
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:19,978
She said she didn't feel well
in the car.

612
00:24:19,978 --> 00:24:20,819
She wanted to get off and take a break.

613
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:22,659
After the customer got off the car,

614
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,218
so did Miss Yao.

615
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:26,498
Then, she told me

616
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:28,059
that the customer refused
to get in the car

617
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:29,699
and had contacted her assistant.

618
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:30,819
Mr. Yang,

619
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:32,419
according to your previous analysis,

620
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:33,738
the turning point of the stock

621
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:34,939
will occur soon, right?

622
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,419
The bone of contention is whether

623
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:37,299
this kind of data

624
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:38,498
can support

625
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,098
(Chief Judge)
my client's prediction

626
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,179
and the rationality of the decision he made.

627
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:45,258
There's uncertainty in investing stocks.

628
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,258
Is there anything else you want to add?

629
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:48,098
No.

630
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,098
There is.

631
00:24:49,498 --> 00:24:50,179
I've got something to add.

632
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:50,779
Your Honor,

633
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:51,939
I've got an evidence here.

634
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:53,659
There are drive recorders in the cars

635
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,779
the hotel uses to transfer customers.

636
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:56,338
What really happened that night

637
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:57,218
has been recorded.

638
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,858
We'll know what the truth is

639
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:00,098
after viewing the footage.

640
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:01,419
Defense attorney,

641
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:03,539
are you requesting
to submit new evidence?

642
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:04,299
Yes.

643
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:06,738
Your Honor,

644
00:25:06,978 --> 00:25:07,858
there's no new evidence

645
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:08,659
we want to submit.

646
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
(Attorney Plaintiff)

647
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,630
(Defendant Attorney)

648
00:25:17,858 --> 00:25:19,018
This is the company quarterly report

649
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:20,539
provided by Meimei Healthcare official.

650
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,498
Meimei Healthcare didn't reduce

651
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:24,258
17 percent of their staff.

652
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,299
(Defense Counsel)
Instead, there was an increase

653
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:27,059
(Defense Counsel)
of 17 percent of personnels.

654
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:29,258
Mr. Yang, may I ask

655
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,930
(Defense Counsel)
if you would divest the holding

656
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:33,378
when you saw this data report?

657
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,419
I wouldn't at that point.

658
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:37,819
Because this stock is not a blue chip.

659
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:39,738
Its profit is unpredictable.

660
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,179
Before getting any data

661
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:42,858
that shows the directivity of profit

662
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:43,738
turning point,

663
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,378
to divest the holding,

664
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:47,018
it should be done recently.

665
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,338
I was right.

666
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,539
Someone changed my data.

667
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,018
I was right, Your Honor.

668
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:54,738
- I was right, I wasn't wrong.
- Calm down.

669
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,138
As there's an emergence
of new key evidence,

670
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,258
we'll request a continuance.

671
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:16,459
Rest assured.

672
00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:17,939
I'll apply for obtaining a guarantor

673
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,059
pending trial as soon as possible.

674
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:21,659
Thank you, Miss Li.

675
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:35,939
Thank you.

676
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,378
I'm just doing my job.

677
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,710
(Defendant)

678
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:09,819
You should leave later.

679
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:12,579
The reporters are at the entrance now.

680
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,459
You should leave after them.

681
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,179
Can you leave me alone?

682
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:21,858
It was you who threw the first punch.

683
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:23,138
Tell us about the details.

684
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:23,779
Will you?

685
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,659
I'll ask my lawyer
to speak on my behalf.

686
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:27,738
Their trial starts today too?

687
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:28,858
Yes.

688
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:39,779
Hello.

689
00:27:40,378 --> 00:27:42,939
(Mom, do you remember my flight number?)

690
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:44,498
Of course I do.

691
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:45,738
Have you eaten yet?

692
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:46,618
(I already ate.)

693
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:47,978
(Mom, I'm going to read books.)

694
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,659
(Is there anything else?)

695
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,858
No, you go ahead.

696
00:27:53,258 --> 00:27:53,939
I love you.

697
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:54,858
(I love you too.)

698
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:04,459
Miss Yao.

699
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:11,738
Dongna, is there any plan for your next drama?

700
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:12,618
Share it with us.

701
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:13,419
Coming up next,

702
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:15,018
I'll go to Hangzhou two days later.

703
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,138
To film a family drama.

704
00:28:16,498 --> 00:28:18,498
It'll take about four months of time.

705
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:19,978
Isn't this Yao Yao?

706
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:21,899
Yao Yao?

707
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:22,498
Yao Yao.

708
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:23,138
Yao Yao.

709
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:23,779
Apologise.

710
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:24,579
You must make a public apology.

711
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:27,320
- Apologise.
- You must make a public apology.

712
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,299
You've got the wrong person.

713
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:31,098
I'm not the Yao Yao you said.

714
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:31,659
You're not Yao Yao?

715
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,098
You're not?

716
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:33,659
Aren't you her?

717
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:35,899
Why are you pointing
your fingers at me?

718
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,459
And you, stop taking photos.

719
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:38,579
Which unit are you from?

720
00:28:38,738 --> 00:28:39,819
What are you going
to do with my photos?

721
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:41,819
- Stop talking, don't look back.
- I'm a lawyer.

722
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,980
Sorry, we own you an apology.

723
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,100
She just left.

724
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:09,579
Yang Hua.

725
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:17,059
Look.

726
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:22,218
Let's go.

727
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:23,699
Let's go there to take photos.

728
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,659
Why are you here?

729
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,459
I guess they've found your home address.

730
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:41,659
For safety precautions,

731
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,218
you should stay
at another place for a while.

732
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:45,498
And see what to do next.

733
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,539
Quick, drive.

734
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:03,419
Qiu Jianxiang had a heart attack on the way.

735
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:04,579
Let's go to the hospital now.

736
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,018
You can leave if you're busy.

737
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:07,098
I'll get off here.

738
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:07,939
You go straight home.

739
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:08,779
Stay safe.

740
00:30:09,498 --> 00:30:10,579
Thank you, Miss Li.

741
00:30:11,218 --> 00:30:11,899
Thank you.

742
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:27,978
Yao Yao.

743
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,779
Yao Yao, listen to me.

744
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:34,098
Two years. Just two years of time.

745
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:35,098
Two years?

746
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:36,939
You want to stay
in Canada for two years?

747
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:38,579
Can you resign?

748
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:39,378
Can you give up

749
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:40,419
on everything you've gained?

750
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:41,899
Can you guarantee
that Qiu Jianxiang won't

751
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:43,059
force you to marry her daughter?

752
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:44,138
Stop messing around.

753
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:44,858
I've said it many times.

754
00:30:45,018 --> 00:30:46,419
I won't marry Qiu Jianxiang's daughter.

755
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,258
I do this for my job.

756
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:48,978
I don't want to listen
to your lies anymore.

757
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:51,738
All you think about is yourself

758
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:52,858
and your career.

759
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:54,098
A selfish person like you

760
00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:55,498
doesn't deserve a happy life.

761
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:56,699
Let go.

762
00:30:58,579 --> 00:30:59,179
Yao Yao.

763
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:05,659
Inform the hospital
that Qiu Jianxiang might have

764
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:06,498
Alzheimer's Disease.

765
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:09,378
What?

766
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:14,899
How did you know that?

767
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:18,419
Mr. Wang,

768
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:21,299
Yang Hua has a bit of a temper.

769
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:23,258
It's been years ago.

770
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:24,659
But he couldn't forget it

771
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,338
and he feels sorry about it.

772
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:29,738
So I won't force him to come with me.

773
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,539
To avoid letting you down,

774
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:32,779
I hereby

775
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,899
raise a juice toast
as an apology to you.

776
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:38,218
Miss Qin,

777
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,299
I don't think this apology of yours

778
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:41,978
is worthy enough.

779
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:44,858
There's still a long time ahead.

780
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:47,338
In these days,

781
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,899
you've had some insight
about the law firm.

782
00:31:50,098 --> 00:31:53,258
Well, what else
do you need me to do for you?

783
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:56,498
Miss Qin, are you trying

784
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:58,218
to get something out of me?

785
00:31:58,378 --> 00:31:59,539
No.

786
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:01,819
It's because Madam Tang attaches

787
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:03,579
great importance to Mr. Hu.

788
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:05,738
I don't think it's right

789
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:07,659
to force one to make a business deal.

790
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:09,338
We must do it on our own free will.

791
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:10,819
Miss Qin,

792
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:15,498
I can't really answer you that now.

793
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:20,018
Mr. Wang, you're really cautious.

794
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:21,939
Take your time to look around.

795
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:24,738
But I'd really like to talk about you, Miss Qin.

796
00:32:25,258 --> 00:32:25,978
Me?

797
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:29,978
I got it.

798
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:32,579
It's about the thing
you mentioned before, isn't it?

799
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:36,618
Well, I'll be open about it.

800
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:37,618
As you see,

801
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:39,338
Cheng & Hui is not a law firm

802
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,378
that only cares about individual capacities.

803
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:43,138
Having customer resources

804
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:44,299
will be more advantageous

805
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:45,858
for a competent person.

806
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:46,498
Miss Qin,

807
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,899
I like your boldness and means.

808
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,179
What you're doing now

809
00:32:52,378 --> 00:32:53,738
is nothing to me.

810
00:32:54,018 --> 00:32:55,858
The lies I've told are way more than you did.

811
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:58,059
This is what makes me think

812
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,858
you're a person
who's worth to talk to.

813
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,699
In my expert opinion,

814
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:05,179
no matter it's in your career
or marriage,

815
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,858
your value has been grossly underestimated.

816
00:33:08,858 --> 00:33:10,218
I know right, Mr. Wang.

817
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:11,618
I've finally found my soulmate.

818
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:13,338
You can give me
a few more words of praise.

819
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:15,018
I'll note it down

820
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:16,579
and tell Madam Tang about it

821
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,018
to ask her to give me
a raise and a promotion.

822
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:19,978
A raise and a promotion
mean nothing.

823
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:21,059
You, Qin Shi,

824
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,018
are someone who can do great things.

825
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:27,899
Mr. Wang,

826
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:30,098
I really love listening to you.

827
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:31,018
Look,

828
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:32,738
you've only known me for a few days.

829
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:34,218
But you already know me so well.

830
00:33:34,378 --> 00:33:35,659
Tell me.

831
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:36,819
What makes you think
I'm someone

832
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,338
who can do great things?

833
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:42,179
Miss Qin, you're smart and competent.

834
00:33:42,378 --> 00:33:43,258
That goes without saying.

835
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,819
The most important thing is that you're

836
00:33:45,978 --> 00:33:47,819
a woman with desires and ambitions.

837
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:50,419
And you don't seem to care

838
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:52,138
to show your desires and ambitions.

839
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:54,779
Your talent will be wasted

840
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:56,338
in Cheng & Hui.

841
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:58,498
You need a wider world.

842
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:00,338
Qin Shi,

843
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:03,098
the eleventh floor is not the top of the world.

844
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,738
There are more places higher than here.

845
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,298
You should go abroad to see

846
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:09,538
how the top elites live

847
00:34:09,538 --> 00:34:11,019
their lifes out there.

848
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:17,019
You're asking me to work
overseas as a lawyer.

849
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:18,778
Miss Qin,

850
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:20,699
being a lawyer is nothing.

851
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:23,378
The graduates of Havard Law School

852
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:24,618
are amazing.

853
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,858
But they're nothing but employees.

854
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,939
The fortune in this world is

855
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,899
held in the businessmen's hands.

856
00:34:35,298 --> 00:34:37,138
But I know nothing about business.

857
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:39,818
You know nothing.

858
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:42,578
But I'm an expert.

859
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:45,659
Mr. Wang,

860
00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:47,659
are you going to teach me
how to do business?

861
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:50,259
Well,

862
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:52,739
after surveying Cheng & Hui,

863
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,858
the next project will be in Zurich.

864
00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:56,499
If you want,

865
00:34:58,378 --> 00:34:59,659
I can take you with me.

866
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:09,499
About this,

867
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,778
I should go back and ask Yang Hua.

868
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,618
My dear Miss Qin,

869
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:15,538
you're going to ask him?

870
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:18,259
Can you even leave home
after asking him?

871
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:21,338
You little fool.

872
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:24,219
You're usually smart.

873
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:25,899
Why do you become a fool

874
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,138
when it comes to this?

875
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,499
I can guarantee this.

876
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:36,578
If Yang Hua was the person

877
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:38,459
who sat here and listened to me,

878
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,338
he'd choose to go with me without hesitation.

879
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:44,538
Really?

880
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:47,858
You know Yang Hua that well?

881
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:49,699
Is he a person like this?

882
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:50,778
Of course.

883
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:52,499
I'm not saying the current Yang Hua.

884
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:54,739
But the past Yang Hua.

885
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:57,259
After all, while facing

886
00:35:57,298 --> 00:35:59,259
a better future,

887
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:01,058
it wasn't the first time for him

888
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:02,138
to take an action

889
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:06,298
like changing the leverage in his hands.

890
00:36:12,778 --> 00:36:13,858
The result of Brain MRI

891
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:14,659
has come back.

892
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,699
The patient's temporal lobe function
is starting to decline.

893
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:18,219
Also, the active ingredient

894
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:19,419
of Aricept is found

895
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:20,298
in his blood test.

896
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:21,858
It shows that it's been a long time

897
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:23,618
since he suffered this condition.

898
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:25,378
Next, our treatment plan

899
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:26,499
consists of two parts.

900
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:27,858
Part of it is conservative treatment.

901
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:38,899
Thank you.

902
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:45,378
How did you know

903
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:47,818
Qiu Jianxiang has this disease?

904
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:54,618
Actually, it's needless to ask me

905
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,739
to be an expert witness in this lawsuit.

906
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:58,378
I think he should be able

907
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:00,378
to vividly recall
his thoughts that time.

908
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:03,098
He kept claiming that his judgement was right.

909
00:37:03,778 --> 00:37:05,058
But he refused to explain why.

910
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:06,818
I can only think of one possibility.

911
00:37:09,378 --> 00:37:10,739
Which is that he can't remember

912
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:12,378
why he would make this decision.

913
00:37:14,058 --> 00:37:14,858
And

914
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:17,179
he can't make the same decision

915
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,019
even when he got
the same documents.

916
00:37:20,778 --> 00:37:21,699
Qiu Jianxiang

917
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:25,538
cares more about his job

918
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:29,419
than his family and kids.

919
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:32,138
Just that it occurs to me

920
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:37,259
that he seems to have lost everything.

921
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:45,578
Life is full of uncertainties.

922
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:47,259
Who would expect

923
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,378
that he'll collapse in his day?

924
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:54,419
But I'm quite grateful to him

925
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:56,259
for evicting me from this industry.

926
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:01,058
If I continued to stay there,

927
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:04,538
I'm afraid I'd become like him.

928
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:08,618
No matter what,

929
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:13,098
thanks for giving him a hand in the end.

930
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:15,618
Otherwise, Qiu Jianxiang

931
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,578
would surely end up

932
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:20,699
more miserable than he does now.

933
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:30,179
By the way,

934
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:33,019
how did you know Yao Yao?

935
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,019
I can't believe Yang Hua didn't tell you

936
00:38:56,298 --> 00:38:57,298
that he nearly became

937
00:38:57,499 --> 00:38:59,098
Qiu Jianxiang's son-in-law.

938
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,338
It's even more unlikely
for him to tell you

939
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:04,419
that he wasn't single that time.

940
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:05,979
He even got

941
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:09,098
a childhood friend as his first love.

942
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:46,659
My heart.

943
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:48,138
I heard such a good news

944
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:49,459
as soon as I came back.

945
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:51,538
Mr. Tao, Mr. Wu, Ma,

946
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:52,538
you've worked hard.

947
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:54,618
To you guys.

948
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:55,098
Come.

949
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:56,578
It's not that hard.

950
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:57,899
It's mainly because

951
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,818
Miss Wu has done a good job
in gaining public support.

952
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:02,858
You're being too polite.

953
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:04,219
You've made me blush.

954
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:07,578
It's because Dongna has

955
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,618
always had a good reputation
in the industry.

956
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:11,098
That's why our plan can be

957
00:40:11,298 --> 00:40:12,419
implemented smoothly.

958
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:13,298
Well said.

959
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:14,058
I suggest

960
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:15,818
to propose a toast to Ms. He.

961
00:40:16,138 --> 00:40:17,778
She played a big role, right?

962
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:18,538
Come.

963
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:19,298
Come, congratulations.

964
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,818
Thank you, guys, you've worked hard.

965
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:27,699
Ms. He,

966
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:28,939
what drama have you been filming lately?

967
00:40:29,298 --> 00:40:30,979
It's a family drama.

968
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:32,778
A family drama, Ma,
it's a family drama.

969
00:40:33,538 --> 00:40:34,378
Your favourite.

970
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:35,939
What is the name?

971
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:36,578
I can't tell you that.

972
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:37,378
It's a secret.

973
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:38,778
A secret, come.

974
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:41,499
It's confidential. Look at you.

975
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:42,659
Yes, Chen.

976
00:40:43,058 --> 00:40:44,179
The case is over.

977
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:46,098
But we haven't taken a photo with this big star.

978
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:47,058
Guess what. I've come prepared.

979
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:47,939
We must take a photo.

980
00:40:48,098 --> 00:40:48,739
Come.

981
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:49,378
Let me.

982
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:49,818
Let me take it for you.

983
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:51,138
Jin, Jin, come.

984
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:52,499
Mr. Tao, let's join in the fun.

985
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:53,818
You guys go ahead.

986
00:40:54,378 --> 00:40:55,058
Let's ignore him.

987
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:55,899
Ready.

988
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:56,939
Let's get ready.

989
00:40:57,298 --> 00:40:58,058
Cheese.

990
00:40:58,259 --> 00:40:59,459
Cheese.

991
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:02,739
Are you still in the hospital?

992
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:04,019
(We've left.)

993
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:06,179
(He's even paid the medical fees,)

994
00:41:06,378 --> 00:41:07,459
(hospitalization costs and surgery fees)

995
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,419
(before we left.)

996
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:12,979
Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.

997
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:14,378
I always thought that Yang Hua

998
00:41:14,378 --> 00:41:16,739
hated Qiu Jianxiang very much.

999
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:18,259
I was surprised

1000
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:19,538
that he agreed to testify for him.

1001
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:20,618
I didn't expect

1002
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:21,979
that he could go this far.

1003
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:25,459
I even started to admire him.

1004
00:41:26,378 --> 00:41:27,699
I'm not pretending.

1005
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:30,659
This is the model
of requiting hatred with good.

1006
00:41:31,098 --> 00:41:31,818
Qin Shi,

1007
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:35,138
when can you get divorced?

1008
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:36,259
How much do you want

1009
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:37,419
to give up on Yang Hua?

1010
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,179
Tell me.

1011
00:41:38,778 --> 00:41:39,939
(I've got some savings)

1012
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:41,578
(in my bank account.)

1013
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:46,058
If there's nothing else,

1014
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:47,058
I'm hanging up.

1015
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:48,019
(Don't do this.)

1016
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,298
Yao Yao's case trial starts today,

1017
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:51,098
you know that?

1018
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:52,219
I know.

1019
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:54,138
Then, do you know that she's set up

1020
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:54,858
by her company?

1021
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:56,858
What do you mean?

1022
00:41:57,578 --> 00:41:58,778
(You don't know that?)

1023
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:02,378
I heard that since I left,

1024
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:04,459
Cheng & Hui has completely become

1025
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:05,778
the slave of money.

1026
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:08,138
How much did He Dongna

1027
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:09,219
pay you guys

1028
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:10,459
to make you join forces

1029
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:11,499
with Tianhang to set her up?

1030
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:14,818
Tang Yihui has completely

1031
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:15,778
yielded to capital.

1032
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:17,818
She could even let go of her pride.

1033
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:20,459
You just left Cheng & Hui

1034
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:22,098
and you started to attack us.

1035
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:26,058
(Qin Shi, are you being isolated?)

1036
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:28,219
How can you not know that?

1037
00:42:28,778 --> 00:42:30,459
Why don't you go ask Tao Junhui?

1038
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:32,058
Anyway,

1039
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:34,378
it's the first-hand information

1040
00:42:34,538 --> 00:42:35,499
Yao Yao told me.

1041
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,098
You even knew Yao Yao?

1042
00:42:40,298 --> 00:42:41,378
I didn't know her.

1043
00:42:42,618 --> 00:42:43,419
Have you heard of

1044
00:42:43,578 --> 00:42:45,138
the Law of Six Degrees of Spaces?

1045
00:42:50,098 --> 00:42:52,219
I'll give you an exclusive news.

1046
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:55,019
Yang Hua and Yao Yao

1047
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:57,019
knew each other.

1048
00:42:58,378 --> 00:42:59,219
(They're not mere acquaintances.)

1049
00:42:59,858 --> 00:43:02,499
There's definitely something
between them.

1050
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:03,659
You know?

1051
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:06,939
(Anyway, it's not a real relationship
between you and Yang Hua.)

1052
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,739
(Telling you this is not sabotaging)

1053
00:43:09,899 --> 00:43:11,858
(the relationship between you
and your husband.)

1054
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,179
If you could dig up

1055
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:14,298
something more shocking,

1056
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:16,578
be sure to run by me first.

1057
00:43:17,419 --> 00:43:18,939
I love this gossip.

1058
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:21,939
