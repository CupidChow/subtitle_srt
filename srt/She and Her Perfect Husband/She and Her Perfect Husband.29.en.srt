19
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,469
Take a guess. When did Yang Hua

20
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,670
leave Hengli?

21
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,732
Around that incident happened, I guess.

22
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:04,613
Correct.

23
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,213
Therefore, we can conclude that

24
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:07,492
It turned out that

25
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:08,692
Yang Hua was the fund manager

26
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:10,492
who led to the chaos.

27
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:11,373
Am I right?

28
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:14,453
Maybe.

29
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,132
What do you mean by it's possible?

30
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:17,933
As the fact we can see.

31
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:21,173
It's not as simple as you think.

32
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:23,853
Everything relies on evidence.

33
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,013
A woman's intuition is the evidence.

34
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:28,252
I've come up with a bold speculation.

35
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:29,173
Would you like to hear me out?

36
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:30,453
I reckon

37
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:32,332
Yang Hua didn't work

38
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:34,412
at the investment bank
after leaving Hengli.

39
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:36,853
He was lying.

40
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:43,252
That's all?

41
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:46,733
Enough, just be contented.

42
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:48,453
You only gave me a name.

43
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:49,692
Nothing else besides that.

44
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:50,813
I've done a good enough job

45
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:51,653
of discovering these.

46
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:02,453
Do you think Qin Shi knows

47
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:05,972
that Yang Hua is telling lies?

48
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,173
Poor thing.

49
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:15,972
Where are we going?

50
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:18,653
You didn't have dinner.

51
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:19,532
I'm taking you to a great meal.

52
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:21,653
I do feel a bit hungry.

53
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:24,013
What are you going to eat?

54
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:26,252
A healing cuisine meal.

55
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,293
Junhui, you're the best.

56
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:35,612
Are you done eating?

57
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:38,972
Are you feeling better?

58
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,173
I knew

59
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:42,213
that everything in the world

60
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,093
can be settled with a bowl of hot Malatang.

61
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:45,532
Let's go with two
if one is not sufficient.

62
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:50,052
Two incoming customers.

63
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:50,772
There's a table inside.

64
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:51,492
- Let's go.
- Take a seat.

65
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:56,573
Miss Qin,

66
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,013
what a coincidence.

67
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,612
Mr. Yang, you're here too.

68
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:04,612
Aren't you feeling unwell?

69
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,532
Did the Malatang cure you?

70
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,093
The Malatang here is a panacea,

71
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:15,772
it can even cure a simpleton.

72
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:20,773
Miss Qin,

73
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,453
after you left,

74
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:25,412
Mr. Wang told me a lot about your husband.

75
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:26,733
Your husband

76
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:28,333
won't necessarily tell you these.

77
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,053
But if you buy me dinner,

78
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:32,733
I might tell you about it.

79
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,652
Can this be redeemed for a free dinner?

80
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:42,252
Well, Senior, from now on, your girlfriend

81
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:43,252
will have to pay for my dinner.

82
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:47,212
Let's go.

83
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:48,812
Watch out!

84
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:49,932
Sorry, I'm sorry.

85
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:50,293
Junhui!

86
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:51,092
It's an accident.

87
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:52,652
Sorry, I'm very sorry.

88
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,293
Did you get burned?

89
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:54,132
Are you alright?

90
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:56,972
- Are you alright?
- Sorry, I'm really sorry.

91
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:58,173
It's alright.

92
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:00,412
Are you okay?

93
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:01,652
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

94
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:02,293
Quick, wipe it off.

95
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:03,252
It's alright.

96
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:20,532
Does it still hurt?

97
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:25,293
Take my car to the hospital.

98
00:05:26,252 --> 00:05:27,132
It's not necessary.

99
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:29,652
I'm familiar with this area.

100
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:30,652
We'll get there soon.

101
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:32,692
Just stay away from him.

102
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:44,412
I'll drive.

103
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:52,652
Be careful.

104
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:08,613
Give him a call later

105
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:09,252
and ask about him.

106
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,372
It feels like he's burned badly.

107
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:15,132
It's not necessary.

108
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,212
Anyway, I'll see him
at the law firm tomorrow.

109
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,692
Actually, I've been reluctant
to admit this.

110
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:23,613
But I had to say

111
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:26,252
that Tao Junhui is a nice guy.

112
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,173
I suppose you'd be quite happy

113
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:30,932
if you two got married.

114
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,053
It has nothing to do with me.

115
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:40,573
Besides,

116
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,013
I'm already married.

117
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:43,932
We're fake-married.

118
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,053
No matter what, legally speaking,

119
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,613
we're husband and wife.

120
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,053
If you want to go back to him,

121
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:55,372
we can get divorced.

122
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:01,053
You're going there, aren't you?

123
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:02,453
It's an entrapment.

124
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:05,212
I won't divorce you, I'm determined.

125
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:09,293
We'll get divorce sooner or later.

126
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,293
Even if we don't do it now,

127
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:12,493
it'll happen in three years either.

128
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:20,812
After today, I'm

129
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:23,173
worried

130
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:25,493
that they'll be suspicious
about my resume.

131
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,532
I'm afraid it'll implicate you.

132
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:28,853
So should we just...

133
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:30,652
Okay, I got it.

134
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:32,652
What happened today

135
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,573
is my fault, I'll apologise.

136
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:37,733
You've done nothing wrong.

137
00:07:37,893 --> 00:07:38,893
It has nothing to do with you.

138
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,013
It's all my fault.

139
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:42,652
I shouldn't have been so selfish

140
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,092
and made you go
to the business dinner

141
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,212
because of my ambition.

142
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:47,293
Then, exposing you to the guy

143
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,333
you don't want to see.

144
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,333
It's my fault, I'll apologise.

145
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:52,453
I won't do this again.

146
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:54,972
I won't make you face this kind

147
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,692
of complicated relationship again.

148
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,893
So can you forgive me this once?

149
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,493
There's no need to ask for forgiveness.

150
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:02,853
Since the first day I met you,

151
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,692
I've known that you're

152
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:06,132
an ambitious person.

153
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:07,532
You won't avoid it

154
00:08:08,932 --> 00:08:09,853
even when facing difficulties.

155
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,853
You'll go straight ahead.

156
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:13,893
So I won't be mad at you.

157
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:16,212
I won't be mad at Tao Junhui either.

158
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:17,372
Then, why did you...

159
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,133
Because I had to face a fact today.

160
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,332
Because I'm a coward.

161
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:39,173
It's true that I'm a coward.

162
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:23,412
Slow down.

163
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:25,053
Watch it.

164
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:29,293
Be careful.

165
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:42,373
Be careful.

166
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:49,253
It's getting late.

167
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:50,332
Why don't you go back first?

168
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:51,532
I'll do it.

169
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:55,012
How can I go back when you're like this?

170
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,373
You can't even brush teeth, wash face

171
00:09:57,532 --> 00:09:58,332
and get a shower now.

172
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:00,253
I'll stay to keep you company.

173
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,053
It's not that serious.

174
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:03,053
My right hand is injured.

175
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:04,572
But I still have my left hand.

176
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:05,693
What do you mean you're alright?

177
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:06,373
The doctor said

178
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,772
if it doesn't recover well,

179
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:10,373
there'll be a scar when we get married.

180
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:14,972
We should just postpone our wedding.

181
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,853
Anyway, our marital home is not ready yet.

182
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:23,452
Marital home?

183
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:26,853
Didn't my dad already

184
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,053
buy us a house?

185
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:30,853
I'd like to give you

186
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,532
a house with my own efforts.

187
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:40,412
I knew you'd be mad.

188
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:42,532
I'm not.

189
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:44,412
I'm not that petty-minded.

190
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:45,412
Why would I be mad?

191
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:46,373
I'm not mad.

192
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:49,652
You are.

193
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:52,532
Since you signed
the stupid prenuptial agreement,

194
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,053
you've been mad.

195
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,853
Don't worry, Junhui.

196
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:00,212
In fact, it was me

197
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:01,572
who made my dad buy us
that house.

198
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:03,012
When we get married,

199
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,493
I'll put your name
on the property title, okay?

200
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:07,772
You don't have to,
just put your name on it.

201
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,133
What do you mean? I'll do it.

202
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:11,892
I insist.

203
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,772
Let me tell you this, Junhui.

204
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:15,813
All I have is yours.

205
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:16,813
I can give you everything.

206
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:17,933
I don't want nothing.

207
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,532
I'm fine with having nothing.

208
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:31,412
Junhui,

209
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,212
let's get married quickly.

210
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:43,412
Feifei.

211
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:45,972
Get married quickly.

212
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:48,733
Didn't you always

213
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,693
want a perfect wedding?

214
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,373
But my hand is injured now.

215
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:56,772
It's all my fault.

216
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:57,772
It's my fault, it's me.

217
00:11:57,933 --> 00:11:58,652
I'm to blame.

218
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,012
I've thought of it.

219
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:10,693
I can't let Qin Shi stay

220
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,892
at Cheng & Hui anymore.

221
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:13,332
Feifei.

222
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:14,293
Don't try to stop me.

223
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:16,012
The more you try, the more I hate her.

224
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,613
It's not necessary for you
to be mad because of her.

225
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:22,373
Qin Shi is already married.

226
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,053
What if she wasn't?

227
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,012
It's pointless to talk about this.

228
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,412
Why is it pointless?

229
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:46,092
Junhui,

230
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,532
I know you can't forget about her.

231
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:53,652
I know you've always cared about her.

232
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:55,613
I know.

233
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,412
I know no matter how hard I work,

234
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,493
I can never make you forget about her.

235
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,693
But I don't understand.

236
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:08,253
She treats you that way.

237
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:09,772
Why would you...

238
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,092
Why would you still care about her

239
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:13,613
and look out for her?

240
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:16,452
That you'd worry if she feels
cold or hot?

241
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:22,493
You even looked at her
with that kind of expression.

242
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:27,412
What do you mean?

243
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:31,293
It's pointless to say this.

Don't you know what I'm talking about?

Junhui,

248
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:47,933
can you please think of me

249
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:52,733
and take my feelings into account?

250
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:54,652
Just don't

251
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,133
make it so obvious.

252
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,053

00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:06,332
I was bad-tempered.

269
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:09,892
And I succeeded young

270
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:10,972
so I was kind of arrogant.

271
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,133
And all the colleagues were very nice to me.

272
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,892
Then, I realised

273
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:17,493
that it was a pretense.

274
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:19,253
Wang Jiesen,

275
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,772
the fund manager
who Qiu Jianxiang was most proud of.

276
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:24,332
And he always wanted

277
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:25,452
to take Mr. Qiu's place.

278
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:27,452
But my presence

279
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,212
seemed to have ruined all his plan.

280
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:32,933
He was good at acting.

281
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,572
He had silently endured me
for two years.

282
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:38,532
I was so naive that I treated him

283
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:39,813
as my best friend.

284
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:44,532
Was he related to the incident
back then?

285
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:47,293
Haibo Biology was not a stock

286
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:49,412
that Qiu Jianxiang and I would choose.

287
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:52,332
But its basic feature was too good

288
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:54,053
that it was practically perfect.

289
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:55,892
Even when Qiu Jianxiang

290
00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:57,693
told me to buy the stock
in enormous volume,

291
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,532
I couldn't find a ground for refusal.

292
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:02,493
In the first month after buying it,

293
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:04,373
it rose by 35 percent.

294
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:06,652
But a month later,

295
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:10,532
the competitor launched a new product.

296
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:11,972
This product was enough to beat

297
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,412
all the products of Haibo Biology.

298
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,853
So we failed miserably.

299
00:16:17,332 --> 00:16:19,133
Would this be a coincidence?

300
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,892
How could it be?

301
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:22,892
After that, I found something unusual

302
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,493
about the purchase
and sold of the stock.

303
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,373
But everything was too late.

304
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:29,212
Wang Jiesen,

305
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:32,572
he knew the ins and outs of this incident.

306
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:34,493
But he didn't allow me to say it.

307
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:36,133
He asked me to trust him.

308
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:38,173
He said he'd tell the board of directors
about it.

309
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:39,012
Yet,

310
00:16:39,813 --> 00:16:41,332
he did this.

311
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:45,853
Why would Qiu Jianxiang

312
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:47,332
set you up back then?

313
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:48,652
I have no idea.

314
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:51,012
I've been taught to be

315
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:53,053
a brave man since childhood.

316
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:54,972
To face difficulties head-on.

317
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:56,253
As long as we're brave enough,

318
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:57,613
we could defeat failure.

319
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:00,933
I always did that back then.

320
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:02,532
Until later,

321
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:05,133
when I was struck hard,

322
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:06,893
I only realised

323
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:12,052
that bravery has nothing to do with failures.

324
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:21,452
Hua, you're back.

325
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:23,773
Hua, you're back.

326
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:26,013
Come, give me the luggage.

327
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:30,853
Yang, Yang, our son is back.

328
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:32,972
Hurry.

329
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:35,373
(After returning from Canada,)

330
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:37,733
(I took a break at home for two months.)

331
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:38,972
(With a step-by-step approach,)

332
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:40,332
(I sent out my resume
to seek for a job.)

333
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,812
(But none of the companies
was willing to accept me.)

334
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:46,853
Qiu Jianxiang practised
what he preached.

335
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:48,853
(If I left him,)

336
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:52,013
(there's no way I could set a foot
in this industry.)

337
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,373
(Only then I knew)

338
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:57,013
(there'd be a series of problems)

339
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:59,613
(when one experienced major defeat.)

340
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:02,812
(I started to suffer hair loss, lose weight.)

341
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:05,452
(I didn't even leave home for a month.)

342
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:08,413
(So I came up with a new mantra.)

343
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:12,452
(Which was to lie down at where you fell.)

344
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:16,133
(Learn to store our energy
when we're at a low point.)

345
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:18,692
(Don't make a feeble attempt.)

346
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:35,133
Get up.

347
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:36,212
I've got something to tell you.

348
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:37,413
Right now.

349
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:50,413
How much longer do you want
to sit at home lazing around?

350
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:53,533
You made your room look like a pigsty.

351
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,733
What are you trying to do?

352
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,133
How much longer do you want

353
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,172
to waste yourself?

354
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:02,932
Talk nicely, don't get violent.

355
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:09,972
(My mom had endured me for six months.)

356
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:11,533
(At last, she couldn't stand it.)

357
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:14,572
(She gave me a choice that time.)

358
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:15,773
Go out and work.

359
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,092
I don't care what your job is.

360
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:19,853
It doesn't matter if it's a cab driver

361
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:21,572
or a vegetable seller.

362
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,613
You must feed yourself.

363
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:25,533
No trash is allowed in my house.

364
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:27,292
My son can't be a neet.

365
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:28,452
You're not allowed to be a neet.

366
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:38,733
I won't.

367
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:42,893
I'll pay all my living costs in time.

368
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:44,452
I won't work

369
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:45,452
but I will make money.

370
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,413
I don't need you to take care of me.

371
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:50,052
But I hope

372
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,253
that you could stop worrying about me.

373
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,692
And take care of your bodies.

374
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:03,452
Get a haircut.

375
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:05,332
Right away.

376
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,733
And shave your beard.

377
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:10,052
I will.

378
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:15,932
If there's nothing else,

379
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:17,452
I'll head back to my room.

380
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:07,413
Sometimes, it's really comfortable

381
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:08,413
to escape from reality.

382
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,972
As long as you admit that you're a loser,

383
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:15,812
then, you can feel comfortable
to be a terrible person.

384
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,613
Because you've degraded yourself.

385
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,893
You won't care if the others degrade you.

386
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:25,972
But,

387
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:28,572
then, I found that I was wrong.

388
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:31,613
Because your failure

389
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:34,972
won't disappear over time.

390
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,893
It'll give you a strike

391
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:38,733
when you stand up again.

392
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:40,493
Don't you think

393
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:41,493
they're very patient?

394
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:54,893
Actually,

395
00:21:58,373 --> 00:21:59,932
it's no big deal to fail.

396
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:03,932
Everyone has failed before.

397
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:08,692
Well,

398
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:12,092
is it a bad thing

399
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,653
to be liked by someone like me?

400
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:19,253
What are you talking about?

401
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:23,812
There's nothing

402
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:25,692
good about me.

403
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,533
But I'll protect my loved one.

404
00:22:30,773 --> 00:22:32,332
If you keep speaking ill of my husband,

405
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:33,692
I'll be mad.

406
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:44,413
Actually,

407
00:22:46,092 --> 00:22:48,253
it doesn't matter if you stand up

408
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:52,292
and face it bravely or avoid it like a coward.

409
00:22:56,932 --> 00:22:57,853
But you have to know this.

410
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,773
We are together now.

411
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:07,212
You can rely on me.

412
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:12,332
From now on,

413
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:16,572
we'll go through hardships

414
00:23:18,212 --> 00:23:19,413
and overcome difficulties together.

415
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:25,373
This is what a relationship is for.

416
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:26,212
Don't you think?

417
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,720
♪In the cold season, we all hide♪

418
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,580
♪A relationship without a bond♪

00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
♪Is as fragile as eggshells♪

425
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:34,092
Are you awake?

426
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:35,013
I've made breakfast.

427
00:24:35,092 --> 00:24:35,972
Do you want to eat it with me?

428
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,133
Hello.

429
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,733
I'd like to sleep a little longer.

430
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:53,373
Well, then.

431
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,972
The breakfast is on the table.

432
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:57,653
Remember to eat it
when you wake up.

433
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,052
Thank you.

434
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:01,172
Bye bye.

435
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:21,212
I'm thinking

436
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:23,292
that Yang Hua is
in a bad mood today,

437
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:24,972
remember to take care
of him for me.

438
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,332
Please, come on.

439
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:29,533
Everyone is a precious individual.

440
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:30,972
I've got many works to do everyday.

441
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:32,773
Who... Who takes care of me?

442
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:33,972
Cai Liang,

443
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:35,773
I'm a woman

444
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:36,653
who always knows

445
00:25:36,773 --> 00:25:37,972
how much you have with Yang Hua.

446
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:39,812
(Are you sure you want to go there?)

447
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,493
Rest assured, Miss Qin.

448
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:49,692
(When your husband comes
to work today,)

449
00:25:49,972 --> 00:25:51,773
I'll be sure to take care of him

450
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:53,653
like I do to my wife, okay?

451
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:55,812
He didn't got to work today?

452
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:57,533
You're living together,

453
00:25:57,812 --> 00:25:58,733
even you don't know

454
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,292
if he has come to work.

455
00:26:00,452 --> 00:26:01,253
How would I know that?

456
00:26:03,572 --> 00:26:04,773
Excuse me, make ways.

457
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:07,172
Excuse me.

458
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:07,893
Be careful.

459
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:10,413
Are you alright?

460
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:11,613
I'm fine, thank you.

461
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:38,773
Is he still crying?

462
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:44,972
(Don't think too much.)

463
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:46,493
(I'll bring good food for you tonight.)

464
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:54,373
Wait.

465
00:26:57,653 --> 00:26:58,292
Is this yours?

466
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:00,773
Yes.

467
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,452
Let me help you.

468
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:09,013
Thank you.

469
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:09,533
You're welcome.

470
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:10,413
Let's go.

471
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,740
(File cover)

472
00:27:34,692 --> 00:27:35,413
Dad,

473
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:36,653
why are you here?

474
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:39,893
This is...

475
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,133
Look.

476
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:45,253
a lawyer came to me yesterday.

477
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:46,773
It was from her.

478
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,130
(Qiu Jianxiang)

479
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:52,572
Mr. Yang,

480
00:27:53,052 --> 00:27:54,893
Mr. Qiu is Yang Hua's mentor.

481
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,893
They've had their clashes before,

482
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,253
but Mr. Qiu has tried

483
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:01,972
his best to protect
Yang Hua that time.

484
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:03,332
Even until now,

485
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:04,972
Mr. Qiu still thinks

486
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:06,212
that Yang Hua is
the most outstanding disciple

487
00:28:06,413 --> 00:28:07,452
that he admires most.

488
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,733
About this matter,

489
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:17,013
Yang Hua is the only person
who can help him.

490
00:28:18,172 --> 00:28:19,533
Yang Hua is simple and kind-hearted.

491
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,133
I'm sure he won't want

492
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:23,613
his mentor to spend

493
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:26,052
the end of his life in jail.

494
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:29,413
Why not?

495
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:31,373
Why can't he do that?

496
00:28:32,452 --> 00:28:33,613
Qiu Jianxiang still

497
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,452
has the nerve to ask Yang Hua for help.

498
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:38,773
I can't believe he could say that.

499
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:42,212
A perfectly fine kid

500
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:43,733
followed him to Canada.

501
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,092
But look what

502
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:47,972
he's turned my son into.

503
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:49,853
It's been four years.

504
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:52,373
He was jobless

505
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:53,613
and a good-for-nothing
for four years.

506
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:55,853
It was all because of this mentor.

507
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:03,613
Yang Hua was jobless for four years?

508
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:05,413
How is that possible, Aunt?

509
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,653
Everyone in our law firm knew

510
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:08,812
that Yang Hua used to be

511
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,013
an executive of an investment bank.

512
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:12,533
Get out.

513
00:29:14,092 --> 00:29:16,212
From now on, no one is allowed to say

514
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,013
this bad guy's name in my house.

515
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,133
Mentor? My foot!

516
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:23,332
If I knew he turned my son into this,

517
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:25,212
no matter what,

518
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:27,133
I wouldn't have allowed my son

519
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,052
to learn things from him.

520
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:30,092
Now that he's in jail.

521
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:31,572
He deserves it.

522
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:34,972
He ruined someone's beloved son,

523
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:36,692
it's tantamount to killing people.

524
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:40,653
Calm down, Aunt.

525
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,373
Yang Hua has a happy family

526
00:29:42,692 --> 00:29:44,853
and a successful career now.

527
00:29:45,212 --> 00:29:45,893
It's being exaggerated

528
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:47,773
to claim that it's a killing.

529
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,812
That's because my son is lucky.

530
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:51,212
Otherwise,

531
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:53,013
why did he sit at home lazing around?

532
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,212
I would've gotten grandchildren now.

533
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:57,773
I would've lived better than now.

534
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:04,253
Your mom has had a good cry.

535
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:07,332
Actually, I know

536
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,533
that she's not blaming the others.

537
00:30:10,253 --> 00:30:12,092
Rather than blaming Mr. Qiu,

538
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:15,572
I'm afraid she's putting
the blame on herself.

539
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:17,292
Just that she didn't

540
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:18,733
spit it out all these years.

541
00:30:19,092 --> 00:30:22,092
It happened to give her a chance

542
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:23,932
to vent it all out at once yesterday.

543
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:27,853
Dad,

544
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:29,292
you want me to help him?

545
00:30:31,812 --> 00:30:34,692
I think you should help yourself.

546
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:40,332
Hua,

547
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:44,172
(Qiu Jianxiang)
I have no idea what happened

548
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:44,533
(Qiu Jianxiang)

549
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:46,020
(Qiu Jianxiang)
to you back then.

550
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,052
But judging from the state

551
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:49,812
you were in after your return,

552
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:52,052
I've got some leads.

553
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:55,493
It's necessary to experience
hardships in one's life.

554
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:58,253
It can't always go smoothly,
don't you think?

555
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:02,172
It requires two secrets to get a happy life.

556
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:03,533
I've told you

557
00:31:04,373 --> 00:31:05,253
about the first secret.

558
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:06,452
Do you still remember it?

559
00:31:07,653 --> 00:31:08,812
Learn to enjoy failures.

560
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:11,373
The second is

561
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:14,932
to learn to forgive others.

562
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:16,460
(Qiu Jianxiang)

563
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:17,253
Letting them off is

564
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:19,493
tantamount to freeing yourself.

565
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:24,613
I don't know if I can do it.

566
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:26,133
Give it a try.

567
00:31:26,812 --> 00:31:28,212
You never know if you don't try.

568
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,960
(Qiu Jianxiang)

569
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:41,092
Hello.

570
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,253
Hello, Mr. Tao.

571
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:43,493
Hello, Miss Yao.

572
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:44,133
Hello.

573
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:50,052
Nice to meet you, I'm Yao Yao.

574
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,533
I was the manager on duty

575
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,212
on the day
when Ms. He Dongna checked in.

576
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:54,572
Hello, Miss Yao.

577
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:57,332
Before we start the conversation,

578
00:31:57,572 --> 00:31:58,812
I have an obligation to inform you

579
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,452
that all our conversations

580
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:01,773
will be recorded.

581
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:03,373
It might become an evidence

582
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:05,212
that's unfavorable to you in future.

583
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:08,172
Are you sure you want to start the conversation?

584
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:09,172
I'm sure.

585
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:21,292
Are you here on behalf of the hotel or yourself?

586
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:22,773
Today, I'm here
as the party concerned

587
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:24,253
to make a clarification.

588
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:25,853
It's purely my personal behaviour.

589
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:27,533
It has nothing to do with the company.

590
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:29,013
So you're saying

591
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:30,613
you don't agree with what

592
00:32:30,812 --> 00:32:31,413
Ms. He Dongna said?

593
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:34,212
The fact is unlike what she described.

594
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:36,533
Those are groundless accusations.

595
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,212
Ms. He checked in
to the Presidential Suite

596
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:41,932
of our hotel at about nine that night.

597
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:43,452
(Before she checked in,)

598
00:32:43,692 --> 00:32:46,013
(she requested for butler service.)

599
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:48,572
(As one of the content in butler service,)

600
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:51,692
(the butler will have to
stay with the guest at night.)

601
00:33:04,013 --> 00:33:04,692
Ms. He,

602
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,972
Ms. He, are you in there?

603
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:14,212
I'm coming in.

604
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:18,013
Ms. He?

605
00:33:18,812 --> 00:33:19,373
Ms. He?

606
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:21,572
Ms. He?

607
00:33:33,653 --> 00:33:35,253
Why are there so many towels in the bathroom?

608
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:37,932
These were the requests from Ms. He.

609
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:39,812
She suspected that there were cameras

610
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:40,773
in the hotel's bathroom.

611
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:42,292
So she used many towels

612
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:43,292
to cover the places

613
00:33:43,332 --> 00:33:44,572
where she thought

614
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:45,653
there might be cameras.

615
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:47,212
Ms. He said

616
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:48,893
she was showering

617
00:33:49,052 --> 00:33:49,893
when the glass broke.

618
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,413
But from what I saw that time was

619
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:53,692
that she was fully clothed,

620
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:54,812
that she wasn't showering.

621
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,013
It's not the point.

622
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:00,013
The fact is that she was injured.

623
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,373
And it's a fact that Ms. He was evicted

624
00:34:02,653 --> 00:34:03,373
from your hotel.

625
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:06,332
It's true that Ms. He was injured
at our hotel.

626
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:08,492
But we've told her many times

627
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:10,012
that we're willing to bear
the corresponding responsibility.

628
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:12,332
Just that Ms. He didn't accept it.

629
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:14,373
(Besides, we didn't try to evict her that time.)

630
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:15,812
(It was her who requested to leave.)

631
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:16,532
Let go.

632
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,012
Quickly contact my assistant.

633
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:18,933
Tell her to come pick me up now.

634
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:20,052
Right now!

635
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:21,133
Calm down.

636
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,052
I'll take you to the hospital
in a while.

637
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:23,012
Let me help you with the wound...

638
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:23,853
Don't touch me.

639
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:25,052
Be careful.

640
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:25,893
Go away!

641
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:31,933
Ms. He felt very agitated at that moment.

642
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:34,572
We kept trying to calm her down.

643
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:36,092
Actually, our hotel

644
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,133
could've provided some

645
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:38,893
simple medical attention.

646
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:41,213
But Ms. He didn't accept any kind
of our assistance.

647
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:43,653
She clawed and bit our staff

648
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:44,772
and she made a lot

649
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,092
of unreasonable demands on us.

650
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:47,012
Like what?

651
00:34:47,492 --> 00:34:48,133
Like

652
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:49,292
she wanted us

653
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:50,532
to send a chopper over.

654
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:52,492
She wouldn't accept any local

655
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:54,332
or domestics medical attention.

656
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:55,732
She wanted us
to send a chopper over

657
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:56,732
to send her abroad

658
00:34:57,052 --> 00:34:57,693
to meet her personal physician.

659
00:34:57,893 --> 00:34:58,653
We're going to take you
to the hospital.

660
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:00,213
To the hospital?

661
00:35:00,853 --> 00:35:01,853
What hospital?

662
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:03,213
I want to go to the foreign hospitals.

663
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,133
Are you trying to kill me?

664
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:06,252
Ms. He,

665
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:08,292
we can't send you abroad for now.

666
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:10,853
But we can take you
to the best hospital here.

667
00:35:10,853 --> 00:35:11,973
Let's have your wound dressed first.

668
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:12,812
Is that okay with you?

669
00:35:13,332 --> 00:35:13,893
I'm not going.

670
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:15,492
Mister, pull over!

671
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:16,413
Calm down!

672
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:17,693
Calm down, Ms. He.

673
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:19,492
It's not safe like this.

674
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,213
- Pull over, Mister!
- Don't do this!

675
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:31,373
(Partner Counsel)
(Actually, we've got)

676
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,213
(Partner Counsel)
(a lot of evidences.)

677
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:33,732
(These are only part of it.)

678
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:35,413
(But in the hotel industry,)

679
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:36,772
(we're not allowed to leak)

680
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:38,012
(the privacy of the customer)

681
00:35:38,213 --> 00:35:39,332
(due to our professional ethics.)

682
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:42,012
(If Ms. He insists on making)

683
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:43,213
(a big deal out of it,)

684
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:46,092
(I'll publicize the evidence in court.)

685
00:35:46,572 --> 00:35:48,532
(I'm sure Ms. He won't want to see it.)

686
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,772
Actually, the hotel and I are
willing to bear

687
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:51,973
the corresponding responsibility

688
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:54,453
with regard to the unhappy experience

689
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,973
Ms. He had in our hotel.

690
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:58,052
We hope that Ms. He

691
00:35:58,332 --> 00:35:59,772
could accept mediation.

692
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:02,812
Who is this Yao Yao?

693
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:05,933
Madam Tang, I've got the information.

694
00:36:09,973 --> 00:36:11,413
(Yao Yao, 29 years old,)

695
00:36:11,772 --> 00:36:12,653
(a divorcee, single,)

696
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:14,373
(has a five-year-old son.)

697
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:16,653
(She was a flight attendant
in an airline company.)

698
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:18,213
(After leaving the airline company,)

699
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:19,213
(she joined a hotel)

700
00:36:19,532 --> 00:36:20,572
(as a junior clerk.)

701
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:22,532
(Now, she's the marketing manager of the hotel.)

702
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:24,373
(And she's the only person in the hotel)

703
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:26,653
(who's graduated from Holand Butler Academy.)

704
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:29,613
(She has Grade Four Certificate
of International Wine Taster.)

705
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:33,532
Impressive.

706
00:36:33,732 --> 00:36:34,812
She even got a grade four.

707
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:37,173
She spent over a million yuan just on the wine.

708
00:36:39,173 --> 00:36:40,732
Yao Yao is mainly in charge
of managing

709
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,133
the important customers of the hotel.

710
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:44,092
And all these customers

711
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:46,092
have high status.

712
00:36:46,453 --> 00:36:47,052
In the past six months,

713
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:50,332
there's been four to five complaints
against Yao Yao.

714
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:54,092
It all happened
when both parties had conflicts,

715
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:56,213
Yao Yao spoke up of the hotel staff,

716
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:58,453
causing dissatisfaction
of the customers.

717
00:36:59,012 --> 00:36:59,973
After getting complaints

718
00:37:00,173 --> 00:37:00,893
from the clients,

719
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:01,973
she's still able to work in the field.

720
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:02,572
It shows that

721
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,973
the superiors have high regard for her.

722
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:05,012
Not quite.

723
00:37:05,772 --> 00:37:07,453
Yao Yao has signed
a long-term contract

724
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,413
with the hotel.

725
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:11,332
Besides, the hotel has spent a lot on her.

726
00:37:12,052 --> 00:37:13,133
Normally, the hotel won't fire her

727
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:16,693
unless she tramples
serious dereliction of duty.

728
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:18,332
In short,

729
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,732
Yao Yao has no problem at work.

730
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:23,453
Well, it means it's impossible

731
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,732
to ask the hotel to fire this manager.

732
00:37:26,572 --> 00:37:28,012
I think it's not impossible.

733
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:29,413
It mainly depends on

734
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,133
how I make use
of the public opinion.

735
00:37:31,693 --> 00:37:33,213
I've looked into Yao Yao.

736
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:34,893
Her family has been poor
since she was little.

737
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:36,613
She didn't have a happy childhood.

738
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:37,812
It's a single parent family.

739
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,532
Her mother is in poor health.

740
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:40,933
Her private life is

741
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:42,893
kind of like a Cinderella Story.

742
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:44,532
Leaving the airline company

743
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:45,532
was for getting married.

744
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:46,413
She was married to a man

745
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:47,653
who was born with a silver spoon.

746
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,853
This marriage made her a trophy wife.

747
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:53,853
But she wasn't happy in her marriage.

748
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,532
She got divorced two years later.

749
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:57,012
But Tianhang Hotel is

750
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:59,373
still our main target of the public opinion.

751
00:37:59,732 --> 00:38:00,413
In these few days,

752
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:02,292
the public opinion will
constantly emerge.

753
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:04,332
It's mostly negative news.

754
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,812
My current plan is

755
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:09,373
to hand the information we have

756
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,572
to the media step by step.

757
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:11,853
To put constant pressure on them.

758
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:14,893
And solve the problem
in short period of time.

759
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:18,453
What do you think?

760
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:23,653
I think we should be more cautious.

761
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:26,373
Because there'll be dire consequences

762
00:38:26,853 --> 00:38:28,292
once the media is out of control.

763
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:29,933
Public opinion is a double-edged weapon.

764
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:32,092
We don't have the evidence of the fact.

765
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:35,373
It might backfire on us.

766
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:36,853
It's a bad plan to make

767
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:39,653
personal attack towards them.

768
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:41,772
Now that both parties have

769
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:42,933
serious disagreement

770
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:44,413
on what happened that day.

771
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,732
The action the hotel took

772
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:48,933
was indeed unreasonable.

773
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:51,572
Our client is a public figure.

774
00:38:51,853 --> 00:38:53,173
She'll receive more attention

775
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:54,373
and support of the public opinion.

776
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,812
But we should turn all the attention

777
00:38:58,092 --> 00:38:59,732
back to this incident.

778
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:02,173
Now that the controversial point

779
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,052
of this case is

780
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:04,332
whether if our client

781
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:05,933
was injured at the hotel,

782
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:06,812
if the hotel has immediately

783
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,973
taken remedial measures.

784
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,933
The answers are still uncertain now.

785
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:14,653
We got two versions of stories.

786
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,213
Which should we believe?

787
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,853
Of course we should trust our client.

788
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:21,012
We're her attorneys.

789
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:23,252
In fact, in the case,

790
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:25,973
whether the client is telling the truth or lies,

791
00:39:25,973 --> 00:39:27,213
it has nothing to do with us.

792
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:28,092
A lawyer has

793
00:39:29,052 --> 00:39:30,492
no obligation to determine
the true and false.

794
00:39:30,653 --> 00:39:32,812
But we have the obligation to tell the client

795
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,292
that whether she's telling the truth or lies,

796
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,653
there'll be corresponding consequences.

797
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:38,653
All we do is to provide advice.

798
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:39,812
Of course.

799
00:39:40,092 --> 00:39:42,492
The final decision is made by the client herself.

800
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:43,292
All we need to do is

801
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:43,933
to provide corresponding

802
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,292
legal service according
to her decision.

803
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:46,012
That's all.

804
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:49,133
That's right.

805
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:51,413
But Madam Tang,

806
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:53,292
this client of ours is not

807
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:54,413
only a person concerned

808
00:39:54,413 --> 00:39:56,133
to the law firm.

809
00:39:58,693 --> 00:39:59,653
How likely do you think

810
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:00,853
it is that Miss Yao has

811
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:02,133
a solid evidence?

812
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:04,772
I think it's impossible.

813
00:40:05,012 --> 00:40:05,973
If she got the evidence,

814
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:07,413
she would've handed it to the media.

815
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:09,292
Why would she hide it away?

816
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:10,613
Now that both parties

817
00:40:10,613 --> 00:40:12,292
don't have a third party's testimony.

818
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:14,492
We can only say it's a 50-50 deal.

819
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:18,893
Miss Qin.

820
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:22,292
Mr. Zhang went to Wuhan early.

821
00:40:22,572 --> 00:40:25,732
So this office is now yours.

822
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,092
I wasn't lying, was I?

823
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:29,693
How is it?

824
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:31,052
Feel it.

825
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,453
Are you satisfied?

826
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:37,492
So-so.

827
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,613
Okay.

828
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,653
As long as you're satisfied.

829
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:43,772
Well, you continue.

830
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:45,252
Come to me if there's anything.

831
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:02,173
What is this about?

832
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:07,853
What's wrong, Miss?

833
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:09,653
Are you mad?

834
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:12,292
Tell me in private

835
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:13,973
if you have an opinion, okay?

836
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:16,092
Is it necessary to say that
in front of the people?

837
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:20,853
I was just being matter-of-fact.

838
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:23,453
And I think your tactics are

839
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:24,492
not smart at all.

840
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,812
It's suspected of violating the law.

841
00:41:26,252 --> 00:41:26,853
You're a lawyer.

842
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,213
Aren't you aware of that?

843
00:41:28,973 --> 00:41:29,532
Calm down.

844
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:30,653
I don't want to drink it.

845
00:41:31,213 --> 00:41:32,613
Do you think it's a rash move

846
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:33,532
as I choose

847
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:35,213
to hold the conference now?

848
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:37,492
I've looked into the Tianhang Group.

849
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:38,933
They're poorly managed.

850
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:39,693
The superiors have always wanted

851
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:40,653
to look for someone to acquire it.

852
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:41,772
Now that there are

853
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:42,693
several buyers bidding for it.

854
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:44,693
Negative news and lawsuit are

855
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:45,572
what they fear most now.

856
00:41:45,853 --> 00:41:47,572
The most likely outcome of this matter is

857
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:49,092
that Tianhang fires Yao Yao

858
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:51,012
to advertise itself as a company
that rectifies its mistakes.

859
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:52,572
Do you think I begin
a public campaign

860
00:41:52,732 --> 00:41:54,092
only for our sake?

861
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:56,012
I'm just showing
Tianhang the way out.

862
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:56,693
Besides, Dongna will donate

863
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:58,092
all the compensation money

864
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:00,052
to the charitable organization.

865
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:03,332
So the fact you reckon

866
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:05,012
doesn't matter at all.

867
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:09,133
Then, why didn't you tell me this?

868
00:42:09,532 --> 00:42:10,933
I wanted to tell you about it.

869
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:12,613
I wanted to tell you this yesterday.

870
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:14,973
Well, stop being mad.

871
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:18,133
I have no idea

872
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:19,772
why I do this.

873
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:26,213
This kind of working environment

874
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:28,413
is more suitable for Miss Qin.

875
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:31,213
I knew you care about me.

876
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:36,772
What happened to Yang Hua yesterday?

877
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:38,373
Why did he feel discomfort
all of a sudden?

878
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:39,572
What was the problem?

879
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:41,572
It was an acute gastroenteritis.

880
00:42:41,732 --> 00:42:43,092
He felt better after taking medication.

881
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:43,812
Thanks for your concern.

882
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:45,213
Don't mention it.

883
00:42:46,373 --> 00:42:47,092
Qin Shi,

884
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:52,572
I've got a very important mission.

885
00:42:53,812 --> 00:42:54,693
After much thought,

886
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,732
you're the most suitable candidate.

887
00:42:57,413 --> 00:42:58,492
Will you help me?

888
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:01,933
Is it something serious?

889
00:43:02,173 --> 00:43:02,732
That you even

890
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:05,052
solemnly discuss it with me.

891
00:43:06,413 --> 00:43:07,173
For your record,

892
00:43:07,332 --> 00:43:08,653
I'm not going to do dirty things.

893
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:10,292
But if you want me to look into

894
00:43:10,492 --> 00:43:11,492
your Jin's hidden reserves,

895
00:43:11,732 --> 00:43:13,413
just leave it to me,
there won't be a problem.

896
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,173
You're puffing yourself up.
