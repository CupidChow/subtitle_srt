Mom, the braised pork belly

20
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,620
looks different today.

21
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,100
Judging from its color,

22
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,140
you cooked it perfectly.

23
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,300
Eat more then.

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,700
Let me try.

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,020
Delicious.

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,220
Mom, my superior

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,300
and he came from the same school.

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,420
But it seems like they were rivals.

29
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,020
Because of him,

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,980
my superior hates me a lot too.

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,340
Feifei, try the soup Mom made.

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,620
It's great.

33
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,060
Mom, you spent at least eight hours

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,980
stewing the soup, right?

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,300
Do you have

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,180
a rival?

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,580
Why haven't heard about it before?
Who is it?

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,540
There's no rival.

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,020
It's your birthday.

40
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,140
Can't we talk about something else?

41
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,980
We're coworkers. How can we be rivals?

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,740
There's no rival.

43
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,700
Mom, his rival is Qin Shi.

44
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,780
Do you know her?

45
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,140
I have no idea who she is.

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,380
Feifei, try the shrimp.

47
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,060
It's really fresh.

48
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,860
Thank you, Mom.

(Marriage Certificate)

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,820
I can't believe I'm married.

51
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,700
Qin Shi.

52
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,300
If you could accomplish this task,

53
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,700
there's nothing in this world

54
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,660
you can't do.

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,540
You're born for the superstructure.

56
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,300
You're an elite.

57
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,540
It's so red.

58
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,960
(Certificate Holder, Qin Shi)

59
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,900

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
(Certificate Holder, Qin Shi)

61
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,860
I could've flashed a more natural smile.

62
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,660
How did it end up like this?

63
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,220
God of Wealth, take a look at this.

64
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,220
What's wrong?

65
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,860
Why did you go back into hiding?

66
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,180
Do I really look that ugly?

67
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,300
Can we take another photo?

68
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,340
We look great.

69
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,220

102
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,930
I wanted to ask you this morning

103
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,170
if we should try dating each other.

104
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,650
Date each other?

105
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,610
Mr. Yang Hua.

106
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,250
Did you not read

107
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,170
the marriage agreement carefully?

108
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,490
It's clearly written

109
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,530
in the marriage agreement.

110
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,690
Look at Item 3 of Article 4.

111
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,570
As long as the agreement is effective,

112
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,130
we will only be husband and wife.

113
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,530
We have the rights

114
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,530
to regard each other as our spouses.

115
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,210
Other than that,

116
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,690
we will not be allowed

117
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,370
to request the other party

118
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,690
to fulfill any other obligations,

119
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,490
whether emotionally or physically.

120
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,810
For example,

121
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,610
to develop a real romantic relationship

122
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,850
or to fulfill the duty
as a husband or a wife.

123
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,050
Whoever violates the agreement

124
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,050
can be prosecuted

125
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,570
according to criminal or civil law

126
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,090
based on the severity of the incident,

127
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,410
and will be required to pay
a five million yuan worth of compensation.

128
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,340
(Countdown, 5 million debt)

129
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,490
It hurts.

130
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,690
It hurts.

131
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,810
Just bear with me.

132
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,010
You'll feel much better later.

133
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,730
You have overworked yourself.

134
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,610
Get it?

135
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,850
Your blood circulation
is not good enough,

136
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,610
and you need a good massage

137
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,650
to relax your muscles.

138
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,890
Is that what you wanted to tell me

139
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:04,770
this morning?

140
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,490
What else could it be?

141
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,050
Slow down.

142
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:12,890
Is it better now?

143
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,330
Thank you.

144
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,730
I can tell you

145
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,890
everything you want to know

146
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,330
about Qin Shi.

147
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,130
Why did you hide the fact

148
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,050
that you know each other from me?

149
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,490
Why didn't you tell me

150
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,530
that she is your ex-girlfriend?

151
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,810
She's not only my ex-girlfriend,

152
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,370
but also was my fiancee.

153
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,730
We dated each other for seven years,

154
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,730
but we broke up later.

155
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,370
Why did you break up?

156
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,210
It was my fault.

157
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,370
My mom didn't like Qin Shi very much.

158
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,450
Qin Shi had fear of marriage.

159
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,970
When did you break up?

160
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,490
Before I went abroad.

161
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,690
That was two years ago.

162
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,890
Miss Qin has been married for two years.

163
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,170
She has a son too.

164
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,890
What's going on?

165
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,530
She has a son?

166
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,610
Didn't you know about that?

167
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,010
Her son lives in a foreign country now,

168
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,690
and has not returned to the country yet.

169
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,850
I got it.

170
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,530
She is such a jerk.

171
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,530
She is the best of all jerks.

172
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,170
I was too blind.

173
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,290
I thought she was an outstanding woman.

174
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,850
She and Yang Hua

175
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,530
are truly

176
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,610
a good match.

177
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,090
Forget it.

178
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,490
It's all in the past.

179
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,770
How can we just let that go?

180
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,170
How can we forget about it?

181
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,490
They were so mean to you.

182
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,250
You might be able to stand it,
but I can't.

183
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,050
Tao Junhui, you're mine.

184
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,530
I love you so much,

185
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,210
and I won't allow anyone to hurt you.

186
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,330
When they bully you,

187
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,650
they're bullying me too.

188
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,250
Even if

189
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,810
they don't get hit by karma,

190
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,810
someone will make them pay for it too.

191
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,610
How can she be living such a good life

192
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,890
and earning so much at work?

193
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,210
I won't allow that to happen.

194
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,210
Calm down.

195
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,250
I know I'm yours.

196
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,250
I know you care for me too.

197
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,770
None of these matters,

198
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,930
as long as we are together,
living a happy life.

199
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,370
We will definitely live a happy life,

200
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,090
but she's not just anyone.

201
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,890
I won't allow anyone to bully you.

202
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,610
I never want to see you sad.

203
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,240
(According to the latest news,
the prosecutor has decided to confiscate)

204
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,500
(all illegal funds collected by Pang Dingfang
and freeze his application for foreign assets.)

(Magnolia Group Press Conference)

207
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,050
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

208
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,170
I am Zhao Danping.

209
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,170
I'm the spokesperson
for Ms. Lan Xiaoting.

210
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,970
I'm also the newly appointed CEO

211
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,210
of Yulan Group.

212
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,410
The newly appointed CEO?

213
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,170
Some time ago,

214
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,170
Ms. Lan Xiaoting faced allegations

215
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,610
of business fraud
and illegal fundraising.

216
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,290
Firstly,

217
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,770
Ms. Lan did receive

218
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,970
the subpoena from the court.

219
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,730
However, as Ms. Lan wasn't
the actual operator

220
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,890
of Luowei Group,

221
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,210
Ms. Lan is not here

222
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,330
as a defendant.

223
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,010
Instead, she is here
as an independent witness

224
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,890
to assist with the investigation.

225
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,450
Ms. Lan Xiaoting

226
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,610
is the wife to Mr. Pang Dingfang.

227
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,130
Mr. Pang is not in the country now,

228
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,410
and we haven't been able
to get ahold of him.

229
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,050
Ms. Lan wishes to ask

230
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,370
the present media to help her

231
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,370
deliver a message to Mr. Pang.

232
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,370
She hopes Mr. Pang can return
to the country,

233
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,770
face the problems head-on,

234
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,610
and do his duty

235
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,370
as the enterprise manager

236
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,090
and her husband.

237
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,490
During his absence,

238
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,690
Ms. Lan will take full responsibility

239
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,170
of all the debts

240
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,330
and do her best to work out a plan

241
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,170
to repay the debt.

242
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,290
The gentleman in the second row.

243
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,450
As far as I know,

244
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,650
the total assets

245
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,290
under Lan Xiaoting's name

246
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,290
are not enough to pay off
the two billion worth of debt.

247
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,170
Is she capable of repaying the debt?

248
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,050
How can you guarantee us?

249
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,730
Are you going to guarantee us
with the share of Yulan Group?

250
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,080
(Hemispheric Financial Daily)

251
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,970
Let me answer your question.

252
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,570
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

253
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,810
You actually found me

254
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,570
a guarantor during this critical time.

255
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,650
Don't worry, Ms. Lan.

256
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,090
We're just doing our best as a mediator.

257
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,130
I'm indebted to you.

258
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,290
Madam Tang.

259
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,850
Ms. Lan seems very eager

260
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,690
to pay off the debt,

261
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,090
and she even found herself a guarantor.

262
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,290
However,
three years is a very long time.

263
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,410
Do you think

264
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,130
anyone will accept this offer?

265
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,250
I think

266
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,370
you should word it like this.

267
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,610
Ms. Lan seems very eager
to pay off the debt,

268
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,210
and she is also being guaranteed

269
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,810
by a famous investment firm.

270
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,410
Do you think anyone will turn down

271
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,570
this offer?

272
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,730
Are you saying

273
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:27,650
that Cheng & Hui Law Firm

274
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,210
will serve as Yulan Group's guarantor?

275
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,850
Is that right?

276
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,450
What is this?

277
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:01,810
A marriage certificate.

278
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,090
You're not married yet.

279
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:03,970
Of course, you haven't seen one before.

280
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,730
I know it's a marriage certificate.

281
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,370
But what's wrong with the date?

282
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,850
It was only signed

283
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,250
two days ago.

284
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,050
I thought so too,

285
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,370
but according to Miss Qin...

286
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,170
Qiao.

287
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,930
Yang Hua and I

288
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,810
have canceled

289
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,650
our marriage registration
in another country.

290
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,410
Since our law firm

291
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,370
could manage,

292
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,650
we thought it's more convenient

293
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,930
to register our marriage locally.

294
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,490
Look

295
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,810
at Miss Qin.

296
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,250
She is always so efficient and decisive.

297
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,730
What...

298
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,570
What are you doing?

299
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,250
Are you trying to see
if it's counterfeit money?

300
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,130
Just share some of its good luck.

301
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,090
You can get one for yourself

302
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,730
if you want.

303
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,810
Qiao Siming.

304
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,090
You're so dense.

305
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,410
You'll stay

306
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,930
and work in this office forever.

307
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,370
You'll never make it to the 11th floor.

308
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,330
Why not?

309
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,370
I can always take the elevator.

310
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,090
Right?

311
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,530
She's insane.

312
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,210
Thanks for helping me

313
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,810
convince Mr. Jiang and the rest.

314
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,690
There's no need to thank me.

315
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,290
I didn't really have to convince them.

316
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,330
I only helped them

317
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,170
gain the best interest.

318
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,530
If you don't have a plan yet,

319
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,450
let me buy you and Wu Fei lunch.

320
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:34,810
Thanks, but no thanks.

321
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,730
We're busy.

322
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,650
All right. I'll see you around then.

323
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,650
Sure.

324
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,570
Are you mad?

325
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,610
Do you call yourself a man?

326
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,210
How could you do that to Qin Shi?

327
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,370
Remember this.

328
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,290
It's none of your business

329
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,850
what I do to Qin Shi.

330
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,010
Don't stand in my way.

331
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,450
What's the matter with the two of you?

332
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,730
Are you all right?

333
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,130
Do you want me
to send you to the hospital?

334
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,490
Sorry.

335
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,330
I'll compensate
for the broken glasses later.

336
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,770
Miss Li.

337
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,090
You scared me.

338
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,210
Miss Qin.

339
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,130
Do you really have to

340
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,570
go to such lengths

341
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,850
for a job?

342
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,930
You only lost because you think

343
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,010
it's just a job.

344
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,890
Have you heard of
the Pareto principle before?

345
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,130
Only very few things matter.

346
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,770
The rest, although the majority,

347
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,850
isn't the priority.

348
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,090
That applies to our lives too.

349
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,530
Compared to the results I'll get,

350
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,250
this hard work is nothing.

351
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,570
Aren't you afraid of falling

352
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,490
as you climb the ladder?

353
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,330
I'm not climbing a ladder.

354
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,810
I'm just taking advantage
of others' incompetence,

355
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,210
fear, and laziness.

356
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,530
They worry

357
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,890
that others might find out
their mistakes they did.

358
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,370
They don't want their bosses to find out

359
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,170
that they have done something
they shouldn't.

360
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,170
I never worry about those.

361
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,530
Do you?

362
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:45,930
By the way,

363
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,290
what's the name

364
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,930
of the famous milk tea?

365
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,410
The Dark Cloud.

366
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,010
Okay. I'll get that one.

367
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,250
My treat.

368
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,090
Sure.

369
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,130
Do you want a cup too?

370
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,290
What's the matter?

371
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,210
Where are you?

372
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,330
I'm on my way now.

373
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,530
Qianqian.

374
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,090
Bring this to my office.

375
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:14,730
Sure.

376
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:19,970
What happened?

377
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,210
What happened to the glass?

378
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,050
It was...

379
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,890
He smashed it.

380
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:25,810
He smashed it?

381
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,410
Where's your mom?

382
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,490
She's not here.

383
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,810
Let's talk somewhere else.

384
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,530
Let's go.

385
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:50,930
What happened to your hand?

386
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,250
I accidentally bumped it.

387
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:55,970
Does it hurt?

388
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,650
I'm fine.

389
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,650
I know my mom very well.

390
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,570
I don't think

391
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,330
she'll let it go

392
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,730
before she gets what she wants.

393
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,890
I can't imagine what will happen.

394
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,010
Let's meet her, then.

395
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,610
It's just a meeting with parents, right?

396
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,210
We should do it sooner
rather than later.

397
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,690
You'll pick the time and venue.

398
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,730
Are you sure?

399
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:22,530
But

400
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,730
I know my mom really well.

401
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,490
It's not going to be

402
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,370
just a simple meetup.

403
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,890
Don't underestimate her creativity

404
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,130
and imagination.

405
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:29,930
Speaking of power,

406
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,850
she might not be a match for your mom.

407
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,530
But speaking of eloquence...

408
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:33,730
Who told you

409
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,370
that my mom is the most difficult person
in our family?

410
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,210
Compared to my dad,

411
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,090
my mom

412
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,210
is considered
a very gentle middle-aged woman.

413
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,770
Do you know

414
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,770
where did I get this temper from?

415
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,810
Genes are very powerful.

416
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,410
Do you know

417
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,130
what's a language teacher's kryptonite?

418
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,490
It's my dad.

419
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,770
When your mom meets my dad,

420
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,570
it'll be as if a scholar trying to
talk to a savage.

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,090
Sorry.

443
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,370
I still can't master it.

444
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,330
It's not bad.

445
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,490
Drink something.

446
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,690
I need to work harder on this.

447
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,570
Harder.

448
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,410
I didn't know

449
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,730
Qin Shi's father

450
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,770
was the leader of the Art Troupe.

451
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,450
He was a Jue'er.

452
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:18,730
Look.

453
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:19,810
Thanks

454
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,130
for playing along

455
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,850
with an amateur like me.

456
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,810
Don't mention it.

457
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,570
I retired a few years ago too.

458
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,330
I was just having fun.

459
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,170
The moment I met Qin Shi,

460
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,570
I immediately fell in love

461
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,930
with her character and temper.

462
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,330
She's just like me.

463
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,570
We're both straightforward.

464
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,170
We don't beat around the bush.

465
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,290
We say everything
that comes into our minds.

466
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,210
Madam She, I'm flattered.

467
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,890
I know my daughter very well.

468
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,450
She has a very short temper
and is rather unruly.

469
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,970
I've spoiled her.

470
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,650
Please take good care of her

471
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,850
in the future.

472
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,770
Hurry up!

473
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,290
Why are you in such a hurry?

474
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,330
You look good.

475
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,730
Tell you what, Qin.

476
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,090
We're going

477
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,690
to meet our future in-laws

478
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,650
and discuss my daughter's wedding today.

479
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,050
The wedding should be organized

480
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,490
by the groom's family.

481
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,090
They should be paying for it.

482
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,610
For my daughter's wedding,

483
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,410
we want everything

484
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,770
that others get.

485
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,410
We want everything

486
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,290
that others don't get as well.

487
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:35,970
Right?

488
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:36,890
Yes.

489
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,010
When the time comes,

490
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,130
you should stop fooling around.

491
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,650
Don't try to act generous.

492
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,850
I got it.

493
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,770
Fate brought us all together

494
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,250
today.

495
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,890
Let's talk

496
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,290
about their wedding.

497
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,530
- Sure.
- Mr. Qin.

498
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,890
Do you know what I like about Qin Shi

499
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,930
the most?

500
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,130
I like how easygoing she is.

501
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,690
She genuinely cares

502
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,530
for Yangyang.

503
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,250
For her wedding, she has never asked
for any betrothal money,

504
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,690
a house, or even a diamond ring.

505
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,730
It's hard to come by

506
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,290
a lady like her these days,

507
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,610
who's not only capable

508
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,530
and open-minded,

509
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,490
but also good

510
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,290
at seizing chances.

511
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,490
The Yang family is really lucky.

512
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,890
Don't you agree, Yang?

513
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,010
Mrs. Yang.

514
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,450
I think

515
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,730
you don't know Qin Shi

516
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,010
well enough.

517
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,530
When our kid was little,

518
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,250
the first thing

519
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,970
we taught her

520
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,890
was how to reciprocate
others' kindness.

521
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,930
Always repay kindness

522
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,490
with kindness.

523
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,370
That's the most important thing in life.

524
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,810
When we speak of kindness,

525
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,810
we're not talking about the money.

526
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,130
It's the sincerity we care about.

527
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,210
We're not greedy

528
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,490
for others' money,

529
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,010
but we won't allow others

530
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,610
to take advantage of us too.

531
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,730
Am I right?

532
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:19,970
Qin Shi

533
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,410
has received

534
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,370
a very good education.

535
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,970
She has the best academic results,

536
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,010
good personality,
and the perfect upbringing.

537
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,050
When others were asking

538
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,290
their parents

539
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,210
for pocket money,

540
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,450
my daughter was able

541
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,530
to buy me and her father gifts

542
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,770
using her scholarship.

543
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,170
When the other girls

544
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,970
are saving up

545
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,210
for designer bags,

546
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,370
my daughter was capable

547
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,850
of buying her own house.

548
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,050
Academically,

549
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,370
our Yang Hua

550
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,530
did really well at school too.

551
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,050
Has he secured a job yet?

552
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,610
It doesn't matter
whether he has secured a job yet or not.

553
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,290
But not having a job

554
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,450
doesn't mean he has no income.

555
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,890
Does he have money?

556
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,130
Or a house? Or a car?

557
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,090
How does he pay

558
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,210
his insurances
and Housing Provident Fund?

559
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,610
Which tier

560
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,450
is he paying for?

561
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,850
Does he get paid annually or monthly?

562
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,570
How much is his salary?

563
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,210
If they really do

564
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,410
get married,

565
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,370
when is Yang Hua planning to have a baby?

566
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,050
When they have a baby,

567
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,010
and Qin Shi is on maternity leave,

568
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,050
who is going to bear

569
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,210
their daily expenses

570
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,330
and the expenses for their newborn?

571
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,090
What if

572
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,530
Qin Shi falls sick...

573
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,050
No, I mean,

574
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,050
what if she's too tired and

575
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,850
sick of working,

576
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,530
and wishes

577
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,290
to take a short break from work,

578
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,890
who is going to support the family?

579
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,050
Who is going
to take care of my daughter?

580
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,010
We're not listing

581
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,650
any terms,

582
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,730
but it doesn't mean

583
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,450
that my daughter wants nothing.

584
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,650
Most importantly,

585
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,890
we want to know what you can offer.

586
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,970
Mom, have some tea.

587
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,970
I worked so hard

588
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,410
to bring up my daughter.

589
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,490
Now that she has reached the right age
to get married,

590
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,050
a man popped out from nowhere.

591
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,530
He's not offering anything,

592
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,690
but is wishing to take my daughter
with him.

593
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,850
I spent 30 years,

594
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,610
watering and raising her.

595
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,770
And when

596
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,370
she's blooming,

597
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,890
you're going
to take the whole flower pot

598
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,890
away from me.

599
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:15,850
No one

600
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,010
will give up their daughter so easily.

601
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:28,690
Are you finished?

602
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,490
Let me say a few things.

603
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,490
Sure.

604
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,890
I would really like to have Qin Shi

605
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,810
as my daughter-in-law.

606
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,090
I think we should definitely hold

607
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,290
a wedding too.

608
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,970
I think so too.

609
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,530
I agree with you.

610
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,410
Dad.

611
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,130
It's great

612
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,410
that we're on the same page.

613
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,530
Mrs. Qin.

614
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,050
Although we're not a wealthy family,

615
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,330
we'll definitely organize

616
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,290
the perfect wedding for our children.

617
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,490
We have a house

618
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,410
and we can buy a car for them too.

619
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,730
We'll give our children
everything they like and need.

620
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,730
Being the groom's parents,

621
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,490
we'll certainly do everything we can.

622
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,410
Am I right?

623
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,210
Don't worry.

624
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,290
You saw it yourself.

625
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,890
They said they wanted nothing,

626
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,130
but look at what happened.

627
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,450
They want everything.

628
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,090
She was the one who said

629
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,250
that she didn't want a wedding.

630
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,290
Now, not only are
they asking for a wedding,

631
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,090
but they're also asking for a grand one.

632
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,090
Her mother also thinks
that we're unworthy of her.

633
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,410
Do you have a house?

634
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,530
Do you have a car?

635
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,250
That's enough.

636
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,490
If you have so much free time,

637
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,370
why don't you reflect upon yourself?

638
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,850
Qin Shi's parents weren't completely wrong.

639
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,610
Of course,

640
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,730
they want a nice wedding

641
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,850
for their daughter.

642
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,770
How is that wrong?

643
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,450
And it's also true

644
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,130
that we don't have a house or a car for our kid.

645
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,650
They weren't wrong either.

646
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,930
As long as the kids
truly love each other,

647
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,290
we shouldn't impose
our opinions on them.

648
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,290
Right?

649
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,690
Of course, we're holding a wedding.

650
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,570
I've never said
that we're skipping the wedding.

651
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,850
But they're in such a hurry.

652
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,770
I won't have enough time to prepare it.

653
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,650
Don't wait until they explicitly ask for something.

654
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,770
We should offer it to them.

655
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,290
Hua.

656
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,170
Discuss with your mom about

657
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,690
what should we include
and what we shouldn't.

658
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,570
Just let me know.

659
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,610
Mom, I want nothing.

660
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,810
I have a house and a car.

661
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,490
Although Yang Hua doesn't have a job,

662
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,130
he is financially independent too.

663
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,850
He doesn't ask his parents for money.

664
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,050
I'm just getting married.

665
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,410
Why are you making it such a great deal?

666
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,570
Fine. I respect you.

667
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,930
But shouldn't you respect my decision too?

668
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,890
I just want to have a meal
with my family.

669
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,610
I don't want to make it
into such a great deal.

670
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:21,770
Moreover,
do you think anyone will turn up

671
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,650
even if we are to hold a banquet?

672
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,730
Of course.

673
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,450
There are a lot of aunties

674
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,250
back in your grandmother's hometown.

675
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,770
I'll invite all of them here.

676
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,490
Don't forget

677
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,610
our neighbors too.

678
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,690
Of course, I'm inviting them as well.

679
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:40,530
Tell you what.

680
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,890
I'm going to invite

681
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,250
the lady who lives upstairs too.

682
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,490
Xiaomei, why do you want to invite her?

683
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,210
It's none of your business.

684
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,250
I can invite whoever I want.

685
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,250
Those who said

686
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,810
that my daughter
would never get married.

687
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:54,730
I would invite all of them.

688
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,570
I want to show them

689
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,730
that my daughter is marrying
a good husband.

690
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,050
- She's marrying a good man.
- Mom!

691
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,970
You're just trying
to satisfy your vanity.

692
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:02,890
You're only trying to use my wedding

693
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:03,730
to flatter your ego.

694
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,250
Shi,

695
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,930
how could you say that to your mom?

696
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,250
I'm only doing that for your sake.

697
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,170
You know nothing.

698
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,850
Shi is driving.

699
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:14,970
Stay out of this.

700
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,810
Stop acting like a Saint.

701
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:18,970
Tell you what.

702
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,690
I'm only inviting all these people

703
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,010
to make you look good.

704
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,450
Why don't we talk

705
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,650
about those quarrels you had with others

706
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,530
during the mahjong games?

707
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,410
I'm only doing this

708
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,210
to save you some face.

709
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,330
Stop playing the good guy here.

710
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,610
Shi, pull over.

711
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,210
I'm not going to keep sitting here.

712
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,330
I'm walking home.

713
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,090
Are you kidding me?

714
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,050
Stop freaking out.

715
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,250
Please pull over.

716
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,650
All right. I'll pull over.

717
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,890
Mom.

718
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,610
Mom.

719
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,770
Leave me alone.

720
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,170
I gave birth to you

721
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,490
and raised you up,

722
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,130
but you are upsetting me now.

723
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:08,770
Isn't it?

724
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,730
That's not true.

725
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,690
You're getting married soon.

726
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,890
When you have a daughter of your own,

727
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,770
who takes after you,

728
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,170
and when you finally become a mother,

729
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,010
you'll understand why I'm doing this.

730
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,930
Mom.

731
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,410
That's enough.

732
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,250
Shi.

733
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:26,890
It's fine.

734
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,890
I'll keep an eye on her.

735
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:28,610
Will you be all right?

736
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,730
I'll be fine.

737
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,210
Go ahead.

738
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,370
Drive safe.

739
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,850
Look at you.

740
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,890
Why are you upset with your kid?

741
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,650
You spoiled her.

742
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,610
Although we're friends,

743
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,370
I agree with her mom.

744
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,610
Take my daughter for example.

745
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,370
Imagine one day,

746
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,490
she brings a man home

747
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,570
and tell me,

748
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,770
"Dad. I'm marrying him
despite he has nothing."

749
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,570
I swear I'll kill the guy

750
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,210
on the spot.

751
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,530
This has nothing to do with money,

752
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,690
because you can't put a price tag
on a beautiful marriage.

753
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,730
However, you need some money

754
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,330
before you can have a beautiful wedding.

755
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,050
Think about it.

756
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:24,930
The prettier

757
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,570
it is,

758
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,170
the more we can't give it out for free.

759
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,170
Right?

760
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,130
Free lunch

761
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,330
is never people's favorite.

762
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,370
People don't like free stuff.

763
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,010
And men only care

764
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,410
about superficial things.

765
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,170
They have very simple minds.

00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,250
Hello?

777
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:51,850
Hello?

778
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,330
I'm going to hang up
if you're not going to say anything.

779
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,170
What do you like the most?

780
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,610
What do you dislike the most?

781
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,450
What do you mean?

782
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,370
Are you drunk?

783
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,530
I used to dislike it the most

784
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,610
when my mom put a lot of pressure on me
about getting married.

785
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,250
Now, I hate it the most

786
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,450
when my mom sets up a blind date for me.

787
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,250
(And what I like...)

788
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,970
(I like...)

789
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,290
I don't like the hotel at the entrance.

790
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,050
Do you know

791
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,930
what I dislike?

792
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,930
Now,

793
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,690
I dislike Tao Junhui the most.

794
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,050
I dislike the way he looks at you.

795
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:07,050
I don't like to see you getting hurt
because of him.

796
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,810
I hate him. I want to beat him up.

797
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,530
I beat him up the last time.

798
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,970
I almost got him,

799
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,930
but he was lucky.

800
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,890
(Qin Shi.)

801
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,770
(You're priceless.)

802
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,690
You're

803
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,050
all the best things in this world.

804
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,290
I want to give you all I have.

805
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,810
(Things you want
and things you do not want.)

806
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,290
(I want to give you all of them.)

807
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,290
How much did you drink?

808
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,010
Shi.

809
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,770
We're getting married.

810
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,370
We're getting married.

811
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:19,770
I love you.

812
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,810
(I love you so much.)

813
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,290
(I'll definitely give you)

814
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,250
(the best marriage.)

815
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,810
The one you've always asked for.

816
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,250
Hello?

817
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:46,410
Hello?

818
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,850
You're so childish.

819
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:32,810
Tony.

820
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,050
Where is my wine?

821
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,570
Sorry, Madam Tang.

822
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,370
Let me check it for you.

823
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,370
Give me a moment.

824
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,690
Who's the guy dancing over there?

825
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,730
He looks so familiar.

826
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:46,930
He's Wu Wei Song, Mr. Wu,

827
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,010
from Xi Mei PR.

828
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:04,770
Cai Liang.

829
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,210
How much did he drink?

830
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,690
Not much.

831
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,170
Wake up.

832
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:14,570
It's time to wake up.

833
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:15,970
Your wife is here.

834
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:16,810
Wake up.

835
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:17,770
My wife?

836
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:18,690
Hurry up. Your wife is here.

837
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,810
I don't have a wife.
