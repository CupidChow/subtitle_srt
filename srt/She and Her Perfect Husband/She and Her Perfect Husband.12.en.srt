=Episode 12=

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,320
I figure no one

20
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,801
knows Ms. Lan better than you

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
so at the moment,

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,241
Cheng & Hui

23
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,280
is our best option.

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,601
First thing first,

25
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:31,081
who exactly are we

26
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,521
representing this time?

27
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,521
Ms. Lan

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,081
or her husband, Mr. Pang?

29
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,601
Both.

30
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:50,920
In that case,

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,840
we can...

32
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,321
Believe me. Believe Pang.

33
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,360
He isn't like what the rumor says he is.

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,840
Luowei Yulan isn't lacking in money.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,401
Why should we

36
00:02:58,401 --> 00:02:59,601
con others for their money?

37
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:01,601
Someone is slandering

38
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,081
Luowei Yulan, I tell you.

39
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,321
Calm down, Ms. Lan.

40
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:05,441
Calm down.

41
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,401
Let's set that aside first.

42
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:09,560
Second question.

43
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,601
Did you partake

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,441
in the daily operation of Luowei Yulan?

45
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,161
I...

46
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,081
Wait.

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,321
Answer me
once you have thought it through.

48
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,081
By partaking,

49
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:24,120
I mean using your identity

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,161
as an operator of the firm

51
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,360
to sign contracts

52
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,000
to close a deal.

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,200
Or perhaps use that identity
to access financial information

54
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,720
before taking out a loan.

55
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:36,120
Did you

56
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:37,720
do it?

57
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,120
Please answer honestly.

58
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:41,760
No.

59
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:44,640
Okay.

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,280
I believe you.

61
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:49,801
Jin.

62
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:51,120
Thank you.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,760
You're the first one

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,601
who looked into my eyes

65
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:54,760
and said he believed me.

66
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:58,840
No one trusts me anymore.

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,881
They say I'm a liar.

68
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:03,241
Those who used to look

69
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,681
and smile at me

70
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,560
now became demons

71
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,280
who want a piece of me.

72
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,041
You have no idea what my life

73
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,241
has become.

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,961
I don't even dare to go home.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,401
Fortunately, Danping is here.

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,880
Otherwise,

77
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,401
I might truly

78
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:23,841
kill myself.

79
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:25,360
Ms. Lan.

80
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,040
This is just the beginning.

81
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,200
It will become worse.

82
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,241
Would you like to hear

83
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,801
our opinion on this?

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,640
Go ahead.

85
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:41,801
Ms. Lan.

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Although you are the defendant,

87
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,360
you are not the operator

88
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,561
of Luowei Yulan.

89
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,880
The plaintiff's attorney

90
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,521
does not have any evidence

91
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,401
that proves you were aware of it.

92
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,681
Therefore, it's highly unlikely

93
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:57,401
that you would be charged

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,160
with fraud or illegal fund-raising.

95
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,281
But your husband

96
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,480
is another story.

97
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,200
He is abroad.

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,001
This makes him look bad.

99
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:09,880
He is more likely

100
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,480
to be found guilty.

101
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:17,200
Fang, Tan.

102
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,081
What do you think?

103
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,121
Fraudulent fund-raising
is a criminal offense.

104
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,121
If the sum

105
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,521
exceeds 2.5 million yuan,

106
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:25,121
it will be considered as a huge sum.

107
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,200
Not only will all your assets
be confiscated,

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,561
you will also get either a life sentence

109
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,561
or death sentence.

110
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,001
It can't be.

111
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,480
Pang isn't a fraudster.

112
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,961
He isn't.

113
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:35,961
Calm down.

114
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,440
Evidence means everything in court.

115
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,801
The judge will not hand out

116
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,001
death sentence easily either.

117
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:44,081
Aunt.

118
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,241
Let's let Mr. Jin finish.

119
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:47,081
Okay.

120
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,001
At the moment,

121
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,040
the operator of Luowei Yulan,

122
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,081
Pang Dingfang,

123
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
your husband,

124
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,961
is abroad.

125
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:57,721
The best way to prove his innocence

126
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,961
is for him to return home.

127
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:03,961
Next,

128
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,561
I'll ask you the third question.

129
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,401
Go ahead.

130
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,760
Ms. Lan.

131
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:11,160
Can you make sure

132
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,721
Mr. Pang comes back?

133
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,600
Yes.

134
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:17,401
If this hasn't happened,

135
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,640
we had agreed

136
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,440
that I would visit my son abroad
for two weeks

137
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,040
and we would come back together.

138
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:24,081
He even called me yesterday

139
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:25,200
to reassure me.

140
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,480
He would book a flight ticket

141
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,760
and when he's back, everything
would be all right.

142
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:29,040
You talked to him?

143
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,721
Yes, he calls me every day

144
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,200
to ask about me.

145
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,040
You told him everything?

146
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,040
Yes.

147
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Shouldn't I?

148
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:38,081
Miss Qin.

149
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,961
I don't know what your hunch is

150
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:41,401
but this

151
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,721
sounds familiar.

152
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,721
Mr. Jin.

153
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,721
Just be frank with me.

154
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:50,401
And now,

155
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:52,040
I will tell you

156
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,241
the worst-case scenario.

157
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:56,760
If your husband,

158
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,281
Pang Dingfang, was found guilty,

159
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:00,961
and he fled abroad with the fund,

160
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:01,760
then you'll

161
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:04,281
be in this situation.

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,760
Criminally,

163
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,160
if they don't have direct evidence,

164
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,801
Ms. Lan,

165
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,681
you won't be found guilty.

166
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,401
But in civil laws,

167
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:18,401
you have to shoulder

168
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:19,721
the debts.

169
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:21,401
As of speaking, Luowei Yulan

170
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:23,040
owes two billion yuan.

171
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,160
Your company will turn insolvent

172
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,001
and you will file for bankruptcy.

173
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,880
And then,
the court will liquidate your assets.

174
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:30,160
Since Mr. Pang will be guilty

175
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,681
of a criminal offense,

176
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:33,360
according to the relevant laws,

177
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,521
his personal property

178
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,880
will be confiscated

179
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,360
and that includes

180
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,640
community assets.

181
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,561
You have been married to him

182
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,121
for three decades.

183
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,200
If you two did not sign

184
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,721
any prenup,

185
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:47,281
any property or real estate

186
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,040
under the married couple's name

187
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,681
such as savings, jewelry,

188
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,360
bond, stocks,

189
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,440
or even stock option

190
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,241
will be liquidated

191
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,521
to pay the debt.

192
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:58,360
And then,

193
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,480
the stocks of Yulan Group

194
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,880
that you own

195
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,801
will be taken away.

196
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:06,841
Then...

197
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:08,121
She'll have nothing.

198
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,040
In that case,

199
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,721
even if my uncle did commit a crime,

200
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:12,961
my aunt shouldn't have

201
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,040
to bear the consequences.

202
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,561
Danping.

203
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:16,200
Aunt.

204
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,160
If you don't care about yourself,

205
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,961
what about Qiuqiu?

206
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,241
He just started university.

207
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,001
His tuition fee is around 500,000 yuan.

208
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,880
And what shall

209
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,480
he do in the future?

210
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:30,561
Luowei Yulan

211
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,760
is a sinking ship.

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
If you don't want to drown with him,

213
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:37,281
there's only one way.

214
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:39,081
What way?

215
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,361
Miss Li?

216
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:05,161
Divorce.

217
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,481
No.

218
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:07,601
Impossible.

219
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,281
Calm down, Aunt.

220
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,841
We have to prepare
for the worst outcome.

221
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,961
No. This is non-negotiable.

222
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:15,240
This is just a hypothesis.

223
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,481
The worst-case scenario.

224
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,841
I will hear none of it.

225
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:18,800
Let's go.

226
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,161
Pang will be back soon.

227
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,120
I won't listen!

228
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:22,961
Aunt.

229
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,281
Sorry, Mr. Jin.

230
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:25,560
I'll talk to my aunt

231
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,601
when we go back.

232
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:31,680
Miss Zhao.

233
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,521
Please think carefully

234
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,120
about my first question.

235
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,760
Who exactly is Cheng & Hui

236
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,281
representing?

237
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,081
If you have the answer,

238
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,841
feel free to contact us.

239
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:53,800
Thanks, Mr. Jin.

240
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,081
Thank you for what you did today.

241
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:58,320
I thank you on my aunt's behalf.

242
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,240
I will

243
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,800
talk to her too.

244
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,961
Let's go, Aunt.

245
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,640
Let's go.

246
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,601
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

247
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:15,680
Mr. Jin sure is something.

248
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,521
He turned down

249
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:18,760
the case of Luowei Yulan

250
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,481
because it is a divorce case.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,560
It's hard for us

252
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,800
to understand how his mind works.

253
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,440
You only get it now?

254
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,401
When I saw Miss Qin and Miss Li

255
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,081
enter the conference room,

256
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,841
I knew something was going to happen.

257
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:29,880
Think about it.

258
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,081
Why would two attorneys
from the family department

259
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,640
attend the meeting
for a financial lawsuit?

260
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,041
Miss Qin, Miss Li.

261
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,680
I count on you

262
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
to pull through.

263
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,000
If you can win this case,

264
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:41,161
you two will be famous.

265
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:44,200
We still don't know who

266
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
will handle this case.

267
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,680
We don't even know if they
will come to us or not.

268
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:48,440
Also,

269
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
if Cheng & Hui takes up this case,

270
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,601
it belongs to us.

271
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
You're too humble, Miss Qin.

272
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:54,000
Whether it will happen or not,

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,361
it's just a matter of your decision.

274
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:57,041
Isn't asking people to divorce

275
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:57,640
the specialty

276
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,841
of the family department?

277
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:00,161
Mr. Tan.

278
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,521
You are accusing us here.

279
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,481
I get it if others have misconceptions

280
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,760
regarding our department.

281
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,481
But since when

282
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,281
did you stoop to that level?

283
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:12,440
People from the family department

284
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,120
might also think

285
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,481
those who work
in the criminal case department

286
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:15,841
are actively persuading people to kill

287
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,560
just so that you can have a case.

288
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:20,880
I know, right?

289
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,041
If you ever need our service,

290
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,281
we will tell you

291
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,760
to work it out
instead of getting a divorce.

292
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,210
(HOUSEHOLD SECTOR)

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,921
Miss Qin.

294
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,521
I don't know what you think of it

295
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,601
but I don't

296
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:50,880
think I'll take up this case.

297
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
It's tricky

298
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:53,680
for hardly any gain.

299
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:55,161
What do you think?

300
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:56,880
You make it sound like

301
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
we already have the case in the bag.

302
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
Even Hui or Mr. Jin

303
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,361
isn't definitive about it.

304
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,041
I will pay it no mind.

305
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,401
Besides, I have enough cases

306
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,000
until the end of the year.

307
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,481
In my opinion,

308
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:08,560
I handle someone else's case

309
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
but I live my life.

310
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,401
What do you think?

311
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:27,961
Hello?

312
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:30,921
Okay. Noted.

313
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:31,481
Hello?

314
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:33,521
Okay. Noted.

315
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:47,721
I need a favor from you

316
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,401
but don't tell anyone.

317
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,000
Stop whatever

318
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,961
you're doing now.

319
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,721
You will leave early today

320
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,640
and go to your friend

321
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,961
in Xi Mei PR.

322
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,481
Ask him to check

323
00:12:58,481 --> 00:12:59,640
Lan Xiaoting's financial status.

324
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,921
I know

325
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:02,081
Ms. Lan has been working

326
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,200
with Xi Mei PR

327
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,640
so they should have the info.

328
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,401
Sure, Miss Qin.

329
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,120
Are we

330
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,401
representing Ms. Lan?

331
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:12,680
No, I didn't say that.

332
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,760
But that doesn't mean
we can't investigate.

333
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,841
I see.

334
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:21,081
Create an illusion to mislead
your opponent.

335
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,440
Wonderful.

336
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:26,081
Jot down this address.

337
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,041
It's Pang Dingfang's overseas address.

338
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,361
(Miss Zhao, if possible,)

339
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:37,521
(can you give me)

340
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:38,921
(Mr. Pang's oversea address?)

341
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,320
(Better safe than sorry.)

342
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,900
(San Francisco, USA)

343
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:54,401
Have someone check

344
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,000
Pang Dingfang's situation abroad.

345
00:13:58,521 --> 00:13:59,161
Okay.

346
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,361
Keep a low profile.

347
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:04,200
Don't...

348
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:10,640
I'll go now then.

349
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,521
Don't meddle in this case.

350
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,721
What you need to do now

351
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:26,240
is get into the corporation department.

352
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,120
Just keep it up

353
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,200
and don't make any mistakes.

354
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,440
This case

355
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,041
is a hot potato.

356
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,481
If you screw up,
it will backfire on you.

357
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,200
So?

358
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,120
Your mom surrendered already?

359
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,880
She promised not to

360
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,721
mention marriage

361
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,880
within the next three months.

362
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,521
Really?

363
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:52,081
Thank goodness!

364
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,041
Praise the lord!

365
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:54,200
Do you know?

366
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:55,640
Your mom

367
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,120
calls me

368
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
every day.

369
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,721
Honestly,

370
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:01,361
she is very persistent.

371
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,120
If she's 20 years younger,

372
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,760
she can be an interrogation expert.

373
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,401
I almost gave her the code

374
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,481
to my credit card.

375
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:08,401
Thank you for doing this.

376
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:09,721
I'll give you
an extra chicken drumstick later.

377
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Make it two, at least.

378
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:13,560
Oh, did the agent

379
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,601
find you any good apartments?

380
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:16,961
Why though?

381
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:18,841
Don't you have a place to stay already?

382
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,041
I want to move out.

383
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:23,281
Move out?

384
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:24,081
Why?

385
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,640
Miss Qin kicked you out?

386
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,320
Aren't you two working together?

387
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,521
Is she kicking away the ladder?

388
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:29,401
No.

389
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:30,680
But I can't impose myself like that.

390
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,041
I will affect her life.

391
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,560
What do you mean by you can't?

392
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,440
You were living with her.

393
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,521
That you two were on a symbiotic
partnership.

394
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:41,841
Also,

395
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:42,680
you did a huge favor

396
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,601
to her company.

397
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,240
Why can't she let you crash
for a few days?

398
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:47,601
If you

399
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:48,721
feel bad about it,

400
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:50,320
pay her rent then.

401
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:52,401
It saves you the hassle of finding

402
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:53,240
an apartment.

403
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,240
Yang.

404
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,000
Who's to say

405
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,560
that nothing will happen

406
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,240
when time goes on?

407
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:09,281
What I mean

408
00:16:09,481 --> 00:16:10,961
is that looking for an apartment

409
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:11,841
that fits your criteria

410
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,240
is too difficult.

411
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:14,880
You manage to cohabitate

412
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,200
with Miss Qin peacefully.

413
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,521
That's like a miracle.

414
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,880
Never have I imagined

415
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,361
that you could

416
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:22,680
live with another female

417
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,200
other than your mom.

418
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,640
What a miracle.

419
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:28,120
Qin Shi is the third female.

420
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,081
God of Wealth is second.

421
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:30,081
It's a female.

422
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,041
If you put it that way,

423
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,961
I have to mention

424
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,921
your ex-girlfriend, Yao...

425
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:41,601
Yang.

426
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:43,161
Where are you going?

427
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,041
You're not eating?

428
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:45,760
Wait for me.

429
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,961
I'm stuck.

430
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:47,961
Oh my god.

431
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:49,440
Yang.

432
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:02,921
Mr. Jin asked me to speak

433
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,081
in the meeting.

434
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:06,121
Why did he do that?

435
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,200
What do you think?

436
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,481
I think

437
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,241
maybe

438
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,040
I won't be

439
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:24,040
a trophy attorney this time?

440
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,761
You...

441
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,841
I can't believe this.

442
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:32,160
You're smart when you're handling cases

443
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:33,481
but when it comes to another thing,

444
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:34,881
you become stupid.

445
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:37,601
Excuse me?

446
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,641
What's your opinion then?

447
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:49,841
Qin Shi

448
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,841
saved Hui from paying

449
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:53,481
25 million yuan in damages.

450
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,961
What do you think she is now

451
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:55,601
in Hui's eyes?

452
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:57,841
Like a daughter.

453
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,081
The apple of her eye.

454
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:02,280
If a parent forbids

455
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,481
his or her kid

456
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,721
from taking part in an activity,

457
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,200
what do you think is the reason?

458
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,841
Because the activity brings no profit.

459
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:11,320
Not only that,

460
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:13,560
it might harm the kid too.

461
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,961
So,

462
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:17,721
imagine,

463
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,841
if you're about

464
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,680
to be promoted
to the corporation department

465
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,560
and now, you have to turn back

466
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,641
to handle this complicated case

467
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:26,440
from the family department,

468
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,361
will you do it?

469
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,560
In that case,

470
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,280
there is no hope for me then.

471
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:45,800
I spoke too much.

472
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:47,721
Eat.

473
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,320
I'm not hungry.

474
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,520
See?

475
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,040
You're always like this.

476
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,601
Don't ask me to treat you next time.

477
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:55,881
You'll treat me.

478
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,601
This is expensive.

479
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,121
Have some. Come on.

480
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:23,000
(Real Estate Information Spreadsheet)

481
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,540
(Mr. Tao Junhui)

482
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,160
Come in.

483
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:41,680
Hi, your food is here.

484
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,121
I didn't order any.

485
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,001
Mr. Tao.

486
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,601
Are you sure you didn't order anything?

487
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:52,361
How long has it been since I last saw

488
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:53,320
my baby?

489
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,001
Now, you know.

490
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,680
You are

491
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,081
always busy.

492
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,560
I almost forgot what you look like.

493
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,481
Good thing I'm a sensible person.

494
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:02,761
Otherwise, I would have come way sooner.

495
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,280
You're the most sensible person
in the world.

496
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,520
Of course.

497
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,800
When do you finish work?

498
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,040
Right now.

499
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:13,081
Getting smarter by the day.

500
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:13,560
Of course.

501
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,440
You came.

502
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,400
I have to catch the hint somehow.

503
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,361
Right?

504
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:17,361
What should we eat?

505
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:18,001
You decide.

506
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,920
Let's have a hotpot back home.

507
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,320
Okay. Let's go.

508
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,520
We'll shop for some ingredients.

509
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,961
All right.

510
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,841
Bye.

511
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:40,560
What are you doing?

512
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,881
We have a lot of meat in the fridge.

513
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:42,881
You won't have enough place.

514
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,800
Slice this and cook it inside the hotpot.

515
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,001
It's delicious.

516
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,081
This is red meat.

517
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:54,961
There is a huge issue

518
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,440
with your diet.

519
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,400
Too much red meat.

520
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,241
It contains a lot

521
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,121
of saturated fatty acid

522
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:00,841
and is one of the factors

523
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:02,680
of cardiovascular diseases.

524
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:03,721
Also, the consumption of meat

525
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,241
is not good for your health.

526
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:06,641
It's also a symbol of indulgence.

527
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,560
It's not a bad thing.

528
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,160
Being motivated

529
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,761
is a sign of ambitiousness, all right?

530
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,920
Also,

531
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
vegetarianism

532
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
doesn't mean desireless.

533
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,400
Adam and Eve screwed up

534
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,761
by eating an apple.

535
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:22,481
I beg to differ.

536
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,601
Adam and Eve were corrupted

537
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,721
not because of the apple,

538
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:27,961
but because they broke their oath.

539
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:29,121
The one who seduced them
into breaking the oath

540
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,841
was a snake, an animal.

541
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,081
I've been using this brand.

542
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,560
This one is on sale.

543
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,721
It's famous too.

544
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,361
We need two shopping carts.

545
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,160
Spare me, please.

546
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:20,400
Tell me.

547
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:22,361
If you were me,

548
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:23,520
would you try to take up

549
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,241
Lan Xiaoting's case?

550
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:26,040
No.

551
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,841
Why?

552
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:28,121
Because Madam Tang has told you

553
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:29,241
the pros and cons of it very clearly.

554
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,920
This is a tricky case.

555
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,641
That's why I'm an attorney.

556
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:35,081
You know,

557
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
I actually

558
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,641
want to take this case.

559
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:39,761
It's not because

560
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:41,081
I want them to get a divorce.

561
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:42,721
But based on my experience,

562
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:43,601
Pang Dingfang

563
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:45,160
planned his escape

564
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,841
and he has done all the preparations.

565
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,001
You're too negative.

566
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,200
His wife is still here.

567
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:51,961
It's not about pessimism.

568
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:53,400
If he

569
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,920
wanted to protect his wife,

570
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,721
he would have fled with her.

571
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,121
Leaving Ms. Lan here

572
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,320
is like leaving a ticking time bomb to her.

573
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:02,761
You don't get it?

574
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,040
Let me explain.

575
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,721
How goes the lawsuit

576
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:08,680
against Luowei Yulan?

577
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,761
When is the trial?

578
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,160
The court has made a case

579
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,841
but due to the amount
of information involved,

580
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,361
it will take some time

581
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,481
before we have a date.

582
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:19,241
How likely are you to win?

583
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:22,081
Why are you so interested

584
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:23,761
in my case out of a sudden?

585
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:25,241
Didn't Cheng & Hui

586
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:26,280
decide against representing

587
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,601
Luowei Yulan?

588
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,400
I just want to know more

589
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,641
about your work.

590
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:33,241
Please.

591
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,200
What do you want?

592
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:35,761
Come clean now.

593
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:38,280
I have a bet with someone else.

594
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,320
You're the representing attorney

595
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,761
so I bet that you would win the case.

596
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:42,081
But Pang Dingfang

597
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:43,200
is abroad.

598
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,881
He won't be able

599
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:44,800
to come back now.

600
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,400
So even if you win the case,

601
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,481
you cannot distrain.

602
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:48,361
Everything will be in vain.

603
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,520
What do you mean by I cannot distrain?

604
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:52,400
It will be difficult. That's all.

605
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,680
We have asked the court to proceed with

606
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,280
property inspection
and property preservation.

607
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,641
Do you like mutton strips?

608
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,081
I like this one too.

609
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:02,841
This one, it is.

610
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,241
Okay.

611
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,520
Property inspection
and property preservation

612
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,560
have to be carried out, of course.

613
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,001
However,

614
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:10,320
Lan Xiaoting has retired

615
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,520
from managing the firm for many years.

616
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:12,560
I believe

617
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,121
she doesn't know much

618
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,200
about the assets she possesses.

619
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,241
In the worst-case scenario,

620
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:19,200
she possesses negative equity.

621
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:22,800
In other words, her real property
was leveraged.

622
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:28,841
Other than Yulan Group,

623
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:30,160
the properties

624
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,241
under Lan Xiaoting's name,

625
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,680
her numerous high-end beauty centers,

626
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:36,400
and education centers,

627
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,320
we applied for their seizures.

628
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,841
What?

629
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:41,081
What what?

630
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:42,200
You seized them.

631
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,160
Of course.

632
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:46,520
Asset seizure is the worst.

633
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,721
In terms of property appraisal,

634
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,160
education centers and beauty centers

635
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,761
belong to asset-light businesses.

636
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,481
In the event of bankruptcy,

637
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
they won't sell for a lot of money.

638
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,320
If you run it,

639
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,761
it produces a lot of liquidity.

640
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,040
But should panic arise
from the seizure...

641
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:02,361
It's done for.

642
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,001
Yes.

643
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,481
But

644
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:05,800
he deserves it.

645
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,361
He only has his greed to blame.

646
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,881
Oh, the benevolent sage,

647
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:15,280
if everyone has

648
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,920
plain dishes like you every day,

649
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,361
will this society

650
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:18,680
be full of love?

651
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,761
Profit-seeking
is the nature of capitalism.

652
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:23,641
The society becomes the way it is

653
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,160
because of capital, isn't that right?

654
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,160
Bringing up anti-consumerism

655
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,361
in a cosmopolitan like Pujiang

656
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,481
is an act

657
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:32,601
of hypocrisy.

658
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:34,481
You masked

659
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,560
your negativity

660
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,761
with desireless.

661
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:39,800
You don't have the right

662
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,001
to say I'm a hypocrite.

663
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:43,680
Although you may have a valid reason,

664
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,481
you walk the path

665
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,040
of deception.

666
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,001
You live like this

667
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:50,601
because you seek success.

668
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:52,280
If you seek

669
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,800
something less ambitious,

670
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,841
maybe you wouldn't have

671
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:56,200
as many troubles as you do now.

672
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:58,641
I know what you're trying to say

673
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,721
but is justice achieved through lying

674
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,081
true justice?

675
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:12,040
You poke at where it hurts the most

676
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:13,241
so I'll return the same favor.

677
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Have you found an apartment?

678
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,560
I'm on it.

679
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,920
You asked me so many questions.

680
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,961
It's my turn now.

681
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,560
Did Lan Xiaoting

682
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
visit Cheng & Hui?

683
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:30,601
No.

684
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:32,241
Not at all. No.

685
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,680
Do you know you have this habit?

686
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,800
Whenever you lie,

687
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,920
you repeat the same words.

688
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,481
It's good. It's good.

689
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:41,320
No. No.

690
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:43,601
No.

691
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,641
No. No.

692
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,440
You don't need to lie to me.

693
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,001
Lan Xiaoting has consulted

694
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:52,440
all law firms in Pujiang

695
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,761
but none

696
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,641
wants to represent her.

697
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,601
Cheng & Hui insisted

698
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:58,841
that they wouldn't be
the plaintiff's attorney

699
00:26:58,841 --> 00:26:59,721
so it makes sense

700
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:01,601
for her to turn to you.

701
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,601
And now,

702
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,761
everyone is speculating

703
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,001
if this was a mere coincidence

704
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,800
or of this was planned by Mr. Jin.

705
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,320
He hasn't said he would take

706
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,481
Ms. Lan's case.

707
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,440
Also, he's smart

708
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,400
but he can't

709
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,881
possibly think that many steps ahead.

710
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,920
That's impossible.

711
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,200
Baby, have you done the homework?

712
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:25,280
You are naive

713
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,841
but your boss

714
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:27,121
isn't as naive as you.

715
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:29,280
He plans ahead.

716
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,761
He plans ahead?

717
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:41,081
Miss Qin.

718
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:46,601
What a coincidence.

719
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:52,440
You're having hotpot too?

720
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:14,361
Sorry, Miss Qin.

721
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,440
I forgot to tell you

722
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,361
that Junhui is my fiance.

723
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,961
The company didn't say you have

724
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:26,920
to declare all your relationships.

725
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:30,841
Since Mr. Tao

726
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:32,361
is your fiance,

727
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:34,361
then the owner of Xi Mei PR...

728
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:37,040
It's my dad.

729
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:40,641
Miss Wu.

730
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,920
You sure kept a low profile.

731
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:43,920
Miss Qin, don't tell

732
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,560
anyone from the firm about us.

733
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:50,160
You have such an excellent fiance.

734
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,440
Shouldn't you let everyone know?

735
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:53,841
It's not about that.

736
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:55,361
It's about my dad.

737
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:56,800
Please keep it a secret.

738
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,721
Even to Madam Tang too?

739
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:07,400
If I were you,

740
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,200
I would proclaim it.

741
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,001
It'll make you look good

742
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,320
because a lot of people

743
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,121
do mind your family background.

744
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:15,841
Isn't that right, Mr. Tao?

745
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,200
All right. We can eat now.

746
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:22,881
Hold on.

747
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:25,160
I'm concocting for you

748
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,081
an exclusive sauce.

749
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:29,641
I'll wait then.

Thank you.

Can I dig in now?

761
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,601
I'll wait for you.

762
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:08,280
I love to have hotpot in a group.

763
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:10,481
If you like hotpot,

764
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:11,280
I'll eat it with you.

765
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,361
Try it. Do you like it?

766
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:14,641
Come.

767
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,530
♪Hiding the everlasting love

768

769
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,400
Did you hear her?

770
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,641
I want to have hotpot.

771
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,841
He wants to have hotpot.

772
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:42,160
I'm serious.

773
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:48,721
When are you getting married?

774
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,361
The end of this year.

775
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:55,601
Congratulations.

776
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,400
Thanks, Miss Qin.

777
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,280
Since you're Junhui's schoolmate

778
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
and my superior,

779
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,040
I expect you to be there

780
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,961
for our wedding.

781
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,440
Miss Qin is very busy.

782
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
How do you know?

783
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,601
It's true.

784
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,841
Nonsense.

785
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,841
If my senior schoolmate sends me
wedding invitation,

786
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:16,001
I have to attend it.

787
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,641
Don't force yourself.

788
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,761
Not everyone

789
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,081
likes to attend a wedding ceremony.

790
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,361
Considering our relationship,

791
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,160
you don't have to be present.

792
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,400
It's okay.

793
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:35,481
Junhui, what are you on about?

794
00:31:35,481 --> 00:31:36,400
We're close.

795
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,040
Mr. Tao.

796
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,001
I like your candor.

797
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:47,040
If everyone

798
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,761
can be like you,

799
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:49,440
socialization

800
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,560
will become less grueling.

801
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,761
Let's go home.

802
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:03,680
Miss Qin.

803
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:08,241
Now that you know

804
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:10,121
my relationship with Feifei,

805
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,160
please stop asking

806
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,841
her to fish info

807
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:14,320
of Luowei Yulan from me.

808
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,001
No.

809
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:16,920
Miss Qin didn't ask me to do that.

810
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,520
She didn't?

811
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,680
No.

812
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Wu Fei is your fiancee

813
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,081
but she's only my subordinate.

814
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:25,081
I allocate tasks

815
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:26,160
to my subordinates.

816
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,160
However,

817
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,040
I agree with you.

818
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:29,200
Wu Fei

819
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,841
will not follow up on this project

820
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,761
so as to avoid

821
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:34,241
unnecessary conflicts between you two.

822
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:36,001
Miss Qin, you're mistaken.

823
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:37,400
There's no conflict whatsoever.

824
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,241
Thank you.

825
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:40,001
Miss Qin.

826
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,081
I like your arrangement.

827
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,800
You're welcome.

828
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,121
I'm hungry. Let's have hotpot back home.

829
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,800
Miss Qin, we're having hotpot too.

830
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,920
Why don't you join us?

831
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,841
No need.

832
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:56,001
Enjoy, you two.

833
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,881
Come.

834
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,800
What's wrong with you?

835
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,440
Because of you, my job is gone.

836
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:09,680
So be it.

837
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:11,160
I'll take care of you.

838
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,040
Didn't you say

839
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,241
the firm gave you too much work

840
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:16,121
and you have a cold boss?

841
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:17,920
When did I say that?

842
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,241
Don't make things up.

843
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,440
Wonderful.

844
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,520
To think that I

845
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,001
have to go to the office
with a smile tomorrow...

846
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:26,160
I finally achieved

847
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,361
something in my work

848
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,920
but you ruined it in one sentence.

849
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:31,320
But isn't this great?

850
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,280
You no longer need to coddle her.

851
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,881
You have many

852
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:33,961
senior lawyers in the firm.

853
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:35,601
Why can't you work for another one?

854
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:36,961
It's easy for you to think that.

855
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:38,200
But I believe Miss Qin

856
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,241
is the best attorney.

857
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:39,961
If I want to learn something,

858
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:41,440
I learn from the best.

859
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:44,721
She isn't worth your time at all.

860
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:47,761
If you want to practice laws,

861
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:48,800
I can teach you.

862
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,320
Something's wrong with you today.

863
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:59,040
Are you hiding something from me?

864
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,280
No. No.

865
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,881
You're imitating me.

866
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:01,961
You're hiding something from me.

867
00:34:01,961 --> 00:34:02,560
No. No.

868
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,800
Did you two cross each other?

869
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:05,081
Aren't you hungry?

870
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,081
I want to have hotpot.

871
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:06,961
Answer me now.

872
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:07,560
Let's have hotpot back home.

873
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,520
Hurry up. It's hotpot time.

874
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,921
Something's wrong with you.

875
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:22,681
You drive very fast.

876
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:24,240
Let me drive.

877
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,081
I think

878
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,681
we should all learn to move on.

879
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,800
Your ex is about to get married

880
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:33,720
and his fiance

881
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,201
is young and accomplished.

882
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:36,240
That will

883
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:37,320
certainly affect you
in one way or another

884
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:37,960
but

885
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,480
don't get all defeated.

886
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,161
You're accomplished too.

887
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,520
Aren't you pursuing

888
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,081
the life you want?

889
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:45,681
Am I right?

890
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:47,841
Car! There is a car.

891
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,040
No.

892
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,601
What no?

893
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,881
Luowei Yulan's case

894
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:56,040
will not go swimmingly.

895
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,401
Tao Junhui has a bad stomach.

896
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,161
Whenever

897
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,401
he is under pressure,

898
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,081
he'll drink a lot of sodas.

899
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,681
And I noticed

900
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:08,240
he bought a lot of them.

901
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:10,201
Besides, he must have known very early

902
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,881
that Wu Fei worked for me.

903
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:15,040
So what Wu Fei told me

904
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:16,040
might not be accurate.

905
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:25,520
You...

906
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,921
So you were

907
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:28,921
thinking about this?

908
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,681
Yes.

909
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,681
You're hopeless.

910
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,121
Your ambitiousness

911
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:35,280
has deprived you of the need

912
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:36,081
for emotional connection.

913
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:39,081
That doesn't sound too bad.

914
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:53,000
Aunt.

915
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:55,320
I bought your favorite

916
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,401
seafood congee.

917
00:35:58,881 --> 00:35:59,441
Aunt.

918
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:01,601
I'm coming in.

919
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,520
You're still sleeping?

920
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,881
Aunt.

921
00:36:13,361 --> 00:36:13,921
Aunt?

922
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:40,480
Danping.

923
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,081
Calm down now. Speak slowly.

924
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,720
When did Ms. Lan leave?

925
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,921
(I left to buy something)

926
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:46,921
(around 7 a.m.)

927
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:48,601
(My aunt was still there.)

928
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:50,520
(I was out)

929
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:52,040
(for 40 minutes.)

930
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:53,841
I'm so worried now.

931
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,520
Will she do something reckless?

932
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,081
Danping, we need

933
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,240
to remain calm now.

934
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,280
Check if she took her passport with her.

935
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,841
Passport. Passport.

936
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:20,960
It's still here.

937
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:24,921
(My aunt won't run away.)

938
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:26,881
Never.

939
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,800
In this situation,

940
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,441
we need to eliminate all possibilities

941
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:32,320
one by one

942
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,161
to narrow down the scope.

943
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:33,960
Danping.

944
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:35,520
(Give me Ms. Lan's photo)

945
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,240
(and tell me what she wore)

946
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:37,681
(before she left.)

947
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:38,361
(Then, list down)

948
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,361
(where she could possibly go.)

949
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:40,800
Wait at the hotel.

950
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,760
We'll be there now.

951
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,841
I'll drive.

952
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,480
Danping.

953
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,520
The Ms. Lan I know

954
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,881
is not weak-willed.

955
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,720
Trust me.

956
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:49,800
She did not rely

957
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,681
on sheer luck to get

958
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:52,040
what she has today.

959
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,841
(Therefore, she won't give up
that easily.)

960
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,401
(Wait for us.)

961
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,201
Okay. I'll wait for you in the hotel.

962
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:18,361
Inform Shen
from the criminal case department,

963
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:19,921
Pan, and Fang.

964
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,480
The more the merrier

965
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:22,361
for a search party.

966
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,520
Shen.

967
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,720
It's Tang Yihui.

968
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:30,921
Miss Sun.

969
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:32,480
You can't tell me that.

970
00:38:32,921 --> 00:38:33,960
You can't do this

971
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:35,000
or that.

972
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,681
So this qualification letter

973
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:39,161
is just a sheet of paper?

974
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,361
My demand is very simple.

975
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:43,361
I paid 50,000 yuan for my membership

976
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:44,841
and I am not satisfied

977
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:45,480
with your service.

978
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:46,441
Therefore, I demand a refund.

979
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:47,401
It makes sense, doesn't it?

980
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,361
You violated the contract first.

981
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:51,960
If you won't perform the refund,

982
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,161
I will take legal action.

983
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:56,361
(Don't. You have a high income.)

984
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,161
How much I earn

985
00:38:57,361 --> 00:38:59,161
has nothing to do with you.

986
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,040
My money

987
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,960
did not grow on trees.

988
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:01,881
Don't you agree?

989
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,320
(Miss Li.)

990
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:05,841
(This is not our fault.)

991
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,320
Sorry, Miss Sun.

992
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,161
I have to answer

993
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:10,841
an important call.

994
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,601
Think about what I told you.

995
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:13,720
We'll touch base in a few days.

996
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:17,240
Hello, Madam Tang.

997
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,641
(Please come now.)

998
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,280
All right.

999
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,641
(If you have any helpers around,)

1000
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:22,681
(bring them too.)

1001
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:23,720
(Just the trustworthy ones.)

1002
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:24,881
(Those who won't tell anyone.)

1003
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:26,720
I got it.

1004
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:27,960
See you.

1005
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,900
(Recent Calls)

1006
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,300
(Recent Calls)
(Qin Shi 2)

1007
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:40,520
If you're about

1008
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,000
to be promoted
to the corporation department...

1009
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:42,841
Right?

1010
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,000
And now, you have to turn back

1011
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:46,841
to handle this complicated case

1012
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,161
from the family department,

1013
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:49,921
will you do it?

1014
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,800
I don't think

1015
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:53,161
you can stay out of it.

1016
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,560
Pick up the call for me.

1017
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:09,921
I'm driving.

1018
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:10,480
What's up?

1019
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,720
Ms. Lan went missing.

1020
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,240
Coming.

1021
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:20,040
You must be getting impatient.

1022
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,441
Careful. Don't burn your hands.

1023
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,081
Let me serve you.

1024
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,240
Junhui.

1025
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,520
Are you stressed lately?

1026
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,681
What stress?

1027
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:34,320
Let me help you.

1028
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:35,000
I can do it.

1029
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:42,361
You're beside yourself

1030
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:43,601
since just now.

1031
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,441
We agreed to have hotpot

1032
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:46,601
but now, we switched to fried rice.

1033
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,401
Miss Qin upsets you?

1034
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,881
Impossible.

1035
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,361
Actually,

1036
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:59,720
I get it.

1037
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,681
You do?

1038
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,841
You're afraid.

1039
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:04,280
Being with her

1040
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,641
is stressful, isn't it?

1041
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,841
Don't use your smile to shield

1042
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,921
your unease.

1043
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:13,320
I saw it through.

1044
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,681
I wasn't

1045
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:16,201
very fond of Miss Qin either.

1046
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,480
I thought

1047
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,081
she would achieve her goal
by all means possible.

1048
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:20,240
She was tyrannical

1049
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,760
and domineering.

1050
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,881
She is like the monarch

1051
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,441
in the family department.

1052
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,681
A woman like that stresses

1053
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:29,641
men out.

1054
00:41:30,441 --> 00:41:31,320
You think

1055
00:41:31,441 --> 00:41:32,881
she is too aggressive, don't you?

1056
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:34,841
Upon hearing your analysis,

1057
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,560
it seems like you have changed
your view of her.

1058
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,441
I don't judge a book

1059
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:40,720
by its cover.

1060
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:42,841
Do you remember

1061
00:41:42,841 --> 00:41:43,681
the case involving

1062
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:44,520
25 million yuan?

1063
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,320
We've been trying to identify

1064
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,641
the leaker.

1065
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,800
I helped Miss Qin investigate

1066
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,881
and we found out that the leaker

1067
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,960
was Miss Qin's rival.

1068
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,121
Miss Qin didn't report her

1069
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,361
nor ask her for a favor.

1070
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,361
Why?

1071
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,240
I asked her that too.

1072
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:04,000
A gentleman

1073
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:05,161
knows what to do and what not to do.

1074
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:06,720
It's the same for a lawyer.

1075
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,841
We have seen the worst of humanity

1076
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,641
but that doesn't mean we should
surrender to it.

1077
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:12,201
Pulling tricks.

1078
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:14,960
Cheating.

1079
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:17,361
What sweet victory can you get
from them?

1080
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:19,921
She may have a lot of shortcomings

1081
00:42:20,201 --> 00:42:21,280
but that alone

1082
00:42:21,641 --> 00:42:23,081
shows true character.

1083
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,161
Who's the better person? Me or she?

1084
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:28,441
Why are you competing with her?

1085
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,201
Are you that competitive?

1086
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:32,720
By the way,

1087
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:35,841
if Cheng & Hui

1088
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,800
decides to handle Lan Xiaoting's case,

1089
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,000
will Qin Shi be the

1090
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:41,560
main representing attorney?

1091
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:45,081
No.

1092
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,760
Even if they decide to handle it,

1093
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:48,361
she won't be

1094
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:49,280
the main representing attorney.

1095
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,480
She's from the family department.

1096
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,560
This is a criminal case.

1097
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,480
Right.

1098
00:42:57,401 --> 00:42:57,800
Wait, no.

1099
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,641
There's no way Miss Qin
shows this much interest

1100
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:05,040
over a case she can't handle.

1101
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,480
Unless...

1102
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,320
What are you talking about?

1103
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,000
Nothing.

1104
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,720
Nothing.

1105
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:16,841
Nothing.
