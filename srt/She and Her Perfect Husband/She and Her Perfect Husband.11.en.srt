=Episode 11=

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
So this is the situation.

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,920
Everything is

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,880
going as planned.

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,719
When are you going back

23
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,359
to harvest the fruit of your labor?

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,359
About that...

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,519
I might still need

26
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,399
your help.

27
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,000
My mom wants to visit us.

28
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,280
But why?

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,239
Didn't she

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,120
oppose our relationship?

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
And

32
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,319
she already quit
forcing you to get married.

33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:41,959
Yes.

34
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,840
I told her I wouldn't go back.

35
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,720
That I wanted to live independently.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,720
That's good.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,039
There is beauty in distance.

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,879
Why is she visiting then?

39
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,200
Because

40
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,080
I didn't tell her we're faking
this relationship.

41
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,120
So she thinks

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,239
we're truly in love.

43
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,200
I've made up my mind.

44
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,039
I will not meddle in your affairs.

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,319
You have your way of thinking

46
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,519
and your life.

47
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:13,360
I will not

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,599
meddle in your marriage

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,519
in case you resent me.

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,519
Regardless of whether Qin Shi

51
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,200
and you remain together or not,

52
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,440
I want to remind you

53
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,759
that kids

54
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,920
from a broken family will...

55
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,480
Mom.

56
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,039
Let me put it this way.

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,759
You'll need to be a giver

58
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
when you're with kids
from that kind of family.

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,239
Of course.

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
You still have to live with each other.

61
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,319
If you two are happy,

62
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,200
then so be it.

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,080
So there's no need
to visit us, is there?

64
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,679
Of course, there is.

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,840
One look is all it takes

66
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,480
to know she doesn't have a happy life.

67
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,399
And you

68
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,959
stay home and do nothing.

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,480
I have to visit you

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,280
to see how well you two are living.

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,879
That will put my mind to rest.

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,840
Why?

73
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,679
Is that not allowed too?

74
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,040
You said yes?

75
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,280
No.

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,919
I told her I would have to talk to you.

77
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,880
This isn't right.

78
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,359
This demand from your mom

79
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,440
shows that she hasn't given up

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,959
even though you're in a relationship.

81
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,040
What do you mean?

82
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,399
Look.

83
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
In this regard,

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,440
if I turn her down,

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,720
I'll be seen as impolite

86
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,880
temperamental,

87
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,120
or even guilty.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,679
She will be seen as a victim.

89
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,440
As her son,

90
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,320
you will be guilt-tripped.

91
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,239
And when this drags on,

92
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,600
you and your girlfriend,

93
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,359
in this case, me,

94
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,519
will have conflicts.

95
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,160
That's how problems within in-laws arise.

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,359
Even though
we're not a real couple per se,

97
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,079
from what I know about your mom,

98
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,239
she isn't one to quit

99
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,959
after I refuse her once.

100
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,919
So I should say yes?

101
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,280
Then you're bringing a threat
into my safe place.

102
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:25,720
Sorry.

103
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,320
I didn't mean

104
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,840
to offend her.

105
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,120
I just think

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,560
that if we let her visit this time,

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,840
it doesn't matter if she

108
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,880
sees through our cover or not.

109
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,479
What happens is that she will know
where I live.

110
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,679
She can come unannounced

111
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,239
for a spot-check.

112
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,079
What should we do then?

113
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:42,560
Right.

114
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,359
You thought of everything.

115
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,239
So what do we do now?

116
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,799
Is your mom proud?

117
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,320
Prideful?

118
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,399
Like you.

119
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,199
Great.

120
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,280
I have a solution

121
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,600
but

122
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,639
I cannot tell you now

123
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,280
because I want to keep you intrigued.

124
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,639
What do you want me to do?

125
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,840
Wash the dishes.

126
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:11,799
Okay.

127
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,199
Go now.

128
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,840
Tell me after I'm done.

129
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,079
Mom.

130
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,000
Hua.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,440
You brought so many things.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,760
They are all your favorites.

133
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:02,840
I even made wontons for you.

134
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,799
Meat wontons, veggies wontons,

135
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,959
and prawn wontons.

136
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,199
Put them on the table.

137
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,919
Hurry.

138
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,959
Freeze them in the fridge.

139
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,000
Stop ordering takeouts all the time.

140
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,519
Where's Qin Shi?

141
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,959
She has overtime today.

142
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,959
Work overtime on Sunday?

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,519
She sure is busy.

144
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Don't lie to me, Hua.

145
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:33,600
Is she avoiding me?

146
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,720
No way.

147
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,679
Mom.

148
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,359
Change your shoes.

149
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,199
Sorry.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,479
This is for you.

151
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,320
Not for Dudu.

152
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,120
Dudu.

153
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm here for peace.

154
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,399
The way I see it,

155
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,519
she forced you to leave your home.

156
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,519
Your future mother-in-law

157
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,519
will be a pain in the neck.

158
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,720
Future mother-in-law? We'll see.

159
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,919
I saw your mom a few days ago.

160
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,560
She wasn't looking too well.

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,359
Your father

162
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,479
will have his seventieth birthday soon.

163
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,199
You don't want

164
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,320
to show them the secret boyfriend
you hid for two years

165
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,040
to make their day?

166
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,519
I came to this peaceful place

167
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,040
to hang out with Dudu.

168
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,959
Behave now.

169
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,199
Don't bring this subject up.

170
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,120
Otherwise, I'll jump.

171
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,919
Let's jump together.

172
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,960
Quit it.

173
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,320
I'll behave, okay?

174
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,239
Don't tell this to anyone.

175
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,279
Especially my mom.

176
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,320
Why?

177
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,679
I admit

178
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,239
your boyfriend is weird

179
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:47,760
but he is still presentable, isn't he?

180
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,039
You know

181
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,239
my mom very well, don't you?

182
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,200
If I have a boyfriend...

183
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,479
Forget about a boyfriend.

184
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,799
If I talk to a member

185
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,799
of the opposite sex,

186
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,440
her imagination runs wild.

187
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,400
Like what our future kids will be called.

188
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,359
Whether they have mono eyelids

189
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,359
or double eyelids.

190
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,279
You remember

191
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,760
when I broke up with Tao Junhui?

192
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,520
Guess who cried on her bed

193
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,200
for three days straight
and couldn't function?

194
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,520
My mom.

195
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,080
My dear mom.

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,960
Please don't give her any false hope.

197
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,679
Right.

198
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,839
I pity you.

199
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,960
Tell me now.

200
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
What do you want to do today?

201
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,520
I'll entertain you.

202
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm here to kill.

203
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,159
Mom.

204
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,239
This is the study.

205
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,000
Study?

206
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,080
Mom, this is the bathroom.

207
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:02,679
Bathroom.

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,880
You live in a nice place.

209
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,239
The apartment type is not bad too.

210
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,200
This renovation...

211
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,719
Qin Shi bought this apartment?

212
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,799
Yes.

213
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,039
Mom.

214
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,200
This is the bedroom.

215
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,599
Can I go inside?

216
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,239
Sure.

217
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,560
So,

218
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,719
are you two together
all the time?

219
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,960
No.

220
00:10:58,599 --> 00:10:59,400
Oh, really?

221
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,760
No.

222
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,120
Miss Qin and I...

223
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,839
Qin Shi and I

224
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,200
have different living tempos.

225
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,320
She works till late at times

226
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,239
and she doesn't want to wake me up

227
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,120
so we sleep in separate rooms.

228
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Also, we're not married.

229
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,359
We don't want to do it first.

230
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,400
It's tidy in here.

231
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,440
Do you do the cleaning or does she?

232
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,120
She's very busy

233
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,839
so I handle the cleaning.

234
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,320
Mom, let me pour you a glass of tea.

235
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,640
But you can't always be the one
who does the cleaning, can you?

236
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,359
It should be shared

237
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,599
among you two.

238
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,239
That way, you avoid conflicts.

239
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,359
You...

240
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,560
(Contraceptive)

241
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,239
You brat.

242
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,479
Brat!

243
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,400
You're lying.

244
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,880
What lie, mom?

245
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,080
Mom?

246
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm not old-fashioned

247
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,839
but I do have a limit.

248
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,560
You should be responsible for your life.

249
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,719
I'm warning you.

250
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,239
Before the marriage,

251
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
if you...

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,239
If you knock someone up

253
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,960
and people start talking,

254
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,560
I won't forgive you.

255
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,479
What are you on about, mom?

256
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,799
What knocking someone up?

257
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,440
Mom.

258
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,640
What does it mean?

259
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,120
The sweet taste

260
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:01,799
of victory.

261
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,039
Oh, no.

262
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,679
I'm getting weak.

263
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,919
I need to eat something.

264
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,320
My stupid brother, Qin Wenyu,

265
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,799
hasn't admitted defeat yet?

266
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,599
I won't wait.

267
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,359
I don't have the time.

268
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,839
Have some nuts to replenish your energy.

269
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,960
Shouldn't you be worried?

270
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,239
Worried?

271
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,120
How do you spell that?

272
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,000
It's not in my vocabulary.

273
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,120
Teach me.

274
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,159
Speak of the devil.

275
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,039
Look.

276
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,000
If you're not worried,

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,799
don't pick it up.

278
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,640
No need to do that.

279
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,159
I'll hang up.

280
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,520
Give it to me.

281
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,440
Give me.

282
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,679
A woman is crushing another woman.

283
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,000
Oops. I already hung up.

284
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,640
Qin Shi, I'm telling you.

285
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,120
As a Scorpio,

286
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,239
I hold grudges.

287
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll hold it for a century.

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,640
I'm so glad

289
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,799
you're doing that.

290
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:52,880
Hello?

291
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:57,880
Okay.

292
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,039
Okay.

293
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,279
Sure.

294
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,960
You even brandished your hair.

295
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,279
Hi there, pretty girl.

296
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Do I look good in this?

297
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,960
Can I wear this out?

298
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,200
Who called you just now?

299
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,239
Vivian.

300
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,640
The lying woman wants to see me.

301
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,080
She is bold.

302
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,320
Why does she want to see you?

303
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:48,479
God knows.

304
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:49,120
We'll see

305
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,599
what trick she's pulling this time.

306
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,799
She is getting too bold.

307
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,839
What about this?

308
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,599
You look good.

309
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,080
Can you be more serious?

310
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,560
I am serious.

311
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
Your face is enough

312
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,640
to dispel all evil.

313
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,279
Morale is very important

314
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,400
in a war.

315
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,120
Do you know?

316
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,839
Having a higher morale

317
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,919
is like winning half the battle.

318
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,359
Look.

319
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,200
This and this.

320
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,520
Do you know what they are called?

321
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,640
Battlesuits.

322
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,799
For many years,

323
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,440
I wear them

324
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,679
to see countless opportunist women.

325
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,200
They are adorned with achievements.

326
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,039
This is no good.

327
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,479
I have never

328
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,560
seen you this nervous before.

329
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,279
What is bothering you?

330
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,279
Bothering me?

331
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,560
I don't like what I'm hearing.

332
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,359
I, Ren Meimei, am afraid of nothing.

333
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,440
If I'm divorced,

334
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,919
I have a car, a house, and my savings.

335
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,679
I have a job to feed myself.

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,279
My life will be a burdenless one.

337
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,039
I can eat whatever I want

338
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,880
or travel anywhere I want.

339
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,400
I will date someone from each kind

340
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,039
and what a wonderful life it is.

341
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,560
You truly want the divorce?

342
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,479
You truly have no feelings
for my brother anymore?

343
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Feelings for Wenyu?

344
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,479
I would rather have feelings

345
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,839
for a TV remote control.

346
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,000
At least I get to hold it

347
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,279
and watch whatever I want with it.

348
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,839
Feelings for him?

349
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,679
I know you.

350
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,520
You act tough

351
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,120
but you're a big softie.

352
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,839
Qin Shi, listen.

353
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,120
Catching feelings is dangerous.

354
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,320
If you ever develop feelings

355
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,640
for someone,

356
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,120
you basically

357
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,560
give the other person a dagger

358
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,919
to stab you.

359
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,479
I have been stabbed

360
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,000
countless times.

361
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,200
My soul is weary.

362
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,159
I have made up my mind.

363
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,520
If I can get a divorce this time,

364
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:06,319
I'll do it.

365
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,520
Maybe...

366
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,920
Maybe this is the end of our journey.

367
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,319
I don't think
you two will get a divorce.

368
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,479
You two

369
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,040
can't leave each other at all.

370
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Oh, come on.

371
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,559
I can't leave him?

372
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,599
Why should I forfeit a life of pleasure

373
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,559
to bust all his mistresses out?

374
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,199
I can't accept this.

375
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,160
Do you get it?

376
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,359
It's even in the song lyrics.

377
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,800
Give me a better love rival.

378
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,359
A better one.

379
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,599
So why can't he find someone better?

380
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,160
Who the hell is Vivian anyway?

381
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,599
Can't he pick someone decent?

382
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,800
This is pissing me off.

383
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:41,959
No.

384
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,520
I need another look.

385
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,880
What about this?

386
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,640
Does yellow speak to you?

387
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,000
Wear the green one then.

388
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,040
You're green with jealousy anyway.

389
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,719
What?

390
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,439
What are you saying?

391
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,640
I hate you.

392
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,400
How dare you mock me.

393
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,439
Be serious now.

394
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,280
This one or that one?

395
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,439
The green one.

396
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,680
Tell me.

397
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:18,800
Why do you want to see me?

398
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,000
Don't you

399
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,400
already have what you want?

400
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,040
Ms. Ren.

401
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,199
I know

402
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,640
you hate me.

403
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,280
But there is nothing

404
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,599
between Wenyu and me.

405
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,920
We talked in private

406
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,000
because of that misunderstanding.

407
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,479
I've been meaning

408
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,359
to explain everything to you.

409
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I don't want to be a homewrecker.

410
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:42,920
You regret it now?

411
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,400
No.

412
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,559
I just feel bad

413
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,000
for Wenyu.

414
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,199
He owns a huge business

415
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,439
but he doesn't have the authority
that comes with it.

416
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,719
Everyone in the company

417
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,680
knows that if he wants something,

418
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,079
even as trivial as getting a new pen,

419
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,439
he needs to ask you.

420
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,239
He doesn't have any say at all.

421
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,160
Ms. Ren.

422
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,120
When you push a man
into a corner like this,

423
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,040
he will run away.

424
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,760
Sorry?

425
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,400
Are you complaining on behalf
of Qin Wenyu now?

426
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,559
You think you have the right

427
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,920
to tell me those things?

428
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,800
Calm down, Ms. Ren.

429
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm here to save your marriage.

430
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,439
You've been married for a decade.

431
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,040
It's a very long time.

432
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,920
Wenyu is a kind man.

433
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,640
My clothes,

434
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,520
my accessories,

435
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,319
he bought them for me even though
I never told him to.

436
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,640
He even said he would buy me
a car and a house.

437
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,680
I would be lying

438
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,599
if I said I wasn't touched.

439
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,359
I'm a woman

440
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,880
who's trying to survive in this city.

441
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,719
A comfortable life like this

442
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,680
is a hell of a temptation to anyone.

443
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:16,760
Are you trying to raise
your conditions now?

444
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,959
I still have my principles.

445
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:22,920
I don't want

446
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,199
to ruin someone else's family.

447
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,680
Besides, I also heard

448
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,839
that you are the reason

449
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,239
why the company is this huge.

450
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,280
I admire you.

451
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,439
You are my role model.

452
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
A call from Mr. Qin.

453
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,439
Should I answer it?

454
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,000
Up to you.

455
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,160
Wenyu.

456
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,239
Hey.

457
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,520
When you come back,

458
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,079
buy a box of fried chicken from below
the apartment.

459
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,439
You miss me already?

460
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,520
Yes, I do.

461
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,280
I'm meeting a friend out here.

462
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,559
I'll be back soon.

463
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,559
Don't forget the fried chicken.

464
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,520
The fried chicken.

465
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:27,800
Okay.

466
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:40,959
Ms. Ren.

467
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:42,719
There's no need

468
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,280
for us to fight here.

469
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,959
We can help each other.

470
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,800
I can persuade Wenyu
to come back to you.

471
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,400
Just help me

472
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,959
settle in another city.

473
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,599
You bare your fangs.

474
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,359
Tell me.

475
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,719
How much?

476
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:00,880
One million yuan.

477
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,239
One million yuan?

478
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,040
You underestimate me.

479
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,640
If I want to,

480
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,400
I can pay more,

481
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,839
let alone one million yuan.

482
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,120
But the thing is,

483
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,680
do you deserve the sum?

484
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,040
As you said,

485
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,920
I run the whole company.

486
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,079
If Qin Wenyu leaves me,

487
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,719
he'll be penniless.

488
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,400
The assets we own are under my name.

489
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,479
I can finally get rid

490
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:26,239
of this parasite

491
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,760
and you want me to buy it back?

492
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,000
Little missy.

493
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,680
Just because you picked up a call

494
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,680
in front of me and got all chummy,

495
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,239
you think you can assert dominance?

496
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,160
I have seen this trick so much

497
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,199
that I'm bored of it now.

498
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,640
Are you desperate now?

499
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:43,719
Ms. Ren.

500
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,719
Can we discuss this
in a civilized manner?

501
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,280
I have seen girls like you before.

502
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,280
You think you're young.

503
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,559
You're willing

504
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,079
to leverage your youth
for a bright future.

505
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,239
But one day,

506
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,520
it will come back and bite you.

507
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,199
And so,

508
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,319
if that happens,

509
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,079
make sure you can take it.

510
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,120
Because we all

511
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,880
are liable for our actions.

512
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:05,959
Don't you agree,

513
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:06,920
Miss Lv Fenghe?

514
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,680
I beg your pardon, Ms. Ren?

515
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,559
I am not Lv Fenghe.

516
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,719
Hi, Miss Lv.

517
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,800
I believe this contains your info.

518
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,880
I'm Qin Shi,

519
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,680
an attorney representing

520
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Ms. Ren Meimei.

521
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,920
I'm also Qin Wenyu's sister.

522
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:38,839
Aren't you...

523
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,359
Oh, you remember.

524
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,040
I took many photos of you.

525
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,160
Miss Lv,

526
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,520
in fact,

527
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,559
your identity,

528
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,559
your past,

529
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
your current project,

530
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,040
your origin,

531
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,520
we know them all.

532
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,520
If you missed your lectures

533
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,079
on common laws in jail,

534
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:56,800
I can give you

535
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,359
a free reminder here.

536
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,599
What you're doing here

537
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,800
are forgery and deception.

538
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,040
If we do not see

539
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,599
Mr. Qin Wenyu

540
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,640
within the next 24 hours,

541
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,760
you will be charged

542
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,599
with abduction too.

543
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,920
Remember, 24 hours.

544
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,599
Let's go.

545
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,559
Ms. Ren.

546
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,160
Don't you want Wenyu

547
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,719
to come home?

548
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,439
Ms. Ren.

549
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm not his mom.

550
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,800
I do not need to educate him.

551
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,559
Whether he comes home or not,

552
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,640
it's none of my business.

553
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,520
Oh,

554
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,719
you want money, don't you?

555
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,239
You...

556
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,000
Ms. Ren!

557
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,160
You're worth this much.

558
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,239
How much did you put in my hands?

559
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,479
Around 200 yuan.

560
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,359
Too much.

561
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,719
Should I bring the money back?

562
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,880
I didn't mean it seriously.

563
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,000
You're back.

564
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,640
Did you get the fried chicken?

565
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:18,800
I forgot to tell you

566
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
that I want the spicy ones.

567
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,719
What flavor did you get?

568
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,800
Bastard!

569
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,559
You screwed me up, do you know?

570
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,959
What?

571
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,160
You're asking me now?

572
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,120
I...

573
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,400
I fed you.

574
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:34,760
I let you live here.

575
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,839
Now you and your family

576
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,199
work together to bully me.

577
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:40,239
Who bullied you?

578
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,640
Ren Meimei came to you?

579
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,359
Why should you entertain her?

580
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,719
Let me see.

581
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:48,880
What did she do to you?

582
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,800
Show me.

583
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,719
Don't touch me.

584
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,559
Qin Wenyu.

585
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,959
I finally see the truth.

586
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,319
Without your wife,

587
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,719
you're nothing.

588
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:58,920
What do you mean?

589
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,079
I love you.

590
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,640
I don't love you.

591
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,719
Give me money.

592
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:06,079
Give me a house. Give me a car.

593
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,520
If you don't have money,

594
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,160
don't be a leech here.

595
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,439
Bugger off.

596
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,160
I should have seen this coming.

597
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,040
If there's profit to be had,
you're docile like a lamb.

598
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,520
But when there's none,

599
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,000
you show your true self.

600
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:23,800
I was so dumb for liking you.

601
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,559
Likewise.

602
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,239
What do I even like about you?

603
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,479
Your uselessness?

604
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:32,120
Your spinelessness?

605
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,079
I'll leave.

606
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,599
But pay up.

607
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,520
Pay what?

608
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,520
What what?

609
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,439
I have no money

610
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,680
and I have to stay in a hotel.

611
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,880
Also, you hurt my feelings.

612
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,800
You owe me.

613
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,479
Pay me now.

614
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:09,239
Leave.

615
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,680
Wait.

616
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,280
Give me back my shirt.

617
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,120
Ouch.

618
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,719
Yu, what happened to you?

619
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:49,239
Ouch.

620
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:49,839
I know.

621
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,800
Mom knows.

622
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,640
Be gentle.

623
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,359
Gentle.

624
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,000
Roll an egg on it
and it won't be painful anymore.

625
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,680
It will reduce the swelling.

626
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,640
Where else?

627
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,839
Here too.

628
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,599
Oh, gosh.

629
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,559
Mom.

630
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,760
I feel like I'm about to die.

631
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,839
What will you do if I'm dead?

632
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,239
Mind you.

633
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,640
You're about to die?

634
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,479
No tear and bleeding.

635
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,359
How are you supposed to die?

636
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,280
But mom,

637
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:15,760
it's this spot.

638
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,559
It hurts here. It's heart disease.

639
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,520
Look at my hands.

640
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,120
They are shaking.

641
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,520
That's a stroke.

642
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,319
You don't have a stroke.

643
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,359
But mom,

644
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,280
why is living so difficult?

645
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,040
I treat everyone with sincerity

646
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,160
but no one returns it.

647
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,319
No one wants me.

648
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,239
Why should I live?

649
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,920
I might as well die.

650
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,760
You're not burning up.

651
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,479
If you're not feeling well,

652
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,520
I'll bring you to a hospital.

653
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,559
I don't want to go to a hospital.

654
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,280
I want to die at home.

655
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,160
Look at you.

656
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,359
Again.

657
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,239
You keep

658
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,400
saying that you want to die.

659
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,640
It brings ill fortune.

660
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:53,479
Touch wood.

661
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,120
Come now.

662
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:59,280
Get up. Someone's here.

663
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,160
Who's there?

664
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,599
Meimei?

665
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:11,520
I'm suffering.

666
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
What's the matter?

667
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,120
He was kicked out.

668
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,839
No, I wasn't.

669
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,880
I escaped myself.

670
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm suffering.

671
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,160
I suffer!

672
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,199
You're not burning up.

673
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:25,520
Darling!

674
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,359
Who's your darling?

675
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,920
We have already divorced.

676
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Darling.

677
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,040
The fact that you came today

678
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,359
means you still care about me.

679
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Don't worry.

680
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,280
I know

681
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,319
I'm about to die.

682
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,359
Just wait a little longer.

683
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,239
Maybe then, we won't

684
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:48,120
have to get a divorce.

685
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
Once I pass away,

686
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,559
you will inherit

687
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,160
all my properties.

688
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,239
I only have one demand.

689
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,400
Treat my mom well.

690
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,680
That's all.

691
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,719
Cut this crap.

692
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,439
Aren't you living happily

693
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,719
ever after with Vivian?

694
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,359
Meimei.

695
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,920
Darling. She is a liar.

696
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,880
I am a victim, darling.

697
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,479
I have never done anything

698
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:18,800
to Vivian.

699
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,559
I hung out with her

700
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,239
to make you jealous.

701
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,199
I can swear with all the skins

702
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,120
I purchased in the game

703
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,680
that in the two days I spent with her
at her apartment,

704
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,319
we did nothing.

705
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,439
We truly did nothing.

706
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:31,880
Darling.

707
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,680
You're the best wife in the world.

708
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,559
Why do I need someone else?

709
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,120
Darling!

710
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,359
I'm a victim, darling.

711
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,479
Look.

712
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,479
It's snowing outside.

713
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,559
Meimei.

714
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,719
Mother-in-law.

715
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,599
Stay here for dinner.

716
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,439
I'll do the grocery now.

717
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:50,000
No need.

718
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,800
I'm busy today.

719
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,880
I have to go back to the office later.

720
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,120
Fine. Leave.

721
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,239
Leave me alone.

722
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,160
I'll be fine.

723
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,559
Once you leave,

724
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,839
- I'll leave this world too.
- All right. Go deal with him.

725
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,719
No one cares about me

726
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:10,400
and I don't need you
to care about me.

727
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,040
Get up.

728
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,559
Are you not helping me to get up?

729
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,520
Darling.

730
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:24,640
I'm suffering.

731
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,319
Darling.

732
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,599
All right. Get in the car now.

733
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,239
Behave.

734
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,199
Sleep when you're back home.

735
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,400
Don't look at your phone.

736
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,400
All right, Mother.
We'll leave now.

737
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,199
Wait.

738
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:38,880
Take this anti-inflammatory med.

739
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,319
He pretends to be sick.

740
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,520
He doesn't need any medicine.

741
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,599
I can't believe he came up

742
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,760
with this stupid idea.

743
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,439
Just let him be.

744
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,760
Talk to him later.

745
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,599
Don't argue.

746
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,920
I don't care what happens

747
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,719
to you two anymore.

748
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,040
All right, Mother.

749
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,599
See you.

750
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:55,479
Take this.

751
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:56,920
Also,

752
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,760
our promise.

753
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,160
Don't forget it.

754
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,760
Yes, I won't.

755
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,479
See you.

756
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,680
Sleep early too.

757
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,479
Drive safe.

758
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:07,959
Bye.

759
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,199
Drive safe!

760
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:11,160

00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,239
I'm running late.

774
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:02,959
I'll skip it.

775
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:08,839
I'm going to the supermarket today.

776
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,079
Do you want something?

777
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,200
Yes, the tam...

778
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,359
Just do the shopping later.

779
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:15,039
Wait for me to come home.

780
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:15,880
We'll go together.

781
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,079
Okay.

782
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:19,519
What is this?

783
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,880
Breakfast.

784
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,799
You're so nice.

785
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:24,279
Thank you.

786
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,240
Best roommate there is.

787
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,440
A thumbs-up for you.

788
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,279
You have your phone?

789
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:28,960
Yes.

790
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,640
Your lanyard?

791
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,200
Yes.

792
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:32,480
Your car key?

793
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,120
Thank you.

794
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,920
Are you looking for an apartment?

795
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,359
I am.

796
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,799
I'll move out as soon as possible.

797
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,519
All right.

798
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,039
Oh.

799
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,279
Come back early today.

800
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:00,680
Let's have dinner together.

801
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,440
It's my duty as the househusband.

802
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:09,200
Okay.

803
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:15,559
So reliable.

804
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,960
Bye.

805
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,839
See you tonight.

806
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,559
Why did I say that?

807
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,880
That was uncalled for.

808
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:34,559
Morning.

809
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:35,160
Me too.

810
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,799
My boyfriend drove me here.

811
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:37,920
I envy you.

812
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,720
Needless to say.

813
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,240
Morning, Miss Li.

814
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,279
Miss Li.

815
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,160
Lili.

816
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:44,920
The elevator is here.

817
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,480
Morning.

818
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:50,759
Wait.

819
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,519
Wait.

820
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,240
Morning, Miss Qin.

821
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,640
Morning, Miss Li.

822
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,480
Morning.

823
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,599
Miss Qin.

824
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,359
Since when

825
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,799
do you take the commoner's route?

826
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:20,640
I know your husband lost his job

827
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,200
but you still

828
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,799
can afford Starbucks, can't you?

829
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,400
You mean this coffee?

830
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,240
My husband brewed it for me.

831
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,120
I told him not to do that

832
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,640
but he insisted.

833
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,160
Look at you, showing off.

834
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,799
But I understand.

835
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:33,200
If a man loses his career,

836
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,880
he'll have to contribute in another way
to the household.

837
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,480
Otherwise, there'll be an imbalance.

838
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:37,680
If this carries on,

839
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,200
the relationship won't last.

840
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:40,440
Miss Li.

841
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,799
I couldn't agree more.

842
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,559
I told my husband

843
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
that it was okay

844
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,480
to stay home.

845
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,559
It's fine.

846
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,680
No need to have an annual income

847
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,960
of millions.

848
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,999
20, 30 thousand yuan per month

849
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:52,079
will make us happy too.

850
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,319
Work

851
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,559
isn't everything life has to offer.

852
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:55,319
Don't you agree?

853
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,079
20, 30 thousand yuan per month?

854
00:36:58,359 --> 00:36:59,160
That's a goal

855
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,240
for many people already.

856
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,039
Look at our legal assistants.

857
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,440
They toil for a year

858
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,519
and they still won't reach that number.

859
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,640
You are making enemies here.

860
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:08,839
By the way,

861
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:10,160
don't drink that much coffee.

862
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,480
It damages your bone density

863
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,279
and makes you excited easily.

864
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,839
Be like me. Drink tea.

865
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:16,039
It's anti-free radicals

866
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,440
and it calms your mind.

867
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,759
Miss Li.

868
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:19,880
I think tea

869
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,640
will do you good.

870
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,039
Have more. All the best.

871
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,880
Miss Li, Miss Qin.

872
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,799
Madam Tang wants

873
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,160
to have a meeting with you
on the 11th floor now.

874
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:00,599
What happened?

875
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:02,920
No idea.

876
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:10,880
Hello?

877
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:18,999
Okay.

878
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:21,799
They're here.

879
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,400
Ms. Lan.

880
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,680
It's okay.

881
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:38,079
You're safe here.

882
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,720
Have a seat.

883
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,400
(Shanghai Artemed Hospital)

884
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,200
(Hello?)

885
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:57,200
(Mr. Yang,)

886
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,960
(Zhou is sick
and has been hospitalized.)

887
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,640
(You said)

888
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,200
(Luowei Yulan was risky.)

889
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:03,240
(He didn't heed your warning)

890
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,120
(and invested all his savings in it.)

891
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,720
He already has high blood pressure

892
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,039
and now, he had a stroke.

893
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,279
He nearly died.

894
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:27,640
Zhou.

895
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:31,079
I'm Yang Hua.

896
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:31,880
Aunty Afro

897
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,839
and others are busy

898
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:33,640
so I visit you

899
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,599
on their behalf.

900
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,279
Zhou.

901
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,440
Don't worry

902
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,039
about it.

903
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:49,120
Money is just a number.

904
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,880
You have lived for a long time.

905
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:52,960
I'm sure you have weathered
all sorts of storms.

906
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:55,279
You understand

907
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:56,400
more things than I do.

908
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,839
Your health is very important.

909
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,079
We miss you dearly.

910
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:08,359
Rest now.

911
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:09,720
I'll visit you again next time.

912
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,759
They won't miss me.

913
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,839
They

914
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,799
are mocking me.

915
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,799
Your health...

916
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:29,480
I'm fine.

917
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,120
I'm not dead yet.

918
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,079
You're so stingy.

919
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,920
If you're visiting me,

920
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,279
buy me some expensive fruit.

921
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,519
No one wants what you bought here.

922
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,920
Can you be discharged now?

923
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,240
Yes, I can.

924
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,880
You know,

925
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:53,599
I

926
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,120
can get a bit greedy at times.

927
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,759
For some reasons

928
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,279
beyond my understanding,

929
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,999
a huge windfall was what I could
think about.

930
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,279
When I heard

931
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,999
what happened to Luowei,

932
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,400
I thought my world

933
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,839
was crumbling down.

934
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,200
But

935
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,920
my daughter-in-law

936
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,960
had a bad feeling about it

937
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
so she secretly

938
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,440
kept the money away

939
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,160
and just bought a few stocks.

940
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,359
That's a good thing.

941
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,599
Indeed.

942
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:34,480
I was never fond of

943
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,279
my daughter-in-law.

944
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,240
But when it matters

945
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,120
the most,

946
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,319
her female instinct was accurate.

947
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,599
I lost more than one million yuan

948
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,480
but it's okay.

949
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,559
I

950
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,960
can afford it.

951
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
I can.

952
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:01,799
And now that I'm sick,

953
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:05,319
my daughter and my son

954
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,519
take turns looking after me.

955
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,200
The time we spend together now

956
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:14,680
is more than the time we spent

957
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,079
together last year.

958
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,400
And honestly,

959
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,160
the loss

960
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,559
is worth it.

961
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:33,359
Quite worth it.

962
00:42:58,839 --> 00:42:59,519
Ms. Lan.

963
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:01,319
If I may ask,

964
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:03,880
why did you choose

965
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,960
Cheng & Hui

966
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:07,440
as your representing attorney?

967
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,799
Mr. Jin.

968
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,400
Madam Tang.

969
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:16,200
I suppose

970
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,880
there's no need to hide anymore.

971
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,200
Cheng & Hui is the furthest

972
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,759
down our list.

973
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:24,680
But in the past week,

974
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,880
we have visited all the best law firms

975
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,920
in Pujiang.

976
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,400
But they turned us down

977
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,279
because they are representing

978
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:32,039
Luowei Yulan's opponent

979
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:33,680
in this financial litigation case.

980
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:35,999
I figure no one

981
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:37,480
knows Ms. Lan better than you

982
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,759
so at the moment,

983
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:40,640
Cheng & Hui

984
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,680
is our best option.
