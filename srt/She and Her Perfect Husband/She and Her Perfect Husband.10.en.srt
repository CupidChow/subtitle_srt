An'an, slow down.

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,170
Hello.

23
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,090
Welcome.

24
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,970
Ms. Tang,

25
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,050
am I late?

26
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,970
No.

27
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,850
This is for you.

28
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,250
Thank you.

29
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,570
Come on in.

30
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,370
Ma,

31
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,890
this tea is not sold at the market.

32
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,410
Try it.

33
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,730
Let's see if you know what it is.

34
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,810
Judging from its texture,

35
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,650
it should have
at least ten years of history.

36
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,650
It's far longer than that.

37
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,690
There are only products
made in 2018 at the market.

38
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,770
As for the products in 1982,

39
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,610
they no longer exist at the market.

40
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,490
As you've brought this out,

41
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,010
I must get half of it.

42
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,050
I'll try everything

43
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,970
to steal it away later.

44
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,730
By just one sip,

45
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,930
I can tell it's tea shoot in 1982.

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,690
It's tough to get such a good tea.

47
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,130
Did you see it, Ma?

48
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,370
This is the expert.

49
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,210
Thank you.

50
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,650
Mr. Yang,

51
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,530
I've read

52
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,810
your analysis report.

53
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,770
It's very professional.

54
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,130
I heard from Jin

55
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,210
you're in the investment industry.

56
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,370
What exactly is it

57
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,410
you do?

58
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,610
I majored in International Finance
in college.

59
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,290
After I graduated, I've worked

60
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,250
as a technology analyst

61
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,970
and risk controller for some time.

62
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,130
Now, I'm responsible for the sale
and purchase of investment projects.

63
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,610
No wonder.

64
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,330
With your ability,

65
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,650
I think you should be

66
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,330
the designer of the projects.

67
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,650
Being a salesman has wasted your talent.

68
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,810
Which company

69
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,810
are you working in?

70
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,890
Ma,

71
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,130
what now? Are you trying to poach him?

72
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,570
You already have me

73
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,250
in the company.

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,770
You still want to poach
my husband.

75
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,850
My mistake.

76
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,730
Qin Shi,

77
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,450
Mr. Ma cherishes the talent.

78
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,170
You and your husband

79
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,850
are always apart from each other.

80
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,970
It must be tough for you.

81
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,210
Mr. Ma has connections.

82
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,930
Maybe he can get your husband back here.

83
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,170
So you can have a whole family.

84
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,170
Why?

85
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,250
You don't like that?

86
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,450
Is that true, Mr. Ma?

87
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,410
Of course I'd like that.

88
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,450
Just that

89
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,090
both of us are workaholics.

90
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,770
We've reached

91
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,450
a common ground when we got married.

92
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,410
That we won't constrain each other
from pursuing

93
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,250
our own careers because of the family.

94
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,690
So the distance doesn't mean

95
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,490
anything to us both.

96
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,930
Right, Hubby?

97
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:04,650
Mr. Yang,

98
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,690
as a man,

99
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,650
I'm truly envious of you.

100
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,370
Dad,

101
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,690
Mom said the meal is ready.

102
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,650
Let's go eat.

103
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,810
The meal is ready.

104
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,610
- Dad
- Let's go eat, come on.

105
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,930
Dad, Mom has prepared the meal.

106
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,410
Let's go eat.

107
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,090
Let's go eat.

108
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,730
Follow me.

109
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,490
My dear sons.

110
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,210
Hurry up.

111
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,490
Go, go, go.

112
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,050
It's surprising to see you here.

113
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,290
You're not the only candidate here.

114
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,530
The company has stipulated

115
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,970
that the chief manager and above

116
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,530
have the right to recommend
a candidate.

117
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,090
I'm recommended by Mr. Hua

118
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,210
from our department.

119
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,090
You've got

120
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,850
a bit of that shameless confidence

121
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,530
of mine now.

122
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,930
We should learn
other people's strengths.

123
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,810
You'll never know

124
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,010
if you don't give it a try.

125
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,010
What if an unexpected incident occurs?

126
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,490
I might be able to strike back.

127
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,490
It's unpredictable.

128
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,610
Fight on.

129
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,090
Welcome, Mrs. Shen.

130
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,850
You're so lucky.

131
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,210
I heard that you've won a lot.

132
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,290
Every lawyers,

133
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,370
let's take a seat and eat.

134
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,930
Calm down, just sit and wait.

135
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,250
Have you won any today?

136
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:31,890
I lost again.

137
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,410
Qin Shi, come, sit next to me.

138
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,010
James, this way, please.

139
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,570
Thank you.

140
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,290
Before we eat,

141
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,690
please spare me

142
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,610
a minute or two.

143
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,410
I need to say something.

144
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,010
We're usually busy.

145
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,690
Every year,

146
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,450
the chance to meet each other

147
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,290
is getting less.

148
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,250
This shows

149
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,730
that the law firm is developing well.

150
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,290
But we have

151
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,170
lesser chance to care for one another.

152
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,530
Cheng & Hui started with three people.

153
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,810
It has developed to what it is today.

154
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,290
I won't mention
how hard the process was.

155
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,010
In short,

156
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,570
thanks to you

157
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,330
for treating

158
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,210
Cheng & Hui as your family.

159
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,330
Come.

160
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,530
This is

161
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,050
to everyone of you.

162
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,410
You drink fruit juice.

163
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,050
It's alright.

164
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,810
Listen to me.

165
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,290
The eleventh floor

166
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,850
is the core level of the firm.

167
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,690
There are seven lawyers in total.

168
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,610
Zhang and Jiang have gone
on a business trip.

169
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,450
The others are all here.

170
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,050
All of them are very capable.

171
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,570
It's our loss to lose any of them.

172
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,410
This time,

173
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,690
we have to choose a lawyer

174
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,090
from the family department

175
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,210
and the criminal case department

176
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,210
to join the eleventh floor.

177
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,490
I hope that everyone who joins

178
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,530
the eleventh floor

179
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,610
could become the lifetime partner

180
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,890
of Cheng & Hui.

181
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,130
And I wish that Cheng & Hui

182
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,050
could become your

183
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,850
lifetime career.

184
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,530
Huihui,

185
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,050
let's propose a toast to everyone

186
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,930
with the co-founders.

187
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,730
To your health!

188
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,570
It's so beautiful.

189
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,090
Is it?

190
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,450
Thank you.

191
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,130
Go on, talk to them.

192
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,730
What's there to talk about?

193
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,850
They're talking about golf,

194
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,570
women and whisky.

195
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,730
I couldn't join in.

196
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,130
Didn't you

197
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,250
come here to manifest yourself?

198
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,570
It depends

199
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,930
on the situation.

200
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,530
I thought Miss Qin

201
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,450
is resourceful

202
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,610
that you can have it both ways.

203
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,450
I didn't expect

204
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,890
there'd be something

205
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,210
that you can't take control of.

206
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,730
I thought you would have more chance

207
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,410
than me

208
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,770
as Ms. Tang got your back.

209
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,330
It turns out that we're both the same.

210
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:28,970
For you.

211
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,170
You should fight on too.

212
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,690
I think you're wrong.

213
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,090
What do you mean?

214
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,210
Qin Shi is not like you.

215
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,530
Guys,

216
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,210
I've brought a box

217
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,730
of cigar from Cuba.

218
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,170
Would you like to try it?

219
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,010
Don't smoke here.

220
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,930
It'll suffocate the ladies.

221
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,850
Let's smoke in the house.

222
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,610
Are women welcomed

223
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,050
to the activity you hold?

224
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,890
Sure.

225
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,770
Let's go.

226
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:02,970
Come on.

227
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,250
Let's go.

228
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,850
Come on, Chen.

229
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,250
Let's go smoke cigars.

230
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,410
Miss Qin seems

231
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,210
a bit haggard.

232
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,250
Mr. Yang,

233
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,890
you've got

234
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,330
to tell your wife

235
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,570
to take care of her body.

236
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,770
Don't push herself too much.

237
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,810
Miss Qin,

238
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,090
actually, I've always wanted
to ask you this.

239
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,090
As a female lawyer,

240
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,570
what do you think

241
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,490
of the pressure issues in our industry?

242
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,890
I didn't mean

243
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,210
anything by this question.

244
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,810
I'm just curious.

245
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,330
My wife is an extraordinary person.

246
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,250
To her, working is an enjoyment.

247
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,450
Because only the incompetent people

248
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,130
will find it exhausting to work.

249
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,250
Instead, to my wife,

250
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,490
she doesn't find it exhausting.

251
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,130
I'm a bit different.

252
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,410
Well,

253
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,770
there's a saying, a competent person

254
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,970
will find nothing hard to do.

255
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,770
Besides, I find her

256
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,610
most attractive when she works.

257
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,610
After all, intelligence makes
one look sexy.

258
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,250
Intelligence will make one look sexier.

259
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,010
Excuse me, Ms. Tang.

260
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,930
I need to use the gents.

261
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,810
Why don't we ask

262
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,210
Mr. Yang

263
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,530
to join our club?

264
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,730
But I think

265
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,850
the existence of career women

266
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,090
is not reasonable.

267
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,650
Don't be eager to judge me.

268
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,010
Hear me out.

269
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,850
Caring for her husband and kids

270
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,490
have been women's most important career
since ancient times.

271
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,090
Look at the condition of the society now.

272
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,530
Men and women have entered

273
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,490
the work force.

274
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,730
Career and making money first.

275
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,570
Family second.

276
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,450
Causing a declining fertility rate.

277
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,850
The competition in work is intense.

278
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,930
If all the married women

279
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,410
leave the labor market,

280
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,370
it'll be able to solve
the issue of fertility rate

281
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,010
and employment rate,

282
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,530
it'll also create
a harmonious family.

283
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,690
To create the best

284
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,690
growing condition for the kids.

285
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,210
Doesn't it make sense?

286
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,850
I agree.

287
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,730
I'm against it.

288
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,010
Miss Qin is not happy about it.

289
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,130
Don't get me wrong, Miss Qin.

290
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,450
I'm sincerely trying

291
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,850
to benefit the married women like you.

292
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,610
Thank you.

293
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,370
Well, does your wife work?

294
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,010
She doesn't.

295
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,690
The life you give her,

296
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,130
is she happy about it?

297
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,770
Is she satisfied with it?

298
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,130
Of course she's satisfied.

299
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,130
She's certainly happy about it.

300
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,330
My wife has a master's in psychology

301
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,490
from Nanjing University.

302
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,610
She has taken good care

303
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,850
of our family

304
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,970
and she has done a great job

305
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,410
in educating our kids.

306
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,530
My wife has told me

307
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,290
more than once

308
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,810
that our family has given her

309
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,370
a greater sense

310
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,370
of accomplishment than the paper

311
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,370
she aced back then.

312
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:01,850
Yes.

313
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,570
Hence, Miss Qin,

314
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,970
I'm genuinely considering issues

315
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,850
for you married women.

316
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,170
Well, I'll tell you

317
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,130
a story about me.

318
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,370
I have a brother

319
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,250
who is five years older than me.

320
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,570
When we were kids,

321
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,770
we always cut a watermelon into half

322
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,730
and ate it with the spoon.

323
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,130
There was one time,

324
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,570
my brother and I were eating
the watermelon together.

325
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,330
He always ate the small pieces

326
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,530
in the middle part

327
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,250
and left the rest to me.

328
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,730
I was so touched that time.

329
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,250
I thought he was so nice

330
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,130
as he left a lot of watermelon to me.

331
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,210
When I grew up a little,

332
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,170
I thought I shouldn't be so selfish.

333
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:44,850
So there was one time

334
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,050
when we ate a watermelon,

335
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,810
I ate the piece in the middle part

336
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,050
and left the rest to him.

337
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,290
After that time, I only found out

338
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,290
the piece in the middle part
of the watermelon

339
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,690
was the most delicious one.

340
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,930
This incident helps me understand a truth.

341
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,370
Which is to tell whether one

342
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,690
is sincerely nice to you,

343
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,010
you need to stand in their shoes

344
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,490
and see if he's as happy as you are.

345
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,130
So

346
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,570
if your wife

347
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,570
gives you the same life,

348
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,770
could you feel comfortable to go home

349
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,930
and be a househusband happily?

350
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,250
Here's the thing.

351
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,690
It's not that I don't want to.

352
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,730
It's because I don't think I can do it.

353
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,850
If you ask me and my wife

354
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,330
to solve the issues of the family,

355
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,490
I'm sure she'll do better than me.

356
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,570
So,

357
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,810
to you, a merger which worths

358
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,570
billion of dollars is a piece of cake.

359
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,290
Yet, you can't do the job

360
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,010
like taking care of the kids,

361
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,210
doing the household chores

362
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,090
and caring for the elders.

363
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,170
Then, can I interpret it as taking care

364
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,490
of a family is harder than working in the society?

365
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,250
So you said

366
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,570
the career women should return
to their families,

367
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,290
isn't it a disguised way

368
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,650
of doing a harder work
with a lower wage?

369
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,570
Chen,

370
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,090
nothing more to say, do you?

371
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,690
Okay.

372
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,890
You've made Chen speechless.

373
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,410
Qin Shi, I'm impressed.

374
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,090
Okay.

375
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,450
I surrender.

376
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,530
Spare me, will you?

377
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,650
I'm flattered.

378
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,770
You're impressive.

379
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,810
Miss Qin is eloquent.

380
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,770
I don't agree

381
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,090
with Chen's statement,

382
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,970
but in fact,

383
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,890
women will always choose family

384
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,210
when there's a conflict

385
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,690
between career and marriage.

386
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,170
Ms. Bian is the living example of it.

387
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,610
Right.

388
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,850
Here's my thought.

389
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,970
I think it's one's personal will

390
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,290
whether to work or not.

391
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,730
It has nothing to do with gender.

392
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,490
Actually, the ladies don't have to face

393
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,450
this kind of problem.

394
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,370
Just take me as an example.

395
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,170
I think it's a false assumption.

396
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,330
You're being too optimistic.

397
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,010
Though you haven't

398
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,370
encountered such a problem,

399
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,450
it doesn't mean you won't

400
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,530
encounter it in future.

401
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,210
Tan,

402
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,370
let's say your girlfriend

403
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,290
wants you to choose
between your career and family,

404
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,330
if not, she won't marry you.

405
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,130
What will you choose?

406
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,210
Fang,

407
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,010
your wife tells you

408
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,330
that she's stressed

409
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,130
and she hopes that you could work less

410
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,690
and come home to keep the kids company.

411
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,210
If not, she'll divorce you.

412
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,170
What will you choose?

413
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:38,810
Shen,

414
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,810
your wife wants to send your only

415
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,090
daughter abroad to attend schools.

416
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,290
So you'll need to immigrate,

417
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,130
will you go?

418
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,090
So,

419
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,690
I think

420
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,850
women are not the only ones
who will have

421
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,370
to face the problem of choosing
between career and family.

422
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,010
Miss Qin is biased against men.

423
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,130
(I'm screwed.)

424
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,890
(Did I push too far?)

425
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:03,690
(What should I do?)

426
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,450
Let me answer this question.

427
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,530
My wife is not biased against men.

428
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,970
She loves her job very much.

429
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,010
Whoever is at odds with her in her job,

430
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,610
she'll see him as an enemy without any hesitant.

431
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,330
I was struck by it.

432
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,850
In the current social environment,

433
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,330
men have indeed taken precedence
over women.

434
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,650
And they're encouraged
to value their careers more.

435
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,970
But in fact,

436
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,850
women are not necessarily

437
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,170
suitable to manage household chores.

438
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,450
Men are not necessarily professional elites.

439
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,370
My wife is a very good lawyer.

440
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,570
The sense of accomplishment

441
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,770
and honour that the work

442
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,290
gives her is far more than that to me.

443
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,570
If both of us must choose

444
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,810
one between family and career,

445
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,130
then I'll choose family.

446
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,450
(Nice move, it's a nirvana.)

447
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,450
This is not a joke.

448
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,090
You've got a great attitude.

449
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,450
But I don't think

450
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,010
you'll quit your job.

451
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,890
Why not?

452
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,010
It's just a job.

453
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,530
That's a job

454
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,370
that many people dream of.

455
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,570
If you quit,

456
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,650
it'll be one less income stream
in your family.

457
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,850
Money is actually not that important.

458
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,090
If your purpose of working

459
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,810
is to provoke your desire,

460
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,730
then this job is completely worthless.

461
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,450
Besides, I've thought about it.

462
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,210
To live a happy life,

463
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,650
4,500 yuan is actually enough for it.

464
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,850
My husband has done

465
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,050
expressing his point of view.

466
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,850
Just ask me if you have any more questions.

467
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,250
Mr. Jin, the beef is ready.

468
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,850
Okay, I got it.

469
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,290
I specially have this beef flown in.

470
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,290
You must try it out.

471
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,370
Let's go.

472
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,970
We're the lucky ones.

473
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,570
There's good food for us.

474
00:19:59,530 --> 00:19:59,970
You're good.

475
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,370
Young man,

476
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,290
you've got a bright future ahead.

477
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,770
That's impressive.

478
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,330
Where did you learn it?

479
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,290
I'm self-taught.

480
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,210
I suppose this is
the spirit of contract.

481
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:15,650
Don't flatter yourself.

482
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,250
Qin Shi,

483
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,610
your plate.

484
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,690
Sorry, Mr. Jin.

485
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,450
She doesn't eat beef, I'll eat it.

486
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,890
Miss Qin,

487
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,250
you've got a good husband.

488
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:33,730
I like him.

489
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,490
Huihui.

490
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,090
Because of what he said just now,

491
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,170
I've got to have a drink with him.

492
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,170
- He doesn't drink.
- I don't drink.

493
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,970
You're indeed a family.

494
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,530
It's alright.

495
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,930
I'll drink and you watch me, okay?

496
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,530
Excuse me, I have to take a call.

497
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,090
It's okay.

498
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,930
Be quick.

499
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,850
Hello, who is this?

500
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,690
I'm Yang Hua.

501
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,970
Mr. Yang,

502
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,890
you gave a splendid speech just now.

503
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,810
But I have a question

504
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,370
that I don't understand.

505
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,890
Why would you hide

506
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,530
the fact that you're married

507
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,890
and go on a blind date if you got

508
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,970
a happy family?

509
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,010
Eight o'clock, tonight.

510
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,690
This is your last chance.

511
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,410
You've got to make it work
no matter what!

512
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,570
Judging from your look,

513
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,130
I suppose you've figured out who I am.

514
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,850
Then, let's find a place

515
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,010
and talk, just you and me.

516
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,130
I heard from Jin

517
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,730
that your husband has done a great job.

518
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,610
So-so.

519
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,250
Is he going to quit his job?

520
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,570
This is my first time hearing this.

521
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,170
What if it's true?

522
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,530
Don't mess around.

523
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,410
We're in the global downturn now.

524
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,010
Rest assured.

525
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,090
We're doing fine.

526
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,250
Actually, it's good that he's back.

527
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,170
You won't have to live apart again.

528
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,010
Let me tell you this.

529
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,330
No matter what,

530
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,130
you must grab ahold

531
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,090
of this husband of yours

532
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,210
and never let go of him.

533
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,730
You always look unconcerned.

534
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,330
I can't believe

535
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,490
you've found a reliable husband.

536
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,210
Stop talking about me. Look at you.

537
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,130
You have complete control over Jin.

538
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,450
Where did he go?

539
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,610
Jin is waiting for him

540
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,370
to talk

541
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,650
about the happy life
with the cost of 4,500 yuan.

542
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:46,770
Where is he?

543
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,730
Madam Yang said I looked familiar.

544
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,450
Or I wouldn't have thought

545
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,530
that we shared such ties.

546
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,770
Miss Li,

547
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,170
our family affair is
a little complicated.

548
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,890
It's alright.

549
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,170
You can explain it.

550
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,010
I'm a lawyer.

551
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,810
No matter how complicated the case is,

552
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,330
I'm still able to sort it out.

553
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,570
I can't explain

554
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,330
the particular situation.

555
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,330
But,

556
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,450
I'll apologise to you

557
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,690
for what I've done last time.

558
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,090
If an apology worked,

559
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,970
why would the people need us lawyers?

560
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,050
I bought the member service,

561
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,650
but the service institution

562
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,970
recommended me a married man.

563
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,210
This is not the point.

564
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,890
What I can't understand is

565
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,650
why your mother
doesn't know that you're married?

566
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,050
Why

567
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,130
did you go on a blind date with me?

568
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,010
There are

569
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,610
several answers in my mind.

570
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,850
But,

571
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,130
it's very unfavorable to Miss Qin.

572
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,130
I owe her a favor.

573
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,370
So,

574
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,730
I'm not going to blow her cover.

575
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,250
Persuade Miss Qin for me.

576
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,450
A little self-surrender goes a long way.

577
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,890
Or else,

578
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,330
I won't remain silence

579
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,010
if this affects the firm's interest.

580
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,010
Miss Li.

581
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,810
Hubby.

582
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,010
What were you talking about?

583
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:29,810
Nothing.

584
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:30,930
What's wrong?

585
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,610
It's a long story.

586
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,690
Li Dai,

587
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,290
you know Yang Hua?

588
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,770
It's not that case.

589
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,170
But we kind of know each other.

590
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,570
What are you talking about?

591
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,330
Do you two

592
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,610
know each other?

593
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,810
Miss Li,

594
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,890
how could you have a secret conversation

595
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,410
with someone else's husband
at a place like this?

596
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,090
I can't believe you do this.

597
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,090
Mr. Yang,

598
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,450
well, I'm sorry.

599
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,010
I can only tell the truth.

600
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,970
The truth?

601
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,010
There's a secret

602
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,210
between you two?

603
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,770
Ms. Tang, do you remember

604
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,010
that Mr. Yang gave Miss Qin a surprise

605
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,970
on the 20th wedding anniversary

606
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,370
of yours and Mr. Jin?

607
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,570
Actually, his appearance that day

608
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,930
wasn't to surprise her

609
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,250
but to go on a blind date with me.

610
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,090
Blind date?

611
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,650
A blind date with you?

612
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,130
How is this possible?

613
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,450
Qin Shi,

614
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,410
what's going on?

615
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,810
I knew it.

616
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,770
How did you happen

617
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,210
to return to China that day?

618
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,210
Tell me.

619
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,770
Whose idea was it?

620
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,130
You or your mother?

621
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,330
Say it.

622
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,090
Weren't you quite eloquent just now?

623
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:36,770
I...

624
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,050
My mom.

625
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,450
I knew it.

626
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,490
She always

627
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,610
has a problem with me.

628
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,890
I didn't expect she even did this now.

629
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,450
Then, answer me honestly.

630
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,090
Did you know
you were going on a blind date

631
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,210
at the hotel that day?

632
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:06,970
Objection.

633
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,970
(You're lying.)

634
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,170
(I got your photo)

635
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:11,930
(that the dating site)

636
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,850
(sent to me.)

637
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,810
There's a Mr. Yang

638
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,730
coming over.

639
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,370
Tell him

640
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,290
that I'm on the rooftop.

641
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,330
All the people are here.

642
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,810
Sir, do you have an invitation card?

643
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,850
I'm here for Miss Li Dai.

644
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,010
This way, please.
Miss Li is on the rooftop.

645
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,570
Sure, thank you.

646
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,370
James Yang?

647
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,330
(No matter how much)

648
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,530
(Yang Hua's mother hates you,)

649
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,650
(she won't be that foolish)

650
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,010
(to register on the dating site)

651
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,890
(for his son.)

652
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,450
(Both of you always live apart)

653
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,170
(from each other,)

654
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,130
(you don't get to see
each other often in a year.)

655
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,210
(Why)

656
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,970
(didn't you tell your wife)

657
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:48,810
(that you're back?)

658
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,050
(Why wasn't your longed-for wife)

659
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,890
(the first person)

660
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,490
(you met after you returned to China?)

661
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,770
(So I doubt)

662
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,370
(that both of you)

663
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,850
(are forging your married status.)

664
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,250
(In fact, you're not married
to each other.)

665
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,250
All of the questions

666
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,970
are attributed to one point.

667
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,290
The answer is

668
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:23,930
that both of you...

669
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,810
I lost my job.

670
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,170
You lost your job?

671
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,610
When did it happen?

672
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,290
It was

673
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,530
a year ago.

674
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,930
A year ago?

675
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,530
You've been jobless for a year?

676
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,930
Why didn't you tell me that?

677
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,850
I didn't want you to worry.

678
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:53,930
Wait.

679
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,650
You've been jobless for a year.

680
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,930
But where were you all year?

681
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:57,850
In China?

682
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,650
No, I've just returned recently.

683
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,210
You didn't have a clue?

684
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,970
How is this possible?

685
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,730
The global economy is stagnant
in these two years.

686
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,210
That's why I lost my job.

687
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,690
I'd like to keep looking for a job,

688
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,610
but,

689
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,850
it's not easy to look for a job

690
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,730
with an annual wage like mine.

691
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,890
I don't have a job

692
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,610
but I've got income.

693
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,850
It's not as high as before,

694
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,250
but I still can make a living.

695
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,250
No wonder you kept telling me

696
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,210
you wanted to quit your job.

697
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,490
If it wasn't for today's incident,

698
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,210
were you going to hide it from me forever?

699
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,690
I was afraid you'd abandon me.

700
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,490
You're such a fool.

701
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,090
That's enough.

702
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,370
You lost your job

703
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,050
but you still have each other,
don't you?

704
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:05,450
Geez.

705
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,450
Previously, your marriage was good.

706
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,490
But it was too perfect.

707
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,370
Now that it's more realistic.

708
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,610
You even have the problem

709
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,970
with your husband and mother-in-law.

710
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,930
This is more like a life.

711
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,850
Sis, thanks for comforting me.

712
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:23,730
Huihui,

713
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,650
Luowei International Foundation

714
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,090
has just held a press conference.

715
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,530
They said they never established

716
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,650
a personal foundation in China.

717
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,970
Luowei International has nothing to do

718
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,370
with all the domestic projects of Luowei.

719
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,530
Aunt,

720
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,530
you'll only be there for two weeks.

721
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,130
But you brought
two big luggages with you.

722
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,170
Why did you bring so many things?

723
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,690
They are for Qiuqiu.

724
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,530
How could I use it all by myself?

725
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,530
I've sent

726
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,770
the arrival information to Qiuqiu.

727
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,530
He'll pick you up
at the airport by then.

728
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,050
Have you prepared the wallet, US dollar

729
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,050
and passport?

730
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,170
Yes, it's all set, don't worry.

731
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:14,930
Good, then.

732
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,690
While I'm away,

733
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,450
I'll need you

734
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,730
to take care of the house,

735
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,450
the company and the association.

736
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,010
Rest assured,
it's just a few short days.

737
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,090
Nothing will happen.

738
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,410
I'm lucky to have you in these few days.

739
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,890
Or else, those bad stuff

740
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,410
would really annoy me.

741
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,410
Actually, I didn't do much.

742
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,450
After all, our company has a good reputation.

743
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,290
This bunch of lawyers

744
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,330
are paid for their jobs.

745
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,050
But they're also the ones
who stirred up troubles.

746
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,370
They're not that capable.

747
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,370
But all of them are good at bluffing.

748
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,930
Obviously, you're biased against them.

749
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,050
If one meets

750
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,010
a good lawyer and a good doctor,

751
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,210
they could save your life
at the critical moment.

752
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,770
When is the flight?

753
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,690
1:30 p.m.

754
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,490
From Pujiang to San Francisco.

755
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,530
No matter what,

756
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,770
we can't let her get away.

757
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,290
Anyway,

758
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,850
we should avoid Cheng & Hui in future.

759
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,010
I kind of admire Jin

760
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,970
from Cheng & Hui.

761
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,010
Aunt.

762
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,090
You're too kind.

763
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,610
That's why you always get bullied.

764
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,970
What should we do now, Bro?

765
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,450
They're heading to the highway.

766
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,050
It'll be tougher to go after her.

767
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,290
We can't let her catch the flight.

768
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,570
Overtake her.

769
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,210
Reduce the speed to block her.

770
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,850
Are you alright, Aunt?

771
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,610
I'm fine.

772
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,170
What's wrong with you?

773
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,730
Get off the car.

774
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,890
Danping, don't go.

775
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,050
Look, what to do now?

776
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,130
You changed lane
and suddenly stopped the car.

777
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,410
It's your fault, you know that?

778
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,610
My fault?

779
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,370
There was a car ahead of me,
shouldn't I make ways?

780
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,850
You hit my bumper,
you're responsible for it.

781
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,490
You know?

782
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,210
Let's call the police.

783
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,530
I've got a drive recorder.

784
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,090
We'll know

785
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,370
whose responsibility it is
after checking it.

786
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,130
Go ahead.

787
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,810
Xia,

788
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,010
I crashed the car.

789
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,570
I'll send you my location.

790
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,810
Yes, Ms. Lan needs to catch a flight.

791
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:58,650
Hurry up.

792
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,050
Hey, no.

793
00:33:59,130 --> 00:33:59,850
What are you doing?

794
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:00,810
Did you call your men over?

795
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,970
What are you doing?

796
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,330
Xia.

797
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,010
Give me back my phone.

798
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,010
Nothing has happened.

799
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,650
You don't have to come.

800
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,490
What are you doing?

801
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,250
Danping,

802
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,530
don't argue with this kind of person.

803
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,690
I can't be late for the flight.

804
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,010
Quickly call a cab

805
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,690
and send me to the airport.

806
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,210
Okay.

807
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,130
Give me the phone.

808
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:13,850
Ms. Lan.

809
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,570
Tao?

810
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,570
What?

811
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,090
You knew each other?

812
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,690
Mr. Tao,

813
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,970
you created this car crash
on purpose, did you?

814
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,010
Sorry.

815
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:29,810
I have no choice.

816
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,010
That's why we take this method

817
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:31,690
to stop you.

818
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,930
Mr. Tao, what are you trying to do?

819
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,650
Do you still remember Mr. Jiang

820
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,490
from Yunya Group?

821
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,690
He is the first client who entrusts me

822
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,370
to investigate Luowei Yulan.

823
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,290
The products of Luowei Yulan in his hands

824
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,610
have costed over 15 million dollars.

825
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,690
But starting from last year,

826
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,210
he notices there's been something weird

827
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,650
about the operation of Luowei Yulan.

828
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,410
So he entrusts me
with the work of investigation.

829
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,210
So I have the right to suspect

830
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,410
that Luowei Yulan has committed illegal acts

831
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,050
such as lying to the investors, forging

832
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,010
business data and so on.

833
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,330
Wait, Mr. Tao.

834
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,370
Luowei Yulan is a legitimate enterprise.

835
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,290
You can't make such

836
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,890
an unwise move because of the rumor.

837
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,530
With your behaviour today,

838
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,730
I can sue you for defamation.

839
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,930
You know that?

840
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:11,530
Legitimate or not,

841
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,690
we don't get to decide it.

842
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:13,970
Ms. Lan,

843
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,610
you're eager to go abroad.

844
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,530
I'd like to know

845
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,970
who will take the blame for you.

846
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,450
I won't let anyone

847
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,370
take the blame for me.

848
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,730
Bro.

849
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,010
You have to take the fall

850
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,250
for the mistake your husband made.

851
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,250
Luowei International Foundation

852
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,730
has officially pressed charges

853
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,610
against Luowei Yulan.

854
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:39,970
Aunt.

855
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,810
You won't be able to take this flight.

856
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,690
You've been banned
from travelling abroad.

857
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,930
Our reporter has immediately

858
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,610
contacted

859
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,450
the person in charge
of Luowei Foundation.

860
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,530
They said

861
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,890
Luowei International Foundation

862
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,010
has never established

863
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,970
any subsidiary in our country.

864
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,930
Luowei Foundation has nothing

865
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,850
to do with the projects of Luowei Yulan.

866
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,130
Currently,

867
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,410
Pang Dingfang,
the person in charge of Luowei Yulan,

868
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,690
is suspected of fraud and illegal fund-raising.

869
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,690
The justice department

870
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,170
has officially initiated
an investigation.

871
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,770
Due to Luowei Yulan's fraud

872
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,690
and illegal fund-raising case,

873
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,930
Yulan Group's shares...

874
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,770
It's all vegetables.

875
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,250
It does match the standard

876
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,370
of spending only 4,500 yuan a month.

877
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,330
Beware of your lipid level
as you eat meat everyday.

878
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:33,810
I work so hard

879
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,530
just to enjoy good food.

880
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,010
By the way,

881
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,290
your law firm

882
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,210
has received a lot of cases because

883
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,370
of Luowei Yulan, doesn't it?

884
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,410
Don't bring this up.

885
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,570
It costs two billion dollars.

886
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,130
The top ten

887
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,330
law firms in Pujiang

888
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,890
has been madly busy because of this.

889
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,570
Think about it, Luowei Yulan

890
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,090
got a lot of members.

891
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,290
Any one of them

892
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,490
is a high-quality client.

893
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,850
Everyone will kill for this.

894
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,690
But we're different.

895
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,770
Mr. Jin clearly said

896
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,530
that Cheng & Hui will not accept

897
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,050
any cases that's related
to Luowei Yulan.

898
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,810
Why?

899
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,690
It's his better nature.

900
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:09,890
Think about it.

901
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,570
Our lady boss

902
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,650
was fawning on

903
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,250
Ms. Lan back then.

904
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,170
If we become

905
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,770
the plaintiff's lawyer
when she's in troubles.

906
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,130
How could we do such a thing?

907
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,730
You know what?

908
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,770
Besides that,

909
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,330
the reputation of lawyers

910
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,690
has been bad.

911
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,370
They say that we're fierce and cruel,

912
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,250
we run a rigged system.

913
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,690
We always take advantage of the others.

914
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:30,450
We earn money

915
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,970
from those who are desperate.

916
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,330
They make us sound so bad.

917
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,130
Aren't the lawyers supposed

918
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,290
to save people from troubles

919
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,210
and bring justice?

920
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,250
That would be the Buddha, lad.

921
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,290
Those clients

922
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,130
just want to win the lawsuit.

923
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,530
But they don't know

924
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,570
that the lawyer doesn't get

925
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,290
to decide whether they can win
the lawsuit.

926
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,330
The lawyer can only recoup their losses

927
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,570
and avoid risks to the fullest extent.

928
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,730
But it also shows
that some lawyers are ill-trained.

929
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,850
They even dare to name a price

930
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,010
and accept cases
before getting their law licenses.

931
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,810
The outcome is obvious.

932
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,050
The bad ones are a minority.

933
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,210
But it brings big impact.

934
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,050
You want a bite?

935
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,010
You even reject me.

936
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,330
According to the lawyers' viewpoint,

937
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,930
how will the case of Luowei Yulan end?

938
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,890
Mr. Jin put it this way.

939
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,090
They can win the case.

940
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,370
It's a high probability event.

941
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,210
But based on current situation,

942
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,650
Luowei Yulan

943
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,810
doesn't have the ability to pay the debt.

944
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,930
The final outcome

945
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,610
might be declaring bankruptcy.

946
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,450
Those who file the lawsuit,

947
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,090
their requirements are
to get their money back

948
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,650
instead of winning the lawsuit.

949
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,570
Anyone of you can guarantee

950
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,570
that you can help your clients
to get their money back?

951
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,330
Raise your hand.

952
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:10,290
Cheng & Hui has a lot of inadequacies.

953
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,890
For example,

954
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,170
they value the sources.

955
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,730
People with background
over the power group.

956
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,890
There's discrimination
between male and female lawyers.

957
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,570
And the plateau in the promotion
of the female lawyers.

958
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,050
Well, someone once offered me

959
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,450
twice the wages to poach me.

960
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,530
I rejected it.

961
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,490
Because I appreciate

962
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,090
the characters of our two bosses.

963
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,610
I think

964
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,690
Cheng & Hui is definitely an honest law firm.

965
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,810
It's like a breath of fresh air
in the industry.

966
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,650
A breath of fresh air?

967
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,090
But they refuse

968
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,450
to allow a single woman

969
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,970
to be the partner of the law firm?

970
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,050
It's a breath of fresh air
but it's not perfect.

971
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,530
I think your boss

972
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:52,290
does not necessarily reject this case

973
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,370
due to his relationship with Luowei Yulan.

974
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,450
Your statement has surprisingly matched
someone else's.

975
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,050
Who is it?

976
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:04,890
Who told you

977
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,970
that our boss rejected it?

978
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,770
Didn't Boss say it on the meeting?

979
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,730
Can't you be more sensible?

980
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,690
What kind of a person is our boss?

981
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,890
What kind of a person
can make Cheng & Hui

982
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,050
one of the top ten law firms

983
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,890
within six years?

984
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,010
An ambitious person.

985
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,850
Then, what do you think

986
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,610
the word "Hui" of Cheng & Hui means?

987
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,650
Does it mean Ms. Tang Yihui?

988
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,290
What else could it be?

989
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:32,610
Stop talking.

990
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,490
I'll only say this once.

991
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,850
In Cheng & Hui, the brain,

992
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,450
the most intelligent person is Jin.

993
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,130
The reason why an ambitious

994
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,170
and intelligent person

995
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,490
refuses to join the fierce battle

996
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,450
is certainly not
because he doesn't want to

997
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,370
but how and when to accept it.

998
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,490
We understand.

999
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:58,810
We got it.

1000
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,410
Understood.

1001
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:08,330
Since you went to Boss's place,

1002
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,410
things have become complicated.

1003
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,970
But it's still manageable.

1004
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,570
Hui always wants to get you a job.

1005
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,290
But she doesn't get suspicious anymore.

1006
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,810
As for Li Dai,

1007
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,290
she no longer keeps her eyes on me.

1008
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,890
So, since you said
that you've quit your job,

1009
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,050
before I get promoted
to the eleventh floor,

1010
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,970
your identity is a perfect househusband.

1011
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,370
You'll stay at home to invest stocks

1012
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,370
and run the house.

1013
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,170
It suits your current situation as well.

1014
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,530
The only problem now is

1015
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,010
the kid.

1016
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,010
I can't help you

1017
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,570
with that.

1018
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:01,770
Did you forget?

1019
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,970
In the version of story I made before,

1020
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,130
our kid is already two and a half.

1021
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,770
He's currently abroad.

1022
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,130
My mom used to take care of him.

1023
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,930
Recently, your sister is
taking care of him.

1024
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,930
When did I have a sister?

1025
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,930
Your sister. Did you forget her?

1026
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,050
She grew up with you.

1027
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,090
You guys are close.

1028
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:23,890
She's married to a foreigner.

1029
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,210
And she's given birth to two kids.

1030
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,850
And now, she's a full-time housewife.

1031
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,810
Her name is Helen
or something else, she's your sister.

1032
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,130
Miss Qin,

1033
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,930
I really think you're more fit to be a novelist.

1034
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,450
As our kid's physical condition is getting better,

1035
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,210
I've been thinking

1036
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:56,410
if we should leave him there
or get him back with us.

1037
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,810
This question is too difficult for me.

1038
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,850
From a mother's viewpoint,

1039
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,050
it's certainly better
for a kid to be with his mother.

1040
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,490
From your boss's point of view,

1041
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,850
the kid will definitely distract you.

1042
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,370
Last time, Ma,

1043
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,090
Mr. Chen and the others

1044
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,050
were impressed with you.

1045
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,490
Especially the statement
your hubby made,

1046
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,010
it was a big plus for it.

1047
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,730
The partners' meeting

1048
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,650
will be held in next month.

1049
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,410
I guess they'll soon vote to decide

1050
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,770
the candidate for the eleventh floor.

1051
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,130
So could you wait a little longer?

1052
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,010
Wait until it's decided,

1053
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,090
you can consider if you want

1054
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,250
to get the kid back afterwards.

1055
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,410
You really are my sister.

1056
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,370
I got to give you a kiss.

1057
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,650
You've ruined my foundation.

1058
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:46,890
I hate you.

1059
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,650
Give me a kiss.

1060
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,850
I don't want.

1061
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,530
Geez.

1062
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,730
Just perform well.

1063
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:55,730
That will do.

1064
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,330
Anyway, that's how things go.

1065
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,330
Everything is going according to plan.

1066
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,210
When will you go home

1067
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,850
to harvest the fruit of your victory?
