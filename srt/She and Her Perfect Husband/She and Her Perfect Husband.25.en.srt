19
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:25,285
What is it?

20
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:27,565
Do you have a minute?

21
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:30,886
Didn't you say you got nothing for me?

22
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:38,725
I was wrong.

23
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:48,526
Do you think

24
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,445
that apology can make everything fine?

25
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:52,606
Yang Hua,

26
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,285
you've become an unprincipled man now.

27
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:57,406
I've said that my principle

28
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:58,966
is hoping the people I care

29
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:00,526
could be happy because of me.

30
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:02,126
Instead of coming into conflict

31
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:03,326
because of me like now.

32
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:05,126
I must untie this knot.

33
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,126
Don't say that.

34
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:15,806
I've done wrong as well.

35
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,046
It's not your problem.

36
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,845
The root cause of everything
is my jealousy.

37
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:23,326
Jealousy?

38
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:25,845
You were right.

39
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:27,526
I'm jealous of Tao Junhui.

40
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:28,966
I'm jealous of him going through

41
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:30,246
seven years of time with you.

42
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:32,406
I'm jealous of him giving you

43
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:33,645
a lot of unforgettable memories.

44
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:35,406
I'm even jealous

45
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:36,966
of him meeting you before I did.

46
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:42,526
But after all,

47
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:44,565
I think I'm luckier than him.

48
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:46,645
Because I have the present you

49
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:49,005
and every seven years from now.

50
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,645
So you struggled all day

51
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:02,526
just because of this?

52
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,845
I'm not good at words.

53
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:08,606
But I don't want you to be unhappy.

54
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,766
Will you think that I'm childish?

55
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:14,925
You look cute like this.

56
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:30,806
Did you say this to me

57
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:32,085
because you drank?

58
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:34,085
I was going to do that

59
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:35,006
but I don't think

60
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:36,566
it's reliable to do the wine talking.

61
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,246
So I'd like to sincerely

62
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:40,406
tell you this when I'm sober.

63
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:44,726
You've opened the wine.

64
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:45,806
Let's drink it together.

65
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:51,765
Coming, coming.

66
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:56,645
Fangfang.

67
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:57,406
Quick, come on in.

68
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:58,165
Hello.

69
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,526
Hello, this way, please.

70
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,045
Fangfang, let me introduce to you.

71
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:05,126
This is my fiance.

72
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:06,485
Tao Junhui.

73
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:07,085
Nice to meet you.

74
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:07,885
I've heard

75
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:08,925
Mr. Tao is an outstanding man.

76
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:11,286
Seeing is believing.

77
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:12,686
Sorry to bother you.

78
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:13,526
Don't mention it.

79
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:15,885
It's a gift for you.

80
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:17,165
This is the latest model.

81
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:18,286
Thank you.

82
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:19,446
Make yourself at home.

83
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:20,406
I'll ask Yiren to come out.

84
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:20,846
Okay.

85
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:21,686
Make yourself comfortable.

86
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,365
Why didn't you tell me

87
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:26,085
that we're going to see them?

88
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:27,885
I heard that Cao Yiren didn't talk

89
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,085
to you in person today.

90
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:30,365
So I'd like to help you.

91
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:32,885
I'm a lawyer too.

92
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,406
But I think sometimes, it's better

93
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,966
to skip the lawyer
and come straight to the client.

94
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,045
Can you tell me

95
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:38,925
in advance next time?

96
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:41,286
I got it.

97
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:46,885
This house looks nice.

98
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:02,645
So look.

99
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:04,205
Their company

100
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:07,325
rents the property
from the owner at low price.

101
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:08,406
After renovating it,

102
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:10,006
they lease it out at higher price.

103
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,925
But it will only be profitable with scalable model.

104
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:15,205
I did the figures.

105
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,645
Based on their rental charges,

106
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:18,605
even if they lease it out
for five years in a row,

107
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:21,205
they'll only make money
for a year and a half.

108
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:23,286
The profit margin is too low.

109
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:24,726
They can't make money out of it.

110
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:27,566
Why would Cao Yiren do

111
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:29,566
such an unenviable task?

112
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:31,165
I don't know.

113
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:36,045
This company can be

114
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:38,126
operated without using their own funds.

115
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:39,925
How?

116
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,885
All he needs to do is to package

117
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,365
his service as a financial product.

118
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:46,686
So he can use the others' money

119
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:47,566
to make profit.

120
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:49,286
Then, use this project

121
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:50,846
to create a credit product

122
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:51,765
and collect money.

123
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,045
And use the money he collects

124
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:54,165
to earn interest from the tenants.

125
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:56,765
What is the interest rate
of Guangjuhao Rental?

126
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:57,885
Sixteen.

127
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:00,045
Look,

128
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,205
he can earn 16 percent of it.

129
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:03,925
He launches this credit product at the bank.

130
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:04,925
The bank will only earn one percent

131
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,165
of handling fee at most for selling it on his behalf.

132
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:08,765
The total cost will only be

133
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:09,806
about ten percent.

134
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:10,806
At a result,

135
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,085
there's a gap of six percent in between.

136
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:14,365
Also, the renovation fee can be

137
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:15,645
paid by using the loan.

138
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,085
The interest rate
of the bank renovation loan

139
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:18,526
is between four to eight percent.

140
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:19,966
If it costs 100,000 yuan

141
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:20,966
to renovate a house,

142
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:22,885
the cost might be less than 80,000 yuan

143
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:24,605
to use their own renovation company.

144
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:26,566
Well, if I renovate ten houses
at the same time,

145
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:27,686
it might cost even lesser.

146
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,246
Then, with this method,

147
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,365
I can lend more money

148
00:07:30,526 --> 00:07:31,686
from the bank at a lower interest rate.

149
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,246
It'll cause a larger spread
in interest rates.

150
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:34,645
In this way, they can spend

151
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,126
little money to operate

152
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:37,006
such a huge business.

153
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:38,406
Didn't you say this guy

154
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:39,566
came from the Wall Street?

155
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:40,645
I did.

156
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:42,286
Do you know what

157
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:43,406
a finance worker is good at?

158
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:47,205
Settling accounts?

159
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:49,645
Making up stories.

160
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,126
The view here is great.

161
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:56,286
So-so.

162
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:57,925
You think about it.

163
00:07:58,126 --> 00:07:59,006
Move here after getting married.

164
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:00,526
So we can be neighbours.

165
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:03,165
Let's go.

166
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:04,045
I'll show you my bedroom.

167
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:04,526
Sure.

168
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:04,925
Let's go.

169
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:15,406
Please take a seat.

170
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:22,126
Thank you.

171
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:28,485
Fangfang and Feifei are really close.

172
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,126
I'm sure Fangfang will be happy

173
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:31,845
if Feifei becomes her bridesmaid.

174
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:32,886
Try it.

175
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:34,045
I specially picked

176
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:36,086
this wine for my wedding.

177
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:41,965
It's a fine wine.

178
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:49,646
Mr. Cao,

179
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,126
did Feifei tell you

180
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:53,045
what my job is?

181
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:54,605
Don't be so formal.

182
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:55,886
Just call me Andrew.

183
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:57,886
What do you do, Mr. Tao?

184
00:08:58,686 --> 00:08:59,326
I'm a lawyer.

185
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,365
Then, you and Feifei are
in the same business.

186
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:05,165
We were supposed

187
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:06,126
to meet up today afternoon.

188
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:09,886
Just that I only saw your attorney, Li Dai.

189
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:17,525
What a small world.

190
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:18,845
It's an odd coincidence.

191
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:20,126
Here.

192
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:26,525
Mr. Cao.

193
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,405
No, I should call you Andrew.

194
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:31,806
Actually, I think

195
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,725
that prenuptial agreement is fair.

196
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:37,365
Firstly, to you,

197
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:38,766
and to Fangfang,

198
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:40,686
it's legally binding to both of you.

199
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:41,725
- Besides...
- Mr. Tao,

200
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,446
take a close look at Fangfang.

201
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:48,206
Do you think she's someone

202
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:49,725
who can hurt me?

203
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:52,725
To me,

204
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:55,446
I choose to get married

205
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:57,925
because I want to share

206
00:09:57,925 --> 00:09:59,126
my everything with my wife.

207
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,485
I'm not short of money.

208
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:02,965
Of course.

209
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:04,566
I'm not as rich as Mr. Ding.

210
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:05,925
But I'm not pressured

211
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,326
to guarantee Fangfang

212
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:08,365
a good quality of life.

213
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,446
In every aspects,

214
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:11,485
I don't need

215
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:12,965
support and help from Mr. Ding.

216
00:10:14,086 --> 00:10:15,165
Instead, I hope

217
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,405
you could convey my idea to him.

218
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:21,566
Actually,

219
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,446
Mr. Ding is a father,

220
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:25,525
from his point of view,

221
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,485
is it wrong to care

222
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:29,446
about his daughter?

223
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:31,326
It's not wrong.

224
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:36,246
Fangfang needs concern and company.

225
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,365
In the five years of time

226
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:48,446
after Mr. Ding got divorced,

227
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:49,646
he got married and divorced thrice.

228
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:54,725
Of course.

229
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:56,646
As a junior,

230
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:57,405
I shouldn't

231
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,725
criticise an elder like this.

232
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:00,806
But don't you think

233
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:03,766
Mr. Ding is the man

234
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:05,845
who only feels secure with the help

235
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:07,246
of the prenuptial agreement?

236
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:09,326
Fangfang and I don't need it.

237
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,285
If you insist on not signing it,

238
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:19,285
it'll put Fangfang on the spot.

239
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:22,045
I never said that I refuse to sign it.

240
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:26,006
I respect Fangfang's decision.

241
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:29,206
I'll be sure to sign it if she asks.

242
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:31,686
But this is tantamount to leaving

243
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:32,845
this issue to Fangfang.

244
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:34,646
You want her to choose

245
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:36,165
between you and her father.

246
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,886
This is not fair to her.

247
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:50,525
Mr. Tao,

248
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:55,126
what do

249
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:57,925
you think

250
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,206
fairness is?

251
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,845
When the shot on the racetrack is fired,

252
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,886
some people are calm,

253
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:14,965
some will make a dash with all efforts.

254
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:16,646
They tread carefully.

255
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,045
Who do you think will win the race?

256
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:21,525
It's Pareto principle.

257
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,086
I'm sure you've heard of it.

258
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:25,086
In this world,

259
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:26,886
only 20 percent of the people are

260
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:27,686
the important ones.

261
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:29,806
I want to be

262
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:30,845
one of them.

263
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:36,725
I've worked so hard

264
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:39,605
to get this far.

265
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,126
So I don't have to lose myself

266
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:43,326
before those

267
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:44,605
who've never worked hard.

268
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,845
I must be available when they need me.

269
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:49,365
Otherwise,

270
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:52,766
I'll be tossed aside.

271
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:58,126
We're the same sort of people.

272
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,405
You should know what I mean.

273
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:04,206
If you were me,

274
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:06,886
would you sign it?

275
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:11,965
No matter what my choice is,

276
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:14,446
in China,

277
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:16,605
without Mr. Ding's consent

278
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,285
to the marriage between you
and Ding Fangfang,

279
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:20,525
legally speaking,

280
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,806
you couldn't be husband and wife.

281
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:29,365
You're so cute.

282
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:31,006
Well,

283
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:34,965
let me share you

284
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:36,246
a small secret between men.

285
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:40,845
Actually, marriage doesn't matter

286
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:42,246
to men at all.

287
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:46,045
Cheers.

288
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:03,925
Slow down.

289
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,686
Actually, marriage matters a lot to men.

290
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,006
It's always been men who cling

291
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:10,886
to marriage.

292
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,446
Because marriage system

293
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:13,485
is inherently

294
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,725
the product of patriarchal society.

295
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:15,725
Its appearance

296
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,206
is simply to ensure the men

297
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,845
who have more social capital

298
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,605
to pass on their asset

299
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:21,845
to their true bloodlines

300
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:24,086
in the form of family.

301
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:25,405
What's the nature of men?

302
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:29,165
Monopolise.

303
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:31,646
I agree to this.

304
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:32,446
I've

305
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:33,646
worked on many divorce cases.

306
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:34,886
It's always been men

307
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:35,886
who refuse to get divorced

308
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:37,566
though they're the parties at fault.

309
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:39,126
After getting divorced,

310
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,006
men will always remarry very soon.

311
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:44,165
But women will choose to be independent.

312
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:46,605
They'll either be single or cautiously

313
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,246
choose another marriage.

314
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:50,086
This...

315
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:51,766
Forget it, let me do it.

316
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:56,605
So far,

317
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,086
as long as it's something
that a man wants,

318
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,845
he'll surely monopolise it

319
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:01,806
even if it's

320
00:15:02,006 --> 00:15:03,285
the non-living game machine

321
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,605
or camera.

322
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,086
Let alone the lover
who's a living person.

323
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,725
He'll only feel reassured

324
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:08,405
after marrying her.

325
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:10,806
As a man,

326
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:12,485
don't you have a sense

327
00:15:12,686 --> 00:15:14,126
of privilege because of your gender?

328
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:19,405
Men's genes are

329
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:20,646
actually very fragile.

330
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:23,006
Biologically,
the genetic attrition rate is

331
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:24,246
way higher than that of women.

332
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:25,886
Also, with equivalent education,

333
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:26,766
the performance of women

334
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,365
is no worse than that of men.

335
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:29,365
Moreover,

336
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:30,605
what is the main task

337
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:31,446
for human survival?

338
00:15:31,646 --> 00:15:32,285
To pass on their genes.

339
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:33,525
Even though you've figured out

340
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:34,605
the truth of the universe,

341
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:35,365
if there's no one

342
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:36,285
giving birth to your kids,

343
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:37,686
your genes will disappear

344
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,886
in the history as well.

345
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:39,806
It's completely useless.

346
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:43,165
Besides, men have spent

347
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:44,126
thousands of years

348
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:46,165
to suppress and fool women.

349
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:47,006
Trying to trap

350
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,206
women inside a fence.

351
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:49,405
This kind of confinement

352
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:50,806
is way more fragile than expected.

353
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:52,686
In less than hundreds of years,

354
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:54,246
women have completely been freed.

355
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:55,686
Besides, in the Internet age,

356
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:57,086
men no longer occupy

357
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,485
the absolute dominant position,

358
00:15:58,766 --> 00:15:59,405
so

359
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:01,365
there's nothing to be proud
of being a man.

360
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:02,965
As if marrying a girl is

361
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:04,686
performing some kind

362
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:06,165
of a charitable act.

363
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:07,405
All I can say is

364
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:08,165
that it's extremely foolish,

365
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:09,365
cunning, childish

366
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,446
of those who think it that way.

367
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,405
(Beautiful appearances)

368
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:16,646
(are all alike,)

369
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,045
(but an interesting mind)

370
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:19,766
(is one in a million.)

371
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:22,886
(Perfect.)

372
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:31,566
Why are you looking at me like this?

373
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:34,246
Let's sleep together tonight.

374
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:48,766
Forget it.

375
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:49,165
Okay.

376
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:54,485
I'm not saying forget it.

377
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:55,965
I mean I agree with your suggestion.

378
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:00,405
It's too late.

379
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:01,525
You must answer such a question

380
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:02,285
in less than three seconds.

381
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:19,686
Fangfang told me this.

382
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:20,606
Or I wouldn't know

383
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,045
there's a wonderland like this.

384
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:23,885
I'm not exaggerating.

385
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:25,726
Normally, it's not open to the public.

386
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,045
Reservation is required.

387
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:29,285
Its garden is designed

388
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:30,925
by the national gardeners.

389
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:33,086
The chef is the elder apprentice

390
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,326
of the young lady from Li's Dish.

391
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,846
Let's plan our wedding

392
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:39,726
at there too.

393
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:43,525
I'll make a reservation tomorrow.

394
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:44,566
I'll invite my parents

395
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:45,606
to have a meal there.

396
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:46,566
Luckily, Fangfang

397
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:47,686
is close to the manager.

398
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:48,726
Or we would have

399
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,486
to wait for a long time.

400
00:17:58,726 --> 00:17:59,765
What's the matter, Junhui?

401
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:00,525
Are you not feeling well?

402
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:03,525
I'm a bit tired.

403
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:07,686
I saw you having a good time

404
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,885
chatting with Andrew.

405
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:10,125
It looks like

406
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,326
he can get along with everybody.

407
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:17,525
Junhui, I've got an idea.

408
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:19,566
I think we should just let

409
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:20,486
this case be.

410
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:22,086
I'll talk to Uncle Ding

411
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:23,566
and persuade him.

412
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:24,486
Show him

413
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,726
how blessed and happy Fangfang is now.

414
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:28,446
Then, I'll ask my dad

415
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,765
to introduce us another cases.

416
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:30,525
What do you think?

417
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:32,566
So are you saying

418
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:33,566
you want to give up?

419
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,206
Just give it up.

420
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:36,686
We can't force him to sign

421
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:38,005
the prenuptial agreement.

422
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:39,645
Besides, there are other ways

423
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:41,125
for Uncle Ding to protect

424
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:42,566
Fangfang's assets.

425
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:44,765
How else can he do that?

426
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:46,645
For example,

427
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:47,885
remove Fangfang's name

428
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,165
from the land of his house.

429
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:52,806
Then, he can give the land to Fangfang.

430
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:55,366
And Fangfang can lease it
to him for free.

431
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:56,925
Then, he can lease it out.

432
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:58,566
The rental fee he receives

433
00:18:58,726 --> 00:18:59,765
will be his earnings.

434
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:01,165
Part of Fangfang's rental fee

435
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:02,686
will be saved under the name

436
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:04,645
of her mother which she can dominate.

437
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:05,806
That'll be it.

438
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:08,846
It's so troublesome.

439
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:10,846
You're right.

440
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:13,645
Mr. Ding wants her

441
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:14,885
to sign this prenuptial agreement.

442
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,525
Ostensibly, it's to protect
the property.

443
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:19,446
Ultimately,

444
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,326
the root cause is
that he doesn't trust them.

445
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:34,005
Junhui,

446
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:36,806
I trust you.

447
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:38,925
I know.

448
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:36,366
That junior

449
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:37,525
followed his example.

450
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,566
She worked hard
and took him as the benchmark.

451
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:40,806
She exceeded many

452
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:41,645
of his exam records.

453
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,486
As for Tao Junhui,
during his college days,

454
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:44,925
he participated debate contest
four times.

455
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:47,366
There was only one time
that he didn't win

456
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:48,486
the best debater award.

457
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:49,885
It was taken by this junior.

458
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:07,846
(I suggest you to investigate)

459
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:09,045
(the product background)

460
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:10,686
(of Cao Yiren's company,
Guangxiahao Rental)

461
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:12,686
(and its every funding conditions.)

462
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:27,606
If you're busy,

463
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:28,446
I won't interrupt you.

464
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:29,366
Wait.

465
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:08,165
Let's sleep.

466
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:13,285
I'd like to ask you question first.

467
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,366
Ask me again tomorrow.

468
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,125
No, I can't sleep
if I don't ask you now.

469
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:38,966
Just a moment, Mister.

470
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:44,525
Bye bye.

471
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:45,285
Feifei,

472
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,165
if Mr. Wu

473
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,405
wants us to sign a prenuptial agreement,

474
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:50,446
you can give it to me.

475
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:53,645
No, no.

476
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:54,925
What prenuptial agreement?

477
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:55,966
There's no such thing.

478
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:58,765
Don't imagine things.

479
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:00,086
I would've thrown it away

480
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:01,405
if there was a prenuptial agreement.

481
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:07,366
Rest assured.

482
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:09,966
Bye bye.

483
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:19,686
(I suggest you to investigate)

484
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:20,885
(the product background)

485
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:22,525
(of Cao Yiren's company,
Guangxiahao Rental)

486
00:23:22,645 --> 00:23:23,206
Bye bye.

487
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,525
(and its every funding conditions.)

488
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:55,846
It dies again.

489
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:00,005
The opponent looks professional.

490
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:11,525
Almost, almost there.

491
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:12,285
I'm almost done.

492
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:14,405
Hmm.

493
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:19,245
It dies.

494
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,165
Almost there.

495
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:22,045
You lose, don't you?

496
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:23,245
Not yet.

497
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:25,165
Not yet.

498
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:28,125
Go fight the king.

499
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:31,125
I dare not.

500
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:47,806
I can't reach it.

501
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:52,566
I can't reach it.

502
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:03,446
Thank you.

503
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,045
Go, go.

504
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:14,446
It should die by now.

505
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:15,645
Not yet.

506
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:17,086
We're going to fight the king soon.

Have you done something

523
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:47,812
behind my back lately?

524
00:26:50,013 --> 00:26:51,413
What do you mean? No.

525
00:26:55,452 --> 00:26:57,612
I heard that someone is

526
00:26:58,293 --> 00:27:00,413
studying laws by himself.

527
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:02,332
Do you want to be a lawyer?

528
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:04,053
No.

529
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:08,173
Is there any questions?

530
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:09,212
Why don't you ask me?

531
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:14,173
You should mind your own business.

532
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:15,972
You look down upon me.

533
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:21,293
I'd like to help you.

534
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:24,533
Help you accomplish your plan sooner.

535
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:27,173
But there's a huge gap

536
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:28,173
between our professions.

537
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:31,053
I'm not so arrogant to boss you

538
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:34,053
before understanding your profession.

539
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:37,653
Why would you help me?

540
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:39,173
What why?

541
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:41,173
Isn't this my job?

542
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,293
You can ask me if you have

543
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:50,373
any questions.

544
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:52,653
I don't need no information

545
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:54,653
about my husband from another woman.

546
00:27:55,572 --> 00:27:56,133
There's no

547
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,812
inappropriate contact
between me and Li Dai.

548
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:04,212
Okay, I believe you.

549
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:08,533
Why do

550
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:10,893
you like me?

551
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:15,253
You don't know why?

552
00:28:21,812 --> 00:28:22,732
I...

553
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,053
I like here

554
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:29,653
and here.

555
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:33,212
I can understand this.

556
00:28:33,852 --> 00:28:35,373
But why do you like this?

557
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:38,773
I think

558
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:41,893
you're pure within.

559
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:44,092
Besides,

560
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:47,332
you're brave and kind-hearted.

561
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:51,972
I've met a lot of bad guys.

562
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:54,373
I think it's very precious

563
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:57,332
to be able to keep a pure heart.

564
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:21,053
I'm not as good as you describe.

565
00:29:23,253 --> 00:29:25,092
You're way better than that.

566
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:37,293
There's something
I'd like to talk to you.

567
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:39,732
Dad, I'm going on a trial later.

568
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:41,332
I have to prepare the documents

569
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:42,173
and the evidence chain.

570
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,013
Let's talk about it another time.

571
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,692
This is an important thing.

572
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:55,332
Okay.

573
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:58,173
Come.

574
00:29:58,692 --> 00:29:59,253
Tell me about it.

575
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:02,133
Do you know Qin Shi?

576
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:06,013
I know her.

577
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:08,373
She was the lead attorney

578
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:09,293
in the family department.

579
00:30:09,732 --> 00:30:10,692
And she's in
the corporation department now.

580
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:12,293
Are you aware

581
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:13,452
of her relationship with Tao Junhui?

582
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:15,492
Dad, is this the important thing

583
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:17,212
you want to say?

584
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:19,852
They had a relationship before.

585
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:20,692
I knew it.

586
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:22,332
What's their relationship now?

587
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:25,612
There's no relationship
between them now.

588
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:27,612
Qin Shi is already married
and she has a kid.

589
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:28,773
Besides, Dad,

590
00:30:29,332 --> 00:30:30,692
you're not against the relationship

591
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:32,492
between me and Tao Junhui either.

592
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:33,773
You've given your consent

593
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,092
to our marriage as well.

594
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:37,253
Why do you bring this up now?

595
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,852
I'm not against it, girl.

596
00:30:40,612 --> 00:30:42,253
Actually, I've always reckoned

597
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:44,092
that Tao Junhui is a nice

598
00:30:44,253 --> 00:30:45,133
and capable man.

599
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:46,572
Then, what are you

600
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:47,452
trying to say?

601
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,612
What is this about?

602
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:53,253
Lately, I've learned some

603
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,732
details of Ms. Lan's case.

604
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:56,692
Especially those cases

605
00:30:56,893 --> 00:30:58,013
Tao Junhui's in charged of.

606
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:00,053
It was Lan Xiaoting

607
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:01,492
who introduced you to him.

608
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:03,732
But when he handled

609
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:05,013
Lan Xiaoting's case,

610
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,092
he showed no mercy to her.

611
00:31:07,972 --> 00:31:08,852
Your mom

612
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:10,612
and I have an opinion about this.

613
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:14,413
Dad, Tao Junhui is a lawyer.

614
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:17,092
He fights for his client.

615
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,653
There's nothing wrong with that.

616
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:21,413
He shouldn't have

617
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:22,692
taken up this case when he knew

618
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,253
it was related to Lan Xiaoting.

619
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:26,572
He's not the only lawyer

620
00:31:26,572 --> 00:31:27,893
in Pujiang City.

621
00:31:28,612 --> 00:31:29,452
Besides,

622
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,732
he used Ms. Lan's trust in him

623
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:34,612
to collect many evidences against them.

624
00:31:35,732 --> 00:31:36,533
I always thought

625
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:38,053
Junhui was an honest kid.

626
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:39,732
I didn't expect

627
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:41,653
he could be so heartless

628
00:31:42,173 --> 00:31:43,452
for the sake of his career.

629
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:45,852
He even could be so cruel

630
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:47,253
to an elder who liked him

631
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:49,612
and took care of him.

632
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:51,572
I'm worried

633
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:53,732
he won't treat you well in future.

634
00:31:54,332 --> 00:31:56,413
Dad, tell me honestly.

635
00:31:57,173 --> 00:31:58,373
Did you present Mr. Ding's case

636
00:31:58,612 --> 00:31:59,452
to us on purpose

637
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:00,852
just to test him?

638
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:02,173
Is it that obvious?

639
00:32:04,893 --> 00:32:06,332
Well, I'll tell you the result now.

640
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:08,612
Junhui is willing to sign it.

641
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:10,773
Is that so?

642
00:32:11,692 --> 00:32:12,413
Did he tell you that?

643
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,212
But I don't agree.

644
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:17,332
Dad, I beg of you.

645
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:19,212
Can you stop being paranoid?

646
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:20,253

00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:24,092
Gosh.

I'll show you something.

We'll talk after that.

00:35:07,095 --> 00:35:08,016
Who told you it won't be a problem

686
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:09,576
with the product of an old bird?

687
00:35:09,895 --> 00:35:10,576
How did you know

688
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:11,296
he's never made a mistake?

689
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:15,216
We can't accept this project.

690
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:18,655
Bro,

691
00:35:19,855 --> 00:35:21,216
this is not the product of our bank.

692
00:35:21,695 --> 00:35:22,456
Our bank is

693
00:35:22,695 --> 00:35:24,335
only responsible
for its lauching and sales.

694
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:25,456
Besides, Jia is

695
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:26,695
begging to work for them now.

696
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:29,135
We have nothing to do with this.

697
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:31,016
Moreover,

698
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:33,095
this is a mature product

699
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:35,576
of a senior finance company.

700
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:36,615
They've done a great job

701
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:37,976
in previous periods.

702
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:38,855
What reason do we have...

703
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:42,095
We've got nothing to do with it.

704
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:42,855
It's not our concern.

705
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,536
Why is it not our concern?

706
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:45,895
This is our job.

707
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:46,976
Isn't it our job

708
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:48,415
to think of the client's interest?

709
00:35:51,736 --> 00:35:52,576
You're right.

710
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:01,576
Fine, let me think about it.

711
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:16,736
Bro, can you think of me?

712
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:18,135
I... I've got to find

713
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:19,135
a way to tell Jia

714
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:20,335
and Mr. Qiu about it.

715
00:36:20,776 --> 00:36:21,375
I tell you what.

716
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:23,976
This Triple Supply project,

717
00:36:24,296 --> 00:36:25,895
our boss is keeping an eye on it.

718
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:28,095
If we offend Mr. Qiu because of this,

719
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:29,415
it's not only you, even me,

720
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:30,415
both of us will be fired.

721
00:36:31,335 --> 00:36:32,456
And that Triple Supply is

722
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:33,855
not necessarily a good project.

723
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:40,496
What do you know about it?

724
00:36:48,216 --> 00:36:49,016
Hello, Zhou.

725
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:51,256
Are you at the bank now?

726
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:54,855
If you're at the bank,

727
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:56,016
I'm coming for you.

728
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:57,776
Why do you need to see me?

729
00:36:58,855 --> 00:36:59,536
Well,

730
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:01,695
of course it's to tell you a good new.

731
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:04,056
Yes.

732
00:37:05,496 --> 00:37:07,256
Does your bank have

733
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:09,016
a trust product

734
00:37:09,216 --> 00:37:12,216
which is related
to Songjiang Triple Supply?

735
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:12,855
Make it clear to me.

736
00:37:15,256 --> 00:37:16,095
How did you know

737
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:16,855
we have this product?

738
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,695
I'm the Centurion Card Member

739
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:20,655
of your bank.

740
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:22,615
(You don't know that?)

741
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:25,016
(I'm the most important person.)

742
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:29,415
(Your bank will immediately call me)

743
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:30,935
(once they have a good product.)

744
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:32,695
I know that you're

745
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:33,855
working for this bank now.

746
00:37:34,536 --> 00:37:35,095
So I came

747
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:37,895
to bring you business.

748
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:39,496
(How is it?)

749
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:40,536
(I treat you well, don't I?)

750
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:42,335
Listen to me, Zhou.

751
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:44,256
This product is risky, don't buy it.

752
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:09,895
Defense Lawyer.

753
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,990
(Attorney)

754
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,855
Defense Lawyer.

755
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,330
(Attorney)

756
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,135
(Attorney)
I'm here.

757
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:18,895
Do you have an objection

758
00:38:19,576 --> 00:38:20,335
to the plaintiff's statement?

759
00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:24,335
About the plaintiff's statement,

760
00:38:25,895 --> 00:38:26,456
we...

761
00:38:28,456 --> 00:38:29,175
We don't endorse.

762
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:30,496
We don't endorse.

763
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:32,655
We don't endorse

764
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:33,615
the plaintiff's statement.

765
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,810
(Attorney)

766
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:45,456
(Attorney)
We have some other evidence.

767
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:14,816
Mr. Cao.

768
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,895
Sorry to interrupt you.

769
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:24,216
I'd like to talk to you.

770
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:26,576
What is it about?

771
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,855
Look at this.

772
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,375
What is this?

773
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:39,175
This is
the environmental monitoring report

774
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,216
of your commercial apartment.

775
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,375
The commercial apartment
you put to lease

776
00:40:42,736 --> 00:40:44,095
contains high level of formaldehyde.

777
00:40:45,216 --> 00:40:46,296
The renovation period

778
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:48,776
of this commercial apartment
should be a month ago.

779
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:50,615
But the developer told me

780
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:51,776
it was completed two days ago.

781
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,016
Mr. Tao,

782
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:58,016
you're very concerned about

783
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,016
my company's business.

784
00:40:59,736 --> 00:41:00,615
But thanks for your reminder.

785
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:02,016
I'll be sure

786
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:03,976
to verify this report.

787
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:05,175
You knew

788
00:41:05,615 --> 00:41:07,415
that my company has over 100 stores.

789
00:41:07,655 --> 00:41:08,415
It's hard to guarantee

790
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:10,296
that individual employees won't do
illegal operation.

791
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,095
But as long as I verify it

792
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:13,415
and capture this guy,

793
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:14,496
I'll fire him.

794
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:18,095
Thank you.

795
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,375
I need

796
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:20,375
to meet a client later.

797
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:21,095
Is there anything else?

798
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:22,375
No rush.

799
00:41:23,135 --> 00:41:23,935
Give me one more minute.

800
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:25,776
Look at this.

801
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:31,375
These are
the environmental monitoring reports

802
00:41:31,816 --> 00:41:32,615
of different commercial apartments

803
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:34,335
at different areas

804
00:41:34,496 --> 00:41:35,415
from the 20 stores of yours.

805
00:41:36,816 --> 00:41:37,655
The renovation period

806
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:38,615
of these commercial apartments

807
00:41:38,976 --> 00:41:40,576
ranged from three months to a year.

808
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:41,736
The commercial apartment

809
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:43,576
which has the longest renovation period,

810
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:45,576
the cabinets still contain high level

811
00:41:45,576 --> 00:41:46,335
of formaldehyde.

812
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:47,655
Mr. Cao,

813
00:41:47,935 --> 00:41:49,415
this is not some kind
of individual phenomenon.

814
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:54,816
No, you...

815
00:41:56,536 --> 00:41:56,976
You're indeed

816
00:41:56,976 --> 00:41:58,655
impressive, Mr. Tao.
