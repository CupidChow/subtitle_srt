=Episode 34=

19
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:57,299
This is my job.

20
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:59,778
It's not worth making a fuss about this.

21
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,619
Don't be modest.

22
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:04,019
The company decided

23
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,379
to relaunch the butler service

24
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:07,538
as the signature service of the hotel.

25
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,458
You'll be taking charge of the team

26
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:10,779
and you can pick members

27
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:12,378
and train them.

28
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:13,859
The company considers

29
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,699
implementing the service
for the high-end hotel apartment.

30
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:16,979
That's to offer butler service

31
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,499
in the high-end hotel department.

32
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:19,578
Therefore, we really need

33
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:21,059
talents like you.

34
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:24,458
By the way,

35
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:25,139
I have more amusing news for you.

36
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:27,139
He Donghe drops the case.

37
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:28,339
It's not just that.

38
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:30,098
She's willing to

39
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,298
set the record straight

40
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:33,378
about what has happened before

41
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:36,298
and to apologise to you in person.

42
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:37,979
Yes, Miss Yao.

43
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:38,979
By that time,

44
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:40,699
we'll call a press conference.

45
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:41,938
At that press conference,

46
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:43,658
will you make a public apology, Mr. Yin?

47
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,098
Sure thing.

48
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,059
I apologise to you now.

49
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:55,738
I'm so truly sorry.

50
00:02:58,538 --> 00:02:59,818
Since we've come this far,

51
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,339
let's be honest with each other.

52
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,059
Hadn't this accident occurred,

53
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:04,219
I would've taken the fall

54
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,098
of He Dongna's incident without a doubt.

55
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,219
I'm not that naive to believe

56
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,499
those attendants and securities

57
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:09,818
will commit perjury in the court

58
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:11,899
voluntarily.

59
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:13,899
And I find it hard to believe

60
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:15,178
that the video evidence

61
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:16,378
I gave to the lawyer

62
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:18,018
got spirited away

63
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:19,818
and reappeared.

64
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,298
Mr. Yin.

65
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:26,658
To you,

66
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,658
I'm a disobedient staff

67
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,059
who merely brings trouble

68
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:31,259
to you and the company.

69
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:33,899
But, after what had happened,

70
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:35,098
I came to understand

71
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:37,178
how much you hate me.

72
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:41,779
I'll never reconcile

73
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:43,578
with someone who backstabbed me

74
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,098
and sold me out.

75
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:51,979
There's something

76
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,538
that money can't buy.

77
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,818
Trust is one of them.

78
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:05,619
(Mr. Yin.)

79
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:07,818
(If you really want me to stay,)

80
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,738
(I can offer you a choice.)

81
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:10,818
(Go ahead.)

82
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,339
(Any deal is negotiable.)

83
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:14,938
(I want you to take the blame
and resign.)

84
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:39,939
Feifei.

85
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:42,779
Feifei.

86
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,779
Feifei, it's from Junhui.

87
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:49,138
He said your phone's powered off.

88
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:50,819
Come on, answer his call.

89
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:52,379
Be quick.

90
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:54,178
(Feifei.)

91
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:57,539
Faster, come on.

92
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:06,978
Oh my.

93
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:10,738
Gosh.

94
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,018
Yes, Mrs. Wu.

95
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,099
Junhui, I'm so sorry

96
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:33,698
that I accidentally hung up the phone.

97
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:34,978
Feifei is sleeping now.

98
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:36,379
I can't wake her up.

99
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:38,499
Is Feifei alright?

100
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,018
She's good.

101
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:40,939
I've checked on her.

102
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:41,939
She doesn't have a fever.

103
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:42,978
Junhui.

104
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,138
Did you fight with Feifei?

105
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:47,858
No, we didn't.

106
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,458
I know Feifei has a bad temper.

107
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,138
If she has gone off the line,

108
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,099
please tell me. I'll reprimand her.

109
00:05:55,298 --> 00:05:55,978
Alright?

110
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:58,499
(It's understandable)

111
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,099
(that young couple bickers sometime.)

112
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:01,819
(Don't keep it inside.)

113
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:03,339
(You'll feel better
after you speak it out.)

114
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,539
I know.

115
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:09,499
Ma'am, something has come up.

116
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:10,258
I'm hanging up now. I'm hanging up now.

117
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:11,339
Sure.

118
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,578
I'll let you get on.

119
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:19,339
The settlement failed?

120
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:20,819
Yes.

121
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,458
I understood.

122
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,339
Mr. Yin of Tianhang

123
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,899
is unbelievably stupid.

124
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:32,258
If this plan doesn't pan out,

125
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:34,819
change to a new one.

126
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:37,379
Tomorrow,

127
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:39,138
I'll meet with Yao Yao in person.

128
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,018
If I fail,

129
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:42,138
we have to figure out another plan.

130
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,178
Sure, I go with you tomorrow.

131
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:45,819
You go with me?

132
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:47,698
Don't you remember

133
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:48,659
you accused she
of being morally deformed?

134
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:49,499
If you want to go there,

135
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,099
don't you afraid if she throws water
on your face?

136
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:52,899
Even if she gets acid thrown on me,
I'll still go with you.

137
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,939
I know Yao Yao very well.

138
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:56,018
She's stubborn.

139
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,018
She never changes

140
00:06:58,219 --> 00:06:59,099
after a decision is made.

141
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:00,619
I don't know.

142
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:03,698
We'll go home

143
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,539
and crack our brains
on this problem.

144
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:06,858
As for the difficult one,

145
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:07,738
let's sleep on it tonight.

146
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,219
Sure, we'll talk about it tomorrow.

147
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:20,698
Hi, mint.

148
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:25,698
Who are you going to meet?

149
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,619
Why are you so excited?

150
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:31,418
I was tasked

151
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:32,939
by a funding company.

152
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,258
And your Yao Yao is an important character

153
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,738
in the plan.

154
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,418
She has nothing to do with me.

155
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:42,738
Fret not.

156
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,939
I'm not here to hold you accountable.

157
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,499
It's normal if you'd dated her before.

158
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:50,939
She's gorgeous.

159
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:53,418
All men like pretty girls.

160
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,499
How did you know?

161
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:58,978
Where did you get that?

162
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:03,138
Look. You admit it now.

163
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:05,219
You really can't

164
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:06,539
keep a secret well.

165
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:07,779
That's impossible.

166
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:09,339
Regarding this, you have to listen
to the statement

167
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:10,298
from the person who experienced this.

168
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,418
If you don't,

169
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,138
all the information you have

170
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:14,578
is mere prejudice

171
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,899
and a misjudgement originates
from that prejudice.

172
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:19,619
Good.

173
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,779
Let me ask you this rigorously,

174
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:24,258
did both of you date each other before?

175
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,418
Yao Yao and I

176
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,099
grew up in the same neighbourhood.

177
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,539
However, we only started
to see each other

178
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,099
after we got into the college.

179
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,859
The reason for the breakup is because of me.

180
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:39,258
I was immature back then.

181
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:40,698
After we broke up,

182
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,219
we never contacted each other again.

183
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:43,578
We only ran into each other

184
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,779
on the court a few days ago.

185
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:48,739
Why did you lie

186
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:50,058
that you were childhood friends?

187
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:52,299
Because

188
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,018
it's an ancient history

189
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:55,659
and I don't want

190
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,339
to cause any trouble

191
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:00,859
because of something
that has already long gone.

192
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:03,618
Well.

193
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:07,859
Just admit it.

194
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:10,578
Dating someone is something normal.

195
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,099
Everyone dated before.

196
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,138
Besides,

197
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:15,818
you have to be honest with me.

198
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:16,498
If you tell me,

199
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:17,539
we can get along better.

200
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:18,899
Do you think

201
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,458
I'm a pretty woman?

202
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:22,258
You're strange.

203
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:25,378
Are you happy

204
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:26,698
after I confessed to you?

205
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,099
Yes.

206
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,058
Let me ask you another question.

207
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,419
When did you both

208
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:41,339
first hold hands?

209
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,099
Is it related to the case?

210
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,219
During the children's day performance
in the kindergarten.

211
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:50,458
I'm asking

212
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,299
about the time after you grew up

213
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:55,179
and started seeing each other.

214
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:57,179
First-year.

215
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:00,539
What about your first date?

216
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:04,219
We went to a movie during
the first winter break in college

217
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:09,458
First kiss?

218
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:10,938
On the same day.

219
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:13,739
You can actually remember this clearly.

220
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:14,578
How romantic.

221
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:16,618
You call this romantic?

222
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:17,739
I don't think so.

223
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:20,138
Yes, it's.

224
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:31,339
Well, I'll ask you the last question.

225
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,779
If you're free to choose,

226
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,339
do you want to take Yao Yao back?

227
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:38,818
I need to answer this honestly?

228
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,018
Yes.

229
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:41,818
I think this assumption

230
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:42,899
isn't true though.

231
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,698
Because time is irreversible.

232
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,938
Even if a parallel universe does exist,

233
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,299
I can't control the decision

234
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:51,058
made by another me
who's in another space-time,

235
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:51,938
right?

236
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:56,859
We're not talking about
the parallel universe.

237
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,618
We're talking about this moment,
right now.

238
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,138
The man before me.

239
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:03,779
What's your thought?

240
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,219
If you're free to choose,

241
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:08,779
will you get back together?

242
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:13,099
It's pointless to talk about this.

243
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,938
That will never happen.

244
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,698
Talking about something's not going to happen

245
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:17,818
is just useless.

246
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:19,299
What do you say?

247
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:23,419
Am I right?

248
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:29,258
Good night.

249
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:30,219
Where are you going?

250
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:31,378
I'm not angry.

251
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:32,618
I'm not.

252
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:34,138
Do I look like I'm angry now?

253
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:34,818
I'm in good mood now.

254
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:36,339
Good night, romantic man.

255
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:52,138
Do you really have to laugh so loudly?

256
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:53,299
Enough.

257
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:54,779
Enough.

258
00:11:57,539 --> 00:11:59,058
I'm really impressed

259
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:01,018
by Yang Hua.

260
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:01,938
Me either.

261
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:03,378
Did you turn again him?

262
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,659
Of course, I did.

263
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:07,138
I tell you what,

264
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:07,979
I haven't spoken a single word to him

265
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:09,378
starting from last night.

266
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:11,938
But, that man really pisses me off.

267
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,539
He looks like nothing has happened
when he woke up this morning.

268
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,179
He even offered me coffee

269
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:16,859
asking me if I prefer a hot coffee
or an iced coffee.

270
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:18,618
He has such a cold face like ice.

271
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:19,299
Iced coffee, my foot.

272
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,099
Enough said.

273
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:24,739
Stop showing off how lovey-dovey you are.

274
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,018
Both of you

275
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,618
are living like newlyweds

276
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,378
because the child isn't around you.

277
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:31,018
Go. Work well.

278
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,979
I'll look him out for you during dinner later.

279
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:35,378
What's the dinner about?

280
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:37,779
You'll know later.

281
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,099
Bring Yang Hua along
and come early.

282
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,698
I'm really furious
when I think of him.

283
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,979
(Tao, don't forget about
the gathering tonight.)

284
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,458
(You must come no matter what.)

285
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:47,698
(It's been a while)

286
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:48,739
(since the debate team last gathered.)

287
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:49,578
(We all miss you.)

288
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:50,979
(Is Tao coming?)

289
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:52,659
(I come if he comes.)

290
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,899
(Can I bring my girlfriend?)

291
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:56,458
(Why bring her?)

292
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:57,539
(It's rare to have a rightful chance)

293
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:59,058
(to enjoy ourselves.)

294
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:00,498
(No one is allowed
to bring their partners.)

295
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:03,018
(If so, my girlfriend
doesn't allow me to come.)

296
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:04,299
Henpecked boyfriend.

297
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:05,938
What's it about? Why are you laughing?

298
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:08,339
The debate team

299
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,299
is having a gathering tonight

300
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:10,979
and most of the members will come.

301
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,258
Do you want to join?

302
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:14,339
Basically, only those who do good
in their career

303
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:15,498
will attend the reunion.

304
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:16,698
I don't think I'm going.

305
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:18,818
You're the top in the career now.

306
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,138
Stop being humble.

307
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:23,099
I think

308
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:24,818
those guys will be pressured if I go.

309
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:25,739
Image if I were there,

310
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,179
how can they talk freely about women

311
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:28,458
and their achievements

312
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:30,138
and complain about their wives?

313
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:32,299
It's not fair to me
if I don't give them an earful.

314
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:33,458
But it's not fair for them, I did.

315
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:34,258
That's boring.

316
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:36,578
Well, whatever.

317
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:37,618
I'm going to meet Yao Yao

318
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:38,779
2.30 p.m. later.

319
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:39,779
Have you got the plan?

320
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,058
Not yet. What about you?

321
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,339
I have some ideas.

322
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:45,299
Good. Tell me on the way.

323
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:45,979
Sure.

324
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:49,818
Have we met each other before?

325
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:52,498
We met at the law firm.

326
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:55,219
I didn't know

327
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,419
you were the lawyer of Cheng & Hui.

328
00:13:57,818 --> 00:13:59,578
Miss Yao, we came here...

329
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:00,419
Mr. Tao, Miss Qin.

330
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:04,058
If you're here to convince me

331
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:05,578
to accept Mr. Yin's request,

332
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:06,739
please save it.

333
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,458
I've already handed in my notice.

334
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:10,779
No matter what,

335
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,578
I won't do this favour for Tianhang.

336
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:16,018
Do you still remember

337
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:16,698
what I told you

338
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:17,618
when we were here last time?

339
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:19,138
Yes.

340
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,938
Last time, I came as the attorney
of the plaintiff.

341
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:23,018
However, I know

342
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:24,818
that you're the only innocent one

343
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,979
in this case,

344
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,739
yet you were forced

345
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:29,458
to take a big loss.

346
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:31,659
Therefore, I asked to you apologise.

347
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,058
Maybe your pride was hurt.

348
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:36,979
But, your rights

349
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,458
were protected, at least.

350
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:41,419
Mr. Tao.

351
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,378
I know you're a kind man.

352
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,498
That's why I agreed to meet with you.

353
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,058
But, I'm stubborn

354
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,299
with what I pursue.

355
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,739
I'll stick to something I think is right

356
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,138
till the end

357
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:53,899
even if something blows up in my face.

358
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:55,979
If you're here

359
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:57,899
as Mr. Yin's lobbyists,

360
00:14:58,219 --> 00:14:59,219
I guess I'm going

361
00:14:59,258 --> 00:15:00,018
to let you down again.

362
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:00,979
I'm sorry.

363
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:02,099
Hold on, Miss Yao.

364
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,258
Do you know Han Huiting?

365
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,258
Female, 27 years old.

366
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:11,578
The former housekeeping manager
of the hotel.

367
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,299
Seven months ago,

368
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:15,578
she was harassed by a VIP guest

369
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,018
yet she received a complaint about that.

370
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:18,698
At that time, you helped her
to file a grievance.

371
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,979
She was switched
to the receptionist after that.

372
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,299
Zhang Yueqing, female, 37 years old,

373
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,419
the former housekeeper manager.

374
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,698
Jin Xiaoyun, female, 42 years old,

375
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:29,498
the former food and beverage manager.

376
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:31,938
Her child just got into senior high
this year.

377
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:35,058
Ke Liang, male, 45 years old,

378
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:36,739
the former security manager.

379
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:38,539
There are many people

380
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:39,578
that you know

381
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:42,419
who are on the next layoff list.

382
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,578
What are you trying to say, Miss Qin?

383
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:47,378
I believe that you're familiar

384
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:49,179
with this layoff list.

385
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,938
It's only the tip of the iceberg

386
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:52,818
of the staffing changes

387
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,219
for last six months.

388
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:57,458
It concerns all departments

389
00:15:57,618 --> 00:15:58,339
except for the finance department.

390
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:02,498
Replacing staff
with a long length of service

391
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:03,818
with younger staff

392
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,698
to save up manpower

393
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,539
by thirty to fifty per cent.

394
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:09,299
The average age of dismissed staff

395
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:10,938
is around forty years old.

396
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:12,219
After being dismissed,

397
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:13,938
they can't look for a job

398
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:15,458
that's compatible with the salary
of their previous job.

399
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:16,979
Besides,

400
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:18,258
they're the entity

401
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,578
that bears the main responsibility
to feed their family.

402
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:23,498
What are you trying to tell me?

403
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:28,739
I know that they have launched a joint
initiative against the higher-ups

404
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:30,938
through the union

405
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:32,779
after they were dismissed,

406
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:35,018
hoping to get support

407
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:36,138
from the middle managers.

408
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:37,258
Miss Yao.

409
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:39,498
You're the minority who made your stance

410
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:41,458
on the initiative.

411
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:44,458
It's out of the question

412
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:45,339
that the company changes their decision

413
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:46,578
because of me.

414
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:49,739
But,

415
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:51,739
it's possible

416
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:53,138
that you can change their destiny.

417
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:56,419
Speaking of Yao Yao,

418
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:57,219
she possesses

419
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:58,578
an intense heroic personality.

420
00:16:58,698 --> 00:16:59,539
Her father passed away
when she was little

421
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:00,859
and her mother was weak.

422
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:01,979
Hence,

423
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:03,698
she was sensible and

424
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:04,738
took good care of others
starting at a young age.

425
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,819
She was very much a tomboy

426
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,899
who was good at fighting
and playing sports.

427
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:11,939
Besides, she was tall.

428
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:12,978
So,

429
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:13,779
she was the little chief

430
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,699
amongst the children.

431
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:17,098
She liked to stand up

432
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:17,819
for those who were bullied.

433
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:19,098
She was a gallant girl.

434
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,579
Where did you

435
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:22,899
get all this information?

436
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:25,018
Exclusive news.

437
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:27,779
That makes sense, then.

438
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:29,738
One's upbringing

439
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:31,098
affects

440
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,498
their behaviour.

441
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:33,618
So,

442
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:34,738
if we only

443
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:36,179
persuade her with interest,

444
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,258
it won't work out.

445
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:39,699
Instead, we should stimulate
her sense of righteousness.

446
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:43,539
Righteousness?

447
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:45,459
I've never heard of this word

448
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:46,539
for a long time.

449
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,659
I supported them

450
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:49,858
when they needed help.

451
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:51,419
But did they show
their sense of righteousness

452
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:52,498
when I needed them?

453
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:54,378
I know

454
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,539
everyone has their own reasons.

455
00:17:58,338 --> 00:17:59,659
Maybe they thought

456
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:01,738
what I did for them
was merely a small deal.

457
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:03,378
However, they have to sacrifice a lot

458
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:04,899
to help me.

459
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:06,179
I understand.

460
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:08,338
But I don't relate to them.

461
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,098
No one is obliged

462
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:11,579
to help others.

463
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:13,059
Just like you lawyers

464
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:14,218
who fight for others' rights

465
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:15,699
because you're paid for it.

466
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:21,539
Therefore,

467
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:23,419
they should solve their own problem.

468
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,018
If their rights are forfeited,

469
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:26,179
they should fight it themselves.

470
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,659
If one gives up on protecting themselves

471
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:30,098
and hoping others

472
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:31,378
to lend them a helping hand,

473
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:33,299
aren't they too naive?

474
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:38,819
I don't think Yao Yao
will change her mind

475
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:39,699
because of her sense of righteousness.

476
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:42,459
She fights her way till now

477
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:44,098
all by herself

478
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:45,338
without depending on others.

479
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:47,258
So, she'll be rigid with her principles.

480
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:48,779
The conflict

481
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:49,819
between Mr. Yin and her

482
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,699
can never have room for reconciliation.

483
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,978
When a leader with
an old-school patriarchal mind

484
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,579
confronts a strong woman with a tough character
like Yao Yao,

485
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:00,899
they're the natural enemies.

486
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:02,659
We can't pin the hopes

487
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,138
only on Yao Yao.

488
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:06,378
It's good if we managed to convince her.

489
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,699
If not,

490
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:08,978
I fear she can't

491
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,258
keep herself out of trouble.

492
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,419
How's the white knight plan

493
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:15,498
going now?

494
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:17,179
Except for Anlyu,

495
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,059
there are two groups

496
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:20,858
are very interested in Tianhang Hotel

497
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:22,498
and sniffing around it.

498
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:24,179
The most potential one

499
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:26,459
will be Nanzhou Group, of all groups.

500
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:30,218
It's said that Mr. Pu of Nanzhou Group

501
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,858
is close to Su Chongfa.

502
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:34,018
They went to the college together

503
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:35,618
and are close friends.

504
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:38,098
If Nanzhou Group

505
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:39,699
and Tianhang collaborate

506
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:41,299
to go against Anlyu who's going to merge
the hotel,

507
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,498
Anlyu is very likely to fail.

508
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:45,699
When will they

509
00:19:45,738 --> 00:19:46,618
reach an agreement?

510
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:47,819
One month, at most.

511
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:49,338
Miss Yao, you only need

512
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:51,179
to cooperate righteously
for one month.

513
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,539
You have to fully cooperate
with Tianhang advertising

514
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:54,899
for one month

515
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:57,098
to create the best condition
for the hotel.

516
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,218
After one month, Miss Yao,

517
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,018
you can resign as you wish.

518
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:01,018
If you don't,

519
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:02,699
we also promise to help

520
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:04,138
the dismissed staff

521
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,098
to obtain a better compensation.

522
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:11,618
Also, we promise to improve the work environment

523
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,539
that's unfriendly to female staff.

524
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,539
Agreeing to do us this favour

525
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,419
falls in your will

526
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:17,699
as well as helping others.

527
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:18,939
Why not?

528
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:25,498
Can you really convince
the higher-ups of Tianhang?

529
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,618
If we couldn't, we wouldn't have come.

530
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,779
Since we've raised this,

531
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:31,218
we'll definitely do it.

532
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,699
It's also a promise I made to you.

533
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:39,939
Why do you help Yao Yao?

534
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,978
For the smooth progress of the case.

535
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:44,819
I'm not born yesterday.

536
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,978
Indeed, Yao Yao is pretty.

537
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:48,498
Not only men like her,

538
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,059
I like her too.

539
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:51,138
That was why she became

540
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,299
Yang Hua's girlfriend.

541
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,498
Don't you think both of you
have something in common?

542
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:57,138
Are you sure?

543
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,138
I mean the quality
you exude extrinsically,

544
00:20:59,179 --> 00:20:59,899
not intrinsically.

545
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:01,699
Both of you are independent

546
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:02,899
and enterprising women.

547
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:03,659
Hold on.

548
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:06,258
I thought 'independent and enterprising'

549
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,378
was a compliment.

550
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:08,939
However,

551
00:21:09,138 --> 00:21:10,138
judging by your tone,

552
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:11,459
I feel like you're teasing me.

553
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,059
Because I reckon women

554
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:15,338
shouldn't possess a tough nature
like you.

555
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:16,779
I dispute that.

556
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:20,539
Everyone can't decide their nature.

557
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,498
If life treats me gently,

558
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,939
I'll treat it back accordingly.

559
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:25,378
But if life tortures me,

560
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,098
I'll definitely give it a big slap
in its face.

561
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:28,618
It shouldn't be bound to gender issues.

562
00:21:28,858 --> 00:21:29,738
Can you fight against life?

563
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,258
What if you fail?

564
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:33,618
I'll just run off.

565
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:34,899
Take a rest

566
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:36,218
when you fail

567
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,138
and gear up for the next battle.

568
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:39,858
Good. You're learning.

569
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:41,539
I'm curious about

570
00:21:41,738 --> 00:21:42,378
something.

571
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:43,338
Shoot it.

572
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:45,579
What's so special

573
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:46,939
about the property of Tianhang Group?

574
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:48,618
Why do so many people

575
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:49,738
fight for it?

576
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:51,579
Have you heard about the smart city?

577
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:52,579
No idea.

578
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,899
They're planning to create

579
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:56,779
the biggest new energy supply
in the world,

580
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:57,858
New Energy Smart City.

581
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:00,059
It's the prototype of the future city

582
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,819
with the mass adoption of robots,

583
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:02,419
augmented reality,

584
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:03,258
and visual reality technology.

585
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:05,498
Besides, many enterprises

586
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:07,138
and high-calibre elites will join it.

587
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:09,338
Four hotels under Tianhang Group

588
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:10,659
is located within this area.

589
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:12,699
They have a pretty much
promising future.

590
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:14,899
Plus, Hu Ping has a hand in it.

591
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,138
Is this confirmed?

592
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:17,618
It's still speculation at the moment.

593
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:18,659
But once the project is announced,

594
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:21,059
Tianhang's shares will be doubled.

595
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:22,258
Are you done?

596
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:23,018
It makes sense to me.

597
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:23,858
Problem cleared?

598
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:24,978
Thank you for your lecture.

599
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:28,258
Are you not going
to the reunion gathering?

600
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:30,138
It's weird

601
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,059
if I go with you.

602
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:32,978
Today,

603
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:34,618
I have an important plan.

604
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:35,978
If it wraps up earlier,

605
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:36,939
I'll join you later.

606
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:38,819
Alright.

607
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:40,459
I'll get going.

608
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:41,618
Bye.

609
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:53,819
We're not late, are we?

610
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,539
You're right on the tick.

611
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:57,459
Come on in.

612
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:03,258
Put down your chopsticks.

613
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:03,978
Let's raise our glasses.

614
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:05,419
- Let's raise our glasses.
- Cheers.

615
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:05,978
Cheers.

616
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:06,738
Cheers.

617
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:11,819
Let me have some words.

618
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:12,738
Junhui.

619
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,338
You finally attend the gathering today.

620
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:14,779
That's right.

621
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,378
I'm trying to be fair.

622
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:18,218
You must make up the drink

623
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,659
you've missed previously.

624
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:20,299
Sure.

625
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:20,699
Come on.

626
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,498
I'll drink up.

627
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:22,378
- Come on.
- Sure.

628
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:29,978
Well done. Very good.

629
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:32,899
You're indeed

630
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:34,378
the great boozer you used to be.

631
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:35,378
Excuse me, one more pint, please.

632
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:38,138
How could you just drink one pint?

633
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:39,419
You're our leader.

634
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,218
Well, I'll take another pint.

635
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:41,779
Of course, you will.

636
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:42,699
You ought to.

637
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,539
Let's just nurse the drink.

638
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,138
I'm having a reunion gathering tonight.

639
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:47,899
Do you want to come?

640
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:49,899
I can show you around my college.

641
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:50,459
Finish it.

642
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:51,939
Hey,

643
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:53,138
don't wink at me.

644
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:55,138
What are you doing recently?

645
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,459
I'm running a small business.

646
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:58,059
Pretty good.

647
00:23:58,378 --> 00:23:59,258
The business makes a little profit.

648
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,858
It's been eight years
since we last met, right?

649
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,659
Is it that long?

650
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:05,018
Yes, kind of.

651
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:08,459
Don't force yourself

652
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,819
if you feel unwell.

653
00:24:13,338 --> 00:24:13,858
Did you realise

654
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,018
that they are all partners of the firm

655
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,258
except for me?

656
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:17,819
There must be a big announcement later.

657
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:19,779
Alright, you may leave now.

658
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:22,419
Please have a seat.

659
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,179
Sure.

660
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:28,738
Before the dinner starts,

661
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:31,018
I'd like to announce

662
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,978
some good news.

663
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:35,539
Today's a special day

664
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:37,419
for Cheng & Hui.

665
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:40,258
First of all,

666
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:42,699
Mr. Hu has agreed

667
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,218
to invest 300 million

668
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:45,858
in our firm.

669
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,539
The first fund of 35 million

670
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,018
will be on board soon.

671
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:50,978
The funding will be used

672
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,858
in the firm expansion in Asia-Pacific

673
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:54,819
like Japan, Korea

674
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:55,858
and Singapore.

675
00:24:57,618 --> 00:24:58,819
Second,

676
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,258
Cheng & Hui is selected as

677
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,618
one of the Top 10 National Law Firms.

678
00:25:03,338 --> 00:25:05,258
Both Chen and Ma are listed

679
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,419
in the Top 100 National Lawyers.

680
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:09,539
Therefore, attorneys in our firm

681
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:11,059
who granted a barrister

682
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,618
have increased to six.

683
00:25:14,618 --> 00:25:15,579
You must buy us a meal.

684
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:16,539
Of course.

685
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:18,498
Choose any restaurant you want.

686
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:19,539
Eat to your heart's content, Madam Tang.

687
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:21,299
- Sure.
- I'll fulfil your request.

688
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:23,779
The third good news.

689
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:27,939
I'm kind of thrilled.

690
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,939
Let me present to you

691
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:35,059
the youngest partner ever

692
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,779
of Cheng & Hui Law Firm,

693
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,338
Attorney Qin, Qin Shi.

694
00:25:51,378 --> 00:25:51,978
I...

695
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:54,858
I'm really indebted to you

696
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,098
who have been looking out for me.

697
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:02,299
I...now...

698
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:05,419
I have no idea what to say.

699
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:06,899
Anyway, thank you so much.

700
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:11,659
You finished the wine?

701
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:13,018
Well done.

702
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,138
Good.

703
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,419
I'll make it short.

704
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,699
Cheng & Hui is able to come this far

705
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,138
because every one of you

706
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,498
who put in so much effort.

707
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:38,338
No doubt everyone here

708
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,819
is the core of Cheng & Hui.

709
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:41,459
As the old saying goes,

710
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,738
refining oneself and governing
the states to lead the world to peace.

711
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:45,899
Though I'm not as ambitious as such,

712
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,218
however, it's my pleasure

713
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:52,258
to pursue the future
with you all.

714
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:53,018
Let's raise our glasses.

715
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:06,738
Congrats.

716
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:11,338
Yang Hua, I feel like
I'm dreaming.

717
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:12,939
No, you don't.

718
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,378
This is what you deserve.

719
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:16,618
Thank you.

720
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:18,738
Because of you,

721
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,699
I manage to come this far.

722
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:23,378
It's not because of me.

723
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,098
You did it by yourself.

724
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:25,539
You can come this far

725
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:26,899
even without anyone's support.

726
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:28,579
Thank you.

727
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:45,618
Back in our days...

728
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:55,098
Who are you thinking about?

729
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:57,338
I'm thinking about you.

730
00:27:58,699 --> 00:27:59,338
Me?

731
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:00,299
I'm right before you.

732
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:01,738
I've been observing you

733
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:03,018
since we were eating.

734
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:05,179
It seems something distracted you.

735
00:28:07,338 --> 00:28:08,419
Were you thinking about Qin Shi?

736
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:13,338
Nonsense. The chapter is closed.

737
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:17,819
We've been friends for years.

738
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:20,378
We're close, aren't we?

739
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:22,699
Just cut to the chase.

740
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:25,018
Fine. Let me ask you this.

741
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:27,618
Why did you break up?

742
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,018
I'm really curious about this.

743
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:32,858
Back then, you were a legend

744
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,899
in the campus.

745
00:28:35,498 --> 00:28:36,138
Every one of us

746
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,299
even prepared the red packet
for your wedding,

747
00:28:38,738 --> 00:28:39,659
yet you break up unannounced.

748
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:44,738
You have let us down.

749
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,258
We really find it hard to believe.

750
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:52,779
Let bygones be bygones.

751
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:57,098
I'm going to get to the bottom of it today.

752
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:57,858
I think

753
00:28:58,098 --> 00:28:58,819
I saved Qin Shi's number...

754
00:28:59,018 --> 00:29:00,059
Stop it.

755
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:04,858
Look, you're serious about this.

756
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:07,978
Guys,

757
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:09,258
do you have

758
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:10,098
Qin Shi's number?

759
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:11,618
Our leader is missing her.

760
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:12,419
Ask her to come right now.

761
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:13,699
Don't listen to him.

762
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:14,498
Do you have it?

763
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:15,579
Do you?

764
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:18,779
Isn't that Qin Shi?

765
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:20,338
Seriously?

766
00:29:20,618 --> 00:29:21,498
Are you sure?

767
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:23,258
Stop playing a fool.

768
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:24,218
You...

769
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:25,459
Call her in.

770
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:26,858
Our leader is going down.

771
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:32,179
The Best Debator,

772
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:33,659
You can come a little later if you want.

773
00:29:42,338 --> 00:29:43,138
Feifei.

774
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:45,179
Why are you here?

775
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:52,579
Feifei.

776
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:54,738
Hear me out, Feifei.

777
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:57,098
What do you want to explain?

778
00:29:58,618 --> 00:29:59,299
You've misunderstood this.

779
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:00,258
I misunderstood?

780
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:01,498
What are you going to say to me

781
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:02,299
apart from your lies?

782
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:04,098
Huh?

783
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:09,459
Tao Junhui.

784
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,258
I can't accept my boyfriend

785
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:13,779
still loves another woman deep inside.

786
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,059
If you still love Qin Shi,

787
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:19,258
just go ahead.

788
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:22,579
Nonsense.

789
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:28,059
Qin Shi's married.

790
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:32,378
The reason why you don't to her

791
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:33,699
is because she's married.

792
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:34,179
Am I right?

793
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:35,618
Well,

794
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:36,738
I have good news for you.

795
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:39,779
The marriage between Yang Hua and her
is a sham.

796
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:42,539
They'll divorce each other at any time.

797
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:46,258
When did you know
about their sham marriage?

798
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:49,819
What a good question.

799
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,258
Tell me then. Why did you find out this?

800
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:02,579
I'll make the decision

801
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:06,299
that both of you can't.

802
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,779
Let's see how Madam Tang will respond

803
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:10,819
after she learns the truth.

804
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:11,579
Feifei.

805
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,218
Feifei, please hear me out. Feifei.

806
00:31:45,498 --> 00:31:46,299
Pinch me.

807
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:47,258
Pinch me now.

808
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,098
Pinch me, Yang Hua.

809
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:51,978
This is real, not a dream.

810
00:31:59,498 --> 00:32:00,539
I made it.

811
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:02,338
I did it.

812
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:10,738
I'm thinking

813
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:12,699
to tell Mr. Jin the truth later.

814
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:14,018
Have you made up your mind?

815
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:14,978
Yes.

816
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:20,699
No, I don't.

817
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:25,138
Let me share with you
what I thought.

818
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:27,459
I can see

819
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:28,858
that both Mr. Jin and Madam Tang

820
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:29,699
are in good mood today.

821
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:30,579
Besides,

822
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:31,338
Cheng & Hui

823
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:32,819
is going to expand the business soon

824
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,699
and they're in high demand of talents.

825
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:36,899
Therefore, this is the best moment
to confess.

826
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:39,299
Even if they're furious at you

827
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:40,618
for the lies and deceits,

828
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:41,939
there's a high probability

829
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:43,138
that they forgive and accept you

830
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:44,618
considering the big picture.

831
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:46,738
What if they can't accept this?

832
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:51,939
Once someone determined

833
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:53,098
that they're doing the right things,

834
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:55,098
a great power will emerge from their heart.

835
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:56,738
If you're scared now,

836
00:32:57,138 --> 00:32:58,059
ask yourself

837
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:00,659
if you're doing to right things.

838
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:03,819
Get home safely.

839
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:20,779
They've left.

840
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:29,659
Hello.

841
00:33:30,738 --> 00:33:31,579
(Qin Shi, listen to me.)

842
00:33:31,978 --> 00:33:33,858
(Don't admit about your sham marriage.)

843
00:33:34,098 --> 00:33:35,539
(Don't tell anyone)

844
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:37,699
(even if they lay the evidence before you.)

845
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:47,179
Let's go. We go home now.

846
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:49,018
Are we leaving now?

847
00:33:49,218 --> 00:33:49,738
Yes.

848
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:51,779
I'm sorry

849
00:33:51,978 --> 00:33:53,138
to keep you waiting.

850
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:54,939
I just saw Ma and Chen out.

851
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:58,618
We shall take our leave too.

852
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:00,539
Are you leaving?

853
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:02,419
We have something important to do.

854
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:03,459
Where are you going?

855
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,018
What about this?

856
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:07,858
Qin Shi, you go with Jin
for that important matter.

857
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:09,098
I'll take care of him.

858
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:13,818
Why?

859
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,219
What are you worried about?

860
00:34:16,979 --> 00:34:18,179
I won't bite him.

861
00:34:18,818 --> 00:34:19,338
Come with me.

862
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:27,338
Have a seat.

863
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:29,739
Do you want any drinks?

864
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:31,378
I have whiskey.

865
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:37,098
It's fine.

866
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:38,899
I drank a lot

867
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:40,138
just now.

868
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,899
This is the partnership agreement.

869
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:52,338
It's written with your rights and obligations

870
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:53,979
as a partner.

871
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,419
I've highlighted several key contents for you.

872
00:34:58,338 --> 00:34:59,419
Including the property share,

873
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:00,419
confidentiality agreement,

874
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,098
fidelity agreement and so on.

875
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:05,098
You have to hand in 500,000 yuan

876
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:06,179
of capital contribution

877
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:07,298
within seven working days

878
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:09,499
after the agreement is in effect.

879
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:10,338
Do you have any problem with this?

880
00:35:12,298 --> 00:35:12,939
No.

881
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:15,739
I can feel my energy drains

882
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,538
as I get older.

883
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:20,459
I have to count on you youngsters.

884
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:22,058
Please don't say that.

885
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:24,058
Women start to bloom in their forties.

886
00:35:25,298 --> 00:35:26,499
I like this.

887
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,538
I'm nearing fifty now.

888
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:31,459
Excuse me.

889
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:33,298
Bring the leftover ham to me.

890
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:34,858
I want it.

891
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:35,858
Sure.

892
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:42,659
Yang Hua.

893
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:45,979
You've picked up some bad habits
from Qin Shi.

894
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,739
Just leave it here.

895
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:53,019
Yang Hua.

896
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,778
I'd like to ask you something

897
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:58,259
about investing.

898
00:35:58,459 --> 00:35:59,419
You flattered me.

899
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,138
But, I'm not well-versed

900
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:02,138
in all kinds of investment.

901
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:04,699
Don't be so humble.

902
00:36:05,618 --> 00:36:06,778
Well.

903
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:09,138
I always think highly

904
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:10,778
about my friend's career.

905
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:15,459
She is capable and talented.

906
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:18,259
Besides, she runs the company very well.

907
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:21,578
However,

908
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:24,058
I only got to know that my friend

909
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:26,979
is a liar.

910
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:31,899
Liar?

911
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,019
Well, she didn't cheat others

912
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:38,058
out of money.

913
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:40,219
It's just that she hid

914
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:42,298
her condition from others.

915
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:48,618
For example?

916
00:36:49,259 --> 00:36:52,298
For example,
her educational background, resume,

917
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:55,019
and also the relationships with the higher-ups.

918
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:57,538
She lied about all of them

919
00:36:58,298 --> 00:36:59,259
including her marital status

920
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:00,179
which's fake too.

921
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:05,378
Yang Hua.

922
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:08,098
Should I continue the business

923
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:09,939
with her?

924
00:37:18,818 --> 00:37:20,378
Do I sign it now?

925
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:23,419
No rush.

926
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:29,778
You've been working

927
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:30,778
in Cheng & Hui for years

928
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:33,338
and we see the effort you made.

929
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:36,338
Previously, you and your husband

930
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:37,538
used to live separately.

931
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:39,659
I'm really happy

932
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:42,979
that Yang Hua supports you so much.

933
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:47,019
The thing is,
after you become the partner,

934
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:49,419
you'll be more tied up than you're now.

935
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:51,019
As a working woman,

936
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:52,499
you have to make an extreme effort

937
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:54,259
as compared to male lawyers.

938
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:56,578
Are you prepared for that?

939
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:02,058
The first day I came

940
00:38:02,098 --> 00:38:02,939
to Cheng & Hui,

941
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,259
I've already prepared for it.

942
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:10,419
I have an important question.

943
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:13,818
It's about your child.

944
00:38:18,578 --> 00:38:20,019
What's wrong with that?

945
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:21,659
As you know,

946
00:38:22,578 --> 00:38:23,259
Cheng & Hui

947
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:24,378
was a firm run by a married couple
at first.

948
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:27,858
Yihui is a great lawyer.

949
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:29,578
Before we turned thirty-five,

950
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,538
we insisted on not having children

951
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:34,459
like Ms. Bian.

952
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:37,179
The situation broke
until Yihui got sick.

953
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:39,098
The doctor told her

954
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:41,179
that she might be barren.

955
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,019
You know well about Yihui.

956
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:46,138
She has a tough character.

957
00:38:46,578 --> 00:38:47,899
It's different

958
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:48,739
between the choices
of not having children

959
00:38:48,939 --> 00:38:50,899
and can't have children.

960
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,739
Therefore, we've been through a lot

961
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:56,979
and finally, we have two children.

962
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:02,499
Yihui has told a bit on this.

963
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:03,939
However, she didn't tell you

964
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:06,259
that we almost got divorced

965
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:07,818
in the first year
when the baby was born.

966
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:12,499
At that time,

967
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:14,338
Yihui failed to adapt to the identity

968
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:17,219
of being a lawyer and a mother
simultaneously.

969
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:20,138
When she was meeting the clients,

970
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,899
she felt that she was a terrible mother

971
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:25,818
and when she was taking care
of the children,

972
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:29,098
she felt that she was a terrible lawyer.

973
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,259
Lastly, she was forced to choose
only one.

974
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:34,899
I see

975
00:39:35,618 --> 00:39:37,259
the perseverance and bravery of a woman

976
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,979
and a great mother from her.

977
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:42,858
At the same time, I realised

978
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,298
when women have to choose between

979
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,058
children and career,

980
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:49,659
only very few women
would choose the latter.

981
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:55,899
Therefore, I hope

982
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:57,058
you can consider well

983
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:01,538
about your choice

984
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:03,499
between a mother or a lawyer

985
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:05,858
and whether are you able to bear

986
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,138
the consequence of your choice.

987
00:40:11,818 --> 00:40:12,618
In my opinion...

988
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:17,818
The decision depends on the reason

989
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:20,019
why did your friend lie.

990
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:22,538
Did she lie about

991
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:24,419
the requirements
that led to her professional success?

992
00:40:24,618 --> 00:40:25,179
For example,

993
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:27,739
she works in a profession

994
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:29,778
that requires certain qualifications,

995
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:31,858
which she doesn't have. So, she faked it

996
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:34,259
and won a good deal.

997
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:35,618
If so, then good business

998
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:36,338
is just an illusion.

999
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:38,098
However,

1000
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:41,058
if she lied just to avoid

1001
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:43,419
from paying a high social cost

1002
00:40:43,578 --> 00:40:44,659
and cost of trust

1003
00:40:45,298 --> 00:40:46,019
and yet her career

1004
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:47,219
doesn't benefit from it,

1005
00:40:47,618 --> 00:40:48,459
I suppose

1006
00:40:48,538 --> 00:40:49,739
you can continue the collaboration
with her.

1007
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:58,058
I share the same thought as yours.

1008
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:00,378
Yang Hua, I found
that we share something

1009
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:01,338
in common.

1010
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:02,659
Think about this.

1011
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,818
You deal with money as your work

1012
00:41:05,138 --> 00:41:07,219
while I deal with laws.

1013
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:09,578
We both

1014
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:11,058
need to be conserved and discreet.

1015
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:13,019
Actually, it's difficult for others

1016
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:14,778
to earn our trust.

1017
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:16,298
You make judgements
with the data support.

1018
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:19,338
While I make judgements
relying on evidence.

1019
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:23,899
What kind of evidence do you mean?

1020
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:27,338
I told my friend

1021
00:41:27,578 --> 00:41:28,538
that I wanted to collaborate with her

1022
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:29,419
on a big project.

1023
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:31,219
I'd invest in her company

1024
00:41:32,058 --> 00:41:33,378
on some conditions.

1025
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:34,778
I've written all my requirements

1026
00:41:34,979 --> 00:41:35,979
and intentions

1027
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:37,858
in black and white.

1028
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:38,778
Of course, she doesn't fit

1029
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:40,179
any of the attributes.

1030
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:41,899
And she's been keeping it from me.

1031
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:49,459
Mr. Jin.

1032
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:51,578
I've made up my mind.

1033
00:41:52,058 --> 00:41:53,739
I will try my best to balance

1034
00:41:53,899 --> 00:41:55,058
both of them well.

1035
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:57,979
Perhaps I can't be as perfect as Yihui.

1036
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:01,179
Fortunately, Yang Hua backs me up.

1037
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:03,298
He chose the family

1038
00:42:03,858 --> 00:42:06,219
and grant me a chance to choose my career.

1039
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:07,739
I believe

1040
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,219
that both Yang Hua and I

1041
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:12,499
will overcome the problem together

1042
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:13,659
no matter what happens

1043
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:15,298
like Yihui and you do.

1044
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:18,419
Well said.

1045
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:22,699
Does it consider illegal?

1046
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:27,019
Like what you said just now,

1047
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:29,538
the lie she made

1048
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:32,138
doesn't affect her business directly.

1049
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:32,939
She did so

1050
00:42:33,098 --> 00:42:34,138
because she wanted to earn my trust.

1051
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:37,259
However, if she signs the agreement,

1052
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:39,219
it'll be a different story, then.

1053
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,910
(Supplementary Terms
on Partnership's Interests)

1054
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:46,138
This is the benefit solely for you.

1055
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,298
Our company treats everyone with respect

1056
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:51,219
and we don't hope our members
devote themselves to the career

1057
00:42:51,378 --> 00:42:52,378
at the expense of their families.

1058
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,298
Therefore, after discussing with Yihui,

1059
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:57,778
we decided to solely provide

1060
00:42:59,058 --> 00:43:01,058
some subsidies to you
as the benefits of your partnership.
