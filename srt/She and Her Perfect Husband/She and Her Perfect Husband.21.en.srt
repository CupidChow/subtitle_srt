00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,570
Ma,

21
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,650
why isn't the take-out here yet?

22
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,010
Do they want to quit their jobs?

23
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,490
Congratulations, Miss Qin.

24
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,450
You finally found your way of life
at the 11th floor.

25
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,730
You taught me well.

26
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,810
Do you have time the day after tomorrow?

27
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,130
Is there any event?

28
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,370
I want you to accompany me

29
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,970
to a client's new store
opening ceremony.

30
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,530
I can't make it.

31
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,370
You even put on airs in front of me.

32
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,490
I don't.

33
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,810
I've got a wedding to attend that day.

34
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,170
A wedding? Is it that important?

35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,530
It's quite important.

36
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,770
I must be there.

37
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,050
Alright, then.

38
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,890
(It's very simple already.)

39
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,650
(At least the parents)

40
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,770
(have to go on stage
and give speech.)

41
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:51,890
It's not necessary.

42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,250
(Then, the parents should go on stage)

43
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,250
(and give you wedding gifts.)

44
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,090
It's not necessary.

45
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,850
(Fine, let me ask you this.)

46
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,210
Shouldn't you two

47
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,570
cut a wedding cake

48
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,650
and exchange wedding rings

49
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,730
and have a lovers' shot?

50
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,690
We can exchange the wedding rings.

51
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,410
Let's avoid the rest.

52
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,170
What about the prize drawing?

53
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,530
I'm the person who gets married.
Why would others hold a prize drawing?

54
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,930
No, my friend,

55
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,490
you don't want everything.

56
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:11,970
You tell me.

57
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,090
What exactly do you want?

58
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,850
We can't let the guests just come and eat.

59
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,530
(Are you holding a wedding or a gathering?)

60
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,690
Let me tell you this.

61
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,170
Getting married is
an once-in-a-lifetime event.

62
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,690
It's good enough for me to be able to attend

63
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,650
the wedding in person.

64
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,810
Stop asking so much from me.

65
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,730
Fine, as the last

66
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,410
friendly reminder,

67
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,690
you must use
waterproof mascara on the wedding day.

68
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:32,770
Why?

69
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,090
You as the bride will cry for sure.

70
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,890
I'm sure I won't, thank you.

71
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,330
Fine.

72
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,690
You're so stubborn.

73
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,250
What's wrong?

74
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,850
(I know.)

75
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,090
(There's no)

76
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,570
(unbreakable promise in the world.)

77
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,890
(Marriage is just one of them.)

78
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,930
(Growing old together)

79
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,050
(is a misunderstanding.)

80
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,610
(Many marriages have turned)

81
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,970
(from the most sincere promises)

82
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,010
(into the palest lies.)

83
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,010
(And I've never thought)

84
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,450
(that my own marriage)

85
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,450
(would start from a lie.)

86
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,530
(Yet, it becomes unbelievably real.)

87
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,250
Qin,

88
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,530
move forward, you haven't reached there.

89
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,490
Move.

90
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,170
We're not yet there, Shi.

91
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,090
Let's go.

92
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:52,810
Are you alright?

93
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,610
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

94
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,850
Dad, leave the rest to us.

95
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,770
Sure.

96
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,410
Look at me.

97
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,730
Very well.

98
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,690
Take a deep breath.

99
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,490
Relax.

100
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,170
Are you feeling better?

101
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,290
Come.

102
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,210
Let's go.

103
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,010
Don't worry, I'm with you.

104
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,050
You have nothing to be afraid of.

105
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,290
There's nothing to worry about.

We still want to drink.

128
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,850
- Enough, stop drinking.
- Drink.

129
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,370
We're home.

130
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,490
You've drunk too much.

131
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,130
I've drunk too much.

132
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,570
Come.

133
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,570
We're home?

134
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,450
Yes, we are.

135
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,330
Aren't they proposing a toast to me?

136
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,290
I want to drink more.

137
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,210
We're already home,
all of them have left.

138
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,770
All of them have left? We're home?

139
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,730
Are you happy today?

140
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,530
I'm excited as well.

141
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,890
I didn't cry at all.

142
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,730
Getting married is a happy event.

143
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,770
Why would I cry? Don't you think?

144
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,810
Do you want

145
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,970
something more exciting?

146
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,450
The wedding money is
59,000 yuan in total.

147
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,890
Your parents gave us 50,000 yuan.

148
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,130
My parents gave us 60,000 yuan.

149
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,090
My mom said she received

150
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,090
20,000 yuan from her family.

151
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,010
She'll give it to us.

152
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,170
At a result,

153
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,330
we've covered the cost,

154
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,690
we even make money out of it.

155
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,370
What are you going to do with the money?

156
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,930
I think you look so charming

157
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,810
while counting money.

158
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,650
I think we should find a chance

159
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,170
to give this money back to your parents.

160
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,050
Also, have your parents

161
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,290
spent any more money?

162
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,290
They did.

163
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:34,690
Here.

164
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,610
It's the love my mom gave me.

165
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,650
I think

166
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,890
I'll clean this up tomorrow.

167
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,730
You get some rest.

168
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:56,970
Good night.

169
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,530
Good night.

170
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,250
Just leave it here.

171
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:00,690
Good night.

172
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,650
(Shi,)

173
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,130
(as you could find this note,)

174
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,770
(it means)

175
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,770
(you're organising)

176
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,170
(the dowry I give you.)

177
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,970
(I'd like to tell you)

178
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,890
(that since the moment)

179
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,090
(you came to me,)

180
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,290
(I've found
that I'm the luckiest person)

181
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,810
(in the world.)

182
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,290
(I'd like to thank you)

183
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,970
(for staying by my side all along)

184
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,170
(and bringing me)

185
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,450
(a lot of pleasure moments.)

186
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,690
(My daughter is getting married today.)

187
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,090
(Seeing you wearing a wedding dress)

188
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,290
(and holding the flowers,)

189
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,690
(I'm really happy for you)

190
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,330
(and it's reassuring.)

191
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,050
(After all this time,)

192
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,730
(I only realise)

193
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,210
(that my marriage has brought you)

194
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,970
(great harm.)

195
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,610
(Your dad and I have done you wrong.)

196
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,770
(That we didn't take good care of you)

197
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,330
(and protect you.)

198
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,410
(Making you suffer a lot.)

199
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,290
(I feel so sorry for you.)

200
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,770
(All those years during my marriage
with your dad,)

201
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,210
(I was jobless)

202
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,690
(and I got no income.)

203
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,970
(This time, I worked)

204
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,650
(as an hourly worker)

205
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,930
(and earned some money.)

206
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,490
(This is the only dowry
I can get for you.)

207
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,410
(This is my token of appreciation.)

208
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,130
(Now that my daughter)

209
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,250
(has her own family.)

210
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,090
(I hope you could be happy.)

211
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,290
(Rest assured.)

212
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,050
(You don't have to worry about me.)

213
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,850
(I'll take care of myself.)

214
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,250
(And I'll find a way)

215
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,730
(to stop our family)

216
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,730
(from influencing your life.)

217
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,050
(Bear this in mind.)

218
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,130
(I'll always love you.)

219
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:29,690
What's wrong?

220
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,290
What's the matter?

221
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,090
There, there.

222
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:47,930
Don't cry.

223
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,890
You're awake.

224
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,050
Hmm.

225
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,970
I'll go clean myself up.

226
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,250
You want to sell the house?

227
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,010
We're well-settled here.

228
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,010
Why do you want to sell it?

229
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,010
You're well-settled here.

230
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,450
But I'm not.

231
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,410
I didn't mention this before

232
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,130
because I didn't want to make

233
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,170
things hard for the kids.

234
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,970
And I didn't have the money for that.

235
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,450
Actually,

236
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,850
I don't have

237
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,490
high demands for the house.

238
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,370
Like the size,

239
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,090
the location,

240
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,090
the renovation, they don't matter to me.

241
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,810
I only have two requests.

242
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,450
First, be closer to Shi.

243
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,690
Second, move away from the person

244
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,770
who stays upstairs.

245
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,810
Hu Xiaomei,

246
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,210
you've been so full of yourself lately.

247
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,450
Do you feel like

248
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,490
you can fly now?

249
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,770
Where are you going?

250
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:49,970
Going to work.

251
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,330
Didn't we have a deal?

252
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,290
After Shi gets married,

253
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,050
you'll stop working.

254
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,450
Back then, I worked

255
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,850
to buy my daughter a dowry.

256
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,050
But now, I work

257
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,850
for the sake of my dignity.

258
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,490
Okay, well, let's not go to work.

259
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,010
For your record,

260
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,650
twelve o'clock at noon,

261
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,090
I'll wait for you at the agency

262
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,650
at the neighbourhood entryway.

263
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,690
Are you for real?

264
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,530
Just go there yourself, I won't go.

265
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,090
I'll wait until one o'clock.

266
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,450
If you don't show up,

267
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,410
let's get divorced.

268
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,730
You...

269
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,530
You always threaten me with this.

270
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:33,970
Divorce?

271
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,970
Last night...

272
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,650
I'll take responsibility

273
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,770
for what happened
last night.

274
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,330
Nothing happened last night, right?

275
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:00,970
It did happen.

276
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,450
What happened last night

277
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,530
is very important to me.

278
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:07,970
I don't know

279
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,290
what it means to you.

280
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,090
But as a man,

281
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,490
I must be honest about how I feel.

282
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,330
Actually, it's alright.

283
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,130
We were quite tired last night

284
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,490
and we were drunk.

285
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,970
We can do better

286
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,330
in future if there's a chance.

287
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,210
Miss Qin, I like you.

288
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,810
I like you too.

289
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,090
I mean

290
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,450
the feelings of a man towards a woman.

291
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,250
Will you let me

292
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,210
be your boyfriend?

293
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,290
You...

294
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,130
You said

295
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,410
you like me?

296
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,730
Are you sure

297
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,930
this is not

298
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,610
because you've sobered up?

299
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,530
I'm sure of it.

300
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,410
Are you really sure...

301
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,490
Do you feel it now?

302
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,650
I might need to confirm it.

Hua,

oyster steamed egg.

328
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,900
And we'll have

329
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,220
sea cucumber porridge later.

I'll wrap up the food for her.

335
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,460
- You eat first.
- You just got married.

336
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
Why is she so busy?

337
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,100
Didn't Qin take marriage leave?

339
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,100
your honeymoon?

340
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,020
Have you thought about it?

341
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,860
There's no honeymoon.

342
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,260
She can't leave

343
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,140
as she's busy.

344
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,100
No matter how busy she is,

345
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,540
you must go on a honeymoon.

346
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,180
Yes.

347
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,220
Go to somewhere near the sea.

348
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,740
You can enjoy sunbath during the days.

349
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,060
And you can listen to the wave at night.

350
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,260
Spend a week

351
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,500
and work hard.

352
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,140
Maybe she'll get pregnant
when she comes back.

353
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,460
What do you mean?

354
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,620
Don't tell me you didn't plan for this.

355
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,580
Now that you've gotten married.

356
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,100
Next, they'll ask us to have baby.

357
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,660
If we encounter this problem,

358
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,260
what will you answer them?

359
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,660
We just got married.

360
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,740
So we haven't planned for it yet.

361
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,980
Wrong answer.

362
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,860
Based on your mom's personality,

363
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,260
this answer of yours

364
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,780
will lead to an unending
subsequent affair.

365
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
So the correct answer is...

366
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,580
Mom, actually, about this,

367
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,820
Qin Shi and I

368
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,940
already have an arrangement.

369
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:10,860
Qin Shi

370
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,220
also thinks that she's getting old.

371
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,780
So we want to have a kid
as soon as possible.

372
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,580
See, I told you.

373
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,740
They'll have a plan for it.

374
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,780
Stop rushing them.

375
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,300
It's good

376
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,260
that Qin is willing to bear a child.

377
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,380
I'm just worried that she's busy and ambitious.

378
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,660
In the principle
of better child-bearing and upbringing,

379
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,380
Qin Shi and I have started

380
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,500
to tone our bodies and adjust our lifestyles.

381
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,300
We've started to take

382
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,700
the supplement like DHA and folic acid.

383
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,460
Just to give birth

384
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,140
to a smart and healthy baby.

385
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,140
- Good.
- Yes.

386
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,100
That's right, it's important.

387
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,780
Come, eat it now.

388
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,380
Nourish your body now.

389
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,180
This is good.

390
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,180
The ingredients are fresh.

391
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,100
Eat more.

392
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,540
It takes time to tone the body.

393
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,780
It'll take at least six months,
a year at most.

394
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,860
By then,

395
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,300
comparing to our parents,

396
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,260
we'll surely be more upset, motivated

397
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,700
and determined.

398
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,660
If we still can't get
pregnant at that time,

399
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,500
they'll console us instead.

400
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,910
(ANDY HOUSE)

401
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,790
(ANDY HOUSE)

402
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,820
Why are you here, Shi?

403
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,780
Why do you come back?

404
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,100
You're here alone?

405
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,820
Where is Yang Hua?

406
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,900
What's the matter?

407
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,340
Did you two have a fight?

408
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,740
You just got married.

409
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,020
- Well...
- Mom.

410
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,500
What's going on?

411
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,620
Tell me about it.

412
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,860
I'm worried sick, Shi.

413
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,700
Shi.

414
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,700
There, there.

415
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,140
A bowl of shrimp dumplings.

416
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,300
A bowl of capsella dumplings.

417
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,780
Why are you

418
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,740
being so clingy?

419
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,780
Are you going to eat

420
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,980
in this position later?

421
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Yes, I am.

422
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,980
Silly girl, how can you eat like this?

423
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,580
Mom,

424
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,700
I love you.

425
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,620
Shi,

426
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,460
be honest with me.

427
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,540
Are you in troubles?

428
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,260
Then, your dad came up
with this strange trick

429
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,020
and asked you to do this to scare me?

430
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,820
Mom.

431
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,340
From now on, I'll listen

432
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,540
to everything you say.

433
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,460
I'll support your decision.

434
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,620
Unconditionally.

435
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,660
Really?

436
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,740
Well, then.

437
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,700
I want to sell the house.

438
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,540
Go ahead.

439
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,780
Aren't you going to ask me why?

440
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,060
I'll unconditionally support you.

441
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,220
Have you grown a conscience

442
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,260
and wanted to be a nice daughter?

443
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,140
What if your dad doesn't agree

444
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,300
to it?

445
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,460
I'll cut ties with him.

446
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,740
Nonsense.

447
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,500
Your dad didn't do you wrong.

448
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,220
What are you going to do then?

449
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,620
I'll divorce your dad.

450
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,660
Shi,

451
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
if I really divorce

452
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,100
your dad,

453
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,380
what will you do?

454
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,900
I'll follow you

455
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,100
and be a dead weight.

456
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,340
You're a traitor.

457
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,300
Let me finish.

458
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,540
As my mom wants to sell the house,

459
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,620
there's no problem

460
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,580
about her motive, reason
and feasibility.

461
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,620
Tell me the reason

462
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,740
why you're against it.

463
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,380
I'll persuade her if it's reasonable.

464
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,020
(Holder of the certificate: Liu Yan)

465
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,420
Liu Yan's name is

466
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,580
written on the property title.

467
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,500
Look.

468
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,060
This is the divorce agreement
between me and your dad.

469
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,260
When we got divorced,

470
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,820
your dad wanted nothing and left.

471
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,500
There's one thing.

472
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,780
I'm sure he didn't tell you this.

473
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm the owner of the unit

474
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,380
downstairs where you're staying now.

475
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,020
Only my name is written

476
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,180
on the property title.

477
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,900
When we first got divorced,

478
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,260
your dad didn't get to find

479
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,260
a place to stay.

480
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,020
But, we were once husband and wife.

481
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,300
I can't be so cruel

482
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,500
and left him homeless.

483
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,660
So I let him stay there

484
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,860
until now.

485
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,660
It's not that I didn't want
to move out from here.

486
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,340
I wanted to wait until I make

487
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,060
enough money to buy a house.

488
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,260
Yet...

489
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:57,860
Yet...

490
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,740
Yet,

491
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,820
their troupe didn't have

492
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,620
much shows to perform.

493
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,460
It was highly cost-ineffective.

494
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,140
How could your dad

495
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,500
afford to pay the members

496
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,580
with his little salary?

497
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,940
Then, he did make some money.

498
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:12,940
But your dad

499
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,140
lent it to a good friend of his.

500
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,060
He said he was going
to venture into business

501
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,620
and make your dad the shareholder.

502
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,580
Your dad is thin-skinned.

503
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,980
So he lent it to him.

504
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,780
Guess what happened next?

505
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,700
He lost it all?

506
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,460
Take another guess.

507
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,300
Did he make money from it?

508
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,060
The good friend of his

509
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,260
owed the bank a great debt.

510
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,780
He couldn't pay it and ran away.

511
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,420
Your dad was the shareholder

512
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,500
so he bore joint liability.

513
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,020
He got to pay all the debt.

514
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,300
All these years,

515
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,300
you've been paying

516
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,300
the debt with the monthly allowances

517
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,660
my brothers

518
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,220
and I gave you?

519
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,060
No.

520
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,140
I paid off the debt

521
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,700
when you were in high school.

522
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,900
So you've started to make money
since I was

523
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,620
in high school.

524
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,380
Then, you should have the money

525
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,660
to pay the down payment for a house now.

526
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,420
Your mom and I have retired.

527
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,180
The bank won't issue a loan to us.

528
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,780
It's not enough to have
only the down payments.

529
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,980
When I broke up

530
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,900
with Tao Junhui,

531
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,940
you paid him back
half of the house price.

532
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,020
How did you get the money?

533
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,780
Half of it was my savings.

534
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,180
Another half was borrowed.

535
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,140
From whom?

536
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,900
Of course he borrowed it from me.

537
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,300
Wenbin hadn't gotten the title

538
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,580
of Associate Professor that time.

539
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,140
He only earned a pittance.

540
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,220
That daughter of his

541
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,740
was clamoring for going abroad.

542
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,060
Your dad was eager

543
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,900
so he borrowed money from me.

544
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,900
It's been five years.

545
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,100
There's at least 300,000 yuan for sure.

546
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,420
I've got all the IOUs with me.

547
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,380
I can show them to you
if you don't believe me.

548
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,020
Shi.

549
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,060
Give me a moment.

550
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,660
Does my elder brother know this?

551
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:45,900
What about my second brother?

552
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,260
Okay.

553
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,620
At least

554
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,100
Hu Xiaomei is not the last person

555
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,340
who knows about this.

556
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,660
You can't tell your mom about this.

557
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,500
My mom and you have been married
for over 30 years.

558
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,780
Legally speaking,

559
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,100
she has the right to know

560
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,460
the family debt situation.

561
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,700
If she knew

562
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
her understanding of this family was

563
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,180
worse than your ex-wife,

564
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,060
what would she think?

565
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,780
How sad would she be?

566
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:13,940
I just...

567
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,220
I just don't want to worry her.

568
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,660
For years,

569
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,180
she has suffered a lot because of me.

570
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,740
Yes.

571
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,580
She has suffered a lot.

572
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,860
As she has suffered a lot,

573
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,300
she would've divorced you long ago
if she wanted.

574
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,820
Think about it.

575
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,180
Why has she stayed

576
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,820
with you for years?

577
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,180
Fine, ultimately,

578
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,580
this is between you and Mom.

579
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,140
Both of you should

580
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,580
face it and solve it together.

581
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,860
Just vent your anger out.

582
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,100
Get it all out.

583
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,460
I finally figure out

584
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,980
why your dad has been

585
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,060
so stingy all these years

586
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,380
that he's been reluctant to spend money.

587
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,540
How

588
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,020
much money does

589
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,180
an electric kettle cost?

590
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,700
There's something wrong

591
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,940
with our electric kettle.

592
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,540
He just can't bear

593
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,780
to buy a new one.

594
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,620
And

595
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,620
the door of the huge wardrobe was broken.

596
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,500
I told him about it that day.

597
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,500
Let him find someone to get it fixed.

598
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,820
But he fixed it himself.

599
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,940
Qin, tell me honestly.

600
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,060
How much more do we owe

601
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,460
the person upstairs?

602
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,420
Eighty thousand yuan.

603
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,540
I was going to pay off the debt.

604
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,580
I used it to pay

605
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,020
Shi's wedding money.

606
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,820
I don't want it,
I'll give it back to you.

607
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,460
That's not what I meant.

608
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,500
Shi,

609
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,500
what do you mean by that?

610
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,220
Besides that,

611
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,020
is that all we've got?

612
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,180
I'll tell you the truth.

613
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,300
There's over 300,000 yuan

614
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,100
in the bank savings account.

615
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,860
I was thinking

616
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,380
that I'll die before your mother for sure.

617
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,820
I've got to leave her some money.

618
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,740
What is this?

619
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,420
How did you get
such a large amount of money?

620
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,100
It's the money

621
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,500
I've saved

622
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,380
from here and there all these years.

623
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,460
You're still able

624
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,180
to save nest money under the nose

625
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,860
of a stingy man like my dad.

626
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,820
That's impressive.

627
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,820
Shi,

628
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,820
use the money

629
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,020
to pay off his debt.

630
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,220
This is not enough.

631
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,300
I'll pay it.

632
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,020
I'll pay the rest.

633
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,180
To pay off his debt.

634
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,860
Aren't you mad?

635
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,140
Mad at him?

636
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,180
How could I be mad at him?

637
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,300
He owed her money

638
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,060
for the sake of our family.

639
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,940
He's hidden it from me for years.

640
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,020
That's because
he didn't want to worry me.

641
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,740
When I married your dad,

642
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,660
he promised your grandfather

643
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,020
that he'll be sure to treat me well
for the rest of his life.

644
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,100
That he won't make me worry.

645
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,380
And he won't let me go out
to work and suffer.

646
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,180
He has practised what he preached.

647
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,060
I couldn't get mad at him.

648
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,060
My dear wife,
I'm sorry to make you suffer.

649
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,060
Please accept my apology.

650
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,660
That's enough.

651
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,020
Qin,

652
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,100
I've told you

653
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,220
that I don't ask for a large house

654
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,580
or luxury decoration

655
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,900
or a good location.

656
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,020
It's a home

657
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
as long as you and I are together.

658
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,060
Yes, that's great.

659
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,340
You've cooled off.

660
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
It's all my fault.

661
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,300
I'll apologise.

662
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,060
Then, promise me.

663
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,140
Let's go house-hunting tomorrow.

664
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,100
Hu Xiaomei,

665
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
it looks like you're so stubborn.

666
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,500
I'm almost done here.

667
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,300
What about you?

668
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,020
So am I.

669
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,020
How are you parents doing?

670
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,700
You have no idea

671
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,900
what I've been through, gosh.

672
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,420
(Our house actually)

673
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,620
(doesn't belong to our house.)

674
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,180
We'll talk about it later.

675
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,300
Let's meet up later.

676
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,140
Just move out if you want.

677
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,620
I won't move out.

678
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,500
I'm getting old.

679
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,900
I can't go through
all these troubles anymore.

680
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,180
Qin,

681
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,660
didn't I tell you this?

682
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,500
That it doesn't matter

683
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,580
where we live as long as we're together.

684
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,660
We just can't stay here.

685
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,540
Why not?

686
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,660
I've stayed here for 40 years.

687
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,580
And you've stayed here

688
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,620
for 30-odd years.

689
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,180
(Why can't we stay here?)

690
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,540
(Why can't we live here?)

691
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,900
You were fine just now.

692
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,740
Why do you argue again?

693
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,460
Look.

694
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,780
Shi,

695
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,620
why don't you tell your dad?

696
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,500
That he either moves out with me

697
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,220
or

698
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,380
I'll divorce him.

699
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,380
Here she goes again.

700
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,580
It was fine as I didn't know

701
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,540
(about this back then.)

702
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,420
(Now that you want me)

703
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,460
to live in Liu Yan's house

704
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,820
like an idle person.

705
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,100
I can't do it.

706
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,020
The developer here is

707
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,100
an acquaintance of my dad.

708
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,260
He asks us to pick one.

709
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,180
He'll give us the family discount.

710
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,820
The property is located
in the inner ring.

711
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,700
And it's all in the villa area.

712
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Will it be too expensive?

713
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,500
Don't worry about that.

714
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,740
My dad said he'll give us full support.

715
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,780
Before I came out,

716
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,900
my mom secretly told me that.

717
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,060
But this is our marriage.

718
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,500
Why would we want your parents' support?

719
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,300
Junhui, I know that you're enterprising.

720
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,100
But my parents want

721
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,060
to make things easy for us.

722
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,260
It's no big deal.

723
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,660
Moreover,

724
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,140
I'm the only daughter my dad has.

725
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,660
His money is all mine.

726
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,860
He'll eventually give me the money.

727
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,060
It doesn't make any difference.

728
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,860
Let's go inside and take a look.

729
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,740
Come on.

730
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,380
I like the layout so much.

731
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,500
It's so comfy.

732
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,060
How large is this?

733
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,460
It's 258 square meters.

734
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,820
There are four bedrooms.

735
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,100
How is it? Do you like it?

736
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,580
It's quite nice.

737
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,700
If you pay the deposit today,

738
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,740
we'll give you

739
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,780
a full set of custom furniture.

740
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,460
The layout and the design
of your property

741
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,460
are quite nice.

742
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,540
But we still need to discuss about it.

743
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,500
- Sure.
- Thank you.

744
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,780
You're welcome.

745
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,380
It's quite nice.

746
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,460
Feifei,

747
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,180
this property is too expensive.

748
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,340
We can't afford it.

749
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,060
I know.

750
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,820
Your parents want to help us.

751
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,340
But one should do things in accordance

752
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,540
with one's own capability.

753
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,900
This house is way

754
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,900
out of our league.

755
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,860
Isn't it?

756
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,100
Then, what kind

757
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,420
of house can we afford?

758
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,500
We can stay in a two bedrooms apartment.

759
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,420
When we get married

760
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,460
and have kids,

761
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,180
we can buy a larger house then.

762
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,620
Don't always try
to settle things at one go.

763
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,980
Do it step by step.

764
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,260
Doesn't it give you more motivation
to make money?

765
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,740
Junhui, I know

766
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,700
how you feel.

767
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,060
I'm alright with that.

768
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,060
I just don't want you
to push yourself too hard.

769
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
Nothing is easy.

770
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,700
I don't mind

771
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,540
working hard

772
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,620
to strive for my goal.

773
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,940
You work hard

774
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,580
just to strive for your goal?

775
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,020
Well, my goal is

776
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,940
to prevent my future wife
from regretting

777
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,460
for marrying me.

778
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,820
It's such a big goal.

779
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,700
You've got to work hard.

780
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,740
Is it?

781
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,260
It is.

782
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,420
I don't think it is.

783
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,340
Then, you should work harder.

784
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:06,980
Don't worry.

785
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,060
It's pointless to worry about this.

786
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,100
Why can't my family

787
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,020
be like the others?

788
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,060
Just have a little argument

789
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,380
over a trivial matter.

790
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,260
Why must it be

791
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,100
a huge fight like this?

792
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,220
Well now,

793
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,460
they start to give one another
the silent treatment.

794
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,260
No one can change

795
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,580
what my mom has decided.

796
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,620
I'm well aware of her temper.

797
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
Why can't my dad

798
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,420
just give in? Geez.

799
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,940
Have you figured out how to solve this?

800
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,340
Yes, I do.

801
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,540
In this matter,

802
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,860
I'll surely take my mom's side.

803
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,820
I'll take her to my house.

804
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,180
And I'll rent another one for myself.

805
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,900
I'll work harder and take up more cases

806
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,140
in these two years.

807
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,700
To earn the down payments.

808
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,620
Everything will be solved by then.

809
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,620
Have you told your mom?

810
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,140
Yes, I do.

811
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,500
What did your mom say?

812
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,620
She...

813
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,740
Of course she agrees to it.

814
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,620
I don't agree.

815
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,820
Why?

816
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,980
You two just got married.

817
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,220
And we move in to your place.

818
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,460
And you have to rent a house.

819
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,020
It's a nonsense.

820
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,300
Besides,

821
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,220
if Yang Hua's family

822
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,020
know this,

823
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,900
what will they think of us?

824
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,020
Didn't you despise his family?

825
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,980
Why do you care how they think of you?

826
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,540
It was in the past.

827
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,300
It was before you got married.

828
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,620
Now that you're married to him.

829
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,580
Well,

830
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,260
we always hope that you could

831
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,620
live a good life.

832
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,300
Let me tell you this, Shi.

833
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,060
We, as the parents,

834
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,460
no matter how we were against you two,

835
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,860
how reluctant we were,

836
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,660
since you've got married,

837
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,580
we still wish

838
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,060
that you could get along with them.

839
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,700
We can't ruin your relationship

840
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,460
with him because of our matter.

841
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,620
No, you must not do that.

842
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,580
Let's not decide to rent house so soon.

843
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,420
What's wrong?

844
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,300
I'd like to work.

845
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,900
You want to work?

846
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,980
Didn't you refuse

847
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,980
to work with those so-called fools?

848
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,140
Because a jobless man can't
apply for a loan.

849
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,660
Why do you need a loan?

850
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,420
To buy a house.

851
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,780
You want to buy a property?

852
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,580
You can let your mom

853
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,620
stay at your place.

854
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,860
I'll buy a house for both of us.

855
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,380
In less than six months,

856
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,060
we won't have to go through
the troubles to rent a house.

857
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,220
(Many women will be moved)

858
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,860
(by the word "I'll support you".)

859
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,620
(However, to me,)

860
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,660
(what I'm going to hear next is)

861
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,180
(the most touching love talk)

862
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,780
(in the world.)

863
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,660
Actually, this is

864
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,820
my family affairs.

865
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,380
I tell you about it

866
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,980
just to vent my anger out.

867
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,780
I didn't mean anything else.

868
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,780
You don't have to change

869
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,260
your principle because of me.

870
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,740
My principle is hoping

871
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,940
the person I care about

872
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,060
to be happy because of me.

873
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,900
I will never change this.

874
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,260
If I'm able to do this

875
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,420
when I move a step further,

876
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,980
why not do it?

877
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,180
By the way,

878
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,180
my dad has introduced you to a client.

879
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,300
He'll go to the lawyer firm
for you on Monday.

880
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,220
Who is the client?

881
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,460
It's Mr. Ding, an old friend of my dad.

882
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,220
Mr. Ding is not a regular person.

883
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,580
You must grab onto him.

884
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,340
I'll be sure to complete the task.

885
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,580
My dad said

886
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,100
he's a long-term client.

887
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,260
If you nail it,

888
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,980
maybe he'll be a gold mine.

889
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,500
What else did your dad say?

890
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,660
He told you to work hard

891
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,100
and buy a house for me.

892
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,980
Wait.

893
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,660
Thank you.

894
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,460
No problem.

895
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,140
Hello.

896
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,660
Hello, my surname is Ding.

897
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,740
I've made an appointment with Mr. Tao.

898
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,580
Sure, Mr. Ding.

899
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,060
Let me check it for you.

900
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,460
Ding.

901
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,100
Miss Qin.

902
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,580
It's been a long time.

903
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,140
Long time no see.

904
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,860
You're prettier than you used to be.

905
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,900
I knew that you won't stay

906
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,540
at that small lawyer firm

907
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,500
for long.

908
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,540
You must've got a bigger career.

909
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,220
You know me well.

910
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:42,980
Tell me.

911
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,020
What do you come here for?

912
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,460
Are you getting divorced again?

913
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,580
This is your fault.

914
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,860
Why do you touch

915
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,180
my sore spot right when we meet?

916
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,900
The young ladies nowadays

917
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,780
are ferocious.

918
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:52,940
are ferocious.

919
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,340
I love them sincerely.

920
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,140
And they truly love

921
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,420
my money as well.

922
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,940
Ultimately, this is your fault.

923
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,620
My fault?

924
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,500
If you were willing to marry me,

925
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,100
I wouldn't have been divorced
four times.

926
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,060
Don't you think so?

927
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,340
Ding,

928
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,540
you still won't behave
after being divorced four times.

929
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,300
If you agree to marry me,

930
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,460
I promise I'll behave.
