19
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:04,839
Okay, I got it.

20
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,280
What's the situation now?

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,159
I just received

22
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,920
a piece of inside news from Tianhang.

23
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,599
They've received a notification

24
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,320
that Yin Zhiqiang
has been transferred away.

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,680
Transferred away?

26
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,400
Where is he transferred to?

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,079
He's transferred

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,519
to the Supervision Office
to be the team leader.

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,960
Supervision Office?

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,719
What kind of a department is that?

31
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,079
It's something

32
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,879
like a department
for the old and retiring employees.

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,879
It's like the Cold Palace
of our corporation.

34
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,320
So, Yin Zhiqiang

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
is already finished
before we can sue him.

36
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,560
This is not good.

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,920
The thing is,

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
because of this merger and acquisition,

39
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,999
he signed

40
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,280
a lifelong supplementary contract

41
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,400
with the HR Department.

42
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,400
He

43
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:48,799
can't retire early

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,480
or resign.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,639
Or else, he'll have to pay

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,840
a large amount of penalty.

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,239
Moreover, he can't work

48
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,079
in the hotel
and catering industry anymore.

49
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:55,680
He deserves it.

50
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,960
Yin Zhiqiang has lost

51
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,760
his power.

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,879
It means

53
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:02,079
that Tianhang

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,079
will not protect him anymore.

55
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:04,359
And I don't think that Cheng & Hui

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,799
will take his case anymore.

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,680
His case

58
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,920
has been given to their legal assistant.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,599
Are we still going to continue
with the case then?

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,079
Of course.

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,040
Our enemy

62
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,079
has already lost his shield.

63
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,760
If we don't defeat him now,

64
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,480
when are we going to do it?

65
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm going

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
to file a complaint today.

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,840
Wait for my return.

68
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:24,760
Then, we can celebrate.

69
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:26,999
- Okay.
- Great.

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
All the best!

71
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,960
All the best!

72
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,359
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,799
This is great.

74
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:47,999
Qin Shi.

75
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,639
To be honest,

76
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:51,719
this is my first time

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,120
harbouring an admiration toward you.

78
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,400
Do you know why?

79
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,120
Why?

80
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
They say that women are narrow-minded

81
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,560
and petty.

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,599
After 18 years old,

83
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,879
women will lose all their friendships.

84
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:04,639
But not you.

85
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,280
You gave up your job

86
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,760
for a love rival.

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,079
And you can even drink together

88
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,519
with your love rival.

89
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,120
What kind

90
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,159
of enlightenment do you have?

91
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
I don't understand.

92
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,120
And I don't dare to ask.

93
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Who told you that she's my love rival?

94
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,840
Have you forgotten
what my occupation is?

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,280
That question

96
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,160
is an insult

97
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,039
to my IQ and my occupation.

98
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,000
Li Dai, you don't have any IQ.

99
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,639
I'm not trying to hide a secret.

100
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,280
In my life,

101
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,000
there's no such thing as a love rival.

102
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,079
If there's a man

103
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,199
who I want,

104
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,319
no one will be able to compete with me.

105
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,519
I need to use the toilet.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,239
It's just because you've never met

107
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,560
a tough opponent before.

108
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,160
What kind of a tough opponent?

109
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,519
Someone like you?

110
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,079
Yes. Someone like me.

111
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,000
What do you think? Do you admit defeat?

112
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,479
You look so cute

113
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,000
when you are being so confident.

114
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,319
Let me drink to you.

115
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:13,919
Come.

116
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:19,880
I need to use the toilet too.

117
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,560
Junhui.

118
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,400
Don't worry.

119
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,239
Everything

120
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,680
is going according to plan.

121
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,280
Okay, I got it.

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
Okay, I got it. You can rest assured.

123
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,519
It's not...

124
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
It's not something...

125
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:33,900
Don't take my phone.

126
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,239
(Brother)
Don't take my phone.

127
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,560
(Brother)

128
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:36,580
Hello.
(Brother)

129
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:36,960
Hello.

130
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,000
You are Yang Hua, right?

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,720
He's my client. Not Yang Hua.

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,519
Let me ask you.

133
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,960
Between me and Yao Yao,

134
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,960
who will you choose?

135
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,319
Look. He's really just a client.

136
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,720
I...

137
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:07,799
Junhui.

138
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:09,919
Okay. I'll call you later

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,720
if I need to talk to you.

140
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Okay. I'll hang up now.

141
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,720
Tomorrow, I'm going back to Australia

142
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,440
with Sunny.

143
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,280
When are you coming back?

144
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,880
I don't think I'm coming back.

145
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
You are not coming back?

146
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
I'll leave the case

147
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,600
to both of you.

148
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

149
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,440
There's something else

150
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,680
that I think Miss Qin doesn't know.

151
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,079
What is it?

152
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,600
Yang Hua will be coming with me.

153
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,560
My dear.

154
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,600
Why are you so funny?

155
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,639
Yang Hua is not your luggage.

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Go with you?

157
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,759
How?

158
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,880
Pack him up and ship him over?

159
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,960
They are already divorced.

160
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,440
What?

161
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:10,720
Qin Shi, are you and Yang Hua divorced?

162
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,919
Why didn't you tell me?

163
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,919
I'm supposed to be the next one.

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,039
How can you cut the line?

165
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,280
Qin Shi

166
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,759
did so much for this case.

167
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,720
But what are you doing now?

168
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:25,960
You want to kidnap her husband

169
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,960
to Australia.

170
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,319
How can you do that?

171
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,639
I'm really mad now.

172
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,560
He won't go with you.

173
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,600
My flight

174
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,039
is at 11:30 tomorrow.

175
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,319
If you are that capable,

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,639
make him stay.

177
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,280
I'll get going now.

178
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,359
Don't turn back. Come with me.

179
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,319
They have left.

180
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,840
Chase after them.

181
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
They are really gone now.

182
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,400
Miss Qin needs to be straightened out

183
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,840
with more force.

184
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,239
I don't know

185
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,000
why the two of you

186
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,840
are fighting like this

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,079
although you love each other.

188
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,519
But I can tell

189
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,759
that you like her.

190
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,160
And you like her a lot, right?

191
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,239
I really like her.

192
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,919
I've never liked

193
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,319
anyone else as much as I like her.

194
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,720
Can't you at least reel it in
when you are with me?

195
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:32,999
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,999
That's why you have to listen to me.

197
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,679
In this relationship with her,

198
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,639
even if you can

199
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,519
walk all the way to her,

200
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,960
she'll have to be the one

201
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,480
to take the last step toward you.

202
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,519

00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:44,160
We couldn't find out anywhere.

229
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,319
We were so anxious.

230
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,999
What's wrong?

231
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:58,280

What happened?

238
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,079
What's wrong? Did someone bully you?

239
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,800
Who is bold enough to bully you?

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,840
Wenyu.

241
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:24,040
What's wrong?

242
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Qin Shi, are you too tired?

243
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,439
Just cry all you want.

244
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,879
We are all here.

245
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,319

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,879
Wash your face and brush your teeth.

256
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:51,999
The porridge will be ready soon.

257
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,600
Here.

258
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,519
Why are the two of you here?

259
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,079
Looks like you've forgotten.

260
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,400
You were drunk yesterday.

261
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,319
And we sent you back.

262
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,360
It was too late.

263
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
So, we stayed here.

264
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,480
Where was your husband?

265
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:32,840
Why didn't he pick you up?

266
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,240
He's on a business trip.

267
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,319
You are no longer young.

268
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,639
How could you

269
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,559
drink so much

270
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,280
and wander around under the rain
in the middle of the night?

271
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,920
What if something happens to you?

272
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,319
Even if you can take it,

273
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,160
our father and your mother
can't take it.

274
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,119
Now,

275
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,400
even you can lecture me.

276
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,519
This is called growth.

277
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:04,879
Do you understand?

278
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:06,679
After you eat,

279
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,800
take the flu medicine.

280
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,639
You are usually a force of nature.

281
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,960
But you don't know
how to take care of yourself.

282
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,840
Even I can take care of myself.

283
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,199
You need to grow up too.

284
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,800
Do you understand?

285
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,559
Okay.

286
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
You manage to keep this alive.

287
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,679
Put that down.

288
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,199
What's wrong? Can't I look at it?

289
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,119
So petty.

290
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,480
No.

291
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,759
I didn't do it on purpose.

292
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:35,519
I...

293
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,600
Let me help you with it.

294
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,600
You don't have to. Move aside.

295
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,679
Stand back.

296
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,119
Let me help her.

297
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,999
Come. Let me clean it up for you.

298
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,280
Here.

299
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,600
I didn't do it on purpose.

300
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,679
I really didn't do it on purpose.

301
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,559
Be careful not to cut your hands.

302
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:45,960
Let me do it.

303
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,600
I'll get to work then.

304
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,360
Okay.

305
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:53,840
I really didn't do it on purpose.

306
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,920
Get up. I'll clean this up.

307
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,079
Even Wenyu is going to work now.

308
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,360
Wenyu

309
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,040
has changed a lot this time.

310
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,319
I thought

311
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,840
that he would be depressed for a while.

312
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:14,920
I never thought

313
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,480
that he would be working diligently

314
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,920
in the company.

315
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,840
He said

316
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,679
that Meimei could come back at any time.

317
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,280
He doesn't want Meimei

318
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,920
to see him as a dispirited
and depressed man.

319
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,160
By the way,

320
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,040
Qin Shi.

321
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,079
Later, tell Meimei

322
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,360
to take good care of herself.

323
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
Ask her not to come back too quickly.

324
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,360
This time,

325
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,720
we need to make sure that Wenyu
can turn into a better man.

326
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,240
I've only managed
to contact her recently.

327
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,280
Are you having a fight

328
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,639
with Yang Hua?

329
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,040
No.

330
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,600
Really?

331
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,360
Will this

332
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,639
mint plant

333
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:14,199
die?

334
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,720
You dummy.

335
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,600
Don't be frightened by the despair

336
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,240
that you see in other's life.

337
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,240
Because that is not your life.

338
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,160
You need to believe in yourself

339
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:25,920
that you'll find

340
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,559
your own happiness.

341
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,679
I don't think

342
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,519
that I have any rights

343
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,199
to own any kind of happiness now.

344
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,119
I don't know

345
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,160
what I should do now.

346
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,040
I don't know what happened

347
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,679
between you and Yang Hua.

348
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,759
But I know

349
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,119
that a person's happiness

350
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,240
depends on the person's sense of safety.

351
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:04,199
Your home is where
your peace of mind is.

352
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,720
Okay now. I have to go to work now.

353
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,640
Remember to take your medicine.

354
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,720
Be good.

355
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,480
You are home.

356
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,799
You are here.

357
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,399
I'm on leave today.

358
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So, I want

359
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,720
to come here

360
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,640
to check on you.

361
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,840
Look at you.

362
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,760
If I didn't come,

363
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,360
your house would be a mess.

364
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,399
You came here two days ago, right?

365
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,079
You bought me a bunch of food.

366
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,720
I haven't even finished
the food in the fridge.

367
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:37,600
This...

368
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,120
I didn't buy the food.

369
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,720
I wasn't here.

370
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,120
You weren't here?

371
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,840
Qin Shi,

372
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,640
your father and I already know

373
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,520
about you and Yang Hua.

374
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,439
What are you talking about?

375
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,760
Everything.

376
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,120
You?

377
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,240
Is this

378
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,319
a joke?

379
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,520
How can you

380
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,399
treat your marriage so lightly?

381
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,399
Mr. Qin, Mrs. Qin.

382
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,240
Qin Shi and I

383
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,279
chose to start

384
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,279
and end like this

385
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,399
not because

386
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,559
we treat our marriage lightly.

387
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,520
On the contrary,

388
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,399
Qin Shi cares about marriage
more than anyone.

389
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,399
She's doing her best to protect

390
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,360
every marriage

391
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
in this family.

392
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,079
Because of that,

393
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,520
she has no confidence

394
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,319
in her own marriage.

395
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,960
And that's why

396
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,039
I choose to divorce her.

397
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,720
You are talking in circles.

398
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,039
What are you trying to say?

399
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:49,840
Qin,

400
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:52,960
let him finish.

401
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,480
Yang,

402
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,240
go ahead and continue.

403
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
I don't want to let Qin Shi

404
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,000
run away from her true feelings anymore.

405
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:03,960
And I don't want her

406
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,600
to use this fake marriage

407
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
as a way to avoid
the happiness she deserves.

408
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,960
So, I've given her something

409
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,600
that I can provide.

410
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:15,880
Freedom.

411
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,559
Today, I'm here to beg you

412
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,919
not to pressure Qin Shi

413
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:21,960
anymore.

414
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,120
Don't blame her for this too.

415
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,520
Marriage is not important

416
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,799
to me at all.

417
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,520
The most important thing is

418
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,000
to be with her.

419
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,640
As long as she's willing,

420
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,199
I don't mind even if

421
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,720
we don't get married forever.

422
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,399
I want

423
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,960
to get your permission

424
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,120
to let me take good care of Qin Shi

425
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:44,919
forever.

426
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,919
Did we go overboard yesterday?

427
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,480
What if our plan backfires on us?

428
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,039
It's okay. Leave the rest

429
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,399
to me.

430
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,240
Not bad.

431
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,600
You are a real man now.

432
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,720
Are you really not going
to go to Australia with me?

433
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,399
There are many women

434
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,640
like Miss Qin over there.

435
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:19,880
Mother.

436
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,480
Look. Even your son

437
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
doesn't believe you.

438
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,039
What is it?

439
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,760
I have a girlfriend. I can't do that.

440
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,600
This is your marriage fund.

441
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:39,840
Keep it well.

442
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,159
I didn't use

443
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,120
any of the money.

444
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:49,840
We'll get going now.

445
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,039
Let's go.

446
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,640
Bye.

447
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,520
Bye.

473
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,799
Are you ready to start now?

474
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,399
Are you ready?

475
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:37,799
Miss Qin, Miss Li.

476
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,520
Hello.

477
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,720
We are from the "Legal Ethics" column

478
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,120
of Pujiang Television Station.

479
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,799
First, I want to congratulate
both of you.

480
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
After more than seven months

481
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,240
of waiting,

482
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:46,919
Our city's

483
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,679
first sexual class action

484
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,679
has already come to an end.

485
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,279
Can you please tell us

486
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,199
the verdict?

487
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,199
The verdict...

488
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,640
The court has upheld

489
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,199
all of our litigation claims.

490
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,000
The court has given us

491
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:02,840
the highest financial compensation

492
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
within the scope of legal aid.

493
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,039
Although the compensation

494
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,679
is far from enough for the victims

495
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,559
who were mentally abused

496
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,319
for a long time,

497
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,199
it can set an example

498
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,600
for other similar cases.

499
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,799
Besides civil compensation,

500
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,159
what other punishments

501
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:17,880
does Yin Zhiqiang

502
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
have to face?

503
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:20,679
From what we know,

504
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,439
during the lawsuit, Yin Zhiqiang

505
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,559
has already been suspended from work.

506
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,000
This case

507
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,199
involves forced indecency,

508
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,159
attempted rape,

509
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,679
and abetted perjury

510
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:29,799
of He Dongna.

511
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,439
So, the procuratorate has filed
a public prosecution

512
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,399
against him.

513
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,640
And those who are involved

514
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,439
in the He Dongna

515
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,480
abetted perjury case
will be put into detention too.

516
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,880
Look

517
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,600
at the office
that I've decorated for you.

518
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,079
What do you think?

519
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,079
Look at this. This is

520
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,039
a massage chair imported from Japan.

521
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,480
It's very comfortable.

522
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:02,679
Qin Shi.

523
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,679
You've done well

524
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,360
with this lawsuit.

525
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,640
You've earned both profit and fame.

526
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,720
Besides, a lot of corporations

527
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,039
want to carry out

528
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,720
sexual harassment prevention now.

529
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:14,840
It's a huge market.

530
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,279
You are here this time

531
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,120
as a senior partner.

532
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,640
Just tell us the salary
and benefits that you want.

533
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,439
If I can do it,
I'll fulfil your requests.

534
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,600
Come and take a seat over here.

535
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,199
Let's not beat around the bush anymore.

536
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,240
Do you have a case this time

537
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,319
that I have to take?

538
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,439
You fox.

539
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,559
Do you still remember Ms. Lan?

540
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,360
Life has come back to a full circle.

541
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Last week, Ms. Lan

542
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,559
received a call from abroad.

543
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,279
Pang Dingfang was speeding

544
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,919
on the highway abroad

545
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,799
and got into an accident.

546
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,360
He and his lover passed away
from the accident.

547
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,559
Ms. Lan has to go abroad

548
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,720
to inherit
all of Pang Dingfang's assets.

549
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
And she has appointed you as her lawyer.

550
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,720
Qin Shi.

551
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,120
I know that you care the most

552
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,000
about our firm's principle

553
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,799
regarding lawyers who are single.

554
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,319
Actually, after you left,

555
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:29,439
Yihui and I

556
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,000
have reflected on it.

557
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,480
We realise that it's inappropriate.

558
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,319
So after that,

559
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,679
we've already corrected

560
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,480
that mistake.

561
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,360
Now,

562
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,480
Cheng & Hui's principle is,

563
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
regardless of one's single status

564
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,000
or having to take maternity leave,

565
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,399
we'll treat everyone the same.

566
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,520
Yes. Not only that,

567
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,319
as long as the lawyer has a child,

568
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,319
regardless of the lawyer's gender,

569
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,279
they'll be given
an allowance accordingly.

570
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,360
We are working on the nursing rooms

571
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,360
and childcare facilities too.

572
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,199
That's great.

573
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,079
I think

574
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,360
that Yang Hua is right.

575
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,760
If Cheng & Hui

576
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,960
wants to continue improving
in the long term,

577
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,760
we can't lose our faith.

578
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,399
As lawyers with professional ethics,

579
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,360
justice and righteousness
go hand in hand.

580
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,399
This is the conscience of our firm.

581
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,000
Am I right?

582
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,559
Are you still in contact with Yang Hua?

583
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,919
Of course.

584
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,199
He is the CEO of the Capital Markets

585
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,279
under Mr. Hu now.

586
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,880
When we opened up a new branch

587
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,079
in Australia,

588
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,520
he was there too.

589
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,079
He was still the same.

590
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,039
Didn't he tell you

591
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,279
that we are divorced?

592
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:44,880
I...

593
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,520
Hui.

594
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,399
Will you still allow me
to join Cheng & Hui?

595
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,760
Qin Shi.

596
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,000
Will you listen to me?

597
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,039
Cheng & Hui

598
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,840
is not a perfect firm.

599
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,600
When we are progressing and developing

600
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,720
in a fast pace,

601
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,079
there are things that can get neglected.

602
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,480
But one thing for sure is,

603
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,240
all the lawyers in our firm are great.

604
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,319
We are inviting you to join us today

605
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,760
not because of Ms. Lan's case.

606
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,000
And it's not because

607
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,840
of your relationship with Yang Hua.

608
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,120
But because

609
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,520
you are a good lawyer.

610
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,240
What's so precious about you is,

611
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,679
you are a lawyer

612
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,039
with a firm principle and conscience.

613
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:40,840
Not only Yihui,

614
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:43,159
even I have to learn from you.

615
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,559
Actually,

616
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,880
we founded Cheng & Hui

617
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,840
because we couldn't take it anymore

618
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,199
when our previous boss
compromised for money.

619
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,520
We hope that just like you,

620
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,559
we can hold true to our principles

621
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,720
no matter what pressure we are in.

622
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,399
But the most regretful thing is,

623
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,520
we couldn't do it.

624
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,720
We've become matured

625
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,360
and more accommodating.

626
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,960
But we know

627
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,360
what we lost.

628
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,960
We are asking you to join us today

629
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,679
not just because of your victory.

630
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,199
We also hope

631
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,640
that we can regain

632
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,840
our past principles and persistence.

633
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,240
Even if

634
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,360
it's something

635
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,960
that we have once abandoned.

636
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:42,120
Yihui, Mr. Jin.

637
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,360
I'm really thankful

638
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,760
that you are telling me this

639
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,760
today.

640
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,399
I think that today
is the most unforgettable day

641
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,319
in my life.

642
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,319
Thank you for telling me this.

643
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,120
It makes me know

644
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,559
that my persistence before this

645
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,960
is worth it.

646
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,840
But I think

647
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,240
I still have to reject your offer.

648
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,480
I know that by saying this now,

649
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,679
it'll seem like I'm being ungrateful.

650
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,760
But

651
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,960
during this period of working alone

652
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,399
in the outside world, I'm quite happy.

653
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,799
I am

654
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,880
really thankful to you

655
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,640
for giving me this chance

656
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,559
to do something crazy.

657
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,480
A chance for me
to do something outrageous

658
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,319
regardless of my own safety.

659
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,760
So, I've decided

660
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,159
to work alone.

661
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,439
As you said,

662
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,199
I'm a stubborn person

663
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:54,559
who can't work under anyone.

664
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,600
If I work under you,

665
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:59,000
I'll only frustrate you more.

666
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,679
So, for everyone's sake,

667
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:04,919
Let's work together starting

668
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,199
from this case with Ms. Lan.

669
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:10,840
Let me think.

670
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:15,240
We can split the agency fee in half.

671
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,159
What do you think?

672
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:24,679
Deal.

673
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:29,439
Thank you.

674
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,760
You are so nice to me.

675
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
You are back, Miss Qin.

676
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,240
Yes!

677
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,199
Mr. Tao.

678
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,119
Bye.

679
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,639
Mr. Tao, are you leaving now?

680
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,399
Yes.

681
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,560
Do you need any help?

682
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,520
It's okay. Thank you.

683
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,679
Miss Qin.

684
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,800
You've resigned?

685
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:47,919
Why?

686
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,080
It has nothing to do with you.

687
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:53,599
I already have my first big case

688
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,520
at my firm.

689
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,599
If you are interested,

690
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,520
you can come to my firm.

691
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,359
I won't go.

692
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,359
Don't be petty.

693
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,960
Why should I give up
millions of annual salary

694
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,399
to work at your lousy firm?

695
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,439
Let me inform you officially now.

696
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,879
I am now the person in charge

697
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,560
of the Northwest Division
of Cheng & Hui.

698
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:08,800
Really?

699
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,280
If you have any big cases after this,

700
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:13,919
remember to find me.

701
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,000
Depends on the situation.

702
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,520
I wish you happiness.

703
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,839
You better

704
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:19,560
think about yourself.

705
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,040
Don't come back to me when you've become

706
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:23,520
a lonely old woman.

707
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,159
Let me help you.

708
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:29,760
Thank you.

709
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:43,960

Hello.

714
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:07,040
Qin Shi, I'm going into labour now.

715
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,159
Isn't it one week away?

716
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,199
I got it. I'm coming.

717
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,320
Mr. Tao.

718
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,359
Hello, Mr. Tao Junhui.

719
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,399
I'm the new legal assistant.

Hope that we can
get along well after this.
