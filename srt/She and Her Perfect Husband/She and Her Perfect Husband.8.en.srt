Hello, Miss Zhao.

20
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:58,432
Please follow me.

21
00:01:58,633 --> 00:01:59,953
It's fine. I know the way.

22
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:00,953
All right.

23
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,473
Hello.

24
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:11,833
(Miss Zhao is here.)

25
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:12,632
Noted.

26
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,233
She's here.

27
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:19,352
Relax.

28
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:20,712
Just follow the scripts.

29
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:21,632
It'll be fine.

30
00:02:24,072 --> 00:02:24,593
I'll take a seat.

31
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:38,512
Come in.

32
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:43,912
Danping, you're here.

33
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:44,953
Hi.

34
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,072
This one is...?

35
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:47,753
He

36
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,432
is the new lawyer of Association for
Women Entrepreneurs just hired,

37
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:50,393
Mr. Liang.

38
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,233
Hi, Mr. Liang.

39
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:55,072
It's a shame

40
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:56,753
that we couldn't work

41
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:58,632
with the association.

42
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:00,233
Congratulations, however.

43
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,272
Ms. Tang, you asked for me?

44
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:05,873
Have a seat, Danping.

45
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:09,673
I have prepared all of you

46
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:11,673
some high-quality Jinjunmei tea.

47
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,272
Have some.

48
00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:14,393
(Partner Counsel)
No, thanks.

49
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,313
I'm not here to sip tea.

50
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:17,673
Ms. Tang, you should know.

51
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,593
The rumor yesterday about

52
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,113
Luowei Yulan and Cheng & Hui

53
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:25,792
is causing a lot of troubles

54
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:26,912
to us.

55
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:29,552
I'm sure it bothers

56
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:30,632
Ms. Lan

57
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:31,792
a lot too.

58
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,432
We should have come to her

59
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:36,072
to explain

60
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,313
but I don't think an apology

61
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:42,233
will suffice.

62
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:44,792
Ms. Tang.

63
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:46,512
Since you already admit

64
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:48,593
to fabricating unreal rumors,

65
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,552
I suppose you are ready

66
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:52,313
to face to consequences?

67
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:53,953
Danping, calm down.

68
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:56,432
Both of us have the right

69
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,792
to know the truth.

70
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:12,992
This is

71
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,593
the screenshot of the lawyers' group chat

72
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:18,112
last afternoon.

73
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:20,952
We traced back and managed

74
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:24,272
to identify the source of the rumor.

75
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,552
It wasn't from our law firm.

76
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:29,672
I see now.

77
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:31,073
You're pointing fingers.

78
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:32,513
This is not what I meant.

79
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,432
Allow me to finish.

80
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:34,633
You see.

81
00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:36,112
We have found the perpetrator.

82
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:37,672
He confessed

83
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:39,753
that someone called him

84
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:41,272
and that's how he learned about
the whole thing.

85
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:43,112
The caller

86
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:46,152
is a young lawyer from our law firm.

87
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:10,633
It wasn't me.

88
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:11,873
I didn't say anything.

89
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:15,272
The security camera here
only provides image

90
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:15,992
and no sound.

91
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,793
So even if we can confirm

92
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:19,232
that Xiaogao

93
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:20,232
was the caller,

94
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:23,073
it cannot be used as evidence.

95
00:05:23,593 --> 00:05:24,313
Fortunately,

96
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:24,873
I

97
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:26,753
have a friend from a school
for the deaf and mute.

98
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,073
He can read lips

99
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:31,392
and I sent him the video.

100
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:32,712
I got a reply not long after.

101
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,353
Let me replay it.

102
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:37,952
I have an important news to tell you.

103
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:40,193
Luowei Yulan will implode

104
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,513
and it will drag Cheng & Hui
down with it.

105
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:00,193
Danping,

106
00:06:02,152 --> 00:06:04,952
although the legal assistant was the perpetrator,

107
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:06,552
we cannot deny that there was also
an oversight

108
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:07,712
on our management's part.

109
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:11,152
We are at fault here.

110
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,272
So please convey to Ms. Lan

111
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:15,992
our sincerest apology.

112
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:22,593
Simply amazing.

113
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,073
People say the best orator
in Cheng & Hui

114
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:26,152
isn't Mr. Jin Cheng

115
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,313
but Ms. Tang.

116
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:29,392
I finally see why today.

117
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:30,873
However,

118
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,232
do you truly think

119
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:33,473
firing an ordinary lawyer

120
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:34,913
is enough to compensate
the reputation damage

121
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:36,313
Luowei Yulan suffered?

122
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:38,552
Do you know

123
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:40,152
how damaging this rumor was?

124
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,432
If I hold you accountable,

125
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:45,832
ten Cheng & Huis won't be enough
to compensate us.

126
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:50,392
Calm down, Miss Zhao.

127
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:52,193
We will not

128
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:53,832
just fire the perpetrator.

129
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:56,793
We came with a clarification

130
00:06:57,152 --> 00:06:58,992
to make our stance clear in this matter.

131
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:00,152
Like Luowei Yulan,

132
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:01,313
Cheng & Hui

133
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:02,593
is also a victim.

134
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,513
We will cooperate with Ms. Lan

135
00:07:04,513 --> 00:07:06,232
and return her peace of mind.

136
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,232
We also hope

137
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:08,232
that this small mishap

138
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:09,112
will not affect

139
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:10,392
our beneficial

140
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:11,593
partnership.

141
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,952
Too late.

142
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:26,272
This...

143
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,193
I rescind the contract.

144
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:30,313
As stipulated in the contract,

145
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,313
you can deduct the liquidated damages.

146
00:07:32,513 --> 00:07:33,432
No need.

147
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:35,112
I was planning to deal with this

148
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:35,913
once Mr. Pang

149
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,992
comes back from overseas.

150
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:38,832
But Ms. Lan insists

151
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,033
on paying this fee.

152
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:42,593
Luowei Yulan

153
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:43,952
can still afford to lose

154
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:44,992
tens of million.

155
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:47,033
What we care about

156
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,552
is our reputation.

157
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:51,152
From now on,

158
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:53,073
I do not want to hear

159
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,353
any rumor between Cheng & Hui

160
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:56,152
and Luowei Yulan.

161
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:57,513
Otherwise,

162
00:07:57,992 --> 00:07:59,073
I will seek

163
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:00,633
legal actions.

164
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:11,633
See you.

165
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:19,832
You got the money back.

166
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:24,712
Come.

167
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:26,033
Let me hug you.

168
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,073
I crossed Ms. Lan,

169
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:35,873
but

170
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:37,432
this 25 million yuan

171
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:38,232
is worth it.

172
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:42,313
Where...

173
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:44,873
Where do you think Xiaogao

174
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,672
got the news from?

175
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,393
Replay the video again.

176
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:49,153
I want to see

177
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:50,153
who else was there.

178
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:52,833
Pause.

179
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:54,232
Rewind.

180
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:00,672
What is this?

181
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:07,513
25 million yuan.

182
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:09,073
Hush.

183
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:11,873
It's serious.

184
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:14,193
Stop yelling.

185
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:15,833
They say they can pay it.

186
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,713
Whether it's true or not,

187
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:17,992
you'll know within these two days.

188
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:20,592
And if they can't?

189
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:23,032
Even if they can't,

190
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:24,912
will it affect our law firm that much?

191
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:29,592
Hey.

192
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:30,912
I have an important news to tell you.

193
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,432
Luowei Yulan will implode

194
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:33,833
and it will drag Cheng & Hui
down with it.

195
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:37,032
Enough.

196
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:39,153
If you continue, you'll put everyone
in a tough spot.

197
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:45,833
It's okay.

198
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:49,713
You did well this time.

199
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,633
What do you want?

200
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:53,153
I'll buy you whatever luxury bag
you want.

201
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,792
You already know

202
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,273
what I want.

203
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:00,193
Ambitious.

204
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:02,193
This is not the first time you met me.

205
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:02,833
Bite me.

206
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:10,193
You'll attend our law firm's

207
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,912
partner dinner

208
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:12,912
tomorrow.

209
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:13,992
Sure.

210
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:16,873
Bring your husband with you.

211
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:20,313
My husband will go abroad soon.

212
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:22,273
He's busy.

213
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:26,873
Joining the 11th floor

214
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,912
means you're a reserve partner.

215
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:30,393
I

216
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:31,592
can recommend you

217
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,313
but that will ultimately require

218
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:36,513
the votes from all partners.

219
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,313
Of course, other than your capability,

220
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:39,672
your potential and your growth

221
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,112
will be taken into consideration.

222
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:43,833
You're lucky, you know.

223
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:46,232
You have a wonderful marriage
and a supportive husband.

224
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:47,912
It's almost impossible

225
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:49,513
for a single female lawyer

226
00:10:49,513 --> 00:10:50,592
to get into the reserve list.

227
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:54,193
That's not fair.

228
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:55,672
A partner is responsible

229
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:57,193
for the firm's success.

230
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,552
Take Ms. Bian as an example.

231
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:02,513
She got dividends, stock options,
and some other bonuses.

232
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:04,232
The firm invested

233
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:05,552
a lot in her

234
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:07,232
but she went to get pregnant.

235
00:11:07,393 --> 00:11:08,513
I can give her my blessings

236
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:09,953
but who can take care of the business?

237
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:13,713
But having a baby

238
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,352
is just having another identity.

239
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:17,232
She can still work.

240
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,393
What a naive view.

241
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:22,073
This business is competitive.

242
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:22,792
Our law firm has

243
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,352
several hundred mouths
waiting to be fed.

244
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:24,992
The higher you climb,

245
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:26,073
the more constrained you are.

246
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:27,313
No one can shoulder the loss.

247
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:29,592
Remember what I told you?

248
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:31,833
Being a businesswoman is not easy.

249
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:33,313
What to choose? How to juggle?

250
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:34,193
They are all tough decisions.

251
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:35,792
You still have the time

252
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,792
so think it through.

253
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:38,792
If you have to make the choice now,

254
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:39,912
what will you do?

255
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:41,833
Are you married?

256
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:43,112
No.

257
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,390
(Junlun Law Firm, Job Interview Venue)

258
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:46,193
Do you plan to in the next three years?

259
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:48,672
No.

260
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:50,472
Can you tell me

261
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:52,313
why you quit your last job?

262
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:56,912
I want to reach a higher ceiling.

263
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:58,873
You're 31 now.

264
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,352
Are you married?

265
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:02,432
No.

266
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:03,873
Are you married?

267
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,032
No.

268
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:08,713
I don't plan to get married in the next

269
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:09,833
three or five years.

270
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:13,313
Everyone says that.

271
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:15,513
(Truth be told, Miss Qin,)

272
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:17,352
(your resume is impressive.)

273
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,953
(However, our law firm)

274
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:21,032
(is concerned)

275
00:12:21,753 --> 00:12:22,792
about the availability

276
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:24,953
(of a single female lawyer like you.)

277
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:29,193
Hello, Jing.

278
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:38,633
This is your office.

279
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:41,713
Are you happy with it?

280
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:46,592
Fine.

281
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:49,032
Cheer up.

282
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:50,953
You won't regret

283
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:52,032
the decision you made today.

284
00:12:57,912 --> 00:12:58,633
Your employment gift.

285
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:08,513
You're welcome.

286
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:12,833
All right.

287
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,273
Come.

288
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:15,513
Get your bearings now.

289
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:16,352
I have to go.

290
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:57,153
Don't worry.

291
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:58,153
My husband and I

292
00:13:58,153 --> 00:13:59,313
will be there on time.

293
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,780
(Divorce Settlement Agreement)

294
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,700
(Husband's Signature: Qin Wenyu)

295
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:49,912
Ren Meimei.

296
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,432
You just want money, don't you?

297
00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:53,552
But I'm telling you,

298
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:54,672
my mother worked very hard

299
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,073
to build the restaurant.

300
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:56,912
Don't even think about it.

301
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:58,032
I, Qin Wenyu,

302
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:59,352
can give you everything,

303
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:02,073
like

304
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:04,912
the car,

305
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:06,472
the house.

306
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:08,672
Yes.

307
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:11,873
Money.

308
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:14,953
Your credit card,

309
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:17,672
your second credit card,

310
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,592
all your credit cards,

311
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:21,472
and

312
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:23,713
all the cash I have now,

313
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:24,953
I can give them to you.

314
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:26,352
I don't want this bag either.

315
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,833
Yes, this divorce will leave me
with nothing.

316
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:30,232
Even then,

317
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,273
I'll leave you

318
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,833
and you can't do anything about it.

319
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:56,953
Meimei.

320
00:15:57,713 --> 00:15:58,633
I'm not good with this.

321
00:15:58,713 --> 00:15:59,633
You know it very well.

322
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:01,513
Watch closely.

323
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:03,432
Did he

324
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:04,833
empty

325
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,273
his pockets?

326
00:16:06,513 --> 00:16:07,352
Other than his phone.

327
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:10,672
All four of his credit cards are here.

328
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:12,313
I also froze

329
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:13,313
all the accounts

330
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:14,393
in his phone.

331
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,873
Well done.

332
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:20,232
Okay.

333
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,273
Now,

334
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,432
you can wait at home.

335
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:24,112
Three days.

336
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,232
During these three days,

337
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:27,513
never pick up his phone.

338
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:28,432
Don't pick up.

339
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:32,713
Whenever I go back,

340
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:34,393
I'm all alone anyway.

341
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,313
Mom, what do you want to eat?

342
00:16:35,313 --> 00:16:36,153
I'll cook something for you.

343
00:16:36,753 --> 00:16:38,552
No need to worry about me.

344
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,753
I

345
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:42,513
have eliminated the internal threat.

346
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:44,193
Now don't tell me

347
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:46,352
I have to deal with the external problem too.

348
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:48,713
I can do that.

349
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:50,273
I have faith in you.

350
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:53,472
You're young.

351
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,273
How do they say that again?

352
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:57,552
You look smart but your mind isn't.

353
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,592
You look intimidating

354
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:00,912
and scary

355
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,633
but when you need to look like that,

356
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,633
you grow soft.

357
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:08,913
I have been through a lot.

358
00:17:09,592 --> 00:17:10,592
Do you know what

359
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:11,393
I learn?

360
00:17:12,153 --> 00:17:12,913
It's that you

361
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,232
can pamper your son

362
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,072
but not your husband.

363
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:17,753
You pamper them

364
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:20,513
and you'll become like me.

365
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:22,832
It's true.

366
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:24,633
Do you hear me?

367
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:33,952
Sir.

368
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:34,873
Can I

369
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:35,992
deal with it like this?

370
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:44,112
You have to wait for the third one.

371
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:44,633
Wait until

372
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:45,753
Mr. Jin returns from Xi'an.

373
00:17:45,793 --> 00:17:46,712
Ask him to sign it then.

374
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:47,472
Okay.

375
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:48,393
As for the rest...

376
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:50,793
Can you check the fourth one?

377
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:55,633
What are you doing?

378
00:17:55,913 --> 00:17:56,832
Wait, what?

379
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:04,232
Xiaogao from
the criminal case department

380
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:05,393
was let go.

381
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:06,312
Do you know?

382
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:07,873
Of course.

383
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:09,793
I did that.

384
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:11,712
Miss Qin sure is an amazing lawyer.

385
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:13,232
She handles divorce cases very well

386
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:14,513
and can identify snitches quickly.

387
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:17,673
Was he the one

388
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:19,553
who circulated it?

389
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:23,153
Yes, everyone knows.

390
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,112
Did he say

391
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,153
where he got the news?

392
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,153
That's not important.

393
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,232
It is.

394
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:34,832
I think he

395
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:36,153
overheard our...

396
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:37,153
Don't whine.

397
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,312
Don't whine

398
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:43,793
during office hours, okay?

399
00:18:46,753 --> 00:18:47,753
The problem

400
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,513
has been dealt with.

401
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:50,153
The money is back.
The person was arrested.

402
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,393
The higher-up decided
to drop the investigation

403
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:52,952
so don't dwell on it.

404
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,992
Clear your head.

405
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:56,832
Focus.

406
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:58,192
Got it?

407
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:05,352
Focus.

408
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:28,352
I am the number zero.

409
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,873
I have no guilt.

410
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,280
(Century Matchmaking, Miss Sun)

411
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:27,793
Miss Sun.

412
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:28,952
Miss Li.

413
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:30,832
Sorry.

414
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:32,433
Remember the Mr. Yang

415
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:33,352
I presented you?

416
00:20:33,553 --> 00:20:34,753
I talked to him

417
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,592
and he told me

418
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:37,913
he already has a girlfriend.

419
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,633
Sorry.

420
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:41,352
Don't worry.

421
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:42,913
Our database has a lot more bachelors

422
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:44,112
(Century Matchmaking)
who are even better

423
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,072
(Century Matchmaking)
than Mr. Yang.

424
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:45,312
(Century Matchmaking)

425
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:46,712
(Century Matchmaking)
I will find you

426
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,832
(Century Matchmaking)
a perfect match.

427
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:49,553
Miss Sun.

428
00:20:50,153 --> 00:20:51,393
I have a question.

429
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:54,033
Is every member

430
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:55,712
single there?

431
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:57,232
Of course.

432
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:59,153
Who else consults a matchmaking service?

433
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,312
(Is this a joke?)

434
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,873
What if someone pretends to be single?

435
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,513
Don't worry.

436
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,712
We adopt a VIP member system here.

437
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:08,952
We will verify

438
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,513
the information of all our members

439
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:11,433
and will ask them

440
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:12,873
to provide proof of their single status.

441
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,592
Do not worry about that.

442
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:45,472
Miss Li.

443
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:50,553
Anything I could help with?

444
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:55,673
Nothing.

445
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:57,433
I'm just here

446
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:58,712
to thank you.

447
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,153
Whatever for?

448
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,273
Thank you

449
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:07,553
for getting in my way so tirelessly.

450
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:09,072
If you don't do that,

451
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:10,633
my life

452
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,273
will be a living hell, won't it?

453
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:21,232
Why?

454
00:22:23,352 --> 00:22:23,793
Knowing

455
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,112
how well we get along,

456
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:26,913
is there a need a play pretend?

457
00:22:30,873 --> 00:22:31,873
That expression looks

458
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:33,033
more natural now.

459
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,192
I know you want to climb up.

460
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,312
So do I.

461
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:43,592
At the moment,

462
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:46,553
I have the edge.

463
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:48,832
Miss Qin.

464
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:51,673
Do you know

465
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:52,992
what is your most admirable trait?

466
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:55,433
Your confidence.

467
00:22:57,312 --> 00:22:59,352
You have so much confidence

468
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:01,273
that it turns into shamelessness.

469
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:03,033
I take that.

470
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:04,913
Since the subject has been broached,

471
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:06,393
I'll be frank then.

472
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:08,312
We

473
00:23:08,312 --> 00:23:09,232
have fought

474
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:10,832
many times over the years.

475
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:12,793
I don't like you

476
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:15,192
but I do respect you.

477
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:16,312
You are evil

478
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,673
and you don't hide it.

479
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:19,472
You own it.

480
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,553
The tide can turn anytime.

481
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:23,992
Don't celebrate

482
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:26,153
before the final moment.

483
00:23:27,312 --> 00:23:28,033
As long

484
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,633
as we fight fair and square,

485
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,913
even if I lose,

486
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:32,992
I'll

487
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:34,913
send you the biggest hamper.

488
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,513
But

489
00:23:39,992 --> 00:23:41,393
if someone

490
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,753
pulls a dirty trick

491
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:44,513
and makes something

492
00:23:44,913 --> 00:23:46,673
out of thin air,

493
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:50,753
I will also play along.

494
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:05,072
Love you.

495
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:10,112
Sorry.

496
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:14,153
It's okay.

497
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:55,633
There must be a problem.

498
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,633
Hi, Cheng & Hui. I'm Zhou Qianqian.

499
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:28,992
Qianqian,

500
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:30,352
find me a Japanese restaurant this noon

501
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:31,513
and invite Xiaojun and others

502
00:25:31,673 --> 00:25:32,712
for lunch.

503
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:35,192
Miss Li.

504
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:36,633
I have plans this noon.

505
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:39,793
You have plans

506
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,192
or does everyone have plans too?

507
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:43,873
I...

508
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:45,112
Let's go.

509
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:46,472
The last one pays the bills.

510
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:52,673
Sorry, Miss Li.

511
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:55,633
Please wait for me.

512
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:57,913
Wait!

513
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:27,393
Hua.

514
00:26:27,873 --> 00:26:28,913
You're back.

515
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:30,112
Where is mom?

516
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:31,513
She...

517
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:32,913
She just left.

518
00:26:33,753 --> 00:26:34,513
Open the door for me.

519
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:37,992
I'm coming.

520
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:39,273
The keys are here.

521
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:46,873
Come in.

522
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:57,232
Hua.

523
00:26:58,472 --> 00:27:00,712
You truly want to move out?

524
00:27:03,793 --> 00:27:05,793
You still want to defy your mom?

525
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,553
Your mom has your best interest
at heart, you know.

526
00:27:09,352 --> 00:27:09,992
Hua.

527
00:27:09,992 --> 00:27:12,312
Will you talk to me?

528
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:13,712
Go ahead.

529
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:16,712
Listen.

530
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:18,312
You

531
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,553
want to move out and be independent.

532
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:22,832
I support that.

533
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:23,712
Okay?

534
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:25,153
You're all grown up now

535
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,673
and you can't stay with your parents

536
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:27,952
all the time.

537
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:28,913
But

538
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:30,673
the timing

539
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:31,992
is all wrong.

540
00:27:32,312 --> 00:27:33,793
How so?

541
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:34,992
Doesn't mom want me

542
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:36,312
to live with Qin Shi?

543
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:38,112
Your mom is...

544
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,312
Your mom

545
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:44,472
can be quite tyrannical at times
but it's for your own good.

546
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:47,592
But marriage

547
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,472
is not a trivial matter.

548
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:50,393
All right?

549
00:27:50,873 --> 00:27:52,232
You first need to get used to

550
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:54,112
each other's presence.

551
00:27:54,312 --> 00:27:55,112
Okay?

552
00:27:58,312 --> 00:27:59,153
What are you doing, dad?

553
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:03,112
I just want you to think twice

554
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:04,112
before you move out.

555
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:06,633
I get your argument, dad.

556
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,232
But

557
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:09,952
if you don't

558
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:11,112
live with someone else,

559
00:28:11,393 --> 00:28:13,072
you can never understand
the person fully.

560
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:14,913
Only after you spend

561
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:16,553
24 hours with that person,

562
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:17,673
you'll feel

563
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:20,513
the human side of someone

564
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:22,192
who's always

565
00:28:25,352 --> 00:28:26,913
glamorous on the outside.

566
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:28,232
Do you get me?

567
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:29,513
I do.

568
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:32,033
Like hell I do.

569
00:28:32,393 --> 00:28:33,793
How long do you two know each other?

570
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:35,112
And you're living together now?

571
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,232
This is too fast.

572
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:38,033
You're not

573
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:39,592
taking her seriously.

574
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,072
I'm telling you.

575
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:42,793
Love

576
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,753
takes time to nurture.

577
00:28:44,753 --> 00:28:46,033
It's not a byproduct

578
00:28:46,712 --> 00:28:48,992
of impetuousness and irrationality.

579
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:49,793
Okay?

580
00:28:50,553 --> 00:28:51,153
Dad.

581
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:52,633
How long did it take you
to fall in love with mom?

582
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:57,112
It took me...

583
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:05,592
Three seconds.

584
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,592
Just three seconds.

585
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:15,592
When I first met your mother,

586
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:17,192
three seconds

587
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:18,273
was enough to make me go.

588
00:29:18,472 --> 00:29:19,433
Oh, no.

589
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,472
My life is over.

590
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:24,192
I can never ever

591
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:25,232
fall in love

592
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,433
with another woman again.

593
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:38,633
Your mom and I

594
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:41,232
were in love at first sight.

595
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:42,873
Wrong.

596
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,472
Mom said

597
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:45,832
she didn't even notice you.

598
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:48,913
She was just denying it.

599
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:49,873
You know

600
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,192
how prideful she is.

601
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:54,673
Although that was

602
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:56,793
a love at first sight,

603
00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:57,673
we did

604
00:29:57,913 --> 00:29:59,112
date for a year

605
00:29:59,112 --> 00:30:02,273
before we got married.

606
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,153
Dad, tell me.

607
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:08,312
Is Qin Shi a great woman?

608
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:09,873
She is.

609
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:10,873
Is she beautiful?

610
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:13,153
Truth be told.

611
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,753
I want to marry a wonderful

612
00:30:15,753 --> 00:30:17,192
and beautiful woman

613
00:30:17,393 --> 00:30:18,793
quickly.

614
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,753
Can you blame me for that?

615
00:30:21,673 --> 00:30:22,712
I

616
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,352
have no problem with it.

617
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:27,072
I'm just worried about your mom.

618
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:29,232
But isn't this what mom wants?

619
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:31,793
Your mom

620
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:33,992
was just pretending.

621
00:30:35,072 --> 00:30:35,992
We're a family.

622
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:36,793
If something is bothering you,

623
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,112
let's talk it out.

624
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:40,433
You know

625
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:42,232
your mom's temper.

626
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:45,112
She always does something crazy.

627
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,712
I'm just concerned

628
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:49,673
that what if she did
something dangerous to Qin?

629
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:50,592
What should we do?

630
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:53,633
What do you mean?

631
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,033
I'm Yang Hua.

632
00:30:59,033 --> 00:30:59,832
Where are you?

633
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:01,913
Okay.

634
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:05,472
(Hi.)

635
00:31:05,992 --> 00:31:08,072
(This must be Cheng & Hui Law Firm.)

636
00:31:08,673 --> 00:31:09,673
(May I know)

637
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:11,952
(if there's a lawyer by the name of)

638
00:31:11,952 --> 00:31:13,873
(Qin Shi here?)

639
00:31:14,393 --> 00:31:16,312
(She's young. Early 30s.)

640
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:18,673
(I'm looking for Miss Qin)

641
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,072
(for a consultation.)

642
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:22,232
(They say she's a good lawyer.)

643
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,560
(Cheng & Hui Law Firm)

644
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:32,433
Ms. She,

645
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:33,472
I already told you

646
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:34,312
on the phone just now

647
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,712
that without an appointment,

648
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:36,793
you cannot

649
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:37,873
consult Miss Qin.

650
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:39,033
Miss.

651
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:40,033
I'm already here.

652
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,793
Just inform Miss Qin, please.

653
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:43,273
I just want to see her.

654
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:45,112
I won't bother her at all.

655
00:31:45,592 --> 00:31:48,072
We're relatives. She knows me.

656
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:49,033
Ms. She.

657
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:50,352
This is a private office area.

658
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:51,393
No trespassing allowed.

659
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,112
Regardless of your relationship

660
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:53,913
with Miss Qin,

661
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:54,753
you have to make an appointment

662
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:55,753
to see here.

663
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,312
If you will not relent,

664
00:31:57,312 --> 00:31:58,513
I will call the police.

665
00:31:59,712 --> 00:32:00,673
Call the police?

666
00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:02,553
I'm not a criminal.

667
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:04,192
I pass by here

668
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:06,153
and want to say hi to her.

669
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:09,153
I don't have to go inside.

670
00:32:09,153 --> 00:32:10,312
Please call

671
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:11,232
Miss Qin now.

672
00:32:11,592 --> 00:32:13,952
Tell her Yang Hua's mother is here.

673
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,472
She will come to see me.

674
00:32:16,112 --> 00:32:17,913
It's the lunch hour now.

675
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:19,352
Miss Qin is out for lunch.

676
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:21,153
Madam.

677
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:24,433
You're Yang Hua's mother?

678
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:25,913
Yes, I am.

679
00:32:26,472 --> 00:32:27,352
You are...?

680
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:32,033
God knows when the candidate

681
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:32,753
for the 11th floor

682
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:33,873
will be finalized.

683
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,513
I'm sick of

684
00:32:35,513 --> 00:32:37,192
picking sides every day.

685
00:32:38,153 --> 00:32:39,312
They fight among themselves

686
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:40,633
but we always end up as the victims.

687
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:43,513
Such is the rule of the game.

688
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:44,673
Being treated to a meal

689
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,072
is better than being treated to nothing.

690
00:32:47,153 --> 00:32:47,952
I

691
00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:49,312
envy Wu Fei now.

692
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:49,712
If only

693
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:51,153
I was as determined as she is.

694
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:53,793
She comes from a rich family
and can always rely on them.

695
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:55,393
Of course, she fears nothing.

696
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:56,832
We can't compare to her.

697
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:58,873
Let's go.

698
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,232
I like your lipstick.

699
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:20,633
Which color code is it?

700
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:26,553
Sorry.

701
00:33:26,553 --> 00:33:27,393
It's limited edition.

702
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:29,472
It's all sold out.

703
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:51,873
Where is Miss Qin?

704
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:54,033
She received a call

705
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:54,913
and went back to the firm.

706
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:55,952
Oh.

707
00:33:56,312 --> 00:33:57,033
She wants you

708
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:58,033
to foot the bill first

709
00:33:58,472 --> 00:33:59,472
and show her the receipt

710
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:00,393
to claim from her.

711
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:06,753
This law firm is huge.

712
00:34:07,832 --> 00:34:09,272
This is just one of the two floors we own.

713
00:34:09,473 --> 00:34:11,032
The floor above is ours too.

714
00:34:15,592 --> 00:34:17,433
Madam, this is my name card.

715
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:18,673
Thank you.

716
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,312
Miss Li.

717
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:23,193
I hope I didn't interrupt

718
00:34:23,193 --> 00:34:24,592
your lunch plan.

719
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:25,953
Just go eat.

720
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:27,193
I can wait here.

721
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:27,913
I'll be fine.

722
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,272
It's okay, Madam.

723
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:30,832
Miss Qin will be here soon.

724
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:32,032
I'll keep you company meanwhile.

725
00:34:33,193 --> 00:34:33,913
It's no bother at all.

726
00:34:35,592 --> 00:34:36,312
Miss Li.

727
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:38,873
Are you close to Miss Qin?

728
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:40,473
Yes, I am.

729
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:42,352
We know each other
for more than two years now.

730
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:44,713
You must be here superior.

731
00:34:45,312 --> 00:34:46,153
No.

732
00:34:46,272 --> 00:34:47,592
Don't say that.

733
00:34:47,913 --> 00:34:48,993
In this law firm,

734
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:50,552
everyone is equal.

735
00:34:50,552 --> 00:34:51,752
We are all colleagues.

736
00:34:52,272 --> 00:34:53,312
That is what

737
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:55,153
a leader always says.

738
00:34:56,272 --> 00:34:57,832
I just want to know

739
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:00,072
what kind of person Miss Qin is.

740
00:35:00,913 --> 00:35:02,832
She's a wonderful lawyer.

741
00:35:02,832 --> 00:35:03,792
One of the best

742
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:05,312
in domestic affairs.

743
00:35:06,032 --> 00:35:06,832
Why, Madam?

744
00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:08,592
You don't know her very well?

745
00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:10,233
Of course, I do.

746
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:14,312
I know her very well.

747
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:16,233
But

748
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:19,233
I only see her after work.

749
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,153
We have all many sides to us.

750
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:23,592
What we're like after work

751
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:24,393
is not necessarily

752
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:25,512
what we're like during work.

753
00:35:25,512 --> 00:35:26,792
Don't you agree?

754
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,713
I couldn't agree more.

755
00:35:28,713 --> 00:35:29,832
Miss Qin

756
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:32,352
is a very capable lawyer.

757
00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:34,873
She's proactive

758
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:37,832
and competitive.

759
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:40,473
Her forte lies in

760
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,272
divorces and asset disputes.

761
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:44,352
So many people came here for her.

762
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:45,352
Her next available appointment

763
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,393
is after three months.

764
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,352
How much does she earn per month?

765
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:50,993
Madam.

766
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:53,552
This involves her privacy

767
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:55,473
so it's best if you ask her yourself.

768
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:13,312
Miss Qin.

769
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:18,153
Miss Li.

770
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:21,552
Have we met before?

771
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:23,272
Have we?

772
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,193
You look familiar.

773
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:27,792
Which high school did you go to?

774
00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:30,312
I'm not from Pujiang

775
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:31,272
but I have been here

776
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,393
for more than a decade.

777
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:36,633
Do you know the Pujiang dialect?

778
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:37,873
I can understand

779
00:36:38,673 --> 00:36:40,112
but I can't speak it

780
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,112
very well.

781
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:45,552
Understanding it is enough.

782
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:47,592
Are you married?

783
00:36:47,993 --> 00:36:48,832
No.

784
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,352
I'm still single.

785
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:52,673
I know

786
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:54,953
you are busy with your career

787
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:57,272
so you don't have time for a love life.

788
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:02,032
Miss Li.

789
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:03,873
Go back to your work.

790
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:05,312
(Set as Lockscreen Wallpaper)
I shouldn't keep you here.

791
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:07,433
It's okay, Madam.

792
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:08,512
Miss Qin

793
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:09,552
will be here soon.

794
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:12,913
It's still early anyway.

795
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,752
Isn't this a photo of my son?

796
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:21,352
You know him?

797
00:37:23,193 --> 00:37:25,913
James Yang, Yang Hua.

798
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:28,153
Everyone in this firm

799
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:29,633
knows him.

800
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:31,752
Your son and your daughter-in-law

801
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:32,673
are famous

802
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:34,552
in our law firm.

803
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,032
Daughter-in-law?

804
00:37:37,873 --> 00:37:39,193
Who is my daughter-in-law?

805
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:40,433
My son isn't...

806
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:40,913
Mother-in-law.

807
00:37:43,873 --> 00:37:44,752
Why are you here?

808
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:50,552
Since Miss Qin has come back,

809
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:52,072
I should go now, Madam.

810
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:00,512
I'll leave you two be.

811
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:08,112
You...

812
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:09,072
Don't speak now.

813
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:11,032
Yang Hua is on his way here.

814
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,673
You already informed Yang Hua?

815
00:38:14,112 --> 00:38:15,393
You have two options now.

816
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:17,552
Wait until Yang Hua arrives

817
00:38:17,552 --> 00:38:18,633
and takes you away

818
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:20,233
or we can have a chat.

819
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:22,552
Where?

820
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:25,713
Don't worry about that.

821
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:28,312
Before that,

822
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:29,512
I need you

823
00:38:29,512 --> 00:38:30,752
to tell me everything

824
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:32,393
you told Li Dai.

825
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,592
Don't spare any details.

826
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:34,993
Come.

827
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:40,153
Good afternoon, Miss Qin.

828
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:40,953
Please come with me.

829
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:43,552
The consultation room

830
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:44,633
is ready.

831
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:48,873
Here, please.

832
00:39:09,072 --> 00:39:10,112
Where are your shoes?

833
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:14,832
It's only the two of us here.

834
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:17,552
Say

835
00:39:17,552 --> 00:39:18,592
what you have to say.

836
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:19,913
Why did you lie?

837
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:21,193
Why did you

838
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,832
tell everyone you're married to my son?

839
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:25,153
Yang Hua and I are dating

840
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:26,993
to get married.

841
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:28,673
Weren't you supportive of this too?

842
00:39:28,873 --> 00:39:29,873
It's all thanks to you.

843
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:31,153
Without your support,

844
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:32,512
we wouldn't be able

845
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:33,473
to live together this soon.

846
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:34,913
I must say

847
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:36,673
you have an excellent son.

848
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:38,832
He is capable and he takes care
of the household very well.

849
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:40,032
He will be

850
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,112
my perfect househusband.

851
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:42,193
Enough.

852
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,832
Spare me the sarcasm.

853
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:44,873
I'm not

854
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:46,032
a sheltered housewife

855
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:47,673
who knows nothing about this world.

856
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:49,913
My son and you

857
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:51,112
aren't dating for real.

858
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:52,633
I know that very well.

859
00:39:56,153 --> 00:39:57,473
What makes you say that?

860
00:39:57,713 --> 00:39:59,352
At my age,

861
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:01,153
I won't say
I have taught 10,000 students

862
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:02,032
but I have seen 8,000.

863
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,713
I know very well who

864
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:05,032
will get along together.

865
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:08,752
Truth be told,

866
00:40:09,352 --> 00:40:10,592
I came here today

867
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:11,592
to test you.

868
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:13,633
I didn't know

869
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:15,032
you are

870
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:16,433
a lawyer for real.

871
00:40:17,193 --> 00:40:18,713
Yang Hua is my son.

872
00:40:19,473 --> 00:40:20,792
As a mom,

873
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:22,552
I believe my son is the best.

874
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,193
But objectively,

875
00:40:25,953 --> 00:40:27,512
you are way better than my son.

876
00:40:28,153 --> 00:40:29,233
You can do better than Yang Hua.

877
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:31,993
With your look, intelligence,

878
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:33,673
ability, and job,

879
00:40:34,072 --> 00:40:35,153
you can definitely find

880
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:36,112
someone better than him.

881
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:38,512
You flatter me.

882
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:39,552
I'm not.

883
00:40:40,953 --> 00:40:41,873
Miss Qin.

884
00:40:42,713 --> 00:40:44,272
For the 70 phone calls

885
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:45,873
an old woman like me made to you

886
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:47,272
and for this precious

887
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:48,752
meeting opportunity,

888
00:40:49,352 --> 00:40:51,032
can you tell me the truth?

889
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:52,032
What is your relationship

890
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,873
to my son?

891
00:40:57,953 --> 00:40:59,312
Yang Hua and I

892
00:40:59,312 --> 00:41:00,832
will get married soon.

893
00:41:01,112 --> 00:41:02,393
Impossible.

894
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,953
You marry for love.

895
00:41:04,153 --> 00:41:05,393
How long do you two know each other?

896
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:06,713
Where is the love?

897
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:10,393
Why do you want

898
00:41:10,393 --> 00:41:11,713
to marry Yang Hua?

899
00:41:12,112 --> 00:41:13,953
What is so good about my son

900
00:41:13,953 --> 00:41:15,233
that you want to marry him

901
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:16,352
and not somebody else?

902
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:20,433
Hua.

903
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:21,032
Mom.

904
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,393
I'll tell you everything.

905
00:41:24,312 --> 00:41:24,873
Sorry

906
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:26,233
for the trouble, Miss Qin.

907
00:41:26,512 --> 00:41:27,873
The situation has exceeded

908
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:28,953
my expectation.

909
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,633
Let's terminate our partnership here.

910
00:41:30,832 --> 00:41:32,032
Let me tell her.

911
00:41:33,913 --> 00:41:34,512
Have a seat.

912
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:41,433
Mom.

913
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:42,633
I'll give you the answer.

914
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,393
Stop.

915
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:45,832
Yang Hua.

916
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:48,752
What partnership were you on about?

917
00:41:49,193 --> 00:41:49,953
What is your relationship

918
00:41:49,953 --> 00:41:51,433
to Miss Qin?

919
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,312
Tell me.

920
00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:53,592
I won't be mad.

921
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:57,193
Don't be afraid.

922
00:41:58,072 --> 00:41:59,393
Is she

923
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,072
blackmailing you?

924
00:42:01,072 --> 00:42:02,352
Tell me.

925
00:42:05,953 --> 00:42:06,512
Mom.

926
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:09,393
Just let me tell you everything.

927
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:11,713
In terms of partnership,

928
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:12,473
for me,

929
00:42:12,473 --> 00:42:13,713
marriage is a kind of partnership.

930
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:15,792
You asked me just now

931
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:17,433
what was so good about Yang Hua

932
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:18,552
that I would marry him
and not somebody else.

933
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:20,072
And the answer is

934
00:42:20,312 --> 00:42:20,873
nothing.

935
00:42:23,272 --> 00:42:25,193
I want to marry Yang Hua

936
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:25,752
but I didn't say

937
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:26,792
we are in love.

938
00:42:27,393 --> 00:42:27,792
What...

939
00:42:28,552 --> 00:42:29,673
What do you mean?

940
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:30,953
I mean we're not

941
00:42:30,953 --> 00:42:32,233
marrying for love.

942
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:34,032
Love only lasts for 18 months

943
00:42:34,032 --> 00:42:35,433
but a marriage lasts forever.

944
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:37,112
I don't think

945
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:38,512
fluctuating hormones

946
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:39,312
provide a good basis

947
00:42:39,312 --> 00:42:40,673
for a stable legal bond.

948
00:42:41,512 --> 00:42:42,752
I want to get married

949
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:43,913
because being single

950
00:42:43,913 --> 00:42:45,473
is too costly.

951
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:46,433
I'm busy.

952
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:47,312
I don't have time to date.

953
00:42:47,913 --> 00:42:48,633
Yang Hua is the same.

954
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,873
He wants to get married. He doesn't
want to fall in love.

955
00:42:51,592 --> 00:42:52,832
We struck a deal

956
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:54,272
and decide to get married.

957
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,352
