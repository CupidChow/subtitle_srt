Cheers!

You're back.

21
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,250
That was quick.

22
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,490
Come on. Hurry.

23
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,731
Today's stew is fantastic.

24
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:02,410
Trust me.

25
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,770
Sit down and eat together.

26
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,291
Listen,

27
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,530
the stew today is...

28
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,330
What did you tell her?

29
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,651
I said what I had to say.

30
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:25,410
Don't worry.

31
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,770
I remember what you told me.

32
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,050
But instead of husband,

33
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,011
I said I was your boyfriend.

34
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,530
I figured
that would be more appropriate.

35
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:33,690
Do you know who she is?

36
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,211
She said she was your schoolmate.

37
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,731
Given how she knew the passcode,

38
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:39,371
to your house,

39
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,890
I assumed you two were close friends.

40
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,211
It should be okay

41
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,410
for her to know this, right?

42
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,731
If you have something to say,
say it out loud.

43
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:47,330
Don't whisper among yourselves.

44
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:09,130
Well,

45
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,651
I guess this is the perfect time
for introductions.

46
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,250
His name is Yang Hua.

47
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,050
He is my boyfriend.

48
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:22,410
This is Meimei.

49
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:23,690
She is my schoolmate

50
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,491
and my sister-in-law.

51
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:31,851
Hello, Sister-in-law.

52
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:32,611
Don't.

53
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:33,611
I don't let just anyone

54
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,930
call me by that title.

55
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,011
Until you guys

56
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,210
sort out your relationship,

57
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,491
just call me Meimei.

58
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,090
Didn't you say
you were working overtime?

59
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,451
Why did you

60
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:49,731
come back so fast

61
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,250
when you heard
I was drinking with your boyfriend?

62
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,930
Look at how much you're sweating.

63
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,451
Well, I was tempted by alcohol.

64
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,851
Perfect timing.

65
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,130
We just got to the part

66
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,491
where you two first met.

67
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,410
He said you two met

68
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,130
in Hokkaido.

69
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,130
Well, if memory serves me right,

70
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,491
I was the one
who went to Hokkaido with you

71
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:10,410
that time.

72
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,650
- Oh, gross! You...
- I'll get the paper.

73
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,210
You didn't choke, did you?

74
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,650
Well, well. You hid your man well.

75
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:30,090
Two years.

76
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,970
Not a single peep about this.

77
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,611
Colour me impressed.

78
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:39,491
Here. Wipe.

79
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,370
I'll do it.

80
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,611
Here.

81
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:02,291
Well, I'm very happy to meet Mr. Yang Hua

82
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,451
and honoured

83
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,891
to be the first

84
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:07,171
and only one

85
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:09,291
who knows your secret.

86
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,891
I don't know why

87
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,370
you guys have to keep

88
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,051
your relationship a secret,

89
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,851
but I'm happy for you two.

90
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,051
A... A bit more.

91
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,370
Congratulations on getting together.

92
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,970
Yang Hua, from now on,

93
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,051
we

94
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,491
are a family.

95
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,690
Let's add each other on WeChat.

96
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:33,771
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:42,930
I don't mean to offend,

98
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,130
but I don't really use WeChat.

99
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,930
I only have

100
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,530
about six contacts in there.

101
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,331
Six?

102
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,331
Who are you fooling?

103
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,020
(Total six WeChat friends)

104
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:01,771
It can't be.

105
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,291
If it weren't because of how expensive

106
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,530
it is to call and text,

107
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,451
I probably wouldn't change

108
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,530
using a smartphone.

109
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:11,410
I think a phone that you can use to call

110
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,690
is good enough.

111
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,130
You don't have friends?

112
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,051
I do.

113
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,171
But I don't need

114
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,731
the number of friends
on social media applications

115
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:23,731
to prove that.

116
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,410
There is too much information

117
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,571
and excessive socialisation

118
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,690
nowadays.

119
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,611
What you post on social media

120
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:30,810
can't truly depict or reflect

121
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,011
your real life either.

122
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,011
And I don't need

123
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:34,930
to scrutinise my friends' lives

124
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,370
to show that I care.

125
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,291
People get anxious

126
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,331
because they know too much.

127
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:40,970
They can get too much information

128
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,331
and they can know too much.

129
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:43,810
On the contrary,

130
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,451
I think ignorance can be bliss.

131
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,130
What is he talking about?

132
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,090
I think he is right.

133
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,571
Right?

134
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:00,051
Let's take you, for example.

135
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,690
You want to know everything

136
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,690
and get yourself involved in everything.

137
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,650
You're keeping Wenyu

138
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,410
on such a tight leash.

139
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,851
Why are you making this about me?

140
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,291
No, you... Carry on.

141
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:10,771
Have you guys heard

142
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:12,051
of the six degrees of separation?

143
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:13,970
Basically, it's the idea

144
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,011
that all people

145
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,171
are six or fewer social connections

146
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:17,530
away from one another.

147
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,690
In short, you can know anyone

148
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,530
in six connections at most.

149
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,210
So I try to keep

150
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,650
the people I keep in touch with

151
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:25,690
strictly within six.

152
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,810
That way, I can avoid

153
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,250
forming unnecessary relations

154
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,291
and social connections.

155
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,810
The simpler things are,

156
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,530
the easier life is.

157
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,691
The beef is ready.

158
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,291
Try this.

159
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:46,611
This is pork.

160
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,251
Here you go.

161
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:01,731
Master,

162
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,491
you've sparked

163
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:05,010
my curiosity.

164
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,291
You seem to be insightful

165
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,131
about how to minimise

166
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,650
one's troubles.

167
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,970
Let me ask you something then.

168
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,010
How much wealth do you think

169
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,570
a person needs

170
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:16,650
to attain

171
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,570
true happiness?

172
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,251
Is the meat not tasty

173
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:22,530
or the alcohol not good?

174
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,851
Why talk about something
so philosophical?

175
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:24,811
I mean,

176
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,291
we're all human at core.

177
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:26,890
Don't interrupt.

178
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,611
I like listening to him talk.

179
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:29,491
Answer me.

180
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:30,570
4,500.

181
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,691
You can live comfortably

182
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,010
with 4,500 a month.

183
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:37,931
In Pujiang,

184
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:38,931
that's not even enough

185
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:40,770
to pay mortgage.

186
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,770
Taking a loan to buy a house itself

187
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,291
is a sign of inflated desire.

188
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,650
If you live alone,

189
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,090
you can rent.

190
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,811
25 square meters will do.

191
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,890
25 square meters?

192
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,611
Rent would cost you 2,000 at least.

193
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,371
And that's outside the central district.

194
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:55,611
You can save more
if you rent with someone else.

195
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,770
Try to cut down
on using electrical appliances.

196
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,291
Read more

197
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,371
and watch less television.

198
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:03,530
Books can help you develop

199
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,010
more independent thinking skills.

200
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,491
Exercising more
and staying off the internet

201
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:08,811
can reduce your chances
of gaining weight,

202
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:09,650
increase your immunity,

203
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,291
and reduce medical expenses.

204
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,970
A fridge is unnecessary expense too.

205
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,731
It'll only make you

206
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:14,970
store more food.

207
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,330
It's neither sustainable nor healthy.

208
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,890
And air conditioning
is even less necessary.

209
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,090
I think the human body

210
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,691
can regulate
its temperature well enough.

211
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,770
So you can also reduce carbon emissions.

212
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:27,330
OK.

213
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:30,371
You would need clothes, wouldn't you?

214
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:31,890
Fashion itself

215
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,890
is a consumer scam.

216
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,890
All those sales and discounts

217
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,851
are just promotional tactics.

218
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,090
I think

219
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,090
a few sets of clothes
are more than enough

220
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,691
to get you through four seasons.

221
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,650
Fine.

222
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,210
You still need to eat, don't you?

223
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:45,890
Listen.

224
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,371
Groceries are expensive now.

225
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:48,450
I mean,

226
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,530
even if I give you 1,000

227
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,450
a month for food,

228
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,410
that isn't much, is it?

229
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,371
That's too much.

230
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,731
Some people have unhealthy attitudes

231
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:56,330
towards food.

232
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,410
They waste more than they actually eat.

233
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:00,131
A healthy diet

234
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,051
doesn't require

235
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:01,890
fancy meals every day.

236
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,450
Scrambled eggs and tomatoes,

237
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,330
chicken breast or fish fillet,

238
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,811
vegetable and tofu soup,

239
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:07,890
and rice.

240
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,890
You've got

241
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,450
your vitamins,

242
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,770
protein, and carbohydrates.

243
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,450
All of that

244
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:14,811
won't even cost you 3,000 a month.

245
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,251
God of Wealth will use 500 a month.

246
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:17,931
That means I still have 1,000 left

247
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:18,731
in case of emergencies.

248
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,010
Hang on.

249
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,570
You would go that far to skimp and save,

250
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,090
but you'll spend 500 on God of Wealth

251
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,970
every month?

252
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,090
God of Wealth is his pet tortoise.

253
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:30,731
He even has a pet?

254
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,530
Master,

255
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:37,410
is that how you're living

256
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,410
right now?

257
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,371
Well, no.

258
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:42,731
It's the life

259
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:44,330
I aspire to have.

260
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,611
But I haven't been able
to achieve it yet.

261
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,090
I need to work harder.

262
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,851
Whatever for?

263
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:51,851
You're already living in retirement.

264
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,491
No, no, no. This won't do.

265
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:54,491
You can't be dating like this.

266
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:55,851
How are you going to get married?

267
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,770
Well, I think we can do away

268
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,890
with marriage too.

269
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:05,611
Naughty.

270
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,051
I'll trouble you

271
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:22,491
to get me something to drink then.

272
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,530
Also,

273
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,611
the drain is clogged.

274
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,090
Go get something to fix that.

275
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,691
I thought I unclogged it?

276
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,811
I think it's still clogged.

277
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:30,890
At this rate,

278
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,691
she'll definitely find out.

279
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,491
Find a place

280
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:33,530
and hang out for a while.

281
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,450
Wait for me to get in touch.

282
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:37,090
Hurry and get out now.

283
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,330
Bye.

284
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,010
Wait...

285
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:05,970
It's just the two of us now.

286
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,090
Talk.

287
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:10,251
About what?

288
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:11,811
How much younger is he?

289
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:16,530
Why are you so nosy?

290
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:19,010
You are going to explain everything

291
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,530
to me today.

292
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:26,731
28.

293
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,010
28?

294
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:33,371
The prime age.

295
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,330
All right.

296
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:41,251
You've convinced me

297
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:42,131
once again

298
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,650
that old sayings

299
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,491
are passed down for a reason.

300
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,051
If you work hard enough,

301
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:48,770
you'll always get it.

302
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,051
So do your best.

303
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:53,890
What?

304
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,491
Do you think

305
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:55,731
I'm just going
to sweep that under the rug?

306
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:56,970
Listen here, you.

307
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,611
We knew each other

308
00:13:58,611 --> 00:13:59,770
even before our bossoms developed.

309
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,410
We are true childhood friends.

310
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,450
Our love is as solid as gold.

311
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,210
Why did you hide

312
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,171
your relationship from me?

313
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,611
Did you know I came here

314
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,691
ready to lay it all out on you?

315
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:10,010
But when I stepped into the elevator,

316
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,491
I saw

317
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:11,330
a decent looking guy

318
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,330
living in your house.

319
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,051
My heart was instantly elated.

320
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,251
But I don't understand.

321
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,131
Why hide this

322
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,811
from me?

323
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,051
What's there to hide from me?

324
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:26,010
You remember how everyone

325
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,770
was against it when you and Tao Junhui

326
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,210
got together?

327
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,410
Who was it
that stood firmly by your side?

328
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,410
And when you guys decided
you weren't meant to be

329
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,330
and wanted to break up,

330
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,371
who was it that supported you
unconditionally?

331
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:36,811
Did you forget all about that?

332
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:41,811
Yes.

333
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:43,171
You did give a lot of ridiculous

334
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:44,210
reasons and excuses,

335
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,291
and I knew you were lying.

336
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,650
I have an idea

337
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,131
about the real reason,

338
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,371
but I chose not to ask

339
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,051
because I know

340
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,530
that once

341
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,851
you were ready

342
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:55,770
and you got over it,

343
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,291
you would come to me

344
00:14:57,851 --> 00:15:00,450
in the first moment

345
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:02,650
and tell only me about it.

346
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:03,650
Because

347
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,811
we are the best of best friends.

348
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:08,330
We know each other's

349
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,491
deepest feelings, we...

350
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:10,970
Meimei,

351
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,691
I want to apologise.

352
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:15,090
I'll be honest with you.

353
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,931
Yang Hua and I...

354
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:17,171
Don't say anything.

355
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:19,051
I... I'm not finished yet.

356
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,530
Why didn't you say anything sooner?

357
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,210
Now...

358
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,131
Now you tell me...

359
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:31,251
It... It has been two years

360
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,410
since you broke up

361
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:33,770
with Tao Junhui.

362
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,811
You wouldn't date someone else

363
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,530
and you said you couldn't
even bring yourself

364
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,851
to get interested in another man.

365
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,570
I was worried sick, you know?

366
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,410
I was afraid
you had lost all hope in love.

367
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:47,731
I hate it

368
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:48,691
when they say
you wouldn't be able to get married.

369
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:49,410
I hate them calling you

370
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,450
a "leftover" woman.

371
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,611
"Leftover"? What "leftover"?

372
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:56,131
I just want my Qin Shi

373
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:57,090
to be happy.

374
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,890
She can do whatever she wants

375
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,450
as long as it makes her happy.

376
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,410
She is excellent and perfect.

377
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,171
She is the absolute best.

378
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,210
I just...

379
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,010
I just want you to smile every day.

380
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:09,890
What do they know?

381
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,770
But when I found out just now

382
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,090
that you had a boyfriend

383
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,251
of two years

384
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:17,890
and I didn't know anything about it,

385
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,811
I felt like

386
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,450
the biggest fool.

387
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,291
It just felt like

388
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,371
I wasn't any different

389
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,530
from anyone else.

390
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,131
Doesn't that just make me
a nobody to you?

391
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:27,171
I was wrong...

392
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:28,931
It was my bad...

393
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:29,970
Don't cry. It was my fault.

394
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,650
Oh, dear...

395
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,570
I felt so hurt...

396
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,171
There, there...

397
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,731
I felt like I was just like

398
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,410
that Qin Wenyu

399
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,410
and your...

400
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,650
and your colleague.

401
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,330
I was just someone "ordinary" to you.

402
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,851
I lost confidence in myself, I...

403
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,131
What's more,

404
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,611
I mean, Qin Wenyu...

405
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:51,371
You know what a mess

406
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:53,010
he and I are in right now.

407
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,010
But I...

408
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,650
I still set my teeth

409
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,731
and refused to get a divorce.

410
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:58,611
What...
What do you think I'm holding on for?

411
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:00,330
It's... It's because

412
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,851
I wanted to show you some positivity.

413
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:04,011
I wanted to let you know

414
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:07,210
that there is true love.

415
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,131
That marriage isn't the tomb of love.

416
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,011
I know what you're afraid of.

417
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:14,170
I want to tell you
that it isn't that bad.

418
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,011
That marriage
is nothing to be scared about.

419
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,011
But I didn't expect myself

420
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,210
to be in this mess either...

421
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:23,611
It's like a slap to my face.

422
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:25,970
You... You don't even know how pressured

423
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,771
I feel...

424
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,891
You...

425
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:32,690
Stop that... I'm not drunk...

426
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,450
Stop that...

427
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,531
Hug me.

428
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:40,131
I'm so stressed...

429
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,450
- Give me a hug...
- Let me hug you.

430
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:46,131
You...

431
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:50,020
You ungrateful little...
How dare you laugh at me?

432
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:54,090
I'm ungrateful...

433
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,570
Quick. Get another shot.

434
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,411
Hey, babe.

435
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,251
Do you know what time it is now?

436
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,810
What time is it?

437
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,930
It's already so late.

438
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,090
(Don't tell me)

439
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,251
(you're still at the office.)

440
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:44,810
(Smart.)

441
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,011
(You got it right again.)

442
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,570
I'm warning you.

443
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,131
You better not be skinnier than me

444
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,930
at our wedding.

445
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,450
Hurry up and go home and get some rest.

446
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,411
This is an order, Mr. Tao.

447
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,210
Right now.

448
00:18:57,411 --> 00:18:58,131
Get up.

449
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:58,930
Grab your briefcase.

450
00:18:59,170 --> 00:18:59,731
Turn off the lights.

451
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:00,570
And leave.

452
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,840
(New World Law Firm)

453
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:02,771
I'm at the parking lot.

454
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:03,371
The signal is bad here.

455
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:04,411
I'll call you later.

456
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,531
(It's fine.
I'll wait for you to get into the car.)

457
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,491
Oh, right.

458
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:09,251
Someone asked me about you today.

459
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,411
Who?

460
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,970
(Your junior, Qin Shi.)

461
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:16,651
(One more thing. Why did you lie to me?)

462
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:19,570
What lie?

463
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:20,771
You and her

464
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:21,891
were on the same debate team.

465
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:23,690
Why did you make it sound like

466
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,930
you don't know her at all?

467
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,611
I was practically retired

468
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:29,851
by the time she joined the team.

469
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,450
What did she ask about?

470
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,970
Does she know about us?

471
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,011
No.

472
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:37,891
People are already talking

473
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:40,170
because I got into the law firm
because of my uncle.

474
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:41,651
If they found out

475
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:42,690
about my dad,

476
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:44,970
the rumours would run wild.

477
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,210
I just said

478
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,411
that I knew someone in Xi Mei PR.

479
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,450
That's good.

480
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,131
We don't need many

481
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:52,251
to know about our relationship.

482
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,170
Why does it sound like

483
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,050
you don't want others

484
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,330
to know about us either?

485
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:02,771
Now that's entrapment.

486
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:04,251
I'm in the car.

487
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,050
I'll call you later.

488
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,570
Don't even think
about muddling your way out of this.

489
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,371
Don't you want to know

490
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:10,930
what she asked about?

491
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,251
What else?

492
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,330
It had to be work-related.

493
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,851
She wanted to know

494
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:18,131
what cases I was working on

495
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:19,771
and if any of them
were connected to Luowei Yulan.

496
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,611
How... How did you know?

497
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:25,851
Silly.

498
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:27,450
Everyone knows

499
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,050
there's a 25 million debt dispute

500
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,330
going on between Cheng & Hui

501
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,251
and Luowei Yulan right now.

502
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,531
You're the only one still in the dark.

503
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,891
And I saw Qin Shi

504
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:36,330
at the party too.

505
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:37,450
This is the matter

506
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,330
she's most interested in right now.

507
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,251
Gosh, Junhui!

508
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:43,170
You're amazing!

509
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:45,251
Sometimes, I think there's nothing

510
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:46,531
you don't know!

511
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:48,930
Cut the flattery.

512
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,090
What did you tell her?

513
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,090
I didn't tell her anything.

514
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,611
I just promised
I would find out more about it.

515
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,690
As Cheng & Hui's legal assistant,

516
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,251
I'm getting paid by them

517
00:20:58,251 --> 00:20:59,570
and I should work for them.

518
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,371
But as your girlfriend,

519
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:03,690
I can't always

520
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,371
use our relationship

521
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:07,411
to pry more information out of you.

522
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:08,930
I'm conflicted.

523
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,891
I completely respect your decision.

524
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:14,251
Then, as my boyfriend,

525
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,170
do you have any advice for me?

526
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:17,771
None I can tell.

527
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:18,810
See?

528
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,531
You're not keeping your word again.

529
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,611
I'll switch modes and call you back.

530
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:35,690
When have I

531
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,771
ever gone back on my word?

532
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:38,930
I said I respect your decision

533
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,570
but I didn't say
I was going to cooperate.

534
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,411
I must keep the cases I handle

535
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:43,450
strictly confidential.

536
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,411
Especially towards third parties

537
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:46,050
that pose a clash of interest.

538
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:48,330
All the more reason for me
to steer clear.

539
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:49,731
You mean

540
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,210
we're the third party
that has a clash of interest

541
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,651
in the case you're handling.

542
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,131
That means you're working

543
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:57,330
on the Luowei Yulan case.

544
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:58,491
You said that.

545
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,011
I didn't.

546
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,290
I must avoid the risks as I can.

547
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,131
That's all for this subject.

548
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:05,210
I'm driving right now.

549
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,170
I'll let you know when I get home.

550
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:08,210
All right. Drive safely.

551
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:08,690
Love you.

552
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,491
I'm so clever.

553
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,170
I like wine

554
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,570
and being with you forever.

555
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,531
I'm going to throw up.

556
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:15,050
I just ate.

557
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:17,251
Where did you learn this

558
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:18,210
from?

559
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,290
Considering that poor taste?

560
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,210
Who else

561
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,570
could have taught him that but Vivian?

562
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,851
Seriously, you can't look

563
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:24,131
at Qin Wenyu's recent moment posts.

564
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:27,050
It's filled with cheesy pick-up lines.

565
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:28,531
He has thoroughly

566
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:29,371
embarrassed me.

567
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:30,290
A husband like this

568
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,210
certainly opens your eyes

569
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,170
and refreshes what you thought you knew

570
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,651
about the mentally challenged.

571
00:23:37,491 --> 00:23:39,491
My heart isn't on my left.

572
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,011
It's with you.

573
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:42,930
I'm going to throw up.

574
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,210
Please stop reading them out.

575
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,170
Goodness.

576
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,170
What on earth

577
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,450
did you see in him?

578
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:50,731
Well, I would like
to ask you the same question.

579
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:52,011
What did you see

580
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:53,330
in that master of yours?

581
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,771
Apart from his looks.

582
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,611
Good question.

583
00:23:57,891 --> 00:23:58,531
Forget it.

584
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,570
I just think

585
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,371
that since he could get you

586
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:06,050
to leave Tao Junhui,

587
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,170
that means

588
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,411
there must be something good about him.

589
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,970
He is not the reason

590
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,491
why I broke up with Tao Junhui.

591
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:13,531
Really?

592
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,011
I'll take your word for it for now.

593
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:16,771
Either way,

594
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:17,771
it's not as if
I'm someone important or special.

595
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,690
I suppose
I'll take whatever you sell me.

596
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:24,570
I'm sorry.

597
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,651
It's no use, I tell you.

598
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,450
You'll be hearing about this
from me for the rest of your life.

599
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:29,731
I told you.

600
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:30,651
Scorpius

601
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,210
is good for nothing
but petty and holding grudges.

602
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:36,050
Could you

603
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,690
help me keep this a secret

604
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,011
from my parents for now?

605
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,210
No problem.

606
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,731
But

607
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,570
where did you find

608
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,531
this oddball?

609
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:47,570
You haven't told me that yet.

610
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,050
His mind works at atomic-bomb level.

611
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,651
I can't understand

612
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:52,290
a thing he says.

613
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,851
Let's talk about serious business.

614
00:24:57,011 --> 00:24:57,570
All right.

615
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,611
Tell me something I can understand.

616
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,011
I've figured out

617
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,131
who that Vivian is.

618
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:09,611
Really?

619
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,570
A repeat offender.

620
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,210
A professional.

621
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,131
A professional?

622
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:18,930
Oh, no.

623
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,251
Your fool of a brother

624
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:23,131
is up against a professional.
He's doomed.

625
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:26,891
She has a history of fraud.

626
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:29,330
Just released six months ago.

627
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,930
What are we going

628
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:33,731
to do about this?

629
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:34,690
What am I supposed to do?

630
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,891
I'll have to get my mother-in-law

631
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:38,170
to cut off his source of income.

632
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,570
If he still refuses to change,

633
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,731
I guess we'll just have to get divorced.

634
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:41,290
Right?

635
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,290
I, Ren Meimei,

636
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,290
can't let my life

637
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,131
be ruined by a man

638
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:45,731
who believes he was Captain America
in his past life.

639
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,131
Right? That's absurd.

640
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:24,690
I already set the passcode.

641
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,371
It's the day we made our down payment.

642
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:30,251
000725.

643
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:31,651
Remember it.

00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:50,891
Don't move or touch anything.

652
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,690
Let the air clear out
for another two days

653
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,050
and we can start
moving in the furniture.

654
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:57,570
Decor.

655
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:04,771
The renovation was done fast.

656
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:05,570
Really?

657
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,651
I can't wait to move

658
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,611
into our cosy little home with you.

659
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:14,090
What do you think?

660
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:16,330
From now on,

661
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,690
we'll be working and living here.

662
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:23,411
It won't be long

663
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,651
before we'll have a child of our own

664
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,450
and grandchildren.

665
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:28,690
You know?

666
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,651
I can already imagine

667
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:33,371
you sitting there.

668
00:27:33,371 --> 00:27:34,290
- Where?
- There.

669
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,290
Yes.

670
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,690
Many years from now,

671
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,651
on a fair weathered

672
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:40,090
lazy afternoon,

673
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,011
the sun

674
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,731
beaming on your face,

675
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,170
even your age spots

676
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,330
would look adorable.

677
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,851
You're the one that'll get age spots.

678
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,491
All over your face.

679
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:49,690
Here, here, and here.

680
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,371
All covered in age spots.

681
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,411
I'll have age spots

682
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,810
and you'll have a head of white hair,

683
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,371
writing those bills of yours.

684
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,050
Me? Still writing bills

685
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,771
when I have white hair?

686
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:00,090
Well, you're ever the hard worker.

687
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:00,731
To me,

688
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:02,131
you're the greatest lawyer there is.

689
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:05,011
You know?

690
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,810
I think

691
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,090
I'm the happiest person

692
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:09,810
in the world right now.

693
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,411
I feel so blessed.

694
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:12,970
Me too.

695
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,740
♪Because of excuses♪

696
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,420
♪The process diverges our path and throws us off our rhythm♪

697
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,740
♪And throws us off our rhythm♪

698
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:33,460
♪Both hearts are stuck at the junction♪

699
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,251
Yang Hua.

700
00:28:39,491 --> 00:28:40,210
You live here?

701
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,771
Are you looking for Qin Shi?

702
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,851
She's not the only one
who lives in this area.

703
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:48,170
Passing by.

704
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:50,570
Wait.

705
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,771
Those things you bought

706
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,330
won't fix the water tank.

707
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,970
Go downstairs and take a look.

708
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,050
The U-tube is blocked.

709
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:02,970
Don't give me that face.

710
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:04,251
I used to live here.

711
00:29:41,371 --> 00:29:41,930
I don't care

712
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,131
where you came from.

713
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,891
Keep your minimalistic, low desire,

714
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:46,970
antisocial philosophy

715
00:29:47,131 --> 00:29:47,651
whatnot

716
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:48,491
all to yourself.

717
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,011
She is my best friend.

718
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:53,651
If you dare use your set of principles

719
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:54,930
and life values

720
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:55,810
on her,

721
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:56,970
then you're my enemy.

722
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,251
I'll make sure

723
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:01,690
you can only live on a liquid diet
for the rest of your life.

724
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:02,851
Do you understand me?

725
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:05,411
The phone is ringing.

726
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:10,970
Hello?

727
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:13,690
Sir.

728
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,251
I... I'm coming down.

729
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:17,131
Yes, yes. Sorry.

730
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:18,771
Please wait for me.

731
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,050
Okay. Goodbye.

732
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,771
Remember what I told you.

733
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,251
And

734
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:28,210
lock the door.

735
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:29,611
Don't let Qin Shi out.

736
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,131
Bye.

737
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,690
Why's this place so messy?

738
00:30:58,411 --> 00:30:59,290
Miss Qin.

739
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,570
Put on your clothes first.

740
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:44,131
Miss Qin,

741
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,330
where are you going?

742
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,011
To work.

743
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,330
I'm going to be late.

744
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:57,970
It's past 10 p.m.

745
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,050
Everyone is off work now.

746
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,570
Where are you going?

747
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,891
Really? It's already 10 p.m.?

748
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,170
Come on.

749
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,531
I'll take you back to get some rest.

750
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:16,210
Sit.

751
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,290
Listen. You shouldn't go out

752
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,491
after drinking.

753
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:23,411
It's late.

754
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:24,251
It's dangerous.

755
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,651
Also,

756
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:30,210
it's good to be passionate about work.

757
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,651
But now's not the time
to be thinking about work.

758
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:35,970
Why am I telling you these things?

759
00:32:37,011 --> 00:32:37,891
Let me help you get changed.

760
00:32:38,611 --> 00:32:39,210
Time to go to sleep.

761
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,170
Slowly now.

762
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,090
I'll help you lie down,

763
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:50,651
okay?

764
00:32:57,731 --> 00:32:58,891
Here. Lower.

765
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,450
You're so nice.

766
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:35,531
Get some sleep.

767
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:04,930
Miss Qin.

768
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,771
Miss Qin.

769
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:08,530
I'm going to work.

770
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,211
My work is important.

771
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:26,131
It sure is different

772
00:35:26,131 --> 00:35:27,131
with a man in the house.

773
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,851
Why are you sleeping on the floor?

774
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,171
Thanks.

775
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,770
Today is a work day.

776
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:11,371
To avoid interrupting your work,

777
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:13,131
I'll try to keep it short.

778
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,891
Miss Qin,

779
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,971
first of all, thank you

780
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:18,730
for letting me stay here.

781
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,090
After our brief time together
last night,

782
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:22,810
I believe we should

783
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:23,891
speed up

784
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:24,971
our cooperation.

785
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:26,691
Do you agree?

786
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,851
Yes.

787
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,250
Actually,

788
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,171
I have a bad habit

789
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,651
of trying

790
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,010
to go to work whenever I get drunk.

791
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,330
I don't know

792
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,611
when it started.

793
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,371
You don't have to mind me.

794
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:47,131
Usually, I fall asleep on the floor

795
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:48,931
after I take a few steps.

796
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,330
Sorry.

797
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,290
Carry on.

798
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:55,891
Secondly,

799
00:36:56,691 --> 00:36:57,691
I want to apologise

800
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:58,530
for communicating

801
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,090
with your friend and sister-in-law

802
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,810
without your permission

803
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,010
last night.

804
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,931
I didn't think there was anything wrong

805
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:07,891
with it at first,

806
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,050
but now I think

807
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,411
we can't keep this a secret
for long anymore.

808
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:11,411
So

809
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,651
how do you plan to stop the spread?

810
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:22,451
First of all, I think

811
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:23,451
we should

812
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,891
change the passcode of the door.

813
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,250
That way, only you and I

814
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,810
will be able to enter this apartment.

815
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,651
We can prevent incidents

816
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:33,411
like last night from happening.

817
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:34,490
I've already changed the passcode.

818
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:37,131
Well done.

819
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,691
After that, I'll tell Meimei

820
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,290
and my colleagues at my company

821
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,330
that you've finished your family leave

822
00:37:45,691 --> 00:37:47,090
and you've been transferred

823
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,971
to Bolivia

824
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,250
for inspection.

825
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,971
That way, you won't need
to show up again anytime soon.

826
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,131
You did well by turning down

827
00:37:54,131 --> 00:37:55,090
the request

828
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:56,290
to exchange WeChat contacts.

829
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,770
I'll give you a thumbs up
and seal of approval for that.

830
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:01,371
Things are okay on my end.

831
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:03,290
You won't need to show up again

832
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,651
for the time being.

833
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,851
But the trouble

834
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:11,010
is with your end.

835
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,651
In view

836
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,490
of your gracious help

837
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,730
in the Luowei Yulan matter,

838
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,171
you can still stay here

839
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:33,050
with me.

840
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:34,651
No time limit.

841
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:36,570
What I promised you won't change.

842
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:39,570
Actually, I'll be able

843
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,530
to have things

844
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,971
on my side under control soon too.

845
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:44,131
But I might need to stay here

846
00:38:44,131 --> 00:38:45,330
for a bit longer.

847
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:47,570
But in the meantime,

848
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,770
I'll draw up a tenancy agreement.

849
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,010
This will work to both of our benefits.

850
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:52,931
What do you think?

851
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,691
How much did you spend

852
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,371
on the things you bought yesterday?

853
00:39:02,371 --> 00:39:03,330
I'll reimburse you.

854
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,851
It's fine. Consider it rent.

855
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:06,171
Don't. You're broke.

856
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:16,010
I mean to say

857
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:16,891
that I don't like

858
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:18,250
owing people.

859
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,330
This and that are different things.

860
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,010
Even family members
should settle their accounts.

861
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:20,490
It's fine.

862
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:21,770
I...

863
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,651
I...

864
00:39:32,211 --> 00:39:33,010
Anything else?

865
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,770
I see you bought a plant too.

866
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:05,891
It's mint.

867
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,171
Can be air freshener

868
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,371
and its leaves
can be used to make drinks.

869
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:13,010
So this is how you grow mint.

870
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,530
What's the flower language of mint?

871
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,810
Integrity and virtue.

872
00:40:27,211 --> 00:40:28,451
Isn't the language of flowers

873
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:30,090
usually related to love?

874
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,411
Let me look it up.

875
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,290
If I say it is, then it is.

876
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:36,290
And I say it isn't.

877
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:38,050
Who are you trying to play
the cool, stoic CEO character?

878
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,971
The meaning of mint...

879
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:44,010
Eternal love.

880
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,691
See?

881
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:07,691
It's all your fault.
Things are awkward now.

882
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,691
I'm leaving.

883
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,090
The new passcode

884
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,131
is 000511.

885
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:25,730
The new passcode is 000511.

886
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:29,971
Your birthday?

887
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,171
Me and God of Wealth's birthday.

888
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,540
Fine.

889
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:36,971
So you're a Taurus.
That's nice. Suits you.

890
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,290
Another thing.

891
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:42,770
Another thing.

892
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,211
I'll send you
the agreement once I have it ready.

893
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,050
Okay.

894
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,570
What is it, Hui?

895
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,371
(Zhao Danping
will be coming to the office)

896
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:02,570
(at 10 a.m. on behalf of Ms. Lan.)

897
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:03,451
(From the call,)

898
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:04,971
(it sounds like
it's going to be a level 10 storm.)

899
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:05,810
(And Jin flew off)

900
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,730
(to Xi'an last night.)

901
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:07,570
(Come straight into my office)

902
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,651
(when you get to the law firm.)

903
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,451
Got it.

904
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:12,290
I'll confirm an email first

905
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,131
and then come to you.

906
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:13,931
Hang in there.

907
00:42:20,611 --> 00:42:21,171
Hello,

908
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:21,851
hi.

909
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:24,651
Is this the Shimin Law Firm?

910
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,131
I'm looking for Qin Shi.

911
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,691
A female lawyer.

912
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:30,451
All right.

913
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:32,250
I... I think I might have misremembered.

914
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,131
Oh, that won't be necessary.

915
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,290
All right. Thank you. Goodbye.

916
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,600
(Shimin Law Firm)

917
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:45,730
I'll find you somehow.

918
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,330
Hello.

919
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:02,530
Is this

920
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,290
the Chengzhong Consulting and Law Firm?

921
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:33,651
Hello, Miss Zhao.

922
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:34,611
Please come with me.

923
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,971
It's fine. I know the way.

924
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:37,010
All right.

925
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:46,851
Hello?

926
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:48,131
(Miss Zhao is here.)

927
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,490
