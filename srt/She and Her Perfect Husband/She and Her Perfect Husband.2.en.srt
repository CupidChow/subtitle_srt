19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,121
It's late, Hua. Where are you going?

20
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:35,560
Dear.

21
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,401
I have been thinking.

22
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:38,601
Do you

23
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,801
think we went too far

24
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,881
by kicking our son out

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,120
like that?

26
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,120
What if he never returns?

27
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,801
What do we do?

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,681
Where can he go

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,920
other than home?

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,200
I can count with my fingers the friends

31
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,720
he has

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,720
growing up.

33
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,241
Your son is meek.

34
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,441
He can only run at most

35
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:00,360
500 meters away from home.

36
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:01,881
If you don't believe me,

37
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:03,081
head to the hotel

38
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,441
opposite the residential area.

39
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:05,760
If he's not there,

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,401
I'll admit defeat.

41
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,520
(Changchun Hotel)

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,700
(Changchun Hotel)

43
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,640
And if he wants to stay in the hotel

44
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,441
forever?

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,000
You know how spoiled he is.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,881
He can never get used to living
in a hotel.

47
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:26,760
He'll come back to us

48
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,640
within 48 hours.

49
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:29,841
Morning.

50
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:30,760
Morning.

51
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,440
Show me.

52
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,401
Did love revitalize

53
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,121
you?

54
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:40,521
You look dead.

55
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:44,920
An eventful night?

56
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:47,081
That's why I'm here

57
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:48,281
to jog with you this early.

58
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:49,841
You and Jin are a lovely couple.

59
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,081
So don't tease me about it.

60
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:53,320
We are an old couple.

61
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,121
We are not as

62
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,600
energetic as young people like you.

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,521
I took a peek yesterday.

64
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,081
Your husband is even younger

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,480
and more handsome in person.

66
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:01,721
No wonder

67
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:02,760
you're so smitten.

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,320
Please. He clings to me all the time.

69
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,320
Where are we jogging today?

70
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:08,281
Not today.

71
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
Let me show you a place.

72
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:11,040
Let's go.

73
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Don't tell me this is where
Ms. Lan

74
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,480
practices her yoga.

75
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:35,360
Smart.

76
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,681
We'll approach her starting now?

77
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,281
We have to.

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Li Dai crossed

79
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:47,681
her niece right away.

80
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:48,760
If I don't approach her now,

81
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,401
we'll lose

82
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:50,721
this big client.

83
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,721
My work for the past six months

84
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,081
would be in vain.

85
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,760
I can't let that happen.

86
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,241
Here.

87
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,721
This doesn't make sense.

88
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,521
How so?

89
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:12,880
Well,

90
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,880
we have other important clients too.

91
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,001
Why

92
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,401
do you want Ms. Lan that badly?

93
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:23,681
Hiding something from me?

94
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:30,360
It's all because of Jin.

95
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,320
What about him?

96
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:34,160
Last week,

97
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,040
he attended a class reunion.

98
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,081
He ran into his first love?

99
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:43,961
Really?

100
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,480
No way.

101
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,561
Jin and you

102
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,961
are so close.

103
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:49,401
You two are relationship goals.

104
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,241
My idols.

105
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,360
If your marriage doesn't work,

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,081
I will never ever believe

107
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:52,640
in love again.

108
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:54,721
Relax. It's not that serious.

109
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,681
You know,

110
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,440
before Jin married me,

111
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,081
he was in

112
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,440
a relationship for seven, eight years.

113
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,721
They split

114
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
and we got together.

115
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:04,480
He has great taste.

116
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,200
But

117
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,920
his family opposed this relationship

118
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,841
because his ex-girlfriend is rich.

119
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,320
If Jin married her,

120
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,760
he wouldn't have to work as hard.

121
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,320
Mr. Jin has been through that too?

122
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,640
It doesn't look like it, does it?

123
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,281
But it all worked out in the end.

124
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,721
Right?

125
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:23,561
You founded your own business.

126
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,721
Cheng & Hui is prospering

127
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:25,600
and expanding.

128
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,281
That's what I thought

129
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,241
but I just had

130
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:34,401
to go online and find out more
about her.

131
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,281
I learned

132
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
that his ex-girlfriend's husband

133
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,760
is the president of a public company.

134
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,001
He's worth several hundred billion yuan.

135
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,521
And it's all because

136
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,760
her family funded his business
at the beginning.

137
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:44,880
So, I've been thinking.

138
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,081
If Jin

139
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:47,561
didn't marry me,

140
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:48,801
perhaps he

141
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,841
would be the president

142
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,961
of a public company now.

143
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,241
What are you on about?

144
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,640
Why? Jin thought
he picked the wrong deal?

145
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:58,801
No.

146
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,561
I just feel bad for him.

147
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,040
So I have made up my mind.

148
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:05,001
I'll get Ms. Lan.

149
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,801
With what she has,

150
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,760
an IPO is nothing.

151
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,841
Exactly.

152
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:11,841
We rely on word-of-mouth.

153
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,440
We don't need to go public.

154
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,401
Even if we won't go public,

155
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:18,121
I will make Jin worth

156
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:19,640
twice or thrice his current value.

157
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,760
In my mind, you're

158
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,360
the best wife

159
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,241
in the world.

160
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:28,721
If I were a man,

161
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,200
I would keep you at my home every day.

162
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,241
I won't get anything.

163
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:31,561
Right.

164
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:32,161
I just want you.

165
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,800
Go ahead.

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,760
Continue.

167
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:42,320
Three days. I can wait three days
at most.

168
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:43,560
Isn't that...

169
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,401
Miss Qin.

170
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm already being thoughtful here.

171
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:47,041
I just want you

172
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,200
to announce our divorce on your end.

173
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:49,281
I don't even need you

174
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,560
to clarify the truth.

175
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,320
Hui.

176
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:59,120
I want...

177
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,760
What? What's so hard to say?

178
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,361
No.

179
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:10,161
Impossible.

180
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:11,320
Don't even think about it.

181
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,200
I know you want to take leave now

182
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:14,800
so that you

183
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,081
can have a romantic getaway
with your husband.

184
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:17,800
No.

185
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,361
I'm serious.

186
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:20,841
Get me

187
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,680
Ms. Lan.

188
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,521
I can let you be the partner
on the 11th floor

189
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,921
or even stock options. Anything.

190
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,560
And you still want to take leave?

191
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:30,601
Okay.

192
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,401
I recorded that.

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,680
You!

194
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
I recorded everything

195
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,721
you said.

196
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,521
Why

197
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:45,961
do you have to fight your mom?

198
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,721
You

199
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:48,880
know her.

200
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:50,640
You can't out-stubborn her.

201
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:53,240
Just do what you're told.

202
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:55,401
What do you think she wants me to do?

203
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:57,120
Get married.

204
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,320
That's just an excuse

205
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:02,041
to make me find a job.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,081
I think my mom

207
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,120
is dead serious this time.

208
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,041
I can only pick one.

209
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
I'll pick for you.

210
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:11,560
Get married.

211
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,640
It's easier.

212
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:20,760
It's easier.

213
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,800
Tell me.

214
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:23,760
Do we live

215
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,880
for ourselves or others?

216
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:26,680
For ourselves, of course.

217
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,841
But not just for ourselves.

218
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,320
You see,

219
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:33,401
it's normal for a mother

220
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:34,841
to worry about her son.

221
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,401
The top student

222
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:37,481
in our class,

223
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,161
in the entire faculty,

224
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,680
the future pillar of our nation,

225
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,000
stays at home all the time

226
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,041
and becomes a shut-in.

227
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:44,560
You have so much potential!

228
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,401
You know,

229
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:48,041
people like you

230
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,440
can easily

231
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:51,081
find a job with a net annual income

232
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:52,481
of one million yuan.

233
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,041
The more you earn,

234
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,841
the heavier the duty.

235
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:58,481
I'm not that ambitious.

236
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:00,041
I quite like my current job.

237
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,000
You like it?

238
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,601
Tell me

239
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,281
what's so good about it.

240
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,081
I have freedom and it's stress-free.

241
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,361
I have an annual income of at least
200,000 yuan.

242
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,961
You work hard for the entire year

243
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:14,640
but you're not earning much more
than I do.

244
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:16,961
And you have to go to the office
every day and feed your family.

245
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:18,240
Can you imagine how stressful

246
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,041
you are?

247
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,800
What about getting married?

248
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,320
Don't even talk to me about that.

249
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,721
The divorce rate is at an all-time high.

250
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:33,880
It is the solution to end every argument

251
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,320
so why should I get married?

252
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:38,481
I'll switch to another machine.

253
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:43,281
Hi, Ms. Lan.

254
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:45,161
It's Yihui.

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
Nothing.

256
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:48,560
You told me

257
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
you have an amazing

258
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,760
yoga tutor

259
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:52,680
so I came here too.

260
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,200
I've been having

261
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,000
a sore neck lately

262
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:57,880
so I want to find a tutor

263
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,921
to coach me.

264
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,281
If you're here,

265
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:01,240
we can

266
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,481
have breakfast together.

267
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,841
Unfortunately,

268
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:05,081
I have a business trip this morning.

269
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm on my way to the airport now.

270
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:09,000
It's okay.

271
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,680
We can hang out once you're back.

272
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,120
I have talked to Danping.

273
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,921
She'll manage the association now.

274
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,041
You can talk to her directly.

275
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,521
Okay.

276
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:20,680
All right then, Ms. Lan.

277
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,601
See you.

278
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,320
She's

279
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,841
avoiding us.

280
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,281
What should we do?

281
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,120
What can we do?

282
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,200
We go straight to the business.

283
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll meet that Zhao Danping.

284
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:40,521
(Subject: Zhao Danping's Information Request)
Give me everything

285
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:41,680
(Subject: Zhao Danping's Information Request)
about Zhao Danping,

286
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,041
including her academic background, her CV,

287
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,721
her hobbies, and her lifestyle.

288
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,961
Summarize all information

289
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,281
and send it to my office before 10 a.m.

290
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,841
Truth be told,

291
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,961
I work out

292
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:53,481
to fit in.

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,961
The same

294
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:56,880
applies to work

295
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,800
and marriage.

296
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,120
I know you well enough

297
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,800
to know that you don't like to fit in.

298
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:02,640
But freedom

299
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,921
is important to you, isn't it?

300
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:04,640
You will be willing

301
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,281
to make compromises to gain freedom.

302
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:07,680
I think

303
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,240
you should seriously consider it.

304
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:12,081
My freedom doesn't come
with terms and conditions.

305
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:13,200
I know.

306
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,320
I know

307
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,601
you lost your job

308
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,200
so you feel disillusioned.

309
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,880
You also broke up with your girlfriend

310
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:23,760
because of this.

311
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,640
Who told you that?

312
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,120
No need to deny everything.

313
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,401
I know.

314
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:31,240
Men are

315
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,200
concerned about their pride.

316
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,120
But even if you're

317
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,081
the rarest talent out there,

318
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,560
you need to face the reality too.

319
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,000
Your parents have been worrying

320
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
about you these few years.

321
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,041
They worry that if this carries on,

322
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,521
you'll end up

323
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:46,401
single forever.

324
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:48,721
They are just worried.

325
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:49,521
You can't carry on like this.

326
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:52,721
You mean

327
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,240
I should lie to my parents?

328
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,120
No.

329
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,521
I did not say that.

330
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm just saying

331
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:02,800
that a white lie

332
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,161
is a possible solution.

333
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,961
To regain

334
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,320
my freedom,

335
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:14,041
I have to lie to my parents.

336
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,760
To gain an advantage in the workplace,

337
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,760
she lies

338
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,120
about her relationship status.

339
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,560
It sounds like the same thing.

340
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,041
What?

341
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:20,880
What are you talking about?

342
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,120
You

343
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,760
can afford to be stubborn right now

344
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,921
because you're a man.

345
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,120
If you were a woman...

346
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,440
Work.

347
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,760
Marriage.

348
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,320
Mix them both together

349
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
and you'll crumble.

350
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,560
What do you mean?

351
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,361
What do I mean?

352
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,081
Imagine.

353
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,841
You're a woman.

354
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,841
If you're single,
you'll get married eventually.

355
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,200
If you get married, you'll take
marriage leave.

356
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:51,760
And then, you'll want kids

357
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:53,721
and you'll take maternal leave.

358
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,680
That's a lot of things.

359
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,041
So

360
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,841
you're saying that exploiting

361
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:03,161
the loophole in this outdated view

362
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:04,481
in order to gain a career advantage

363
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,601
is excusable?

364
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:09,401
I understand

365
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:10,601
but I do not condone it.

366
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:12,560
This misconception

367
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:13,800
should have been corrected.

368
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:15,481
Not circumvented or surrendering to it.

369
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,521
Otherwise, fairness can never exist.

370
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,601
All right.

371
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,120
I know

372
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,081
you're the warrior of justice.

373
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,820
- Morning.
- Morning.

374
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:33,921
- Morning, Ms. Wu.
- Morning.

375
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:36,721
Why are you

376
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:37,601
so chill?

377
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:38,560
You can saunter in here.

378
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,760
What's the hurry? It's still early.

379
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Don't tell me

380
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:43,521
you didn't check the company email?

381
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,161
I don't look

382
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,440
at my phone often once I'm back home.

383
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,081
That's a good habit.

384
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,320
Yes.

385
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,081
Yes, that Zhao Danping.

386
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Yes, the 01' intake.

387
00:15:58,361 --> 00:15:59,800
She should be your senior.

388
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,800
For this divorce case, the husband

389
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,320
might have transferred
the marital asset.

390
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,401
Can you check

391
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:14,841
the couple's community asset?

392
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,800
Ms. Li.

393
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Can you find someone else to do it?

394
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,120
Are you saying

395
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,000
that you can't handle this case?

396
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:27,401
No.

397
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:28,361
I mean

398
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:30,401
I'm Ms. Qin's legal assistant.

399
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:31,841
I have to prioritize

400
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,000
the tasks she gives me.

401
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,041
If you're not in a hurry,

402
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,081
I can do it for you

403
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:37,200
once I'm done.

404
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,440
Sorry.

405
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,560
I see you work for Qin Shi.

406
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,961
It's okay.

407
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:44,200
You don't need to do it.

408
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,921
Sorry.

409
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,320
Dong.

410
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,041
This is your case now.

411
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,401
Thanks, Ms. Li.

412
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:19,641
I shouldn't

413
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:20,680
be the one to tell you this.

414
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,160
But I think

415
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,040
you made a mistake.

416
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:23,920
What happened?

417
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:25,481
What happened?

418
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,560
In Cheng & Hui,

419
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:28,520
a legal assistant

420
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,040
is just a rank.

421
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,560
You are not affiliated with anyone.

422
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,280
You work for all

423
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,361
senior lawyers.

424
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
You didn't know?

425
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,520
I see.

426
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,320
I thought...

427
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,400
You thought...

428
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:42,520
Stop thinking.

429
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,881
Just pray for your

430
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:44,761
future.

431
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,841
I'll apologize to Ms. Li.

432
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:49,001
I didn't mean it.

433
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:51,481
Do you know the relationship between

434
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:53,081
Ms. Qin and Ms. Li?

435
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:54,761
No.

436
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,481
They are like coffee and green tea.

437
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:59,601
Incompatible and in a competition.

438
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:00,841
You

439
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:01,881
just picked a side there.

440
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:03,601
Do you think an apology

441
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,520
will work?

442
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,881
It's a rivalry between them.

443
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:08,961
It's none of my business.

444
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,280
I just have to excuse myself

445
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,440
for my mistake.

446
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,721
This is a workplace,
not the Imperial Palace.

447
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,400
Okay.

448
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,001
Wish you luck.

449
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:28,601
Tell me.

450
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,040
What did you find?

451
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:49,800
Zhao Danping, female.

452
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Born in July 1985.

453
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,121
She graduated from
Pujiang Business University

454
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:55,400
and is a certified accountant.

455
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,280
She then worked in PwC.

456
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
Ms. Wu.

457
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,961
Please skip all the information
we can get

458
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:00,920
on the internet.

459
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,361
Do you have anything else?

460
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:04,881
For example, her ex-husband.

461
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,560
Ex-husband.

462
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:21,361
I didn't have enough time to prepare.

463
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,160
I informed all of you to get ready

464
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,481
three hours ago.

465
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,001
Her ex-husband

466
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,601
is our client.

467
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,001
His info should be in the database.

468
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,280
Were you too busy

469
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,361
to go through it?

470
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,920
Why are you smiling, Ms. Wu?

471
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Please treat this

472
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,881
more seriously.

473
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,121
You can't stay

474
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,160
in this law firm

475
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,280
with your connections alone.

476
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:53,920
Noted?

477
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:57,841
Anyone else?

478
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,560
Zhao Danping's ex-husband

479
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,400
loves marathon.

480
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,241
Zhao Danping once helped him

481
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:06,440
screen the volunteers

482
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,601
for Pujiang International

483
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:08,881
Marathon Race.

484
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,400
Where is everyone?

485
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:16,641
Where are they?

486
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,721
Ms. Li.

487
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,040
They are having a meeting

488
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,320
with Ms. Qin.

489
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,121
Is the case that significant

490
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,881
that everyone has to be part of it?

491
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,160
What about you?

492
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,320
Why are you here?

493
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,440
I forgot my phone.

494
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,361
I came to get it.

495
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,200
I came to get it.

496
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,920
In conclusion,

497
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,241
Zhao Danping

498
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,121
holds people around her dearly,
is responsible,

499
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,641
proud, and pretentious.

500
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:50,601
She treats marathon

501
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,761
like a job.

502
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,680
She ran 22 marathons in three years.

503
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,920
This kind of people

504
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,601
hates to be fooled.

505
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:57,481
But we

506
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:59,081
made her lose face.

507
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:01,200
I don't think

508
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,081
she's thrilled to see us.

509
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,881
You made it sound so serious

510
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:07,560
so that

511
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,121
your suggestion will look
like a saving grace.

512
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,361
Don't pull that trick on me.

513
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:11,400
Just give me the solution.

514
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,400
By right,

515
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,440
she should have

516
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:17,800
rejected us.

517
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:19,121
But she didn't do it.

518
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,440
She even agreed to meet us.

519
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:21,920
That means we still have hopes.

520
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,320
You sure she isn't saving it

521
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,800
so that she can spit on our faces
in person?

522
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,200
That's to be expected.

523
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:29,160
If you can't handle that,

524
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:30,680
we can just call it quits here.

525
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,680
Yes, I am bracing myself for it.

526
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:35,001
Show me

527
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,040
what you have here.

528
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:36,601
Be

529
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:37,881
the lead attorney you can be.

530
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,081
Your husband is the lead attorney.

531
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:41,121
Not me.

532
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,841
Once this is over,

533
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:49,320
I want to tell you something

534
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,320
and you can't be mad about it.

535
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,560
I can't possibly be mad at you.

536
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,601
What's the matter?

537
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:56,601
Tell me.

538
00:21:57,121 --> 00:21:59,040
She's here.

539
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:01,280
Hi, Ms. Zhao.

540
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,200
Have a seat.

541
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,121
Ms. Zhao.

542
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,920
We invited you here

543
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,800
because we want to apologize to you.

544
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,241
I just learned

545
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:16,400
that for your divorce,

546
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,241
our law firm

547
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,081
represented your husband.

548
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:20,800
Ex-husband, please.

549
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:23,641
It's your job to defend

550
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:24,560
your client.

551
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,001
You need not apologize.

552
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:27,400
Unless

553
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,601
the good conscience got to you?

554
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,081
We're not apologizing

555
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:38,520
because we acted

556
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,481
on our client's best interest.

557
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,241
It's our job.

558
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,721
But we understand that we

559
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,320
might come off as too cold-hearted
in our handling of cases.

560
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,881
If we offend you this time,

561
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,361
we ask for your forgiveness.

562
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,361
Such diplomatic words.

563
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:55,361
Does Cheng & Hui care about the feeling

564
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:56,721
of its rival that much

565
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:58,560
or is it because

566
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:00,841
I am Ms. Lan's niece?

567
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,001
Both.

568
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:07,601
Ms. Zhao.

569
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:09,001
I hope this

570
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,641
allows you to understand

571
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:12,400
the importance of having

572
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,721
lawyers who will devote their service

573
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:14,680
to their clients.

574
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,361
I will be frank with you.

575
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,961
We propose to handle

576
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,481
all the association's legal affairs.

577
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,800
We are just a small association

578
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,081
so we don't have a huge volume
of legal affairs.

579
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:27,520
We don't have a big budget either.

580
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,081
Hiring you guys

581
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:30,920
would be a terrible waste
of your resources.

582
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:33,800
Money is not the problem.

583
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
What we want

584
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,440
is Ms. Lan's name and reputation.

585
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,881
I have met many law firms

586
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,200
but you

587
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,440
are the first

588
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,841
to be this upfront about your real goal.

589
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:46,641
This

590
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,001
is our style.

591
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,761
I hope you

592
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,520
can give us

593
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,881
a chance to compete fairly.

594
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,040
Sure.

595
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:01,320
But I raise two conditions.

596
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:03,560
Anything.

597
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,280
I want you to provide

598
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,400
free consultation services

599
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,040
to the association.

600
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:14,200
No problem for consultations.

601
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,280
But court hearing

602
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,361
will incur extra charges.

603
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:19,081
Understandable.

604
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:20,841
And,

605
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:22,121
help me

606
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:23,520
get my 12 million yuan back

607
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,400
from my ex-husband.

608
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,320
You can't do that?

609
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:35,200
Forget it then.

610
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:36,601
Ms. Zhao.

611
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:40,601
You're asking us

612
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:42,121
to lie to our client.

613
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:44,560
I don't care what you do.

614
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:47,040
Whether you lie or find an excuse,

615
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,001
I leave that to your expertise.

616
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:52,481
Ms. Zhao.

617
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:55,040
It's hard to imagine

618
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,040
hearing this

619
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,361
from someone who has worked
in the finance industry

620
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:00,641
for 16 years.

621
00:25:01,841 --> 00:25:02,841
For you,

622
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:04,001
one's adherence to job ethics

623
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:05,601
is not just reflective
of his professionalism,

624
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,400
but also his integrity.

625
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,121
Can I interpret this

626
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,121
as a trial

627
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:14,361
on our character, Ms. Zhao?

628
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,121
I prefer to work

629
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:19,920
with an honest person
than a smart person.

630
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,440
Welcome on board.

631
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,601
Thank you.

632
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:28,961
Who will lead

633
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,040
this project?

634
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,081
Our best lawyer,

635
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:31,961
Ms...

636
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:34,200
I hope it's Ms. Li Dai.

637
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:37,601
Sure.

638
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:39,761
I do trust

639
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:41,040
your capability, Ms. Qin.

640
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,081
But you're feisty

641
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,680
and sometimes, that backfires.

642
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,160
I prefer

643
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,560
Ms. Li Dai's style.

644
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,320
Is it okay?

645
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,361
Definitely.

646
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:56,160
Li Dai.

647
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,200
I have to say

648
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,040
you're

649
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,200
so lucky this time.

650
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:00,721
She's not bothered

651
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:02,481
and she wants you to lead the project.

652
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:03,680
I'm telling you.

653
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,001
Secure

654
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:06,040
this client for me.

655
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,280
Do your job well.

656
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,761
I'll tell you more

657
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:08,920
once I'm back.

658
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,481
All right.

659
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:17,481
Don't sulk.

660
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:19,320
She has the upper hand

661
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,761
so she gets to decide.

662
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:22,280
There will be more opportunities.

663
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,520
Cheer up.

664
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,601
You told me you wanted

665
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:28,881
to tell me something, didn't you?

666
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:36,241
My husband and I...

667
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,481
It's fine.

668
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:41,400
I get it.

669
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,761
You'll have three days off.

670
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:44,400
Go have your date.

671
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:45,601
Don't worry

672
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:46,920
about the law firm.

673
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,560
Enjoy.

674
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,761
Take care.

675
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:17,961
Ms. Li Dai's treat.

676
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,361
Milk tea

677
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,001
with black sugar tapioca pearls.

678
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,520
Thank you.

679
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,721
Who else?

680
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,721
Everyone got one?

681
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:27,481
Yes.

682
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,280
Zhao.

683
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,481
Send me the document already.

684
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,320
All right.

685
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
Ms. Li Dai's treat.

686
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:32,920
Have some milk tea.

687
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,860
(Changchun Hotel)

688
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,601
Hello.

689
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:53,520
Hi, mom.

690
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:55,121
Can we talk?

691
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,160
No, we can't.

692
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,721
Remember.

693
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:01,040
This home doesn't have the happiness

694
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,200
you seek.

695
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,680
Go find your own.

696
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,200
Mom.

697
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:07,800
Mom.

698
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:16,241
Dad.

699
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,560
Hua.

700
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
It's okay.

701
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,241
Your mom

702
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:24,001
is just mad right now.

703
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:24,761
Okay?

704
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,481
So...

705
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:29,160
You have to know

706
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,440
that your mom

707
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:32,800
is dead serious this time.

708
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,200
You have to be ready

709
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,841
to concede.

710
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,081
Listen.

711
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,121
Why don't you

712
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,481
find a job?

713
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:42,680
You can go to the office.

714
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,481
That way,

715
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,920
you don't

716
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:47,601
have to see your mom every day.

717
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,601
A little bit of distance
will do you good.

718
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:50,320
Don't you think,

719
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,361
Hua?

720
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:55,361
Hua?

721
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:56,601
Hello?

722
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,520
What?

723
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:01,121
He hung up on you too.

724
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,440
That brat.

725
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
No.

726
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,881
It's just bad signals.

727
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,560
He said he would call back later.

728
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,601
Don't worry.

729
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,920
I'll talk to him.

730
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,081
Let me take a photo of you.

731
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:16,761
Stand right there.

732
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:18,400
Don't go.

733
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:22,961
Your back is beautiful too.

734
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:23,520
Yay!

735
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
That brat.

736
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:39,601
Almost all

737
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:41,081
legal assistants were there.

738
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,241
I have never

739
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,320
felt this embarrassed before.

740
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,721
I feel like an idiot.

741
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:47,320
Also, this is my second day at work.

742
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,160
It's normal that I still don't know
many things.

743
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,280
Do they have to be that harsh
towards me?

744
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,601
And I thought she was my mentor.

745
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,040
Great.

746
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,160
I was scolded by her

747
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,961
and I crossed another senior lawyer.

748
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,800
This is hell.

749
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,761
Are you listening?

750
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,361
I am.

751
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,121
Are you not going to defend me?

752
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,160
Your girlfriend was bullied.

753
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,361
My girlfriend

754
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:14,320
has high IQ and EQ.

755
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,841
She can't possibly be bullied.

756
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,440
I wasn't joking around.

757
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,121
Feifei.

758
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,841
If you aren't happy

759
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,560
and are fed up, come back.

760
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:24,680
I'll take care of you.

761
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,761
I know you're saying that
just to make me happy.

762
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:30,320
It's very effective, I must say.

763
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:33,081
I know

764
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,001
it's mainly

765
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,481
my fault.

766
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:37,200
I underestimated everything.

767
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,641
Look at my baby.

768
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:40,961
She's reflecting upon herself now.

769
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,841
She's perfect.

770
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:43,841
Only you think

771
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,841
I'm perfect.

772
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:46,761
Like I said,

773
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,961
if you're tired,

774
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
feel free...

775
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,961
Feel free to be your princess,

776
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:55,160
to be your obedient fiancee.

777
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:56,121
I did not forget it.

778
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,721
Remember that.

779
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,560
Be good now.

780
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,800
Bye.

781
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:09,641
Let's continue.

782
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:11,320
Dude.

783
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,081
Can you take care of me too?

784
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,680
I'm not high maintenance, I swear.

785
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:16,481
Back to business.

786
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:19,520
I have followed Ms. Lan

787
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,481
for more than two weeks.

788
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:22,320
She's a busy woman

789
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:24,881
and has many connections.

790
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:26,520
Wherever she goes,
she's the center of attention.

791
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,160
However, several days ago,

792
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,280
she met

793
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,320
with several lawyers.

794
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,440
(Mr. Tao Junhui)

795
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,841
(Mr. Tao Junhui)
How do you know

796
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:31,520
(Mr. Tao Junhui)
they are lawyers?

797
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,920
Do you know who I am?

798
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,361
Suit and tie, loafers, expensive watch.

799
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,400
They either work in finance

800
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
or deal with laws.

801
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,481
Plus, I'm very sensitive

802
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,001
to lawyers.

803
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,320
I can smell

804
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,081
the law codices from them.

805
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:47,160
Association for Women Entrepreneurs

806
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,400
is hiring a new legal counsel.

807
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,040
Many law firms are bidding

808
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,881
it.

809
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,961
Hello?

810
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:23,680
It's me, Zhou Qianqian.

811
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,200
Ms. Qin wants me to tell you

812
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,841
to prepare

813
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:28,241
the documents regarding Ms. Lan.

814
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,800
Have it done
before you finish your work.

815
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:30,841
Keep it a secret.

816
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,001
And never

817
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:33,280
let Ms. Li Dai get hold of it.

818
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,961
You just have to submit the documents
to me later.

819
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:37,641
You performed badly this morning

820
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:38,800
so do your best this time.

821
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:18,800
(Why did you pick me)

822
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,601
(to be your husband?)

823
00:33:21,121 --> 00:33:23,040
Do you remember your trip

824
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,320
to Australia?

825
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,241
You posted

826
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:29,721
photos of your voyage

827
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:30,881
on Weibo.

828
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,241
I came across your post by accident

829
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,081
and I followed you.

830
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,601
I just

831
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:38,680
quite like the photos you took.

832
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,520
Special?

833
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,721
What's so special about the photos?

834
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,960
(Male. 28 years old.
Renting a girlfriend. Location: Pujiang.)

835
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:20,090
(This is to regain my freedom and to
shut my parents up.)

836
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,210
(Renting one girlfriend for a year.
No need to be in a relationship. Price negotiable.)

837
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:38,601
Cheng & Hui. I'm Zhou Qianqian.

838
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:40,601
All right, Ms. Qin.

839
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:48,560
Have you prepared the documents?

840
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,201
Yes.

841
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:51,881
Here.

842
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,921
I still have some information

843
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:59,121
pending confirmation.

844
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,480
This will do.

845
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,121
Will it?

846
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,760
What are you doing?

847
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,960
Just go back to your work.

848
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,161
No need to come.

849
00:35:15,121 --> 00:35:16,000
Lan Xiaoting.

850
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,960
54 years old.

851
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,040
Executive Director of Yulan Group.

852
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,641
Yulan Group's mainly deals

853
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:22,201
with real estate,

854
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:24,201
medical science, education,
and many more.

855
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:26,081
It's valued at billions.

856
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,480
However, further digging shows

857
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,081
that Yulan Group's de facto leader

858
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:31,081
is Ms. Lan's husband, Pang Dingfang.

859
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,201
That's all?

860
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:36,921
Yes.

861
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,161
I heard Ms. Lan left
on a business trip today.

862
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:41,441
Do you know where she went?

863
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,641
Business trip?

864
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,081
Come in.

865
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,121
Ms. Qin.

866
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:49,320
Yes?

867
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,960
I have confirmed the information.

868
00:35:51,201 --> 00:35:51,800
What information?

869
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:52,921
Tomorrow night,

870
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,201
Ms. Lan will be attending

871
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:55,361
a charity dinner with people

872
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,441
from the Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce
in Pinghu.

873
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,601
It is a celebratory dinner
for their initiative

874
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:00,320
to provide free surgeries
to cataract patients.

875
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:05,361
Who prepared this document?

876
00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:06,800
We did it together.

877
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,601
Can you get me a ticket

878
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,201
to the charity dinner?

879
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:16,000
- Ms. Qin...
- Excuse me.

880
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't think it's possible.

881
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,881
Yes, are you sure?

882
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,441
Ms. Qin.

883
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,560
For the dinner tomorrow,

884
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,841
you have to come with

885
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:25,720
a family member.

886
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,480
Are you and your husband available?

887
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,161
(I want a divorce.)

888
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,560
(You have three days.)

889
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:38,161
Yes.

890
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:39,800
They need

891
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,681
your husband's name.

892
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:44,601
Yang. Yang Hua.

893
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,081
Oh, Yang.

894
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:58,760
You

895
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,361
are a hypocrite.

896
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:02,240
Didn't they say a true warrior

897
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,201
would face a tragedy with courage?

898
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,760
Look what you're doing now.

899
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,760
My mom is using a scare tactic

900
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,800
so I will feign submission
before I strike.

901
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,121
I will play along.

902
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,760
No one will get hurt anyway.

903
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:17,000
Talking

904
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,280
is all you can do now.

905
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,320
Is it the girl opposite me

906
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,720
in green clothes?

907
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:26,720
She's not here.

908
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,401
Also,

909
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:27,921
before we know

910
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:28,681
what she looks like,

911
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:29,441
I cannot let her know

912
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:30,280
what I look like.

913
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,841
I'm in danger now?

914
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:40,720
I'm a

915
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,641
good, decent man.

916
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,841
You can't

917
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:44,601
sacrifice me

918
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:46,000
like that too.

919
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:47,401
Yang.

920
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,240
I don't get it.

921
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,161
You have an IQ

922
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:52,441
of 146.

923
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:54,121
Why did you think that you could

924
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:56,361
rent a girlfriend online?

925
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:57,960
Do you know

926
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,480
catfishing is a thing?

927
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,401
You might be scammed.

928
00:38:05,921 --> 00:38:07,520
This one here? She's hot.

929
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:26,681
I don't get it, Yang.

930
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,081
You can understand

931
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,520
a stack of financial statements

932
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,881
with a glimpse.

933
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:32,361
But you can't deal with your mom?

934
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,081
You know what?

935
00:38:35,361 --> 00:38:37,161
Let's seize this opportunity

936
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,121
and create

937
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:39,201
your own business.

938
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:40,720
You're almost 30.

939
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,441
It's not right for you to stay

940
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:43,441
with your parents every day.

941
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,040
Remember this.

942
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,841
Free meal comes with a price.

943
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,081
I checked the apartments.

944
00:38:49,081 --> 00:38:50,401
The rent is outrageous.

945
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:52,040
Somewhere decent

946
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:53,841
and close to public transport

947
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:55,560
is around 4,000 yuan per month.

948
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,441
If you want cheaper rent,

949
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,280
you only get 20 square meters
of living surface.

950
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,681
What is your budget?

951
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:03,081
I can look around for you.

952
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,480
2,000 yuan.

953
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,201
Anything higher than this

954
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,280
is no-no.

955
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,240
2,000 yuan?

956
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:10,560
Let me know

957
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,641
if you find an apartment

958
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:12,520
with this rent.

959
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,121
I'll rent it too.

960
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:16,960
Is the person coming or not?

961
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,800
What time is it?

962
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:20,161
This is wasting my time.

963
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:24,921
I'm busy now.

964
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:25,641
I have to go.

965
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,760
This is bad.

This one is chubby.

967
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:28,641
Too cute.

968
00:39:28,641 --> 00:39:29,841

Is there a misunderstanding

1024
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:32,000
Miss Qin, if I'm not mistaken,

1025
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,681
we signed

1026
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:33,881
a contract.

1027
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,881
What contract?

1028
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,520
Yes.

1029
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,720
As stipulated, I am to give you

1030
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,881
an answer in three days.

1031
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,960
Today is the second day.

1032
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,441
Wrong.

1033
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,000
You only have

1034
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,320
less than 26 hours left.

1035
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:54,800
Mr. Yang.

1036
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,361
You're not surprised

1037
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,040

1038
00:41:59,161 --> 00:42:01,121

you

You're overthinking it.

1043

This wasn't my intention.

1044
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:10,121
Yes, it was.

1045
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,881
No, it wasn't.

1046
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:12,000
Yes, it was.

1047
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,960
Even if it was,

1048
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:16,121
I have changed my mind now.

1049
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,720
If your strategy, Miss Qin,

1050
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,520
involves

1051
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,361
incessant pestering,

1052
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:21,480
you can leave now.

1053
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,040
It's not as complicated

1054
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,161
as you imagined.

1055
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
I find it hard to trust

1056
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:32,280
someone who lies her way up.

1057
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,161
There is

1058
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:43,720
something special about you.

1059
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:44,681
Your relentlessness

1060
00:42:44,681 --> 00:42:46,401
will allow you to become a great lawyer.

1061
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:47,441
Therefore,

1062
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,921
you need

1063
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:50,320
to go somewhere suitable
for your development.

1064
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,240
You need a bigger stage.

1065
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,720
But...

1066
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,881
No but.

1067
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,000
Have you forgotten

1068
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,401
why you quit New World?

1069
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:00,921
Why weren't you given

1070
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:02,121
the opportunity
to attend the training program?

1071
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,720
You are talented

1072
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,960
but why did you climb the slowest

1073
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,601
among your peers?

1074
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,480
A single female lawyer

1075
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,000
has a glass ceiling.

1076
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,240
That's a fact.

1077
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,841
You're 32 now.

1078
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:16,441
Do you want to waste any more time?

1079
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:21,681
A stickler can never be a leader.

1080
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:24,361
I want to know
I made the right choice here.

1081
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:25,520
Jing.

1082
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:27,560
I don't want to use this method

1083
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,760
to get what I want.

1084
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,720
I put my neck on the line

1085
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,881
to bring you in here.

1086
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:35,401
If you come clean to them,

1087
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,560
I have to leave with you.

1088
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,121
It can't be that serious.

1089
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,201
You don't believe me?

1090
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,361
I am not your enemy.

1091
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:50,520
Why can't we reach

1092
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,121
a win-win solution?
