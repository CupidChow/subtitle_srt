00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:56,774
The renovation period

20
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:57,695
of these commercial apartments

21
00:01:58,055 --> 00:01:59,655
ranged from three months to a year.

22
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:00,814
The commercial apartment

23
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,655
which has the longest renovation period,

24
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,615
the cabinets still contain high level

25
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:05,414
of formaldehyde.

26
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:06,734
Mr. Cao,

27
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:08,495
this is not some kind
of individual phenomenon.

28
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:13,895
No, you...

29
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:16,055
You're indeed

30
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:17,734
impressive, Mr. Tao.

31
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:21,814
But, I've made some preparation

32
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:24,415
before I came in here
for business.

33
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:27,415
I pay my taxes

34
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,374
and conduct legal business deals.

35
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,855
I'm the pioneer and innovator

36
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:32,014
in this industry.

37
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:33,975
All of these

38
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:37,335
won't shake me.

39
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:39,335
If I deal with it properly,

40
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:40,495
it can never be a threat to me.

41
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,215
However, do your partners

42
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,294
and investors know about this?

43
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:50,615
Besides,

44
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:53,335
does Mr. Sang of Xiaoyun Finance

45
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:55,055
know about this too?

46
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:00,934
Mr. Cao,

47
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:03,094
your leverage

48
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:04,174
has reached a critical point.

49
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,495
Once the vacancy rate of the apartments

50
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,895
is raised by one or two points,

51
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:11,294
you will face liquidation.

52
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:13,695
Now that you're going
to marry Ding Fangfang

53
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:15,654
and the problem might be solved

54
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:17,855
as you can have Mr. Ding's

55
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:20,014
fund and status in the finance industry

56
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,934
in the palm of your hand.

57
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,174
Am I right?

58
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:26,895
Our country welcomes investors

59
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:28,055
from all around the globe.

60
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:29,734
However, under one condition,

61
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:34,374
that's the businessmen should act honestly.

62
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:45,695
Mr. Tao.

63
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,215
I used to think

64
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:50,335
that we were cut from the same cloth.

65
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:51,574
That's you.

66
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:53,895
Please come to the firm

67
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:55,615
to sign the prenup.

68
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:00,495
Take your time, Mr. Cao.

69
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:02,055
You may continue with the meeting.

70
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:03,495
I'll wait for you.

71
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:10,775
Did Cao Yiren throw in the towel

72
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:12,055
with just one testing report
you brought?

73
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:14,255
One report isn't enough.

74
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:15,255
I brought over twenty reports to him.

75
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:16,974
Where did you get those?

76
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,694
I have a friend

77
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:20,294
in the inspection bureau,

78
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:21,375
he helped me with this.

79
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,335
Besides, the testing report

80
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:24,055
is only for the cabinet.

81
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:25,974
Did you lie?

82
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:27,535
I did.

83
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:29,854
I didn't expect that from you,
Tao Junhui.

84
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:31,655
You've grown up. You can lie now.

85
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:32,495
It depends on who's it.

86
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,535
I'll use tricks when I have to.

87
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:36,254
Good.

88
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:37,655
So, would he come this afternoon?

89
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:39,055
Maybe.

90
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:40,734
Maybe?

91
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:42,014
It means...

92
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:46,615
I need to tell you something.

93
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:51,215
Go ahead.

94
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,734
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,495
I'll step out.

96
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:04,535
Bye.

97
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:07,815
Cheer up, bye-bye.

98
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:17,854
What has happened?

99
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,820
(File Folder)

100
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:14,935
Are you angry?

101
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:17,294
No.

102
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:20,935
Why don't you talk to me?

103
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:23,854
I don't feel like talking.

104
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:25,174
Let's sit down.

105
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:29,014
Let me check

106
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:29,974
if you're feeling unwell.

107
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,375
Drink some water and calm yourself.

108
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:48,655
This is insidious.

109
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:54,014
What has gotten into you, Miss Wu?

110
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:55,174
Why are you lashing out?

111
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:57,014
Why could you accept my father's request

112
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,414
without letting me know?

113
00:06:58,414 --> 00:07:00,414
We have an agreement.

114
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:02,454
Miss Wu.

115
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,895
You're being harsh.

116
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:04,775
I won't take this.

117
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:06,694
Indeed.

118
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,375
We had an agreement.

119
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:11,294
You wanted to transfer Tao Junhui
to the corporate department

120
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:12,655
which I had made it happen.

121
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:14,294
Besides, you requested
to be the attorney

122
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:15,495
of the family department

123
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:16,775
and I granted your wish as well.

124
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,775
You even wanted me
to make Qin Shi embarrassed,

125
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:20,854
I did so.

126
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:22,974
Except for these,

127
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:23,775
I think there's nothing else

128
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:25,454
I've promised you.

129
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,254
Your dad cares a lot about you.

130
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:32,895
He wants to know more

131
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:35,014
about Tao Junhui's character
and behavior.

132
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:38,215
I find this request reasonable as well.

133
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:41,014
The camera on the 11th floor

134
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:43,655
is visible to everyone.

135
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:45,294
It depends on them

136
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:46,375
to do what they want,

137
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:47,615
I can't control them.

138
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,495
Don't you think

139
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:50,414
it's unreasonable

140
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:52,375
to blame me for this?

141
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:55,134
Besides,

142
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:56,895
the past between Tao Junhui and Qin Shi

143
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:58,055
isn't a secret.

144
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:01,335
Don't tell me

145
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,615
he has been keeping it from you.

146
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:04,854
No, he doesn't.

147
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:06,014
He confessed everything to me.

148
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:08,454
That's good, then.

149
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:15,095
The way he treats Qin Shi

150
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:15,935
is just normal

151
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,414
and understandable.

152
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,134
Dear girl.

153
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:32,215
First love is always unforgettable,

154
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:34,335
let alone they were once

155
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:35,895
going to marry each other.

156
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:38,975
Even my husband, Jin

157
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:40,694
still remembers clearly

158
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,374
the school romance that happened

159
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:44,934
between him and his puppy love.

160
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,054
But,

161
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,415
Qin Shi has hurt him hard before.

162
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:53,454
Stop grinding on the past.

163
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:54,335
Don't forget

164
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:56,335
you're his current fiancee.

165
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:01,374
He never sees me

166
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,215
with full affection in his eyes.

167
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:07,415
You should stop comparing.

168
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:09,855
Let me tell you this.

169
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:12,814
To women, jealousy is fatal.

170
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:14,895
Once jealousy takes over you,

171
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,134
you lose.

172
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:19,254
A proud and confident person

173
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,215
never gets jealous.

174
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:22,614
Instead of being jealous,

175
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:23,975
you should set your eyes

176
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:25,415
on your advantages.

177
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:27,494
I never reckon

178
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:29,655
that Tao Junhui chose you

179
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,054
because of your father's money.

180
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:33,014
Don't you even

181
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:33,814
have that confidence?

182
00:09:34,054 --> 00:09:34,735
I do have.

183
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:38,814
Are you curious
what's the secret to lead

184
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:40,054
a happy marriage?

185
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:43,895
The secret is

186
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:45,574
never to expect

187
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:46,574
that there'll be someone

188
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:49,054
who loves you more than your parents do.

189
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,054
Only you can make yourself happy.

190
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:54,095
What's this?

191
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:56,054
Read it yourself.

192
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,100
(File Folder)

193
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,980
(Prenuptial Agreement)

194
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:21,895
Are you upset because of this?

195
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:25,855
If you insist to know

196
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,494
whether Tao Junhui loves you or not,

197
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,054
there's a way to justify it.

198
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:35,574
See if he's willing

199
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:36,374
to sign this agreement.

200
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:50,895
What are you doing?

201
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:51,855
I'm signing.

202
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:53,374
Nothing to be worried about then
after signing this.

203
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:55,574
Why didn't you even read it?

204
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:57,335
No necessary. No problem with it.

205
00:10:57,694 --> 00:10:59,095
No problem?

206
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:01,175
I see many problems in this.

207
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:03,295
Which one of these
do you find problematic?

208
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:06,975
The whole thing.

209
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:09,655
This prenup is an insult to you

210
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:11,735
and to our relationship.

211
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,014
Why don't feel angry about this?

212
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,134
You should retaliate

213
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:16,374
when someone bullies you

214
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:17,454
or hurts you.

215
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:18,175
You should

216
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:19,054
rip this agreement

217
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:20,574
and throw it into the dustbin.

218
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,175
Why are you so silly?

219
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:24,175
Why do you sign it?

220
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:25,535
Just why?

221
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:29,855
You mustn't be soft-hearted.

222
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:36,254
You can't just be kind to everyone.

223
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:48,975
Don't cry.

224
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:52,374
You'll look ugly if you cry.

225
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,295
Feifei.

226
00:11:57,814 --> 00:11:59,335
We can't throw a fist

227
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:00,335
whenever we are upset.

228
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,054
Otherwise, we'll be trapped in wrath

229
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:10,934
and achieved nothing. Alright?

230
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:15,975
Life isn't as simple as you thought.

231
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:18,814
There are moments

232
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:20,454
that go against us.

233
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:23,494
We just can't do anything

234
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:25,614
if someone misunderstands us.

235
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:29,614
Your rage

236
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:32,934
won't help change their mind.

237
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:35,895
Besides,

238
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:37,134
I couldn't care less about
other's opinions,

239
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:42,134
I only care about how you see me.

240
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:49,655
There, there. Don't cry.

241
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:52,934
Junhui.

242
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,574
Let's get married as soon as possible.

243
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:01,814
Sure.

244
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,295
What's the hurry? Where are you going?

245
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:22,814
Oh right.

246
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:24,574
What time is it for the prenup session
this afternoon?

247
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:26,175
Three or four.

248
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:27,054
Three or four.

249
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:28,054
Good. I still have time.

250
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:29,374
I want to take a leave.

251
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:31,254
I'll be back after the session starts. Bye.

252
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:32,335
Be careful.

253
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:42,054
Do you know we've lost

254
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,694
a black cardholder
because of what you said?

255
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:48,494
How dare you spewed nonsense

256
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,295
and nitpicked the product of Fangyu Finance?

257
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:52,895
Do you know

258
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,014
how valuable Mr. Qiu

259
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:55,814
of Fangyu Group is?

260
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:59,374
I can't see why

261
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:00,535
an account manager

262
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:01,855
who just came

263
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:03,535
could be so bold.

264
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,095
It has nothing to do with courage.

265
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:08,014
It's true that something's wrong
with Fangyu's product

266
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:09,694
and I've submitted
an analysis report to you.

267
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,054
You would know

268
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:11,735
that I'm right

269
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:12,814
if you read the report.

270
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:20,694
Don't trick me with that.

271
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,295
Listen.

272
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:24,614
Mr. Qiu is an important partner

273
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:25,975
of our bank

274
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:28,535
who has projects that are worth
tens of billions.

275
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,775
What if the trouble you caused

276
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,855
affects our partnership?

277
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:35,535
Can you afford the loss?

278
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:38,415
As an account manager,

279
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:41,014
my duty is to protect the benefit of clients.

280
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:42,374
I can never introduce

281
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:43,254
a defective trust product

282
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:44,134
to my clients.

283
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:46,694
This doesn't fit well with my work ethic.

284
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:47,655
You!

285
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:56,855
Good. Very good.

286
00:14:57,934 --> 00:14:59,295
This place is too small

287
00:14:59,494 --> 00:15:00,814
for a capable person like you.

288
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:03,895
I hope that you hand in your notice
right now.

289
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,494
Why are you at home?

290
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,335
I'm hungry.

291
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:25,775
So, I came back to cook some noodles.

292
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:26,694
And...

293
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,175
And you made a mess in the kitchen.

294
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:34,574
I'll clean this up.

295
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:38,975
Did you get hurt? Are you fine?

296
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:40,975
Don't strain yourself

297
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,054
if you can't cook.

298
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,215
Tell me what you want to eat.

299
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:44,175
I'll make it and send it to you.

300
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:46,295
You have your own work too.

301
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:47,814
Hold on.

302
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:50,095
Why do you come back?

303
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:55,934
I came to fetch something.

304
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:57,215
I will head back later.

305
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:00,415
You should put your feet up.

306
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:01,374
I'll clean it and cook the food.

307
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,454
I'll clean up the mess.

308
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:03,614
Let me do it.

309
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:04,334
- Hello.
- Be careful.

310
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:06,854
This is your order.

311
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:33,214
Why did you order two servings of rice

312
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:34,254
for yourself?

313
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:36,494
I'm a heavy eater.

314
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:41,895
Fine, I'll own up.

315
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,655
I was thinking

316
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,575
to prepare some food at home

317
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,815
and send it to you

318
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:50,295
as a surprise.

319
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,455
And now you've seen this.

320
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:54,254
Hence,

321
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:56,014
I came out with Plan B

322
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,734
to pretend that I cooked this.

323
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:02,415
I didn't know you'd come back.

324
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:04,494
Why do you suddenly think of

325
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:05,134
cooking for me?

326
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:06,254
The idea doesn't come on a whim.

327
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:08,695
I've been thinking
to do something for you.

328
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:11,175
And this is what I could think of
after racking my brain.

329
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:12,535
All this time,

330
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:15,535
you've been taking care of me.

331
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:18,775
I can't imagine how messy

332
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:22,214
my life would've been without you.

333
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:24,895
Honestly, I just want to tell you

334
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:26,655
that we're one.

335
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:28,854
I can look after you

336
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:31,974
and do anything for you too.

337
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:37,734
You don't need

338
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:39,895
to force yourself into something
you're not good at.

339
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:43,655
I only came to realise this today.

340
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,575
Yang Hua.

341
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,374
I understand that you have your own work and life.

342
00:18:57,815 --> 00:18:59,455
And you will choose family

343
00:19:00,254 --> 00:19:01,614
over your career.

344
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:03,734
However, I don't wish

345
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,295
the family is a nuisance to you.

346
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,614
I hope both of us lead a better life,

347
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:11,895
not because of one's sacrifice.

348
00:19:14,614 --> 00:19:15,494
What if

349
00:19:17,014 --> 00:19:17,854
I lose my job some other day?

350
00:19:18,695 --> 00:19:19,254
I'll take care of you.

351
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,815
Anyway, you'll do a bang-up job

352
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:27,455
no matter where you are.

353
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:28,935
You did well when you were at home.

354
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:30,655
But on one condition,

355
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:33,094
that's you must enjoy
what you've done.

356
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:34,415
Regardless of what choice you make,

357
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:35,535
I'll root for you.

358
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:36,655
I'll back you up

359
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:37,695
like what you did for me.

360
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:45,614
Thank you.

361
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:49,494
I should thank you instead.

362
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,815
Thank you for being here for me.

363
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:54,614
Thank you for being here for me too.

we'll wrap this up then.

373
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:30,094
See you around.

374
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:34,094
Dear, let me see you off.

375
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:38,334
Don't be dejected.

376
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:39,374
It's not your first me

377
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:40,895
losing to me.

378
00:20:42,055 --> 00:20:42,775
I lost?

379
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:44,614
Darling.

380
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:46,254
You're as naive as you used to be.

381
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:48,895
Well, don't grind on this.

382
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:50,734
I'll buy you a meal next time, okay?

383
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:58,535
Do you know who did Mr. Cao meet

384
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:00,254
before signing this agreement?

385
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:10,614
Mr. Ding.

386
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:11,974
We meet at last.

387
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:17,295
What do you think

388
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:18,655
about Cao Yiren's intention
to meet with Mr. Ding?

389
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,014
It could be any reason

390
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:26,374
except that he persuaded Mr. Ding

391
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,494
how deep his love is for Ding Fangfang.

392
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:30,935
Hui.

393
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:33,775
I feel like I'm being outwitted.

394
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:39,134
Think about this.

395
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:41,254
We've sifted through

396
00:21:41,415 --> 00:21:42,974
everything about him

397
00:21:43,494 --> 00:21:45,494
to find the evidence.

398
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,935
Even someone has no sense of business like me

399
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:51,055
deemed that he's natural for business.

400
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:53,214
Though his company

401
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:54,775
encounters all sorts of problems,

402
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:56,575
however, by just getting funds,

403
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:58,334
he still can make a profit.

404
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:02,374
Do you think he made a deal

405
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:03,455
with Mr. Ding?

406
00:22:04,854 --> 00:22:05,415
That's possible.

407
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:08,815
You see.

408
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:12,055
Although I don't know Cao Yiren well,

409
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:13,575
I'm familiar with Mr. Ding.

410
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:14,854
Mr. Ding is a businessman too.

411
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:17,094
If he accepts Cao Yiren's proposal

412
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:18,455
and offers him the fund,

413
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,055
probably he'll be benefitted

414
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:21,815
of the business too.

415
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:23,374
The thing is,

416
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:24,854
the benefit is more alluring
than the property

417
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:25,455
he wanted Cao Yiren

418
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:26,775
to give up.

419
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:28,655
Hui, it's a big loss for us.

420
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:30,055
Why?

421
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:31,295
Think about this.

422
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:32,734
We merely received the money

423
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:33,935
for the prenup

424
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:35,815
yet we've done a due diligence service

425
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:37,854
on financial and lawyering.

426
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:39,935
Not true.

427
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:41,455
I think

428
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:42,935
it's not as easy as I thought.

429
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:47,094
I can sense

430
00:22:47,455 --> 00:22:49,614
that there's something else

431
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:51,854
apart from Cao Yiren's trap.

432
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:54,214
It really bothers me.

433
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:56,734
Hui.

434
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:00,295
Don't tell me you trapped me too.

435
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:06,014
You just came to this department,
though.

436
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:07,775
Why are you so suspicious?

437
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:10,655
Tell me

438
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:12,775
what lesson have you learnt

439
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:14,815
besides this dumb fooled feeling?

440
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:20,854
Well, I won't say it's a lesson.

441
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:23,415
After these days of setbacks,

442
00:23:24,014 --> 00:23:25,214
something has dawned on me.

443
00:23:26,295 --> 00:23:26,935
Go on.

444
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:29,775
Given my shallow experience,

445
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:31,535
there's a long way to go

446
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:33,214
before I establish myself

447
00:23:33,214 --> 00:23:34,175
in the corporate department.

448
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:35,895
You're a realist.

449
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:38,415
As compared to Tao Junhui,

450
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,094
he's a better choice than me

451
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:41,815
and he possesses resources
and connections.

452
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:42,734
Therefore,

453
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:44,455
he's more capable and influential.

454
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:47,094
You have a mind of the management.

455
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:48,734
Besides,

456
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:50,935
the reason why you put me

457
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:52,415
in an awkward place
on the 11th floor

458
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:54,134
not because

459
00:23:54,214 --> 00:23:55,614
you wanted me to keep an eye
on Tao Junhui,

460
00:23:56,974 --> 00:23:57,815
instead,

461
00:23:58,575 --> 00:23:59,775
you disapproved of me

462
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:02,614
and wanted me to reflect on myself.

463
00:24:04,055 --> 00:24:05,014
You're learning.

464
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:10,895
I know I used to be

465
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:12,295
self-centred before.

466
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:14,695
Qin Shi.

467
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:15,935
Who do you know

468
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:16,854
what's the greatest virtue about you?

469
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:18,374
I'm young and beautiful.

470
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:23,775
The greatest virtue of yours

471
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:25,014
is that you're quick-witted
and resourceful.

472
00:24:25,535 --> 00:24:27,614
Your hands aren't tied by the restriction.

473
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,134
Likewise, the greatest flaw of yours

474
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,295
is that you think quickly,
uncontrollably,

475
00:24:32,655 --> 00:24:33,734
and overly ambitious.

476
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:35,734
You fail to realise

477
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:36,895
how deep the world is

478
00:24:37,094 --> 00:24:37,974
and you need to restrain yourself.

479
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,695
I'm at fault.

480
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,214
I'm wrong.

481
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,974
I'm to be blamed.

482
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:45,455
Please give me a chance.

483
00:24:49,014 --> 00:24:49,655
Let's set some ground rules.

484
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,014
Never take matters into your own hands.

485
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:54,974
No problem.

486
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:57,734
Never hide any information

487
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:58,854
concerning the company's interest.

488
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:00,455
I'll be frank.

489
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,334
Never cut corners

490
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:05,535
when I task you with something.

491
00:25:06,494 --> 00:25:07,535
I'll accomplish anything

492
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:08,295
you want me to do.

493
00:25:08,535 --> 00:25:09,575
You're my guardian.

494
00:25:11,974 --> 00:25:12,494
Very good.

495
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:13,575
Now,

496
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:15,014
I have a very important task for you.

497
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:22,094
Could you please take a look at it
for me?

498
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:23,895
Sure, I'll.

499
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:31,295
Madam, don't worry.

500
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:32,254
Though

501
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:34,175
you're not registered on
the property ownership certificate,

502
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:34,695
you possess

503
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,455
half right of this house

504
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,214
as it was bought

505
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:38,175
after you married your husband.

506
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:40,575
After your husband passed away,

507
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:42,455
his possession
turns into an inheritance.

508
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,134
Both you and your son

509
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:45,214
are entitled to the inheritance.

510
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,134
Besides, you have the right
of habitation over this house.

511
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:48,895
Your son can't drive you
out of the house.

512
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:49,775
Don't worry.

513
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:51,295
Alright, I understood.

514
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:51,895
Sure.

515
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:53,935
Thank you.

516
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:54,494
Don't mention it.

517
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:55,815
Madam, wait.

518
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:57,295
Please take a photo with me.

519
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:00,415
Qian, do you mind helping me?

520
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,950
(Charity Law Consultation)

521
00:26:05,214 --> 00:26:07,014
Three, two, one.

522
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:08,134
Good.

523
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,094
Thank you.

524
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,014
Thank you, see you.

525
00:26:10,214 --> 00:26:11,214
Do come by if you need help.

526
00:26:11,214 --> 00:26:12,055
Sure.

527
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,295
Miss Qin.

528
00:26:18,935 --> 00:26:19,575
Why don't you

529
00:26:20,094 --> 00:26:21,254
come back to the family department?

530
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:23,494
I'm doing good
in the corporate department, though.

531
00:26:23,695 --> 00:26:24,494
Why would I?

532
00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:25,974
Because

533
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:27,655
we miss you very much

534
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:28,775
and we wish you can come back.

535
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:29,815
Am I right, Qian?

536
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:31,415
Yes.

537
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:35,055
There's no room for improvement
for me

538
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:36,575
in the family department.

539
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:38,094
Besides, I went
to the corporate department

540
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:39,295
as I wanted to step out
of my comfort zone

541
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:40,415
and challenge myself.

542
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:43,775
Being a lawyer needs lifelong learning.

543
00:26:44,494 --> 00:26:45,254
Well, I shall end here.

544
00:26:46,614 --> 00:26:47,374
I'm going strolling around.

545
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:48,334
Work well.

546
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:49,374
Phone me if anything happens.

547
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:50,494
- Sure.
- Sure.

548
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,254
I'm around the area of your bank.

549
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:56,374
What time do you get off work?

550
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:57,535
I can pick you up.

551
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,494
(I have an extra shift today.)

552
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:02,175
(I might be coming home late.)

553
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:03,295
Extra shift?

554
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,254
The system of the bank

555
00:27:05,295 --> 00:27:05,935
is off on time though.

556
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:06,655
Why would you work overtime?

557
00:27:07,415 --> 00:27:08,415
(Training.)

558
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:09,695
(We have training sessions.)

559
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:11,134
(We're asked to stay for the training.)

560
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:12,334
Training?

561
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:14,695
Where are you now?

562
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:16,134
What's the loud noise over your side?

563
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:24,815
Say that again.

564
00:27:25,415 --> 00:27:26,374
What did they do to you?

565
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:29,614
Nothing. It's just

566
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:31,254
that the job doesn't suit me well.

567
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:35,214
Just now, you said

568
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:36,415
you detected a problem

569
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:37,494
from the product

570
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:39,334
and helped the client to sidestep

571
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:40,935
the risk of losing the property

572
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:43,575
and avoided a potential crisis for the bank.

573
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:44,535
However,

574
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:46,614
you lost your job because of this.

575
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:47,374
Is that so?

576
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:51,935
Well, you can say it that way.

577
00:27:56,854 --> 00:27:57,655
Bad guys.

578
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:05,295
Jia.

579
00:28:06,614 --> 00:28:07,334
Cai.

580
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,134
Mr. Qiu called me just now

581
00:28:09,575 --> 00:28:10,535
saying that he was dissatisfied

582
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:12,214
with the cancellation

583
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:13,134
of credit products

584
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:14,415
he offered.

585
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:16,895
He promised

586
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:18,295
to introduce me to the person in charge

587
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:19,895
of the New Energy Smart City this week.

588
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:21,175
It's all gone up in smoke now.

589
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,334
Are you going

590
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:23,374
to bear this consequence?

591
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:24,415
Calm down.

592
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:25,535
Please sit, Jia.

593
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:26,775
Sit down and drink some water.

594
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:28,895
Take a sip.

595
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,535
Jia, do you believe me

596
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:34,055
if I tell you I can?

597
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:36,895
Besides,

598
00:28:37,494 --> 00:28:38,655
you can't always threaten others

599
00:28:38,854 --> 00:28:39,575
with this project.

600
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:40,974
I heard

601
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:42,695
that you've been following this project
for a long time.

602
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:43,974
Yet you haven't gotten

603
00:28:44,094 --> 00:28:44,895
to meet the person in charge.

604
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:46,175
I wonder what's wrong with you.

605
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:47,094
Anyway,

606
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:49,895
we've helped Fangyu to sell products

607
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:51,575
and make sales that are worth
billions of yuan.

608
00:28:51,734 --> 00:28:55,415
Cai, what are you trying to imply?

609
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:56,815
What am I trying to imply?

610
00:28:57,295 --> 00:28:58,214
I was saying

611
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:00,535
that although

612
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:01,815
we helped Fangyu distribute the product,

613
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:03,455
however, we promoted

614
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:05,455
their product to our important clients.

615
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:07,055
Do you know what will happen

616
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:09,374
if the clients find something wrong

617
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:10,854
about the product?

618
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:12,214
Something wrong?

619
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:15,374
Fangyu is an established
finance company,

620
00:29:15,575 --> 00:29:16,614
okay?

621
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:23,655
By the way,

622
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,295
I heard

623
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:27,334
that it was you

624
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:29,374
who cut Yang Hua some slack.

625
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:32,374
I'm curious

626
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:33,935
what's the relationship between you two.

627
00:29:35,014 --> 00:29:36,295
He didn't have rich working experience,

628
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:37,935
yet he got to waltz in here

629
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:38,935
to be an account manager

630
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:41,214
who nitpicked the product.

631
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:43,895
I recruited Yang Hua

632
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:46,254
as I'm well aware of his capability

633
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:47,455
to deal with this job.

634
00:29:48,014 --> 00:29:48,854
I tell you what,

635
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:50,254
being an account manager

636
00:29:50,494 --> 00:29:51,254
is just too small for him.

637
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:52,494
When he was

638
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:53,535
an analyst of the best finance company

639
00:29:53,854 --> 00:29:54,775
in Canada,

640
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:56,055
he was just twenty-two years old.

641
00:29:56,815 --> 00:29:57,695
I can promise you

642
00:29:58,334 --> 00:29:59,494
that the product is defective

643
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:00,815
when he said so.

644
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:02,094
You can promise?

645
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:03,695
Can you take the blame
if he's wrong?

646
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:04,695
Can you?

647
00:30:04,974 --> 00:30:05,815
What do you want now

648
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,254
when you've fired him?

649
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:09,494
What are you up to?

650
00:30:10,254 --> 00:30:10,935
Mr. Cai.

651
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:11,854
You need to come out now.

652
00:30:12,295 --> 00:30:12,854
Why?

653
00:30:13,254 --> 00:30:15,494
Yang Hua...is back.

654
00:30:15,695 --> 00:30:16,374
Why does he come back?

655
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:17,655
Perfect timing.

656
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:18,895
I want to see him now.

657
00:30:22,775 --> 00:30:23,535
Why do you come here?

658
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:26,455
Who are you?

659
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:30,334
Take a seat.

660
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:37,974
I'm Yang Hua's wife.

661
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,334
Impressive, youngsters.

662
00:30:45,374 --> 00:30:46,974
You caused a big problem at work

663
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:48,695
and now you ask your wife to stand up for you.

664
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:49,974
As a man,

665
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,295
I feel shameful for you.

666
00:30:55,535 --> 00:30:56,415
How may I address you?

667
00:30:57,895 --> 00:30:58,535
My last name is Jia.

668
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:00,655
You're the bank manager?

669
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:04,974
Did you sack my husband?

670
00:31:05,455 --> 00:31:05,935
Yes.

671
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:10,134
Can you please tell me your reason?

672
00:31:10,655 --> 00:31:11,254
My reason?

673
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:13,775
You're the fine one to ask.

674
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:16,535
Why don't you ask your husband?

675
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:20,295
Listen up.

676
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:22,775
You better apologise to Mr. Qiu now

677
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:25,134
and take back your inappropriate words.

678
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:26,455
Put everything right.

679
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:28,734
Otherwise, you have to bear

680
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:30,854
all the consequences and financial loss.

681
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:31,854
Do you hear me?

682
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,334
When I was young, my mother taught me

683
00:31:41,695 --> 00:31:44,254
to act sensibly and reasonably,

684
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:45,494
show respect to others,

685
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:47,815
don't make noise while eating

686
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:51,014
and never point my finger at others while talking.

687
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:53,254
And I realised

688
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:55,334
that there are people

689
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,415
who are uneducated.

690
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:02,055
Who are you referring to?

691
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:06,374
Mr. Jia.

692
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:09,254
It seems

693
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:11,094
you don't quite know about laws.

694
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:12,295
In Labour Law,

695
00:32:12,655 --> 00:32:13,974
employees can only be dismissed

696
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:15,014
under the following situations.

697
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:16,895
First, employees
who don't fit the requirement

698
00:32:17,374 --> 00:32:18,734
during probation.

699
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:21,014
Second, violation

700
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:22,455
of the rules and regulations
of the employer.

701
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:25,535
Third, dereliction of duty,
favouritism and fraud,

702
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:26,854
and causing great loss

703
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:28,334
to the employer.

704
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:29,455
Fourth,

705
00:32:29,695 --> 00:32:31,014
sign labour contract

706
00:32:31,094 --> 00:32:32,415
with other employers.

707
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:33,895
Fifth, the labour contract is invalid

708
00:32:34,455 --> 00:32:35,655
according to the rules.

709
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,775
Sixth, prosecuted
for criminal responsibility

710
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:38,655
according to law.

711
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:39,974
May I ask

712
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:42,535
if Yang Hua has violated which of them?

713
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:54,254
The second...

714
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:55,815
Think twice before you talk.

715
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:00,175
Yang Hua

716
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:01,614
raised reasonable doubts

717
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:03,055
about the risks of products

718
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:04,614
released by
an external financial institutions

719
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:05,734
entrusted to the bank.

720
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:06,614
Please tell me

721
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:08,695
which of the laws did he violate?

722
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:14,734
He...

723
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:20,374
That's not

724
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:21,815
within the scope of his job.

725
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:25,295
The job scope of an account manager
includes

726
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:26,734
serving the clients.

727
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:28,055
He's being responsible for the bank

728
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,094
and the client.

729
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:30,775
Please explain to me

730
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:32,695
what's his job scope

731
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:34,494
instead of this?

732
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:39,854
You...

733
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:41,974
You're messing up with me.

734
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:43,415
You're the one who messes up with me.

735
00:33:44,854 --> 00:33:45,734
Per Labour Law,

736
00:33:47,014 --> 00:33:47,974
the employer isn't entitled

737
00:33:48,455 --> 00:33:49,254
to dismiss the employee

738
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:51,254
even if they discover the incompetency

739
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:53,175
of the employee.

740
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:55,214
The company must offer

741
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:56,614
training for the employee,

742
00:33:57,014 --> 00:33:58,415
which is the duty of the employer.

743
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:00,815
Even if you intend
to dismiss the employee,

744
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:02,175
you must inform them
via written documents

745
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,374
thirty days before
the termination date

746
00:34:03,695 --> 00:34:05,094
and pay the employee

747
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:07,254
the wage for their contribution
within the period.

748
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:10,255
The behavior of your company

749
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:12,774
has violated Labour Law.

750
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:14,495
Arbitration Court or the media,

751
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:16,015
you can choose either one.

752
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:17,774
I'll see it through to the end.

753
00:34:27,614 --> 00:34:28,054
You!

754
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,814
Who the heck are you?

755
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:37,134
I'm the attorney

756
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:39,054
of Cheng & Hui Law Firm of Pujiang.

757
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:40,255
My name is Qin Shi.

758
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:43,094
Before you try him,

759
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:47,415
you need to ask me first.

760
00:34:53,774 --> 00:34:54,455
Let's go.

761
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:25,415
Miss Qin.

762
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:28,814
The exit is over here.

763
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,374
- You should tell me earlier.
- That's right.

764
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:51,495
Spend a good night with your wife
tonight.

765
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:52,455
She's amazing.

766
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:03,655
Miss Qin.

767
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:14,534
I knew it was you.

768
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:15,854
We meet again.

769
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:20,814
It's a shame to waste your talent

770
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:22,215
being an account manager here.

771
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:24,175
Do you want to join my company?

772
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:35,134
Mr. Qiu.

773
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,215
Glad to see you here.

774
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:38,175
Well,

775
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:39,215
regarding that incident,

776
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:41,334
I've settled it seriously.

777
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:45,215
Back in the day,

778
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:47,015
Qiu Jianxiang

779
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:50,374
was a god in the security industry to us.

780
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,334
All of his classic cases

781
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:54,455
were recorded in the textbook.

782
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:55,774
Our lecturer

783
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,255
of the security course

784
00:36:57,455 --> 00:36:58,814
was his loyal fan.

785
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:01,134
Normally,

786
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:02,735
we common people

787
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:04,814
could never cross path

788
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:06,455
with a person like him.

789
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:09,054
Qin Shi, guess what.

790
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,015
During the last year in college,

791
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:12,134
the two of us participated

792
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:14,895
in the University Investment
Simulation Competition

793
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:16,655
that led to a massive change

794
00:37:16,895 --> 00:37:18,015
to the life of two young men.

795
00:37:23,094 --> 00:37:23,695
Take a guest.

796
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:26,334
Who won first place?

797
00:37:26,854 --> 00:37:27,495
It seems you were foreshowing.

798
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:28,415
It must be that man.

799
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:31,415
Wrong.

800
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:34,015
You know what?

801
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:36,094
The competition lasted for one month.

802
00:37:36,774 --> 00:37:37,975
The participant wasn't restricted
to individuals and groups.

803
00:37:38,975 --> 00:37:40,134
The result of the competition
is determined

804
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:41,175
by earnings yield.

805
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:42,695
So, Yang Hua and I

806
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:44,294
shared one account.

807
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,415
I remembered

808
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:46,334
that the market index

809
00:37:46,415 --> 00:37:49,455
started at 4289.72

810
00:37:49,854 --> 00:37:53,015
and it ended at 3686.92

811
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:54,334
which was reduced by

812
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:55,695
12.02 per cent.

813
00:37:57,774 --> 00:38:00,215
Two of us only took two-weeks time

814
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:01,814
to raise the earning yields

815
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:03,614
to 17...

816
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:06,054
17.32 per cent.

817
00:38:06,614 --> 00:38:07,895
Do you know what that means?

818
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:10,015
First place.

819
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,374
Guess how much is the yield

820
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:15,854
of second place.

821
00:38:19,895 --> 00:38:21,175
I feel ashamed of them.

822
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:21,935
They were just dumb.

823
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,374
Only 10.02 per cent.

824
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:29,374
What was the problem with them then?

825
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:39,655
Hua.

826
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:41,774
Hua.

827
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,134
Stop solving that stupid game.

828
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:44,854
Alright?

829
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:45,975
That Little Prairie Prince

830
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:46,774
managed to raise his yields

831
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:48,294
to 14.3 per cent.

832
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:49,374
Just now,

833
00:38:49,614 --> 00:38:50,334
he sold off

834
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:52,134
the stock

835
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:53,415
of Dongfang Electronics

836
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:54,255
at 12.26 yuan.

837
00:38:54,814 --> 00:38:56,334
I remember that he bought it

838
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:58,614
with 11.76 yuan.

839
00:38:58,935 --> 00:38:59,735
What do we do now?

840
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:01,975
His gain is around 3 to 4 per cent.

841
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:03,574
Only ten days left.

842
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:04,215
If this keeps on going,

843
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:05,374
we'll surpass us.

844
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:08,374
Let's open a position.

845
00:39:10,054 --> 00:39:10,534
No.

846
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:17,534
Let's open a position.

847
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:19,614
I've picked four stocks.

848
00:39:20,415 --> 00:39:21,054
Four of them

849
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,294
fulfil our requirement for the trade.

850
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,255
It'll work. Shall we?

851
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:26,215
No.

852
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:27,415
Previously, we talked about

853
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:28,175
Yizheng Chemical Fibre.

854
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,814
We did some research on it, right?

855
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,534
If the price is ranging from 6.90 yuan

856
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:32,614
to 7.20 yuan,

857
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:33,975
we can buy it, right?

858
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,134
Now that it has increased to

859
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:36,015
7.10 yuan.

860
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,015
We can give it a shot.

861
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:38,975
No.

862
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,655
Well, the stock of Hongcheng

863
00:39:42,895 --> 00:39:43,895
has raised to

864
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,814
20.58 yuan now.

865
00:39:45,814 --> 00:39:47,935
You said this yourself

866
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:49,215
that we can buy it
if it's below 21 yuan.

867
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:50,574
Shall we?

868
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:51,935
Let's buy it.

869
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:52,574
Yang.

870
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:55,175
What's wrong with you?

871
00:39:59,334 --> 00:40:00,054
Therefore,

872
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:01,415
second place surpassed you

873
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:03,455
as you didn't open a position

874
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:04,175
and sit idly?

875
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:07,695
On the 23th August,

876
00:40:08,215 --> 00:40:09,134
we bought 2000 shares of Hongcheng

877
00:40:09,294 --> 00:40:10,655
with 20.62 yuan

878
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:12,614
and sold them at 19.50 yuan

879
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:14,015
at the 27th August.

880
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:16,015
Lastly, Little Prairie Prince

881
00:40:16,215 --> 00:40:17,175
topped the rank

882
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:18,374
with 17.6 per cent

883
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:20,215
which was 0.2 per cent slightly higher

884
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,134
than the second place.

885
00:40:29,374 --> 00:40:31,655
Who's the person

886
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:35,614
that caused this failure?

887
00:40:43,614 --> 00:40:45,695
That was why I came to realise

888
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:47,774
that I wasn't suitable for trading.

889
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:49,255
After graduation,

890
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:50,814
I chose bank over stock exchange

891
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:53,094
without hesitation.

892
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:54,814
Since then,

893
00:40:55,015 --> 00:40:55,975
I started to count the money for others.

894
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:57,134
Afterwards,

895
00:40:58,015 --> 00:40:58,735
I never stand straight

896
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:00,895
before him

897
00:41:01,175 --> 00:41:02,614
as if I've owned him five million.

898
00:41:03,175 --> 00:41:04,015
He bullies me a lot.

899
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,935
You've been talking for one hour.

900
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:07,094
Can you tell me about the hero?

901
00:41:08,054 --> 00:41:11,735
Miss Qin, please don't be as impersonal as him.

902
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:13,814
You should listen to the story

903
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:14,814
of the supporting character

904
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:15,975
besides the hero.

905
00:41:16,495 --> 00:41:17,294
Do you know how much

906
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:18,334
my time is worth an hour?

907
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:19,495
Don't talk to me like that.

908
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:21,175
I work the entire eight hours
dealing with money too.

909
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:22,534
Despite this, I'm a man with feelings.

910
00:41:24,975 --> 00:41:26,015
After the contest,

911
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:27,334
I received a call.

912
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:38,334
Hello.

913
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:39,534
(Hello.)

914
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:41,534
(You're Mr. Yang Hua, right?)

915
00:41:42,175 --> 00:41:43,015
(I'm Qiu Jianxiang.)

916
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,294
(I suppose you know who I am.)

917
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:47,134
(Wonder if you would)

918
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,774
(meet me and have a little chat.)

919
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:56,094
I see.

920
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:57,695
Among all the students,

921
00:41:57,854 --> 00:41:58,774
I paid most attention to you.

922
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:00,574
Someone bet me

923
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:01,975
you would open a position

924
00:42:02,054 --> 00:42:02,655
when you were going to crack.

925
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:04,215
But, I didn't think so.

926
00:42:05,094 --> 00:42:06,015
Though I lost the game,

927
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:08,415
anyway, I got to learn the truth today.

928
00:42:10,054 --> 00:42:11,255
As a trader,

929
00:42:11,854 --> 00:42:13,294
one must have a strong determination

930
00:42:13,735 --> 00:42:14,695
and a firm belief

931
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,374
and stick to it till the end.

932
00:42:19,895 --> 00:42:21,175
Did you learn something

933
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,294
from this failure?

934
00:42:26,774 --> 00:42:28,334
The lesson I've learnt is

935
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:30,094
that a partner who slows you down

936
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,374
is scarier than a robust opponent.

937
00:42:43,054 --> 00:42:44,895
Would you like to be my partner?

938
00:42:50,255 --> 00:42:51,455
After graduation,

939
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:52,334
I went to Canada

940
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:53,455
to learn from him for two years

941
00:42:54,854 --> 00:42:56,215
and then I became the fund manager.

942
00:43:05,774 --> 00:43:08,134
Excuse me,
please get me two flasks of sake.

943
00:43:08,495 --> 00:43:09,134
- One flask.
- One flask.

944
00:43:11,614 --> 00:43:13,175
Let's just take one flask.
