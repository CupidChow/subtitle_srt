Your wife is here.

Wake up.

22
00:01:59,347 --> 00:01:59,866
My wife?

23
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:00,786
Hurry up. Your wife is here.

24
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:02,906
I don't have a wife.

25
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:16,267
She's my Goddess.

26
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:21,827
Isn't he reading poetry today?

27
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:22,626
He already did.

28
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:23,267
Help me out.

29
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:24,827
Enough.

30
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:25,907
Go home. You can hug her at home.

31
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,706
If he were born in ancient times,

32
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,387
there would have been more
than 300 Poems of the Tang Dynasty.

33
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:30,907
Have you settled the bill?

34
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:31,947
I have. Let's go.

35
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:32,827
Slow down.

36
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:34,786
Why did you drink so much?

37
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:37,346
Slow down.

38
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,146
Come here. Have a seat.

39
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:44,866
Thank you.

40
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:45,827
We'll get going.

41
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,107
Miss Qin.

42
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:52,827
I don't know

43
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:53,667
if you're really married,

44
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:55,586
but there's one thing I'm sure of,

45
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:56,747
Yang Hua

46
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:58,747
likes you a lot.

47
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,467
He might appear very
emotionally distant and cold.

48
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:03,747
But deep down,

49
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:04,907
he's especially fragile.

50
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:07,986
I hope that even if you want
to use him as a pawn,

51
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:10,267
please don't hurt him.

52
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:15,827
If I've said anything wrong,

53
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:16,667
just think of me as a drunk man

54
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,467
who's spouting nonsense.

55
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:20,226
Drive safe. I'll get going.

56
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:21,387
Bye.

57
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:35,506
I can't do this anymore.

58
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,107
It's been so long since I last exercised
this much, and even longer

59
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:38,786
- since I last did it with my daughter.
- Mr. Wu, you're too modest.

60
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:41,547
Mr. Wu is getting better and better at dancing.

61
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:43,467
I'm all sweaty.

62
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,226
Mr. Wu.

63
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:46,467
Sorry.

64
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:47,747
The alcohol I just served you

65
00:03:47,747 --> 00:03:48,586
is actually a collectible

66
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:49,146
that belongs to another client.

67
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:50,187
I'm truly sorry.

68
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,467
We made a mistake.

69
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:52,387
Do you think

70
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:53,346
we can serve you with something else?

71
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:58,747
That's why I thought

72
00:03:58,747 --> 00:03:59,586
the alcohol tasted really smooth.

73
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,547
It's a very decent collectible.

74
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:06,226
Who owns this?

75
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,307
They have really good taste.

76
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:08,706
It's mine.

77
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:13,307
And you are...

78
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:14,866
Let me introduce her to you, Dad.

79
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:17,186
She is Madam Tang Yihui.

80
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:19,147
Madam Tang, this is my dad.

81
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:21,906
I see,

82
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:22,867
you are Feifei's superior.

83
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:24,306
Nice to meet you.

84
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:25,587
Nice to meet you too, Mr. Wu.

85
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,466
Your daughter is too humble.

86
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,827
Mr. Wu, it seems like
you have other guests.

87
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,346
I don't want to keep you occupied.

88
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:33,827
I have a few more bottles of liquor

89
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,107
that have aged quite well.

90
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:36,267
Get Mr. Wu two bottles as a gift.

91
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:37,626
You're too kind.

92
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,147
I can't be getting all these for free.

93
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,827
It'll be on you next time.

94
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,306
Sure.

95
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:43,827
Thanks, Madam Tang.

96
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,667
The age

97
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:49,226
does give the liquor

98
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:50,346
a different taste.

99
00:04:51,186 --> 00:04:51,827
It's good liquor.

100
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,707
Let's enjoy our night with Mr. Wu.

101
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:56,306
Come here.

102
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:58,867
Thanks, Mr. Wu, for the feast.

103
00:04:59,107 --> 00:04:59,906
Thank you so much.

104
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,306
Madam Tang.

105
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:09,186
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,906
You didn't do anything wrong.

107
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:16,306
I should've told you sooner.

108
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:19,346
We have a lot of great talents
in our law firm.

109
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:20,906
It's my honor.

110
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,906
Madam Tang, do you think

111
00:05:25,147 --> 00:05:26,827
you can be the legal counsel
for my dad's company?

112
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:30,346
Is this what you want

113
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:31,867
or what your dad wants?

114
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:33,267
I can convince my dad.

115
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:36,346
That's great.

116
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:38,387
Xi Mei PR has

117
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:39,186
a good customer base.

118
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:40,746
They have a good relationship
with the media too.

119
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:42,906
It is Cheng & Hui's pleasure

120
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:44,226
to provide services

121
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,466
for a corporate like Xi Mei.

122
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:48,306
Madam Tang, you're too humble.

123
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:50,147
Cheng & Hui

124
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,547
is one of the best law firms too.

125
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:54,147
If you can work with my dad's company,

126
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,547
we'll form a strong coalition.

127
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:59,066
Then, what can I do

128
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:01,746
for Miss Wu in return?

129
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,107
All right. Slow down.

130
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,147
Why is he so heavy
when he's a vegetarian?

131
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:21,346
Herbivores are bigger.

132
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:24,906
All right. We're here.

133
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:25,867
Careful.

134
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:27,667
Careful.

135
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:30,786
We're here.

136
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:57,547
Shi, we're getting married.

137
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,626
We are getting married!

138
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:06,906
(I'll definitely give you)

139
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,026
the perfect wedding

140
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:13,547
you've always dreamed of.

141
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:16,267

Mr. Huang. Calm down.

163
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:32,387
Listen.

164
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:34,626
We are lawyers, not judges.

165
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:35,787
You pay legal fees,

166
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:37,347
but we can't amend the law.

167
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:39,347
This is the best result

168
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:40,587
we can achieve.

169
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:42,267
Miss Qin.

00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:44,387
I think you've been relying

171
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:45,947
too much on gossip.

172
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,746
You can't bribe a judge,

173
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:49,947
no matter how good your offer is.

174
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,147
If you're not pleased with the result,

175
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:53,267
you can always appeal.

176
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:55,626
If you can't find any new evidence,

177
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:56,506
the appeal might...

178
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:01,626
Let me send another document to you.

179
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,866
Why are you here?

180
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:10,227
Miss Qin.

181
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:11,787
This is my office.

182
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:14,866
Miss Qin.

183
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,587
Mr. Qiao wants to see you right away.

184
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:38,746
Congratulations, Miss Qin.

185
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:39,546
This way, please.

186
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,090
(PARTERNER COUNSEL)

187
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:20,827
Miss Qin.

188
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:25,947
Miss... Miss Qin.

189
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:31,986
Are you all right?

190
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:33,947
I'm fine.

191
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:35,986
This way, please.

192
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:39,387
Miss Qin, sorry.

193
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,787
I only got this news an hour ago.

194
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:43,666
I was in a haste,

195
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,066
so I didn't get
to prepare everything nicely.

196
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:46,306
However, Madam Tang said

197
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:47,787
this is only temporary.

198
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,106
There will be changes in the future.

199
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:51,666
You can always let me know

200
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:52,866
if you need anything.

201
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:53,746
Sure.

202
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:54,827
You're welcome.

203
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:05,746
Here?

204
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,306
You're not kidding me, right?

205
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:18,227
I don't think so.

206
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:36,227
Take your time and check the contract.

207
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,147
We can talk about it later

208
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:37,947
if you have any questions.

209
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:43,907
Miss Qin.

210
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:45,467
Is Madam Tang in?

211
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:46,227
Yes, she is.

212
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:47,546
But she has a guest now.

213
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,480
(PARTERNER COUNSEL)

214
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:55,666
If I were you,

215
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,506
I wouldn't pick this time

216
00:12:57,707 --> 00:12:58,907
to let it out on my boss.

217
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:02,186
Unless you're ready to resign,

218
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:03,986
just like me.

219
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:12,267
Resign?

220
00:13:12,907 --> 00:13:13,546
Why?

221
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:15,626
I've tendered my resignation.

222
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:17,546
I thought

223
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:18,986
she would at least say something

224
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:19,907
to convince me to stay.

225
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:22,546
That's why

226
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:24,587
no one should ever

227
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:28,066
overestimate their worth to a company.

228
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:29,787
Why did you resign?

229
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:32,626
Because Wu Fei took your position.

230
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:34,186
Is that really why?

231
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:36,546
A chambering pupil

232
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:38,907
who joined the company
not more than three months ago.

233
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,027
Because her dad

234
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:41,426
is the general manager
of Xi Mei PR,

235
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:42,626
she was able to skip

236
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:43,986
the years of hard work others put in,

237
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:45,827
and became a senior attorney
right away.

238
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,027
And look at me.

239
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:50,387
No matter how hard I work,

240
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:52,066
I'll never be on par

241
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:53,626
with my married male coworkers,

242
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:55,506
or those female coworkers

243
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:58,426
who pretend to be married.

244
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:00,387
I can't put up

245
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,387
with a corporate culture like this.

246
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:03,546
A relationship won't work

247
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,227
if the contribution is one-sided.

248
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:05,986
It's the same at the workplace too.

249
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,186
But fortunately,

250
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:10,626
I have many other choices.

251
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:17,866
Why do I feel like

252
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,546
these aren't the true reasons?

253
00:14:23,506 --> 00:14:24,267
Miss Li.

254
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,467
Have you received

255
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,186
the year-end performance review?

256
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:29,866
Any problems?

257
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:31,746
It's my fourth year

258
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,066
working as a legal assistant.

259
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:35,027
This year-end performance review

260
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:36,267
will decide if I can be promoted

261
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:38,347
to an associate attorney
by the end of this year.

262
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:39,546
So?

263
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:41,186
I took a look at it.

264
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:43,267
I got a B for my evaluation.

265
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,227
I want to know

266
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:47,106
what am I lacking.

267
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:49,626
If I fail to get an A or above,

268
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,186
I'm afraid that...

269
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:52,186
Miss Zhou.

270
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:53,506
Yes, Miss Li.

271
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,227
Our law firm is very transparent

272
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:56,866
about our evaluation process.

273
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:00,027
Although it's not perfect,

274
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:01,347
it can accurately reflect

275
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:02,986
our staff's workplace competencies.

276
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:05,666
If you wish to get an A,

277
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,426
you should work harder

278
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:09,186
in the second half of the year.

279
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:11,587
Miss Li.

280
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,387
I promise I'll work even harder.

281
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,426
But I also know

282
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,387
that if I can get

283
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:17,746
a senior attorney's reference

284
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:18,787
in the evaluation,

285
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,467
it'll earn me a few extra points.

286
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,147
When we speak of references,

287
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:25,387
it's only for the best employees,

288
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:28,387
or those who have outstanding achievements.

289
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:32,147
Do you think you're one of them?

290
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:33,387
I do.

291
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:37,387
Really?

292
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:38,947
Miss Li.

293
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:40,587
Have you never wondered

294
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,467
how did this flash drive

295
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,787
end up on your table?

296
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:45,186
What flash drive?

297
00:15:56,907 --> 00:15:57,707
It was you.

298
00:15:59,066 --> 00:15:59,787
Miss Li.

299
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:02,227
I'll always take your side.

300
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:04,227
We have no one

301
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:05,866
to back us up,

302
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,907
so we need to help each other.

303
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:09,827
Don't you agree?

304
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:15,227
Qin Shi, you won't get any true friends
at the peak.

305
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:24,546
Don't go. Just stay here.

306
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,546
I'm getting goosebumps.

307
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:33,267
I wasn't expecting you

308
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:36,227
to convince me to stay.

309
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,907
Your acting is pretty good.

310
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:41,907
I'm serious.

311
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:43,467
Don't go. Stay.

312
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:47,746
Cheng & Hui will stop discriminating

313
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:50,227
single female lawyers.

314
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:54,827
Did you get any news?

315
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,106
Stop asking.

316
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:58,106
Just believe me.

317
00:16:58,306 --> 00:16:59,467
Why should I trust you?

318
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:11,467
Are you saying

319
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:14,587
that you want to move to the 11th floor

320
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,666
because you want to change the policy?

321
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:23,827
Qin Shi, I always thought

322
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,186
you were a smart person.

323
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:27,546
It seems like I made a mistake.

324
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:29,107
You're so foolish.

325
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:30,947
You're taking such a great risk,

326
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:32,747
because you want to benefit others.

327
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,587
Who do you think you are?

328
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:36,947
This is me.

329
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:39,546
I have never changed.

330
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,107
I only told the lie two years ago,

331
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:43,546
so that I could do this.

332
00:17:46,347 --> 00:17:48,707
All these years,

333
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:51,347
people always think of us as rivals.

334
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:53,186
But I admire you a lot.

335
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,587
Although we are using different approaches,

336
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:57,026
we have the same goal.

337
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:58,627
We all know there's an unspoken rule

338
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,026
in our workplace.

339
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,947
But none of us gave up, right?

340
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:07,906
You have a really good imagination.

341
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:11,507
But I'm more pragmatic than you.

342
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:12,546
I know

343
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:13,426
when to work hard,

344
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,146
and when to give up.

345
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:17,026
You have a big dream.

346
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:18,827
Have you ever thought about it?

347
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,947
In your current moment,

348
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,146
you are too far from your goal.

349
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,627
It's not easy

350
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:28,707
to change the rules.

351
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:32,347
Shouldn't you secure your footing

352
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:33,707
on the 11th floor first

353
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,026
before you think about anything else?

354
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:36,587
Did Qiao Siming tell you this?

355
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,467
Tang Yihui won't be able

356
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,507
to fool me.

357
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:47,627
She owes me an explanation.

358
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,066
What kind of explanation?

359
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:53,026
You're so foolish.

360
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:54,707
What do you mean?

361
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:56,386
Do you really think

362
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,666
you'll win the partner election

363
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:00,666
that's going on upstairs?

364
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:03,186
Cut to the chase.

365
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:25,066
We have two nominees left.

366
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,026
Miss Qin

367
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:30,867
and Mr. Shen.

368
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,747
Seven partners

369
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:35,266
took part in this voting.

370
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,627
In the end,

371
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:40,867
Mr. Shen got three votes,

372
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,827
and Miss Qin got three votes too.

373
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,666
Shen actually got the same number
of votes as me.

374
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,266
What did you

375
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,186
just say?

376
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:53,347
It's the other way around.

377
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:55,266
You actually got the same number
of votes as Shen.

378
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:57,867
Qin Shi.

379
00:19:58,227 --> 00:19:59,186
You might be a great deal

380
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:00,467
in the family department,

381
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:02,146
but speaking of
your performance indicator,

382
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:03,347
how many corporate disputes

383
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:05,266
have you dealt with before?

384
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:07,026
Other than the Civil Law System,

385
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,467
which one among the
Common Law System and Civil Law

386
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,546
are you well-versed with?

387
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:13,627
Shen works very closely with
the economic crime investigation team.

388
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:15,426
Fang's dad

389
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:17,747
was the first person in China

390
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:18,627
to study the Civil Law System.

391
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,587
Pan, although with the least experience,

392
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:23,227
got his Master of Laws

393
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:24,426
from the United Kingdom.

394
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:27,306
You beat Fang and Pan,

395
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:28,786
and I already think

396
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:29,987
that was very impressive.

397
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:32,747
No one

398
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:34,146
was born an all-rounder.

399
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:35,587
When a company

400
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:36,707
is doing an internal selection,

401
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:37,306
they know

402
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:39,066
the strength and the weaknesses
of every candidate.

403
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:40,707
We need space and opportunities

404
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,266
before we can improve.

405
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,507
Who told you

406
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,186
that it was just an internal selection?

407
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:53,026
Madam Tang.

408
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:56,026
In our law firm,
the corporation department

409
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,227
does the best job
in protecting our client resources.

410
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,266
Unless the candidate
is very outstanding,

411
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:03,266
or they can offer a better client resource.

412
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:04,707
Otherwise,

413
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,186
we're not recruiting.

414
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:09,587
However, this person is different.

415
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:11,987
Not only is he a very capable man,

416
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,906
but he also comes from
a very powerful background.

417
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,266
It makes perfect sense

418
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:20,266
for Madam Tang to pick him, right?

419
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:25,867
By the way, Miss Qin,

420
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,666
you know him too.

421
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,347
I know him?

422
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:34,627
Wait. Who is he?

423
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,620
(PARTERNER COUNSEL)

424
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:39,947
This way, please.

425
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,026
Mr. Tao, welcome.

426
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:02,666
Miss Qin,
congratulations on your promotion.

427
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:03,906
Shouldn't you

428
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,066
treat us to dinner?

429
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:07,227
Speaking of promotion,

430
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:08,587
I think Miss Wu should be the one

431
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,987
buying us a meal.

432
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:11,426
I didn't know

433
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:12,426
Miss Wu was this capable.

434
00:22:12,906 --> 00:22:14,107
Please take care of me in the future.

435
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:16,827
Miss Qin, don't make fun of me.

436
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:18,107
Of course, I can buy you a meal.

437
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:19,666
I've learned a lot from you

438
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,227
during this period.

439
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:22,347
My dad told me

440
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:23,906
that we should always respect

441
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:25,266
people who're willing to teach us.

442
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:32,627
Qianqian.

443
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:33,786
Help me book a table for noon

444
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,666
at the most expensive restaurant
in our area.

445
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,587
I'm buying Miss Qin lunch.

446
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,546
By the way, you should join us too.

447
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:40,827
Bye.

448
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:43,906
Didn't you tell me to come
and pick up my things?

449
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,507
I've packed it for you.
It's right there.

450
00:22:56,546 --> 00:22:58,306
Miss Qin,
are you going to carry this by yourself?

451
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:00,227
Let me get someone to help you.

452
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,146
Miss Wu, do you really think

453
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:06,386
you've learned enough

454
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:07,786
during the last few months?

455
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,026
It's a pity that I can't teach you more.

456
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:12,426
I wish you great success

457
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:13,306
in the future.

458
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:14,227
All the best.

459
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:25,426
Sure.

460
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:26,747
Thanks for consulting Cheng & Hui.

461
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:27,306
Thank you.

462
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:35,987
Sorry. Excuse me.

463
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:02,827
Is this your office?

464
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:06,666
I have bad news for you.

465
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:08,146
My office

466
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:09,306
is just right there.

467
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:10,947
Did you do this on purpose?

468
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,066
What do you think?

469
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:13,146
Is it fun?

470
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:14,107
No.

471
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:24,426
Now,

472
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:25,546
you have your own life,

473
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:26,546
your own career,

474
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:28,546
and a wife

475
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:29,947
who does everything for you.

476
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:31,627
You should just stay a good son-in-law

477
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:32,426
to her parents.

478
00:24:32,827 --> 00:24:34,227
You made such a big deal,

479
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:35,266
only because

480
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:36,587
you wanted to disturb a nobody like me?

481
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:37,546
Are you having fun?

482
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,467
It seems like there are a lot of people
backing you.

483
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:49,146
Why didn't I realize it sooner?

484
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,186
You're quite scheming.

485
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:54,827
What are you talking about?

486
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:55,747
What did I do?

487
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,026
Let's not talk about how you got married
to another man

488
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,587
right after you broke up with me
two years ago first.

489
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:02,306
But why are you a mother

490
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,666
to a two-and-a-half-year-old kid?

491
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,426
Who is the kid's father?

492
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:14,146
It's none of your business.

493
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:18,587
You're living a new life now.

494
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:20,026
There's no need

495
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,186
to keep bringing up the past.

496
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:23,546
You're right. It's all in the past.

497
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:26,707
It's not worth doing it
for someone like you.

498
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:54,906
Sorry. I was occupied

499
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:56,026
and couldn't reply to you on time.

500
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:57,467
I'm sorry you had to make a trip here.

501
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:58,947
It's all right. I had to drop by anyway.

502
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,186
Take a seat.

503
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:04,266
You took a long time to reply to me,

504
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:05,426
so I thought you must be very busy.

505
00:26:05,587 --> 00:26:07,026
And I'm sure you haven't taken
your lunch yet too.

506
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:08,467
That's why I cooked something

507
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:09,426
and brought it here for you.

508
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,347
Are you a layperson again?

509
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,026
You've been working really hard lately.

510
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:19,947
Normal dishes

511
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,426
won't be enough
to satisfy your appetite.

512
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:23,026
That's why I cooked something different

513
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:23,627
for you today.

514
00:26:23,627 --> 00:26:24,107
Give it a taste.

515
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:31,107
I've been recharged.

516
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:32,546
Thank you so much.

517
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:38,786
How's your fist?

518
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:39,386
Does it still hurt?

519
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:42,026
It's just some abrasion.

520
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,146
Be careful next time.

521
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:47,266
Luckily, you only bumped into the door.

522
00:26:47,627 --> 00:26:49,386
Imagine if the door bites.

523
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:50,386
Then, it would've been terrible.

524
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:53,507
Why would the door bite?

525
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:55,347
If it bites,

526
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:56,906
I'll give it a punch.

527
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:04,107
What's in there?

528
00:27:05,987 --> 00:27:07,266
I grew some peppermint at home,

529
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:08,266
so I thought I should share
this plant with you.

530
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:09,587
You can put it in your office.

531
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:11,227
The smell will make you feel better.

532
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,227
You're being

533
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,426
too considerate recently.

534
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:23,186
By the way,

535
00:27:23,786 --> 00:27:25,227
did I call you yesterday night?

536
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:28,546
Did I say anything

537
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:29,227
I shouldn't have?

538
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:30,786
I was drunk. I...

539
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:31,867
When I woke up this morning,

540
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,546
I couldn't recall anything.

541
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:35,227
I hope I didn't upset you.

542
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:40,627
You didn't upset me.

543
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:42,827
But if you weren't drunk,

544
00:27:43,026 --> 00:27:43,906
I wouldn't have found out

545
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,146
that you knew

546
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:48,266
so many poems.

547
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:49,707
You're indeed the kid
of a language teacher.

548
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,306
That's it?

549
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:01,947
I'd like to have dinner at home tonight.

550
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:02,947
Really?

551
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:04,786
Sure. Then, I'll visit the market

552
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:05,666
to buy some ingredients
in the afternoon.

553
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:08,306
Have some soup.

554
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:10,227
Mr. Tao, this is the family department

555
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:11,507
that's located on the 10th floor.

556
00:28:14,747 --> 00:28:15,266
This way, please.

557
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:17,627
Here.

558
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:20,707
It's delicious.

559
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:22,947
Do you like it? Have some more.

560
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:28,947
Mr. Tao.

561
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:33,827
Try the pork trotter.

562
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:35,426
Let me get some for you.

563
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:36,266
This way, please.

564
00:28:52,707 --> 00:28:54,266
You're quite decisive.

565
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:57,426
You were the one who convinced me.

566
00:28:58,426 --> 00:29:01,107
I don't have any strength.

567
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:03,347
But I'm very good

568
00:29:03,546 --> 00:29:05,386
at accepting constructive opinions.

569
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:10,266
You're very sober now.

570
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:12,186
After all,

571
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:13,666
it's just a job.

572
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,906
There's always a way out.

573
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:16,947
We don't need

574
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:18,107
to hang ourselves on this tree.

575
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:19,186
Right?

576
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:20,627
You're right.

577
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:23,347
But remember

578
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:26,627
to say this to Qin Shi.

579
00:29:27,827 --> 00:29:28,666
I think she needs

580
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:29,546
more counseling than I do.

581
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:32,266
No one knows

582
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,546
if Qin Shi will win or lose this battle.

583
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,060
(REFERENCE ROOM)

584
00:29:42,707 --> 00:29:44,426
Cheer up.

585
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,827
Successful people

586
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:49,467
don't care about trivial matters like this.

587
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:51,747
How is this a trivial matter?

588
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:54,546
Hui, tell me honestly.

589
00:29:55,146 --> 00:29:56,146
Why am I here

590
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:57,026
instead of Shen?

591
00:29:58,747 --> 00:29:59,587
Qiao told you

592
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:00,507
the result of the voting.

593
00:30:04,707 --> 00:30:05,347
Things happened

594
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:06,906
a little too abruptly this time.

595
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:08,026
I might not have agreed to it

596
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:09,386
if they picked someone else.

597
00:30:09,906 --> 00:30:10,827
After all, the corporation department

598
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:12,227
is unlike the other departments.

599
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,347
We have no place for idlers.

600
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,587
I didn't expect Wu Fei

601
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:18,386
to bring up Tao Junhui.

602
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:19,707
And Tao Junhui

603
00:30:19,707 --> 00:30:20,947
is actually her fiance.

604
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:23,666
This is interesting.

605
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:27,386
What's so interesting about it?

606
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,426
Have you not noticed

607
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:31,707
anything wrong yet?

608
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,386
Wu Fei only does this

609
00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:34,587
because she wants to upset you, right?

610
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:35,867
She's targeting her?

611
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:38,707
Why does Miss Wu

612
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:39,827
want to upset Miss Qin?

613
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:45,066
This is a very good question.

614
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,707
As of now,

615
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:50,227
I still have no idea

616
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:51,467
what's up Wu Fei's sleeve.

617
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:53,867
Before this,

618
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,066
she was always talking about Miss Qin.

619
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:56,507
But in the blink of an eye,

620
00:30:57,186 --> 00:30:58,146
they turned into enemies.

621
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:02,827
No wonder they said

622
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,507
that Miss Qin won't last long.

623
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:09,507
The legal assistants started a bet.

624
00:31:10,227 --> 00:31:11,347
They said

625
00:31:11,546 --> 00:31:13,186
that Miss Qin wouldn't last
more than three months.

626
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:16,707
What's your bet?

627
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:18,707
Mine?

628
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:22,227
Do you think

629
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:24,347
I'll join the kids?

630
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:32,026
I placed a small bet.

631
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:34,026
There's no way

632
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,786
Miss Qin will leave so soon.

633
00:31:36,947 --> 00:31:37,347
I agree.

634
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,227
Help me place my bet too.

635
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:43,666
Do you think Miss Qin will leave?

636
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:48,146
I think Wu Fei will lose.

637
00:31:51,146 --> 00:31:53,426
You and Miss Qin

638
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,146
are really in a love-hate relationship.

639
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:57,747
My foot!

640
00:31:58,386 --> 00:31:59,867
If Qin Shi can't even handle

641
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:02,107
a kid like Wu Fei,

642
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,306
I'll be very upset with my loss.

643
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,827
But there's still one thing I don't get.

644
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,186
Why did our Madam Tang

645
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,186
want Miss Qin

646
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,306
to go through these hardships?

647
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:13,987
Don't you get it?

648
00:32:14,386 --> 00:32:15,786
You were the one who told me about this.

649
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,786
For Madam Tang,

650
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:19,426
Qin Shi is like a treasure.

651
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:21,026
But things are different now.

652
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:23,186
Miss Qin helped Ms. Lan
come up with a plan

653
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:24,747
behind Madam Tang's back.

654
00:32:25,306 --> 00:32:26,386
If it didn't make a profit

655
00:32:26,587 --> 00:32:27,306
for Cheng & Hui,

656
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:28,146
do you think

657
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:29,146
Madam Tang would've let her go?

658
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:30,707
Tell you what.

659
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:32,266
Guess who was the person

660
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:34,306
who didn't vote

661
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:36,587
for Miss Qin.

662
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,587
Could it be Madam Tang?

663
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:49,107
This is how Madam Tang manages
the company.

664
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:52,266
Just wait.

665
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:53,947
Madam Tang will definitely be able

666
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:55,507
to make Miss Qin give up

667
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:57,947
and devote herself to the company.

668
00:32:58,546 --> 00:32:59,627
Even though she put her

669
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:00,507
in an awkward position,

670
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:04,546
Miss Qin will still be grateful to her.

671
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:11,266
Qin Shi.

672
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,467
How did you upset Wu Fei?

673
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:20,426
It's fine
if you don't want to tell me anything.

674
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:22,906
But you know

675
00:33:23,107 --> 00:33:23,827
my temper very well.

676
00:33:24,707 --> 00:33:25,587
I'll never allow others

677
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:26,867
to take advantage of me.

678
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,386
Tao Junhui joined us midway.

679
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:32,066
If he can't show us his value,

680
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:33,347
I will definitely prefer

681
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:34,386
to work with a familiar face.

682
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:36,906
You and Shen

683
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:38,186
are part of my team.

684
00:33:39,347 --> 00:33:40,306
You're here

685
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:41,306
because I think

686
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:42,786
you'll do a better job than Shen

687
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:44,827
when it comes
to handling pressure at work.

688
00:33:45,347 --> 00:33:46,347
That's why I want

689
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:47,627
to give you this learning opportunity.

690
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:50,786
Thanks, Hui.

691
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:52,386
Don't thank me yet.

692
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:54,347
It comes with a condition.

693
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:57,747
Help me investigate Tao Junhui.

694
00:33:58,107 --> 00:33:58,507
My hunch tells me

695
00:33:58,666 --> 00:33:59,386
that he has an agenda

696
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:00,386
when he joined our company.

697
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:01,587
Of course.

698
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,186
It's fine if you don't want
to accept this offer too.

699
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:07,627
I didn't expect Li Dai to resign.

700
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:09,586
The family department

701
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,067
needs a person in charge too.

702
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:15,426
Don't worry.

703
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:17,507
Now that I'm here,

704
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:19,146
I don't plan to go back there again.

705
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:21,386
Sure.

706
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:23,106
You'll be

707
00:34:23,307 --> 00:34:24,586
on a three-month internship.

708
00:34:25,426 --> 00:34:26,747
Three months later,

709
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:28,386
it'll be up to your capability
if you want to stay here.

710
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:30,747
Take this chance to learn.

711
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:33,307
I've placed my bet on you.

712
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:34,586
Don't let me down.

713
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:36,307
Don't worry.

714
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:37,346
I won't let you down.

715
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:39,707
Take your time unpacking.

716
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:28,626
Hey.

717
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:30,507
Are you free?

718
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:31,987
Let's meet up.

719
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:34,227
I'll send you the address in a while.

720
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,067
I know

721
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,626
that you and Qin Shi
are in a sham marriage.

722
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:41,146
Miss Li.

723
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:43,826
I don't understand.

724
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:44,906
Qin Shi and I

725
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:46,146
are legally married.

726
00:36:47,826 --> 00:36:48,787
Stop faking it.

727
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,866
Qin Shi has already admitted to it.

728
00:36:57,787 --> 00:36:59,467
I'm not here to convince you
to tell me the truth.

729
00:37:00,346 --> 00:37:02,027
I've already resigned from my position
in Cheng & Hui.

730
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:03,787
Whether

731
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:05,267
you're really in a marriage or not,

732
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:06,906
it has nothing to do with me anymore.

733
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:10,547
Miss Li.

734
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:11,547
I really don't get

735
00:37:11,747 --> 00:37:12,386
what you're talking about.

736
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:14,346
If this is the reason

737
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:15,787
you asked me out,

738
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,626
then I'll make my move first.

739
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:19,106
I'm not done yet.

740
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:23,227
I guess Qin Shi has told you

741
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,386
what's her reason and motive

742
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:25,307
behind this lie, right?

743
00:37:32,507 --> 00:37:33,227
Do you know

744
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:35,626
that if the lie gets exposed,

745
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:37,626
it'll be considered fraud?

746
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:39,666
And you, as an accomplice,

747
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:41,866
will have to bear
the legal responsibility as well.

748
00:37:49,987 --> 00:37:50,426
Not bad.

749
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:53,426
You have quite a good mentality.

750
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:55,666
If you ever run into similar questions,

751
00:37:56,747 --> 00:37:57,346
I hope

752
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,947
you can do what you did today.

753
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:04,666
What are you trying to say?

754
00:38:06,507 --> 00:38:08,307
Although I don't agree with Qin Shi,

755
00:38:09,507 --> 00:38:10,707
I have to admit

756
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:13,186
that she is much braver than I am.

757
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:17,027
Cheng & Hui has its charm,

758
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,426
and it has a fatal flaw too.

759
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,626
And Qin Shi wants to change that.

760
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,067
I am very impressed.

761
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:25,507
However,

762
00:38:25,747 --> 00:38:26,426
she'll never achieve her goal,

763
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,707
if she is all on her own.

764
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:32,146
Eventually,

765
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:34,666
she'll fail.

766
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,707
But I think Qin Shi is really capable.

767
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:40,626
Besides, no one knows

768
00:38:40,747 --> 00:38:41,307
what will happen in the future.

769
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:49,507
Now I know why Qin Shi picked you.

770
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:52,106
Look at how boastful you are.

771
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:53,626
You do share some similarities.

772
00:38:55,186 --> 00:38:55,826
Don't worry.

773
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:57,547
I'm not here to pour cold water on you.

774
00:38:58,106 --> 00:38:59,027
I hope she can succeed too.

775
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:00,626
But

776
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:02,507
she can't be doing this alone.

777
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,227
She needs comrades,

778
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:06,866
and also someone

779
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:08,227
who will always have her back.

780
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:10,626
Therefore,

781
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:14,747
I hope that you can help her.

782
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:21,267
Zhang, is Mr. Qin around?

783
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,467
He's not in.

784
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:24,146
Did he go to the store?

785
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:25,906
I've no idea.

786
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:27,507
When is he coming back?

787
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:30,106
I don't think he's coming back today.

788
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:31,826
But I need him

789
00:39:31,826 --> 00:39:32,826
to sign the invoices.

790
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:34,307
Leave it here.

791
00:39:34,547 --> 00:39:35,507
Mr. Qin will sign it once he's back.

792
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:45,027
Zhang, how long has it been

793
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:46,666
since Mr. Qin came to the office?

794
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:47,826
Will he come in tomorrow?

795
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:51,787
I have no idea too.

796
00:39:57,586 --> 00:39:58,826
Miss Qin.

797
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:00,987
If you have time,

798
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:02,747
can we have a chat?

799
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:05,547
I'm getting really depressed.

800
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:07,906
I think you've called the wrong person.

801
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:09,547
You should call your therapist.

802
00:40:10,547 --> 00:40:11,547
Qin Shi,

803
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:12,947
you've changed.

804
00:40:13,507 --> 00:40:14,227
Why are you giving me

805
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:15,467
a cold shoulder?

806
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:16,906
(I've been abandoned)

807
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:18,067
(by everyone else.)

808
00:40:19,346 --> 00:40:20,346
It was your idea

809
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:21,507
to send Wenyu

810
00:40:21,707 --> 00:40:22,467
to the office.

811
00:40:22,906 --> 00:40:23,586
It was

812
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:25,227
your brother's idea.

813
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:26,386
He wants me

814
00:40:26,626 --> 00:40:27,146
to take care of his family's business.

815
00:40:27,547 --> 00:40:28,027
It's as if

816
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:29,227
I am taking advantage of them.

817
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:31,186
Does he think it's easy
to run a business?

818
00:40:31,426 --> 00:40:32,227
(I want him)

819
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:33,426
(to know)

820
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,626
(how it feels like
to go to work every day.)

821
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:38,146
However, I find it rather strange too.

822
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:39,227
I thought he wouldn't be able

823
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:40,267
to last a week.

824
00:40:40,426 --> 00:40:41,507
But a month has passed.

825
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:43,547
He still goes to work on time every day.

826
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:44,467
Do you think

827
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:45,547
we have wronged him?

828
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:47,267
(Do you think)

829
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,027
(it's possible)

830
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:51,067
(that my husband is actually a genius
in business?)

831
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,666
Have I been underestimating him?

832
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:56,467
You're talking about Qin Wenyu.

833
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:57,386
He graduated from high school

834
00:40:57,547 --> 00:40:58,507
when he was 20 years old.

835
00:40:58,626 --> 00:40:59,426
(He couldn't even memorize)

836
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:00,227
(the periodic table.)

837
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:01,106
(If he can do)

838
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:01,987
(what you mentioned,)

839
00:41:02,186 --> 00:41:02,987
(he is probably possessed)

840
00:41:03,186 --> 00:41:04,186
(by an alien.)

841
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:06,467
I don't know if he's really possessed

842
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:07,067
by an alien.

843
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:07,507
But I can tell you

844
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,386
that I'm really bored of staying at home.

845
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:10,626
I can't stand

846
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:11,666
staying at home

847
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,227
and doing nothing anymore.

848
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:14,707
I gave up

849
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:16,947
my whole empire.

850
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:19,067
Do you think I can ever get it back?

851
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:21,426
Wait a minute.

852
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:23,987
I've got to go.

853
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:24,547
I'll talk to you later.

854
00:41:34,106 --> 00:41:34,747
Where is Mr. Qin?

855
00:41:38,106 --> 00:41:38,747
It's all right.

856
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:39,866
Don't worry.

857
00:41:40,346 --> 00:41:41,307
It's not the end of the world yet.

858
00:41:42,426 --> 00:41:43,826
I'll handle it.

859
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:46,586
Don't worry.

860
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:01,106
Baby, are you ready to come with me

861
00:42:01,106 --> 00:42:02,626
to win back my empire?

862
00:42:23,426 --> 00:42:24,307
Do you have any other questions?

863
00:42:25,027 --> 00:42:25,787
That's all, Ms. Ren.

864
00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:26,826
Thank you.

865
00:42:27,267 --> 00:42:27,787
Don't worry.

866
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:28,386
Thank you.

867
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:29,467
I'll get going.

868
00:42:29,787 --> 00:42:30,227
Sure.

869
00:42:39,987 --> 00:42:40,547
Meimei.

870
00:42:40,947 --> 00:42:41,866
I'm sorry.

871
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:46,067
Get up.

872
00:42:46,826 --> 00:42:47,866
You're a man.

873
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:48,707
What if someone comes in

874
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:49,787
and sees you doing this?

875
00:42:50,386 --> 00:42:50,826
No, Meimei.

876
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:52,186
I really made a mistake.

877
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:57,186
I...

878
00:42:58,386 --> 00:42:58,866
Qin Wenyu,

879
00:42:59,027 --> 00:43:01,180
you're really something.

880
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:03,626
I spent 10 years of hard work
building our reputation.

881
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:04,987
And you only spent a month
to destroy everything.

882
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:07,626
They sent these invoices two weeks ago.

883
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:09,386
And you left them lying here until now.

884
00:43:10,106 --> 00:43:11,386
There is a big banquet tomorrow

885
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:12,386
and we just lost all our ingredients.

886
00:43:13,386 --> 00:43:15,186
You're really something, aren't you?

887
00:43:16,707 --> 00:43:17,826
When my mom was the manager,

888
00:43:17,826 --> 00:43:20,227
she settled the debt every six months.

889
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,067
That's rubbish.

890
00:43:22,507 --> 00:43:24,626
We started settling our bills
every three months 10 years ago.

891
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:26,826
We settle all the bills
from big suppliers every two weeks.

892
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:28,227
Mr. Qin.

893
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:30,547
We're not a chain trust.

894
00:43:30,547 --> 00:43:31,626
We're just a small company

895
00:43:31,626 --> 00:43:33,787
with seven or eight shopfronts.

896
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:35,067
All right?
