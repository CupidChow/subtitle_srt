=Episode 32=

19
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:57,666
(Anyway, it's not a real relationship
between you and Yang Hua.)

20
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,105
(Telling you this is not sabotaging)

21
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:02,706
(the relationship between you
and your husband.)

22
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:04,026
If you could dig up

23
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,145
something more shocking,

24
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:07,425
be sure to run by me first.

25
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,786
I love this gossip.

26
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:12,786
(Hello.)

27
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:14,786
Hello.

28
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:16,426
Are you there?

29
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:19,906
No, I'm hanging up.

30
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:20,945
Hey, no.

31
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:22,426
I have something important to tell you.

32
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:24,585
Something very serious.

33
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:27,906
Previously, rumours have it
that Qiu Jianxiang

34
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:30,185
banned Yang Hua from the finance circle.

35
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:31,665
I have asked

36
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,185
Qiu Jianxiang about this in person

37
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,906
and he didn't admit that it was him.

38
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:39,066
I thought it was because
he felt embarrassed to admit it.

39
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:40,825
However, he didn't have a reason

40
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:43,626
to lie about this that I could think of.

41
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,385
(Think about this.)

42
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,346
(He even took the blame)

43
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,626
(for the failed investment of Haibo Biology.)

44
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:51,825
It's not necessary for him

45
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:53,105
not to be frank on this.

46
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:56,185
Have you ever thought

47
00:02:57,146 --> 00:02:59,266
that he's wronged?

48
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:02,105
(Would it be someone)

49
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:04,626
(who manipulated what happened then)

50
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:05,665
(to find fault with Yang Hua?)

51
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:08,025
(Who would that be?)

52
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:10,986
Who's on the phone?

53
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:16,866
After that, I discovered

54
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,465
that there were strange transactions
of the shares

55
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:21,626
but it was too late to do anything.

56
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:25,545
Wang Jiesen was aware of

57
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:26,545
the whole story behind this.

58
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:28,745
But he asked me to stay tight-lipped

59
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:30,266
and believe in him.

60
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:32,426
He said he'd explain to the boards.

61
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:35,745
Yet he has done such a mess.

62
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,506
Mr. Wang, why do you come out?

63
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:41,465
You're not there,

64
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:42,665
so I found it boring

65
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:43,786
to stay there without you.

66
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:46,385
Let's go inside.

67
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,585
Why, Qin Shi?

68
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:50,945
You won't get your piece

69
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:52,385
even if you go inside.

70
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:55,346
It's better to stay here with me.

71
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:19,145
What's wrong?

72
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:19,865
I need to go now.

73
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:23,265
It's just started though.

74
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:24,145
Did something come up?

75
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:24,985
I'm going to meet two clients

76
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:25,865
tomorrow morning

77
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:26,865
and I need to prepare the material.

78
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,185
Who are the clients

79
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:29,705
more important than this deal?

80
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:32,185
I know nothing about the business deal,
though.

81
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:33,305
As long as you're here.

82
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,106
Please stay with me for a while more.

83
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:36,985
I can't drink. It's kind of awkward
sitting there.

84
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:42,265
Don't drink too much.

85
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,705
Get home safely.

86
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:44,745
Go ahead.

87
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:45,826
Bye-bye.

88
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:54,346
Mr. Hu has entrusted me to decide on

89
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,346
the investment of Cheng & Hui.

90
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:57,626
In other words,

91
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:00,865
the ultimate decision of the project is on me.

92
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,346
A 100 million investment
is a huge project

93
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:07,386
and you get to call the shot?

94
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:10,386
Qin Shi, how cute of you.

95
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,226
Do you think I can't decide

96
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:14,305
on a hundred of
millions US dollars project

97
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:16,305
let alone a lesser figure
which's in Chinese Yuan?

98
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:19,506
You better take some time

99
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,226
to consider my advice.

100
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:23,865
Mr. Wang.

101
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:25,946
Are you really not going

102
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,226
to give me a sneak peek?

103
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:31,985
The inspection will be wrapped up today.

104
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:33,465
Tomorrow, I'll be going

105
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:35,305
to the Hangzhou branch of the law firm.

106
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:37,546
Later, I'll start working on the report.

107
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:40,185
If you're curious about how I write it,

108
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:45,585
go to Hangzhou with me.

109
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,865
Don't work so diligently.

110
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:53,025
You should spare yourself some time

111
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:56,626
to go on a vacation and relax.

112
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:59,185
What brand is your fragrance?

113
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,106
It smells lovely.

114
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:01,705
Hello.

115
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:02,546
(Tao.)

116
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:04,906
(The travel record you asked for is out.)

117
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,185
I'll buy you this.

118
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:10,305
Be careful.

119
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,546
Did you say...

120
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:15,946
Yes.

121
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:17,025
That you're going to learn from Ma?

122
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,025
Of course.

123
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:21,465
Dongna.

124
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,185
Madam Tang has been asking me

125
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:24,826
regarding Mr. Hu.

126
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:25,786
Well...

127
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,506
Because of the lawsuit,

128
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:31,985
people told me that fighting a lawsuit is laborious.

129
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,626
But I found it a small deal

130
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,386
after I experienced this myself.

131
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:36,465
You really made a lucrative profit

132
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,425
in this industry.

133
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:40,346
Dongna.

134
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:41,705
Winning a lawsuit

135
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,666
relies on the exact right roll
of the dice.

136
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:44,626
Your case won

137
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,946
because of advantageous circumstances.

138
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:47,946
It may seem easy,

139
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:49,346
in fact, no one can predict the result

140
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:51,265
until the last moment.

141
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:52,705
Besides, Junhui

142
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:53,585
prepared three countermeasure plans

143
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,906
for your case.

144
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:58,425
Anyway, you've lucked out.

145
00:06:58,506 --> 00:06:59,826
The plans weren't used.

146
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,826
Also, Mr. Jin has come back.

147
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:07,626
He's familiar with the working style

148
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:09,386
of the judge of your case,

149
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,386
hence, the result he predicted

150
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:11,386
wouldn't be far from what we expected.

151
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:12,985
Therefore, don't worry.

152
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:14,865
I'm not worried at all.

153
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:21,305
By the way, my dad invites all of us

154
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,226
to go yachting this weekend.

155
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,226
You can bring Mr. Hu

156
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:25,465
and I bring Madam Tang
and the rest along.

157
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,106
What do you say?

158
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,906
I'm not free this weekend.

159
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:30,865
Well, my dad insists

160
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:32,666
to have us in a gathering.

161
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:34,025
When will you be free then?

162
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:36,425
My drama shooting will start tomorrow

163
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:38,585
and I'll be back for at least another four months.

164
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,025
Didn't they tell you about this?

165
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:41,386
Our collaboration will end here

166
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:42,865
and my legal team
will take care of this well.

167
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:44,626
Anyway, don't worry.

168
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,585
I've already told Hu
about the investment.

169
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:48,985
I'll call you up once he returns.

170
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,940
(Unknown)

171
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:38,106
When did you become like this?

172
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:40,505
What are you talking about?

173
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,025
How could you show yourself up

174
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:42,986
just for the money,

175
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:44,866
shares and status?

176
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:56,705
When did you marry Yang Hua?

177
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:58,306
Is your relationship real?

178
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:00,465
- Or...
- I love him.

179
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,825
I really love him.

180
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:07,546
I've never loved someone the way

181
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:09,346
I love him.

182
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:10,866
Are you aware the man

183
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:11,866
you really love is a con artist?

184
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,065
He didn't travel abroad

185
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:14,145
during the last few years

186
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,786
and all of his working background are fake.

187
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:16,906
Quiet.

188
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:17,866
Come with me.

189
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:22,986
Are you scared now?

190
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:25,025
Are you scared
that you've met such a man

191
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,546
who's a con artist with a child?

192
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:27,426
Shut your mouth.

193
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:47,145
Dad, look at her.

194
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:48,546
It seems we have nothing to do

195
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,226
with her winning case.

196
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:52,025
She's turning her back on us
after using us.

197
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:53,666
(No worries.)

198
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,385
(Calm yourself.)

199
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:58,025
What do I do now?

200
00:09:58,145 --> 00:09:59,945
Dad, you must help me.

201
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:01,346
(Alright, I will.)

202
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:02,945
(Let's talk about this when we go back.)

203
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,585
Don't forget what you promised.

204
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,025
(Easy, I'll take my word.)

205
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:06,906
Bye-bye.

206
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,346
Wu Fei.

207
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:14,505
Madam Tang.

208
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:15,625
You're here.

209
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:16,945
What has happened?

210
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:19,025
Are you upset

211
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,226
or are you feeling unwell?

212
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:22,945
No, I'm good.

213
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:24,265
I got to go now.

214
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:26,145
Just now,

215
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,825
you were talking well with Dongna.

216
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,666
How was it? Is everything going well?

217
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,705
Yes, everything is going smoothly.

218
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:34,025
Please wait for the good news.

219
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:35,786
Good, then.

220
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,025
I can't believe you did this
just to get the job

221
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,906
to fix your lies.

222
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:52,906
In order to get your story straight,

223
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:56,625
you married a man you didn't know before.

224
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:58,025
Qin Shi.

225
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:00,106
You're marvellous.

226
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:01,465
Is it funny?

227
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:02,825
It's hilarious.

228
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,465
I did this not only to get a job.

229
00:11:06,505 --> 00:11:08,666
Forget it. You won't listen to me.

230
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:10,546
I'm telling you

231
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,265
this is a serious matter

232
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:13,945
and you better keep it to yourself.

233
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:15,385
There's no need.

234
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:17,106
You've given yourself away.

235
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:18,546
There'll be others to look you up
besides me.

236
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,705
Who do you think you're to look me up?

237
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:24,546
Did Wang Jiesen know about this too?

238
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:28,226
That's why
you swallow your pride before him?

239
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:32,786
Is this job that important to you

240
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,145
until you give way

241
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,505
to someone like him?

242
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:40,106
What about Yang Hua?

243
00:11:40,906 --> 00:11:41,906
Isn't he your husband?

244
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:43,945
He's close to Wang Jiesen, isn't he?

245
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:44,666
Where's he?

246
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:46,186
What has my relationship with Yang Hua

247
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,625
to do with you?

248
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:48,786
I know.

249
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:50,306
There's a big flaw
regarding the time we got married.

250
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,226
But why do you have to rip into me?

251
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,585
It was your family
who despised me back then.

252
00:11:56,746 --> 00:11:57,585
Enough. I'm not going

253
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,505
to repeat ancient history.

254
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:01,625
That's right.

255
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:03,265
I want to be a partner of the firm.

256
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:05,465
I did all of these out of my ambition.

257
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,025
Let me tell you this.

258
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:09,585
I've never felt ashamed

259
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:11,145
for being career-driven and ambitious.

260
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,825
I want to be the winner in life.

261
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,186
And then I can

262
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:16,465
lead a desirable life
by myself

263
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,585
instead of being judged by others.

264
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:24,986
You, on the other hand,

265
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,546
who do you think you're to tell me off?

266
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:29,426
Someone like you

267
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:29,945
who dates a woman

268
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:32,226
that can be a great help to your career

269
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,866
demands me to be pure and clean.

270
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,385
You're the hilarious one.

271
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:43,265
You're right.

272
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:47,465
I'm not qualified

273
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:48,705
to make demands on you.

274
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:56,306
You better stay away
from Wang Jiesen.

275
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:58,465
Never believe what he says to you.

276
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:01,746
Though this job means a lot to you,

277
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:05,426
it's just a job.

278
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,585
It doesn't worth sacrificing for it.

279
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:13,705
Don't worry.

280
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,385
I won't tell anyone about this.

281
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,106
Hello.

282
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:26,546
Ms. Liang.

283
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:29,546
You're coming to the firm?

284
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:32,945
But, Jin and I are outside
at the moment.

285
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:34,505
May I know what you're here for?

286
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:43,186
Yihui, Jin.

287
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:44,945
About this matter,

288
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:46,866
the best solution for the time being

289
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:48,226
is this and nothing else.

290
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:49,546
However,

291
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,585
you'll have to decide

292
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,866
by yourselves.

293
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,265
Jin.

294
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:02,346
You decide.

295
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:19,585
(Come to my office right now.)

296
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:21,186
Yes.

297
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:53,906
Yang Hua.

298
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:56,625
Are you alright?

299
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:58,426
Why am I not?

300
00:14:58,705 --> 00:14:59,786
What brings you here?

301
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:02,186
I...happened to pass by here
after work.

302
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:03,145
So, I came to pick you up.

303
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,346
It's been a tired day.

304
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:10,065
I need supper.

305
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:11,825
What do you want?

306
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,065
I want meat. Many meats.

307
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:17,746
No problem. Let's go.

308
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:18,786
Yes.

309
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:48,106
Mister.

310
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,906
I'm done.

311
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:54,226
Done?

312
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:56,025
That's fast.

313
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:00,825
Why does it end so early today?

314
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,106
You didn't drink much, right?

315
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:11,025
No.

316
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:20,306
What has happened?

317
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:22,065
Mister.

318
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:24,866
Do you love me?

319
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:27,945
Silly. Of course, I do.

320
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:30,786
Tell me that you love me.

321
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:32,186
Love you.

322
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:34,385
Lack of affection.

323
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:49,065
I love you.

324
00:16:58,426 --> 00:16:59,226
Are you tired?

325
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,385
Yes, a little.

326
00:17:02,585 --> 00:17:04,706
If so, I'll send you home.

327
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:06,745
No.

328
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,586
I just want to sit here

329
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:11,505
and recharge myself.

330
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:12,826
Well.

331
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:15,385
Let's just sit here like this.

332
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,306
No matter how big the trouble is,

333
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,306
I'll overcome it.

334
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:27,706
I definitely will.

335
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:54,345
The taste is good, right?

336
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:01,306
I thought you were attending
to the business today.

337
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:02,586
Didn't you eat anything?

338
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,546
Why could I?

339
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:06,906
Imagine when I eat

340
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:07,985
while my supervisor
is dealing with the clients.

341
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:10,345
By the way,

342
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:11,586
why did you call me today?

343
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:15,426
Is Wang Jiesen still at the firm?

344
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,345
Yes, he's leaving tomorrow.

345
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:19,225
Did he find faults with you?

346
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:20,586
Tell me if he does so.

347
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:21,826
I have a way to tackle him.

348
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:23,345
Why would he find faults with me?

349
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:24,345
I'm just a nobody.

350
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:28,345
What about you? Is the case going well?

351
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:30,745
Pretty good.

352
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:33,826
Li Dai said you met
one of your acquaintances.

353
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:37,186
You didn't say it out, right?

354
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:38,426
Did you remember

355
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:39,666
what I teach you?

356
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:40,265
At the very moment,

357
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:41,505
you mustn't admit it.

358
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:42,786
Do you know how horrible women are

359
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:44,865
when they get possessive?

360
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:45,706
Therefore,

361
00:18:45,906 --> 00:18:46,906
you can never let your guard down.

362
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,546
Especially when it comes

363
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:50,145
to the topic of the ex-girlfriend.

364
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:51,385
It's a deadly trap.

365
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:52,426
Never answer to it.

366
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:55,306
I'm experienced in this.
You must believe me.

367
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:56,906
You ought to.

368
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:00,186
What did she say?

369
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:02,706
Nothing much.

370
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,265
She said you and Yao Yao
know each other.

371
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:08,105
Yes, we do.

372
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:12,306
How?

373
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,066
We were neighbours when we were young.

374
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:17,865
We went to the same elementary
and secondary schools.

375
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:20,505
Childhood friends?

376
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:21,985
She's just my classmate.

377
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:26,865
I've met her before.

378
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:27,906
Did you?

379
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:28,625
Yes.

380
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:32,906
She was in the lift of the firm.

381
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:35,586
She's pretty and tall.

382
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,145
I guess she's this tall.

383
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:40,186
She must be a pretty girl
when she was young, right?

384
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:41,505
No way.

385
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:43,546
She was very naughty

386
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:45,025
and she used to bully us.

387
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,145
We all had to obey her.

388
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:48,985
Did you obey her too?

389
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:52,946
Because I couldn't fight her.

390
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:01,946
Very good. Childhood friends.

391
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,826
Did Cai Liang tell you this?

392
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:09,145
He asked you not to tell me anything,
right?

393
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:15,105
Today, Li Dai told me

394
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,625
your face turned pale

395
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:19,865
after you came out from the courthouse

396
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:21,025
seeing many people were stopping

397
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:22,066
your Yao Yao.

398
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:24,586
Besides, Li Dai got told off for her too.

399
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:25,786
She asked me not to forget
about this favour.

400
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:27,826
What do you mean by my Yao Yao?

401
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,066
Nonsense.

402
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,546
How could Miss Li say that?

403
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,426
Nothing's wrong with her though.

404
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:46,826
It's from my dad.

405
00:20:57,826 --> 00:20:58,466
Dad.

406
00:20:59,265 --> 00:20:59,826
(Hua.)

407
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:02,786
(Which hospital is Mr. Qiu in?)

408
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:05,505
I'm thinking to pay him a call tomorrow.

409
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:06,946
He's just out of surgery.

410
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:08,265
He needs time to recover.

411
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:11,625
Hua.

412
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:13,946
Did you hear about Yao Yao?

413
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:16,385
Yes.

414
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:17,906
You did?

415
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:19,706
How did you know?

416
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:22,145
Your mother and I just knew it

417
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,706
from an old neighbour today.

418
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:26,505
Erm...

419
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:28,225
Did Qin know about this?

420
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:30,826
I haven't told her yet.

421
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:34,906
Hua. Let me tell you this.

422
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:37,706
You ought to treat it seriously.

423
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:42,105
Women really mind this.

424
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:44,385
(You can never hide it from them.)

425
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:47,625
(But, you can't tell her unplanned.)

426
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:48,466
(Understood?)

427
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:50,066
(Hua.)

428
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:52,706
You need to
have a serious talk with her.

429
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:53,625
Right?

430
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,826
If she can't accept this,

431
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:56,826
ask for my help.

432
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:57,906
I'll explain to her.

433
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:00,865
Well, I'm hanging up.

434
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,105
Are you done?

435
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:33,505
Yes.

436
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,345
Erm...

437
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,985
There's a snooker tournament today.

438
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:39,625
Why don't we watch the tournament?

439
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:40,666
I bought some fruit today.

440
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,385
I don't feel like doing anything now.

441
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:45,505
Are you upset?

442
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:00,225
If you don't want to talk about it,

443
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:02,385
I won't force you.

444
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:05,666
I don't have the mood
to listen to you either.

445
00:23:09,426 --> 00:23:09,906
Good night.

446
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:15,906
Good night.

447
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:35,025
What do I do?

448
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,220
(Cloud Commercial Bank)

449
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:39,826
Your dad called at the right time.

450
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:42,426
You've pulled our fat out of the fire.

451
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:43,745
That was close.

452
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,225
I didn't expect

453
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:56,225
that the Great Yang Hua is afraid of his wife too.

454
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:57,426
He can be a coward too.

455
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,865
I'll record this moment.

456
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,385
Back time, you told me

457
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:03,906
that being afraid of wives
is a sign of low IQ.

458
00:24:04,186 --> 00:24:04,985
Now that you don't look like

459
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:05,865
you have a high IQ too.

460
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:14,625
Well, things have passed.

461
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:15,546
Afterwards,

462
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,786
we just have to take whatever comes to us.

463
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,225
Let's not worry about
trouble that has yet to happen.

464
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:19,985
Alright?

465
00:24:21,265 --> 00:24:22,505
I'm not thinking about that.

466
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:24,426
I'm worried about Wang Jiesen.

467
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,985
Miss Qin is pretty and capable.

468
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:31,066
It's normal if someone hits on her.

469
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:32,625
However, I'm very certain

470
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:34,466
that Miss Qin won't be shaken.

471
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:35,865
Besides, she knew

472
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,505
that you have a beef with that Wang.

473
00:24:37,786 --> 00:24:39,546
She won't accept him, right?

474
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,466
Wang Jiesen is devious

475
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:43,505
and he has a way

476
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,546
to make use of one's weak spot.

477
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:49,466
Do you think

478
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,706
Miss Qin falls for a man like him?

479
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,025
No.

480
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:53,385
Case closed.

481
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:57,145
I was thinking who sent me the photo.

482
00:24:57,865 --> 00:25:00,105
I reckon this person is more devious.

483
00:25:04,826 --> 00:25:06,385
Regarding this,

484
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,385
you can't find that person out

485
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,306
as he's hiding in the dark.

486
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:14,625
Maybe it was Wang

487
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,666
who wanted to infuriate you
with the photo.

488
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:19,985
I'm off to work.

489
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:21,105
Hold on.

490
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,625
Yang, be honest with me.

491
00:25:22,985 --> 00:25:23,906
What's about?

492
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:25,666
How do you feel
when you met Yao Yao again?

493
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:27,105
She's single now.

494
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,745
If you were given a chance,

495
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:58,706
will you pick Miss Qin or Yao Yao?

496
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:01,906
I don't think

497
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:02,906
the ball is in my court.

498
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:21,546
(What are you up to?)

499
00:26:22,105 --> 00:26:22,666
(Don't go.)

500
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:25,466
(Do you have much spare time?)

501
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:27,385
(Just focus on yourself, okay?)

502
00:26:27,946 --> 00:26:29,306
(Do you know what's waiting for you?)

503
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:31,505
The task of reception is the order
from the higher-up.

504
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:32,426
What I have to do

505
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:33,985
is to accomplish the task given.

506
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:35,505
Mr. Tao, you're hired here

507
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:38,265
not to poke your nose into other's affairs, okay?

508
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,080
Mr. Tao, are you leaving?

509
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,160
No, I'm going to the reference room.

510
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,160
You asked for me?

511
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,160
Well.

512
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,600
Our company

513
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,640
has taken in some new lawyers.

514
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,960
And Madam Tang said

515
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,880
that if you need

516
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,480
a legal assistant,

517
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,040
you may set up an interview now.

518
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,600
Alright, thank you.

519
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,240
Sure.

520
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,840
Anything else?

521
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,280
No, that's all.

522
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,280
Hurry it up.

523
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,440
Mr. Hu.

524
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,760
Everything over Hangzhou
is taken care of.

525
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,480
Mr. Wang.

526
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,720
I'll sit back and hear back from you.

527
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,240
Sure, Madam Tang. No worries.

528
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,880
Good. Please get in.

529
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,520
Qin Shi.

530
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,040
I'll leave Mr. Wang to you.

531
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,200
Don't worry, Madam Tang.

532
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,360
Bye-bye.

533
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,440
Bye-bye. See you around.

534
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,520
Madam Tang.

535
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,440
Didn't you promise

536
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,440
to let me settle the investment matter?

537
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,720
It's inappropriate to let Qin Shi

538
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,080
meddle around here, right?

539
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,920
Isn't that Qin Shi

540
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,280
just helps with entertaining the guest?

541
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,280
Wang Jiesen

542
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,760
is merely a staff under Mr. Hu.

543
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,680
He doesn't have much right
on the investment.

544
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
Mr. Hu is the one who has the last word.

545
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,600
Of course.

546
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,120
So,

547
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,760
why worry?

548
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,560
By the way,

549
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,160
when will Mr. Hu be back?

550
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,760
Didn't Dongna tell you

551
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,960
that Mr. Jin has been in Pujiang

552
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,040
for the time being?

553
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Set up a meeting at this point of time.

554
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,800
No problem.

555
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,920
I've reached Hangzhou.

556
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,520
I prepared a present for you.

557
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,720
I'll see you at the old place
after dinner.

558
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Cancel all the schedules this afternoon.

559
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,640
I have plans tonight.

560
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,840
Sure.

561
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
I'm sorry, Miss Yao.

562
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,400
During the court day, I...

563
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,600
My dad is in poor health

564
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,880
and I really need this job.

565
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,240
I'm truly sorry.

566
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,520
Tong.

567
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,760
I can understand why you did so.

568
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,440
If I were your age,

569
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,520
perhaps I'd have the same action as you.

570
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,200
However,

571
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,280
I ought to let you know

572
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,160
that even if you swallow your pride,

573
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,640
you won't obtain the things you want.

574
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,840
You refuse to seek justice for me

575
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,960
because of your interests.

576
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,920
No one would stand out for you

577
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,400
when you endure

578
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,480
mistreatment the other day.

579
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,920
Stop crying.

580
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,360
Today is my last day here.

581
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,840
Hopefully,

582
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,160
you take care of yourself now.

583
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,690
(Unknown)

584
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,960
(Your wife is going out with a man today.)

585
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,600
(This is the address.)

586
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,640
Didn't you say

587
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,040
that Miss Qin won't fall for Mr. Wang

588
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,240
with full confidence?

589
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:45,920
I tell you what,

590
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,040
you're too naive.

591
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,720
Men can endure any insult

592
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,480
except for this one.

593
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,480
No worries. I'll help you. Hop in.

594
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,560
What?

595
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,560
Lawyer? What's so great about being a lawyer?

596
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,480
How can they domineer over others?

597
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,040
Qin Shi, I can drive the car.

598
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,320
I feel bad for letting you drive.

599
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,960
I'm fine, Mr. Wang.

600
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,880
I'm familiar with the route.
We'll reach there soon.

601
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,280
Why call me Mr. Wang?

602
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,320
Call me Jiesen.

603
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,600
Alright, Jiesen.

604
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
(Qin Shi, Wang Jiesen will write a report)

605
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,320
(during the trip to Hangzhou)

606
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,360
(which affects Mr. Hu's decision)

607
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,720
(on investing in our firm.)

608
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,120
(You must keep a close eye on him.)

609
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,560
(If you manage to accomplish this,)

610
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,960
(I'll give you large credit.)

611
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,040
What did you just say?

612
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,400
Someone is going to commit suicide

613
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,520
out of the relationship problem.

614
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,840
And live streaming the process?

615
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Did you call the police?

616
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,880
Who's in charge of this?

617
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,120
Who?

618
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,960
Yao Yao?

619
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,320
How could it be her?

620
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,640
Miss Yao.

621
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,000
Do you know which room the person is in?

622
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,040
No.

623
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,560
There are so many rooms.

624
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,880
What should we do now?

625
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,880
Hold on.

626
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Let me take a close look.

627
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,600
The source of lights in this video
is from the left side.

628
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,880
But videos shot by handphones

629
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,800
are in mirror mode.

630
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,320
Therefore, the source of light should
be from the right

631
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,520
which means it faces south.

632
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,280
South side.

633
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,320
You go to the seventh floor
and I'll stay on this floor.

634
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,440
Go now.

635
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,560
Listen, pay attention
to the rooms on the south.

636
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,880
The person is in one of the rooms
on the south side.

637
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,960
I'm on the sixth floor now.

638
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,120
What's that?

639
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,960
Whatever. Run now.

640
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,560
Come out.

641
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,760
The fire alarm.

642
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,760
Check every room thoroughly.

643
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,120
Hello.

644
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,480
(Miss Yao.)

645
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,880
(You asked for yesterday's
room registration)

646
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,080
(of couples
who are around twenty-five years old.)

647
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,800
(There are five pairs in total.)

648
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,680
(Two pairs checked out)

649
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,440
(at 9.30 a.m. today.)

650
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,000
(The remaining three are in Room 807,)

651
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,000
(815 and 720.)

652
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,520
Which of these rooms is in the south?

653
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,560
(South? It's Room 720.)

654
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,960
Send the photo of the client

655
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,200
- to my phone.
- (Yes.)

656
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,360
- Right now.
- (Yes.)

657
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,040
Be careful, mister.

658
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,720
Please go down through the staircase.

659
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,920
Please proceed to the first floor.

660
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,600
Walk slowly.

661
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,880
Lady, be careful.

662
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,000
Please proceed to the first floor.

663
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,360
Where's it that's on fire?

664
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,160
We're checking for it now.

665
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,800
Please proceed to the first floor.

666
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
(Miss Yao.)

667
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,960
(There's only one female client
in Room 720)

668
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,720
(and no one else.)

669
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,920
Sir, please wait for a moment.

670
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,560
Scram.

671
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,480
Sir, please wait.

672
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Sir, are you the guest from Room 720...

673
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,800
Get out of my way.

674
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,080
How could you do this to me?

675
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,480
Why do you force me?

676
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,360
You women are the worst.

677
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,040
I'm going to kill you.

678
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,120
I'm going to kill you.

679
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,960
What has happened, Junhui?

680
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,840
Get in the car first.

681
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,720
What has happened, Junhui?

682
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,760
Qin Shi and Wang Jiesen

683
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,720
aren't in the law firm.

684
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,000
Since they're not

685
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,760
in the firm or the hotel,

686
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,160
what should we do now?

687
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,920
Hangzhou is big.

688
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,920
It's pointless to wander around here.

689
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,480
What a long shot.

690
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,440
Do you have Yang Hua's number?

691
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,520
No, but I can get the number.

692
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,400
Call him.

693
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,800
She just accompanied her colleague
on a field trip.

694
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,000
Nothing's wrong with this.

695
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,800
(Are you serious?)

696
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,160
(Why choose her)

697
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,440
(out of all lawyers in the firm?)

698
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,280
Now that Wang Jiesen

699
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,680
has the say in the project.

700
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,840
Yet he asked for Qin Shi alone
to go with him

701
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,920
out of so many lawyers.

702
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,160
Can't you tell what's his intention?

703
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,680
Besides, no one can reach them now.

704
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,520
They're not in the hotel or the firm.

705
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,080
You know better than me

706
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,600
what kind of person Wang Jiesen is.

707
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,000
Do you think
it has nothing to do with you

708
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,800
when he chose Qin Shi alone?

709
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,280
What do you want me to do?

710
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,480
Are you out of your mind?

711
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,200
What do you mean by that?

712
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,360
Don't you know

713
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,720
what you should do?

714
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,560
Let's go.

715
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,280
Yang.

716
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Something bad has happened.

717
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,320
I'm talking to you.

718
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,440
What has happened?

719
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,600
Something bad has happened to Yao Yao.

720
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,240
There's a psycho

721
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,240
hurting people in Yao Yao's hotel.

722
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,560
Yao Yao got stabbed.

723
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,920
Where did you get this?

724
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,760
A group chat we have
during the university days.

725
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,000
One of our coursemates is a reporter

726
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,240
who covers social news.

727
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,680
Read this.

728
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,200
Let's go.

729
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,160
Where to?

730
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,080
Are we going to look for Qin Shi

731
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,160
and turn back for Yao Yao?

732
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,920
Mr. Wang, please take a good rest.

733
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,520
- After I contact...
- Qin Shi.

734
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,480
Now, there are only two of us

735
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
in this room.

736
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,440
Take off your mask.

737
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,400
There's no one here.

738
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,800
Writing the report

739
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,600
is just a waste of time.

740
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,240
Hey, no rush.

741
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,080
If you have any plans,

742
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,760
we'll talk about them later

743
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,760
until you finish the report.

744
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,480
Today,

745
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,520
you're not going anywhere

746
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,040
but to sit here and write the report.

747
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,440
Tell me if you need help.

748
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,320
I shall get out of your way, then.

749
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,680
Well.

750
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,760
I'll brew tea for you.

751
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,280
Well.

752
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,040
(Feifei.)

753
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,480
(I'm afraid something will be up)

754
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,880
(regarding He Dongna's matter.)

755
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,040
(She's going through a divorce
with Mr. Hu.)

756
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,200
(I guess Madam Tang has
already known about this.)

757
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,080
(That's why)

758
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,920
(she keeps in close touch
with Wang Jiesen.)

759
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,560
(Probably both of them)

760
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,120
(have conspired on certain deals.)

761
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,960
(Feifei.)

762
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,120
(I've miscalculated this time.)

763
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,160
(The contact is saved on my computer.)

764
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,280
(Go find it.)

765
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,200
Same passcode, please.

766
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Marital settlement agreement?

767
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,200
(Marital Agreement)

768
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,000
Yang Hua.

769
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,680
Qin Shi.

770
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,760
Is the intel correct?

771
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,800
This is the place, I'm sure.

772
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,400
They were here three this afternoon.

773
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,240
Are you sure this is the place?

774
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,320
Yes, I'm certain of it. Very sure.

775
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,920
Junhui.

776
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,080
Wait.

777
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Junhui.

778
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,560
Be careful.

779
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,280
Stay outside.

780
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
If I don't come out
after fifteen minutes,

781
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,360
call the police.

782
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,760
Alright.

783
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,640
Be careful.

784
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,920
Qin Shi.

785
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,840
You're so gorgeous.

786
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,480
Qin Shi,

787
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,160
it's a waste
for a gorgeous woman like you

788
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,400
to be with that pathetic Yang Hua.

789
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,040
I deserve you.

790
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,600
If you come to me,

791
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,520
I promise

792
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,600
you'll live in heaven every day.

793
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,360
Is it?

794
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:29,760
