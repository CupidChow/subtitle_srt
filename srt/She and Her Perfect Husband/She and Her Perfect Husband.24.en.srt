Put me down.

20
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,191
You're late.

21
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:03,032
Put me down.

22
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:05,111
Let me introduce to you.

23
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,272
This is my childhood friend,

24
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:08,271
Wu Fei.

25
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,631
Feiei, this is my boyfriend,

26
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:11,351
Cao Yiren.

27
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:13,112
Hello, Wu Fei.

28
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:14,472
Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:15,592
Hello.

30
00:02:16,232 --> 00:02:17,351
Feifei's dad and my dad

31
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:18,711
have been friends for years.

32
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:20,151
So,

33
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:21,032
Feifei agreed

34
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:22,271
to be my bridesmaid.

35
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:23,791
Really?

36
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,312
That's great.

37
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:27,952
You've done us a great favour.

38
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:29,192
Thank you so much.

39
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,032
Previously, Fangfang was worried

40
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,151
as she couldn't find a bridesmaid
she liked.

41
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,232
That's great.

42
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:36,232
Finally, she can stop complaining

43
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:37,032
and nagging.

44
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:38,351
Cao Yiren.

45
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,232
What's wrong with you?

46
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,672
- What's with you?
- Just kidding.

47
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:41,312
Just kidding.

48
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:41,952
Let's go.

49
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:42,511
Come on.

50
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,271
You went to see Cao Yiren?

51
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:53,752
When?

52
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:00,032
I woke up early this morning.

53
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:02,872
You should've

54
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:04,472
discussed this with me.

55
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:09,392
Would you agree then?

56
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,151
No worries.

57
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:11,911
He knows me

58
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,511
as Fangfang's friend.

59
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:14,911
I'm just curious

60
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:15,631
what kind of person

61
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:17,271
Cao Yiren is.

62
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:19,032
We can't

63
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,032
know him well

64
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:20,911
by just speculating.

65
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,472
The information is more accurate

66
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:23,511
if we get firsthand knowledge of him.

67
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:29,511
Aren't you curious

68
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:30,592
about what I've found?

69
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:31,392
Ask me now.

70
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:33,192
Something's fishy about this man.

71
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:41,232
I wonder if it was
because of my good luck

72
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,631
or his tough luck,

73
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:44,151
I've got something peppery

74
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:45,192
on the first day.

75
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,151
Look forward to our cooperation.

76
00:03:58,392 --> 00:03:59,872
Look forward to our cooperation.

77
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:08,351
Sir, your glasses.

78
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:17,671
Mr. Cao, it's my pleasure
doing business with you.

79
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,231
Cheers.

80
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:25,391
It's normal for businessmen

81
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,872
to entertain their clients
in that kind of place.

82
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,111
What did they talk about?

83
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:31,192
About the financing.

84
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:33,592
He wanted the company to go public.

85
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:35,072
They were

86
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,231
chatting, drinking and singing there.

87
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:39,831
Nothing went off

88
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,312
at first.

89
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,072
What has happened then?

90
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,512
Well.

91
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:46,632
You know.

92
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:48,951
When men get drunk,

93
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:52,872
they become more lively.

94
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:54,912
So did Cao Yiren?

95
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:57,111
Well, this guy.

96
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:05,352
I got a call.

97
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:10,671
Have you arrived?

98
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:11,512
Yes.

99
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:12,951
I'm looking for you.

100
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:13,991
Where are you?

101
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:15,872
I'm outside the room.

102
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,222
- Where are you?
- I can't see you.

103
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:40,592
Do you mean this woman?

104
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:43,912
I tell you what,

105
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:46,111
he brought this woman home

106
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,271
that night and never left.

107
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:54,072
This woman is Ding Fangfang,

108
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,912
Cao Yiren's fiancee.

109
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:01,872
Is it?

110
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:03,512
You asked me?

111
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:10,352
No wonder I thought

112
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:11,632
they were a lovely couple.

113
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,632
You better give me back the money
for fried chicken.

114
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:22,111
Wait, you can't blame me.

115
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:22,551
Right?

116
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,792
You didn't provide

117
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:25,352
all information about him though.

118
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:26,951
You just wanted me to keep an eye
on Cao Yiren.

119
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:27,951
I've brought you the intel

120
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:29,551
after twenty-four hours.

121
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:30,632
You can't ask for more.

122
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:31,032
Bro.

123
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:32,312
You called this intel?

124
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,072
I didn't say

125
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:35,792
that Cao Yiren seems fishy
because of this woman.

126
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,431
Right?

127
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:37,312
I was saying

128
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:40,271
that since Cao Yiren took his fiancee

129
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:42,072
to such a place,

130
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:43,831
it shows that he's...

131
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,151
Frank and charming.

132
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:48,352
Fangfang said

133
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:49,352
that he always told Fangfang

134
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:50,271
whenever he had business functions.

135
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,711
Besides, most of the places
of the function

136
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,632
were planned by Fangfang.

137
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,352
Thanks to Fangfang's dad

138
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,711
who helps improve her tolerance of this.

139
00:06:58,312 --> 00:06:58,752
Sometimes,

140
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,072
Fangfang would come to help him

141
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:01,512
if he was trapped in the function.

142
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:03,352
His business partners

143
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:04,192
know about this too.

144
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,592
Didn't you go

145
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,951
acquire firsthand knowledge?

146
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:09,752
Why is it all from Fangfang?

147
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:12,632
I didn't only use my ears,

148
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,792
I witnessed it with my eyes too.

149
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:15,792
If you want to know

150
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:16,671
a couple well,

151
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:18,512
you should look at

152
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:19,352
how they get along.

153
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:20,551
Tell me.

154
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:21,752
How do they get along?

155
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:24,752
They get along well and naturally.

156
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,151
Besides, Fangfang is very happy.

157
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:30,032
They're like a blessed couple who's in love.

158
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:31,431
You might not know

159
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:33,472
that Fangfang used to be arrogant.

160
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:34,711
She studied at

161
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,711
a prestigious art college overseas

162
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:38,551
and she was condescending.

163
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,352
That's why she couldn't find a bridesmaid.

164
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,111
It's me who devoted myself to helping,

165
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,551
therefore, she's willing to tell me this.

166
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,312
Anyway, I can sense that Fangfang

167
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:51,512
has become humble now.

168
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:53,592
Also, she's thoughtful.

169
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,032
I think you're the more thoughtful one.

170
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:58,991
Concerning what you said,

171
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:01,391
the huge change in Ding Fangfang

172
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:03,792
is credited to Cao Yiren, right?

173
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:08,352
I think...

174
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:16,912
I think

175
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,872
there's nothing more powerful than love

176
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:22,151
in this world.

177
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,151
So...

178
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:26,472
So?

179
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,951
I'm sure the relationship
between Cao Yiren and Ding Fangfang

180
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:30,271
is genuine.

181
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:32,272
Just like us.

182
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:37,312
Wait.

183
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:40,632
That's all?

184
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:43,192
Yes, that's all.

185
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:45,872
Didn't you say

186
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,152
that something's wrong with Cao Yiren?

187
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:50,632
Initially, I thought so.

188
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:51,832
But for now,

189
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,632
I think

190
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,671
nothing's quite wrong with him.

191
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:56,512
Don't worry.

192
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,471
There's another clue

193
00:08:58,752 --> 00:08:59,591
waiting for the result.

194
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,152
I wonder if it's useful.

195
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:08,832
Hey, why are you silent?

196
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:09,952
What about this?

197
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:12,152
If we can't find anything from him,

198
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:14,192
let's think of a way

199
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:15,512
to test him out.

200
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:16,911
What's it?

201
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:20,671
Look.

202
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:24,152
Money is used to test women, right?

203
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:25,551
What should we use to test a man?

204
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:27,351
It's women.

205
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,152
I really want

206
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:34,512
to shut your mouth.

207
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:36,591
Do you think Cao Yiren

208
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:37,512
can't find women himself?

209
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:39,512
He...

210
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:50,952
Wait, who are you?

211
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,111
It's said that Cao Yiren
gave all his properties

212
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:55,431
to his wife after they got divorced.

213
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:56,431
The truth is

214
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,632
that the properties don't belong to him.

215
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,111
His ex-wife, Jessica Chen.

216
00:09:59,272 --> 00:09:59,911
Chen Yun'en

217
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:01,031
is a Chinese Canadian.

218
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,752
Both of her parents are
from Taiwan, China.

219
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:04,231
Her father is a famous Chinese architect

220
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:05,671
in Canada,

221
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,272
while her mother is an obstetrician.

222
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:09,351
As for her, she's the top student
in the Department of Music.

223
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:11,591
She is a typical middle-class Canadian.

224
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,551
However, her parents' brothers

225
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:15,632
are all businessmen

226
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:17,272
and they're wealthy.

227
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:18,752
She owes the family foundation

228
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,471
when she was eighteen.

229
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:22,712
The time when she married Cao Yiren,

230
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:25,272
Cao Yiren was merely

231
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,392
an ambitious young man

232
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:27,991
who depends on scholarships
and bursaries.

233
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:30,031
Wait, where did you

234
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:30,911
get the information?

235
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:33,351
Chen Yun'en's mother may seem to be

236
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:34,431
a common obstetrician.

237
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:36,512
In fact, the hospital
where her mother works at

238
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,192
belongs to the family of her mother.

239
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:39,832
Before they got married,

240
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:40,911
Cao Yiren signed

241
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:41,671
the prenuptial agreement.

242
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:44,231
His apartment, villa,

243
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:45,471
and yatch

244
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:47,312
belong to his ex-wife.

245
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:48,551
Cao Yiren didn't work for three years

246
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,791
after they got married.

247
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:52,272
Even the start-up investment was
offered by his wife.

248
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:53,872
Basically, he had no revenue

249
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:55,072
in that three years.

250
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,272
So, he was empty-pocketed

251
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:57,671
when he got divorced.

252
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:58,911
The reason for the divorce

253
00:10:58,952 --> 00:10:59,832
is because his wife cheated on him?

254
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:00,911
Yes.

255
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:02,351
Moreover,

256
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,512
the guy is his buddy

257
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:04,551
who started up the business with him.

258
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:06,872
Wait, who are you?

259
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,591
This guy has a better family

260
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,591
than Cao Yiren.

261
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:10,752
His family involves
in the business of steel.

262
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:12,231
Their affair was widely spread

263
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:13,551
amongst the rich.

264
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:14,911
Besides, I've looked

265
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:16,072
Cao Yiren up too.

266
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,392
He's from a common family

267
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:18,712
which his father's an accountant

268
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:19,712
at the local Chinese area

269
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:21,231
and his mother is a housewife.

270
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:22,671
Cao Yiren has a smart brain.

271
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:24,392
During his university days,
he received a full scholarship

272
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:25,872
and he worked part-time
to earn his keep.

273
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:27,192
He's indeed

274
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,431
an ambitious student

275
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:29,152
from a humble family.

276
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:30,351
After graduation,

277
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:31,791
he did work on Wall Street.

278
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:33,351
But, the job only lasted one year

279
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:34,471
and then he resigned and got married.

280
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:36,272
Bro,

281
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:37,991
how do you know

282
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,152
if the resume is genuine or not?

283
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:43,591
This is the confirmation letter

284
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:44,791
from the Canadian company.

285
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:53,392
They regard him quite highly.

286
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:56,752
Cao Yiren strove

287
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,471
to change his social strata.

288
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:00,952
But I have a question.

289
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:03,591
Both his ex-wife and girlfriend

290
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:06,072
are either affluent

291
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:07,551
or with prestigious status.

292
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:09,111
Is this a coincidence?

293
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,791
You just met him once.

294
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:13,152
Don't you think

295
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:14,632
you've made an arbitrary judgement?

296
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,031
Actually,

297
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:22,152
I asked him outright.

298
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:23,872
What did you ask?

299
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,072
It's for you.

300
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:39,952
Thank you.

301
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:40,671
My pleasure.

302
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:44,551
Where's Fangfang?

303
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:47,351
She forgot to wear sunscreen.

304
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:48,392
So she went back to the car.

305
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:53,231
Fangfang changed a lot.

306
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:54,911
I can tell she's happy now.

307
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,192
Of course.

308
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:57,791
I love her very much.

309
00:12:58,231 --> 00:12:59,072
She should be happy.

310
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:05,072
Will you sign the prenuptial agreement?

311
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:12,832
You're direct.

312
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:14,591
Did Fangfang tell you this?

313
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:17,471
This agreement bothers her a lot.

314
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:22,911
I haven't made up my mind yet.

315
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:24,991
Do you think

316
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:26,752
I should?

317
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:28,272
I'm Fangfang's friend

318
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:30,392
and I hope you sign it.

319
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:31,872
So that she won't be on bad terms

320
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:33,351
with her dad.

321
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:35,911
After all, marriage
is a lifetime thing.

322
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:38,072
No one would want to have any regrets.

323
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:45,752
To the Chinese,

324
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:47,712
family matters a lot.

325
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:49,671
I've been through a marriage

326
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:51,031
and I have my own child.

327
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:53,031
So, I'm well aware of this.

328
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:55,551
Fangfang is my family.

329
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:57,152
She's the only one

330
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:57,872
I love and care about.

331
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,791
I'll willing to do anything

332
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,072
to make her happy.

333
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,591
However, her dad

334
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:03,551
isn't part of my family.

335
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:05,471
Whether he's happy or not,

336
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,471
it has nothing to do with me.

337
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,312
If Fangfang asks me

338
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,872
to sign the prenuptial agreement

339
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,512
for her sake,

340
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:13,031
I'll do it.

341
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,272
But, if it's for other's sake,

342
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:17,632
sorry,

343
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:19,312
I can't do it.

344
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:23,952
You've done a great job.

345
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:25,712
Order any food you want. It's on me.

346
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:27,791
- Thank you, Miss Qin.
- Thank you, Miss Qin.

347
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:30,072
Waitress, please.

348
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:46,752
What's wrong with you?

349
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:49,312
Qin Shi, what did you say just now?

350
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:52,392
Oh, I remember it.

351
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:55,752
Both Cao Yiren's ex-wife

352
00:14:55,991 --> 00:14:57,111
and girlfriend

353
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,192
are either affluent

354
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,952
or with prestigious status.

355
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,952
Is this a coincidence?

356
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:04,111
I can answer

357
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:07,072
your question now.

358
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:25,712
What did you say

359
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:26,632
about Cao Yiren just now?

360
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:28,551
A professional sponger.

361
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:29,991
This is too much.

362
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,312
Though both his ex-wife and girlfriend

363
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:34,272
come from a rich family,

364
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:36,712
but you're mean to call him that.

365
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:37,791
You have to prove it.

366
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,272
Look at this.

367
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:44,111
This watch.

368
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:45,632
Do you know

369
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,272
how much it is worth?

370
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,512
How would I know?

371
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:48,351
I need to check it.

372
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:49,712
Each of these watches

373
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,712
has its own serial number

374
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,712
and it leads to the purchase details.

375
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,591
Well-played.

376
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,351
Where did you get this serial number?

377
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:03,351
Cheers.

378
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:06,512
Sir, I'll pour you some wine.

379
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,272
What's wrong with you?

380
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:12,911
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:14,431
I'm sorry, sir.

382
00:16:14,832 --> 00:16:15,632
It's my mistake.

383
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:17,872
Do you mind
if I take you to the bathroom?

384
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:19,192
You can drink with them.

385
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,192
I go to the bathroom to clean it.

386
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:21,911
Do you need my help?

387
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:22,512
It's fine.

388
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:24,832
I accompany you to the bathroom

389
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:25,431
and clean it.

390
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,152
My apologies.

391
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:28,671
Towel.

392
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:29,671
I'm fine.

393
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:30,872
Please give me your coat.

394
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:36,111
You might need this.

395
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:40,152
A new towel.

396
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,111
Thank you.

397
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:49,911
She bought that.

398
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:51,392
I've looked her up.

399
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,072
Her family runs a hotel business.

400
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:55,471
Though it's not up to the rank like Hilton,

401
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:57,632
still, she's well-off.

402
00:16:58,192 --> 00:16:59,952
What do you think about
the relationship between them

403
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,351
that the woman would buy him a watch

404
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:03,312
that costs hundreds of thousands?

405
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:04,311
There must be something going on
between them.

406
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:05,152
Besides,

407
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:08,552
I've found more than three similar cases like this.

408
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:10,512
I think there would be more than that.

409
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:14,272
Do you mean Cao Yiren only chose to date

410
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:16,512
women from wealthy families?

411
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:17,632
Yes.

412
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,872
Is it a crime to date a rich woman?

413
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:24,792
Cao Yiren's expertise is in business

414
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:27,231
and he has plenty of chances
to deal with rich people.

415
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,591
Even if he yearns for money, background

416
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:31,152
and connections from the rich,

417
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:33,191
do you think the rich are silly

418
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:35,191
to marry their daughter
to someone like him?

419
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:36,831
It's because they regard

420
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:38,152
his potential and capability highly.

421
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:39,792
Besides, a love relationship

422
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:40,872
is between the couple.

423
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,711
How could you call him

424
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:44,991
a sponger?

425
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:47,792
What a clear thought you have.

426
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:49,632
Speaking of which,

427
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:50,912
do you think Cao Yiren is just like you?

428
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,711
Don't deflect.

429
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,272
As you said,

430
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:00,071
even if one values money highly,

431
00:18:00,672 --> 00:18:01,991
it doesn't mean there's no true love
exists between them.

432
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:04,632
Besides, even if Cao Yiren

433
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:06,872
has his feet on two boats,

434
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:08,872
it can never be considered
an extramarital affair

435
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:10,831
as he hasn't gotten married yet.

436
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:12,752
Besides, he treats his fiancee

437
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:14,191
sincerely, right?

438
00:18:14,752 --> 00:18:15,392
You can't

439
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,552
take the high road on this.

440
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:19,392
All we have to do now

441
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:20,512
is to draft the agreement.

442
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:21,912
And it's his matter
whether to sign it or not.

443
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:23,752
Just let you know.

444
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:26,191
Cao Yiren's coming today.

445
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:27,512
Today?

446
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:28,672
This is an easy case.

447
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,231
Make it quick.

448
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,540
(Cloud Commercial Bank)

449
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:41,432
What are you up to?

450
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:47,231
I've double-checked it for you.

451
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:48,752
What's that?

452
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:51,711
My wife's cousin

453
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,432
graduated from Pujiang Poli-sci too.

454
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:54,512
(Fangyu Finance)
He's from the same batch

455
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:54,630
(Fangyu Finance)

456
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:55,711
as Tao Junhui.

457
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,392
So, I've fished something out from him

458
00:18:57,392 --> 00:18:59,432
about Tao Junhui.

459
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,231
Are you curious?

460
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:05,752
Do you want to know

461
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:07,032
or I'm leaving now?

462
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:14,231
I knew you do.

463
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:15,032
You're ashamed to admit it.

464
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:15,872
Tell you what,

465
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:17,552
Tao Junhui

466
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:20,632
is actually...well...

467
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:24,071
He's more capable than I thought.

468
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:25,512
He's the top scorer

469
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,632
in science stream

470
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,831
and got admitted
to Pujiang Poli-sci.

471
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:29,872
For a four-year programme,

472
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,111
he completed all credits in three years.

473
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:32,711
He passed National Judicial Examination
on the first try

474
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,231
and topped the rank.

475
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:35,711
When he was at university,

476
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:36,752
he only had one relationship.

477
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:38,831
It was a junior who tried in every way

478
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:39,991
to woo him.

479
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,711
Do you know

480
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:43,032
how did the girl manage to get him?

481
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:47,392
You better leave now.

482
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:48,632
Hey, I'm not done yet.

483
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,071
Take a guess.

484
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:51,912
Never mind, I'll tell you.

485
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,591
The girl took him as a role model

486
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:55,711
and worked very hard.

487
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:56,632
She set him as her target

488
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:58,552
and strove to break his records
in the exams.

489
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,872
Tao Junhui participated
in the debate four times.

490
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:04,272
Among the competitions,

491
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,272
he missed the Best Debater Award once

492
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:06,831
because of her.

493
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:09,432
Finally, the girl won over his heart.

494
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:13,152
You see,

495
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:15,152
the love relationship
of the top-bracket students

496
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:16,711
is beyond the imagination

497
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:18,432
of my common brain.

498
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:20,032
So to sum up,

499
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:23,591
Hao Junhui is exceptional.

500
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:27,552
He's amazing and marvellous.

501
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:29,432
You admire him very much.

502
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:30,792
I can introduce him to you.

503
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:31,752
Good.

504
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:32,831
This is a good idea.

505
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:33,831
He's our potential...

506
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:36,471
potential...

507
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:47,632
Haven't you made up with Miss Qin yet?

508
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,152
Don't tell me

509
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:55,991
something is going on
between Miss Qin and him.

510
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:57,792
Cut that out.

511
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:00,991
I never doubted Qin Shi.

(Meeting Room)

513
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:09,032
Unexpectedly,

514
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:11,311
I can witness the scenery
from the 11th floor

00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,912
in this position.

516
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:15,991
It seems you managed to enter
the corporation department

517
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:17,672
with a workaround.

518
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:19,071
One gets the promotion and
a raise in pay by jumping the ship.

519
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,392
Unlike someone

520
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:22,471
who's small-mindedness

521
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:24,672
thinking that there's
only one way leads to Rome.

522
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:27,752
Miss Li, you're Cao Yiren's attorney.

523
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:30,111
May I know
if Mr. Cao is presenting today?

524
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:34,152
Oops, I almost forgot this.

525
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:39,032
This is the letter of authorization.

526
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,552
I've got the full power of attorney

527
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,711
on the prenuptial agreement

528
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,392
of Mr. Cao and Miss Ding.

529
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,951
Mr. Cao is occupied with his business

530
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:50,512
and the wedding preparation.

531
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:51,792
He can't manage this.

532
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:52,552
Besides,

533
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:54,392
this is just a small deal.

534
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:55,752
After all, it's Miss Ding's father

535
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:57,591
who requested the prenuptial agreement.

536
00:21:58,231 --> 00:21:59,591
I've asked Miss Ding

537
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:01,591
and she said
that she listens to Mr. Cao.

538
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,591
If Mr. Cao wants her
to sign the agreement, she'll do so.

539
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:07,951
Oh my.

540
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:09,191
They pass the bucket to each other.

541
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:10,311
Interesting.

542
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:12,032
Miss Qin.

543
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:14,032
You're the only

544
00:22:14,152 --> 00:22:15,231
a married woman here.

545
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:18,311
Given your lovely

546
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:19,711
and happy marriage,

547
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:21,111
I'm sure

548
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:22,432
you understand them.

549
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:26,991
That reminds of me

550
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:28,912
that I'm the only married woman

551
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,191
in this room

552
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:31,632
and I had signed

553
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:32,552
the prenuptial agreement too.

554
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,632
I can promise you,

555
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:35,552
the prenuptial agreement

556
00:22:35,752 --> 00:22:37,111
won't harm their relationship.

557
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:38,552
Instead,

558
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:40,152
it shows that the couple
is mature and wise.

559
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:42,512
As a married couple

560
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:43,912
has already taken into consideration

561
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,231
about the ugliest things

562
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,711
that's most likely to happen

563
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:47,792
before they set foot in marriage,

564
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:48,672
therefore,

565
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:49,912
they're prepared

566
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:51,711
no matter what's going to happen later.

567
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:53,991
Humans fear of the unknown.

568
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:55,272
And prenuptial agreement

569
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,672
deals with the fears.

570
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:01,752
Well said.

571
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:04,231
Let's get down to business.

572
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:06,111
You can go through the content quickly.

573
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,152
If there are no other problems,

574
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,632
this can be done within one day or two.

575
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:11,392
However, this agreement is kind of personal,

576
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:13,831
can you decide for Mr. Cao?

577
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:15,152
No problem.

578
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:16,912
If you have any concerns,

579
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,512
I can resolve it for you.

580
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,111
Besides,

581
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:21,512
you've already

582
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:22,912
scrutinised thoroughly

583
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:24,792
the background of Mr. Cao, right?

584
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:29,191
What do you mean?

585
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:33,071
Miss Qin.

586
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:35,111
I just left Cheng & Hui firm

587
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:35,991
not long ago.

588
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:37,111
I know very well

589
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:38,632
how things get done here,

590
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:39,792
especially you.

591
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:42,792
Mr. Cao grew up abroad

592
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:44,432
and his love relationship,

593
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:46,711
social circle and marriage

594
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:47,711
isn't off the record.

595
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:48,632
He has nothing to hide.

596
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:50,711
Miss Ding knows everything about him.

597
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:52,792
Oh, right.

598
00:23:53,272 --> 00:23:53,872
Miss Ding

599
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:55,512
and his ex-girlfriend,

600
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:57,912
oh, what's her name?

601
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,512
The one who gave him the watch.

602
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:00,831
Dorris.

603
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:03,831
Her Chinese name is Tao Lisi.

604
00:24:04,432 --> 00:24:05,432
Right, Tao Lisi.

605
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:08,792
The English name

606
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:09,752
is quite tricky.

607
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:12,552
But, there's one thing

608
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:13,632
you might not know.

609
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:15,351
Miss Ding

610
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:16,951
got to know Mr. Cao

611
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:18,071
via Tao Lisi,

612
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:19,912
while Tao Lisi's father

613
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,512
was an important client of Mr. Cao

614
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:22,951
when he was on Wall Street.

615
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:24,392
At that time,

616
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:25,512
Mr. Cao has helped him

617
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:26,591
to make tons of money.

618
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:28,432
Hence, this watch

619
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:30,471
is a token of appreciation for him.

620
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:32,272
Never think that those

621
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,111
who approaches the rich

622
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,272
harbour a bad intention.

623
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:35,591
You're just judging the book

624
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:36,752
by its cover.

625
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:38,711
That's superficial.

626
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:43,951
I think we should

627
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:45,231
revise the agreement again.

628
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:49,032
By the way,

629
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:52,392
Mr. Cao has a message for you.

630
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:53,792
One second.

631
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:57,351
Where's my handphone?

632
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,231
It's here.

633
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:03,512
(Actually,)

634
00:25:04,392 --> 00:25:05,831
(the relationship between Fangfang and me)

635
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:07,351
(doesn't need to be justified
by something in black and white)

636
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:10,111
(nor do we have to persuade anyone
to get their trust.)

637
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:11,272
(I've experienced)

638
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:13,071
(a failed marriage before.)

639
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:15,912
(Before meeting Fangfang,)

640
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,231
(I thought I'd never married someone again.)

641
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,032
It's said that one remains single

642
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:24,272
because they haven't met someone

643
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:25,912
that makes them
abandon their principles.

644
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:28,152
To me,

645
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:30,632
Fangfang is that someone.

646
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,720
(Reference Room)

647
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:59,392
(Cao Yiren is really cunning.)

648
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,831
(He even got Li Dai)

649
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:02,351
(to be in charge of this.)

650
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:04,432
(I can never come around)

651
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,191
(that he's so lucky.)

652
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:19,711
Why are you still here?

653
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:24,951
I won't leave

654
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:26,872
as I haven't seen you being bullied.

655
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,831
I won't be satisfied then.

656
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:31,831
The greatest dream

657
00:26:32,111 --> 00:26:33,032
in my career

658
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:35,991
is to become the director of a library.

659
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:37,311
To my surprise,

660
00:26:37,711 --> 00:26:39,512
you've made my dream come true.

661
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:40,951
If you want to be the director,

662
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:41,912
you can have it.

663
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:43,991
Stop eating.

664
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:45,272
I'll buy you lunch.

665
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:46,512
No, I'm on diet.

666
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,231
Then why are you eating
the salted egg yolk pastry?

667
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:54,432
Aren't you curious

668
00:26:54,872 --> 00:26:55,792
about Cao Yiren?

669
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,510
(Fangyu Finance, Product details)

670
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:11,272
(Fangyu Finance, Product details)
What are you reading?

671
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:13,711
Just reading.

672
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,711
Just reading?

673
00:27:17,032 --> 00:27:18,111
I'm not born yesterday.

674
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:20,552
Yang Hua, I'm telling you

675
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:22,471
you can do anything you like
and I won't interrupt you

676
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:24,231
but never lay your finger
on Fangyu Finance.

677
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:25,951
Don't even look at it. Do you hear me?

678
00:27:28,032 --> 00:27:28,512
Why?

679
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:29,552
What do you mean?

680
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,272
Mr. Qiu of Fangyu Finance

681
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:32,752
is the guest of honour
in Credit Department.

682
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:33,752
Credit Department

683
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,912
is going to treat him to lunch later.

684
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:39,432
I know

685
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:41,991
that you have a beef with Mr. Qiu.

686
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:43,351
However, I don't care

687
00:27:43,552 --> 00:27:44,152
what's happened between you.

688
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:45,792
From now on,

689
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:47,991
don't touch Fangyu Finance.

690
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:48,792
Okay?

691
00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:52,111
Mr. Qiu owes a finance company.

692
00:27:53,032 --> 00:27:54,512
Normally, he should be the one
who buys meals

693
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:55,471
for Credit Department.

694
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:56,672
Why does it happen

695
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:57,632
the other way round?

696
00:27:57,951 --> 00:27:58,552
Nothing's wrong.

697
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:00,792
As you know,

698
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:02,872
Mr. Qiu has been in this industry

699
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:04,392
for forty years.

700
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:06,951
The thing he's proud of

701
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,512
isn't his trading skills,

702
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:09,951
but the connections he has

703
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:12,152
in the industry of finance and business.

704
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:13,752
Why does the bank

705
00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:14,672
need his connections?

706
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:18,552
Songjiang is going to have

707
00:28:18,552 --> 00:28:19,792
the New Energy Smart City.

708
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:20,632
Do you know this?

709
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:24,552
Do you know about
New Energy Smart City?

710
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:28,071
I offer you a stock.

711
00:28:29,111 --> 00:28:29,752
Tell you what,

712
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:32,351
this is a massive project.

713
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:33,951
The core project of all

714
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:36,392
is CCHO,

715
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:38,831
Combined Cooling, Heating and Power.

716
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:39,912
To be more exact,

717
00:28:39,912 --> 00:28:41,432
it's a new kind of power plant.

718
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:43,591
Not only does it help with electricity,

719
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:47,272
it also handles heating, cooling
and hot water needs.

720
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:48,711
Think about this.

721
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:50,951
It can cope with the demand
for heating, cooling and hot water.

722
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:52,951
It's definitely a great project

723
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:54,672
to change human needs in the community.

724
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:57,672
Currently, this project

725
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:58,831
has been applied
in the industrial field.

726
00:28:59,152 --> 00:29:00,471
But, I believe
that within a short period,

727
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:01,231
it will be used

728
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:02,071
for both commercial and residential use.

729
00:29:02,632 --> 00:29:03,392
Look,

730
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:05,071
this is revolutionary.

731
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:07,591
Pretty good.

732
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:08,752
Pretty good?

733
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:09,991
The expected revenue

734
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:11,752
of this project is promising.

735
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:12,872
Besides, it possesses

736
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:13,951
sufficient funds.

737
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,152
So, Credit Department

738
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,191
keeps their eyes on the prize.

739
00:29:17,432 --> 00:29:18,231
I heard

740
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:19,951
that the person in charge of the project

741
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:22,032
is on good terms with Mr. Qiu.

742
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,351
Jia

743
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:27,711
shamelessly wants to get a piece

744
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:28,512
from the project.

745
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:29,672
Otherwise, there's never

746
00:29:29,872 --> 00:29:30,591
for the arrogant Credit Department

747
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:32,111
to treat their client to a meal.

748
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:33,311
Am I right?

749
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:36,351
Where are you going?

750
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:37,831
It's lunch hour. I'm off for lunch.

751
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,632
You should take me along.

752
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:40,752
Are you not going to buy me lunch?

753
00:29:44,872 --> 00:29:46,191
You eat a lot.

754
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:47,672
Why do you torture yourself

755
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:48,991
by spending money to lose weight

756
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:49,792
after eating heavily?

757
00:29:51,432 --> 00:29:52,991
I have a fast metabolism.

758
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,632
Statistically speaking,

759
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,152
married people

760
00:29:57,552 --> 00:29:59,111
are twice as obese as single people

761
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:01,111
of the same age.

762
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:02,111
Therefore, even if I eat

763
00:30:02,272 --> 00:30:02,951
twice as much as you,

764
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:04,792
we're still drawing a tie.

765
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:10,392
Tell me something valuable.

766
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:11,872
What will that be?

767
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:12,632
About Cao Yiren.

768
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,032
Him?

769
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:17,152
You won't get valuable information about him

770
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,032
even if I tell you.

771
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,872
After all, we're in a contrary position.

772
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:23,272
I won't act

773
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:24,872
like an unprofessional lawyer.

774
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:29,471
You were acting mysteriously just now.

775
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:30,591
I thought

776
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:32,272
you have some exclusive news for me.

777
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:35,711
Speaking of inside information,
I don't have it.

778
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,711
But, I do have an inside advice for you.

779
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:43,471
You better give up.

780
00:30:44,272 --> 00:30:45,552
Cao Yiren won't

781
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:46,951
sign the agreement.

782
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:53,951
Did Cao Yiren ask you to tell me this?

783
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:55,951
What for?

784
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,392
You should

785
00:30:58,392 --> 00:30:59,672
know one or two about Cao Yiren.

786
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:01,991
He's the wolf of Wall Street

787
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:03,471
who's abnormally brilliant and politic.

788
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:05,311
He gets his hook into Ding Fangfang.

789
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:06,432
I think we shouldn't

790
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:07,872
waste our time on this.

791
00:31:08,152 --> 00:31:09,272
Just do our duty

792
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:10,792
and go through the agreement.

793
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:12,912
Even if you write a perfect agreement,

794
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,471
he won't sign it either.

795
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:16,912
I don't believe it.

796
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:19,231
Whatever.

797
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:22,512
You'd better

798
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:24,311
save your strength on this case.

799
00:31:25,392 --> 00:31:27,672
Unless you don't have any cases.

800
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:30,632
Sorry, I'm very busy.

801
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:31,831
Very.

802
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:37,912
Do you think Cao Yiren

803
00:31:38,392 --> 00:31:39,792
loves Ding Fangfang truly?

804
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,071
How should I know?

805
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,392
I'm not the justifier
in Civil Affairs Bureau.

806
00:31:43,432 --> 00:31:44,552
Even if the staff there

807
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:45,591
has to issue the certificate

808
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:47,591
when they come for registration,

809
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:50,432
even if one of the couple
has beaten another one

810
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:51,711
to a pulp the night before.

811
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,111
The marriage certificate must be issued

812
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:56,272
as long as both of them choose so.

813
00:31:57,912 --> 00:31:58,831
Eat your own food.

814
00:32:04,032 --> 00:32:04,672
Qin Shi.

815
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:06,711
Why do I feel

816
00:32:07,432 --> 00:32:08,272
that you've become lonely

817
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:09,872
after my leaving?

818
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:12,552
Who's your rival now?

819
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,032
How many battles did you two fight?

820
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:15,471
What's your record?

821
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:17,951
I'm a mysterious woman.

822
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:19,032
Never ask about me.

823
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:20,632
Don't you think I know nothing

824
00:32:20,632 --> 00:32:21,512
even if you don't say.

825
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:24,032
Before I left,

826
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,272
I've entrusted you

827
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:26,632
to Yang Hua.

828
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:28,512
Given your limited intelligence,

829
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:30,872
you're considered fortunate

830
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:31,872
to die with a complete body

831
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:32,711
in the corporation department

832
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:35,231
let alone achieving
a big success whatsoever.

833
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:35,912
Hold on.

834
00:32:36,152 --> 00:32:37,432
What do you mean by
"you entrusted me to Yang Hua"?

835
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:40,071
Do you think you survive there
just by yourself?

836
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:43,191
Yang Hua is a man with a brain.

837
00:32:44,552 --> 00:32:45,912
Don't tell me

838
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:47,152
that you regard him as a wallflower

839
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:47,991
instead of making good use of him.

840
00:32:49,872 --> 00:32:52,672
Did he really not help you?

841
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:53,591
It can't be.

842
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:55,191
Previously,

843
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,311
he was reading law books, though.

844
00:32:58,471 --> 00:32:59,672
Do you mean Yang Hua

845
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:01,831
reading law books?

846
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:06,711
What's this for?

847
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:08,632
You want me to make a book list?

848
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,711
You list the book based on

849
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:13,311
the compulsory course of law students

850
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:15,991
or from the perspective
of finance and economics.

851
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:18,152
Do you decide

852
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:21,191
to change your career now?

853
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:23,912
I just want to read more

854
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:25,672
and widen my knowledge.

855
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,071
Qin Shi.

856
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:37,632
Let's be honest.

857
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:40,231
Did you bully Yang Hua

858
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:41,432
with your profession?

859
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:44,471
Do you study law before?

860
00:33:45,152 --> 00:33:46,111
Do you how a lawyer works?

861
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:47,231
If not,

862
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:48,071
what makes you think

863
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:48,872
you can command on

864
00:33:48,872 --> 00:33:49,432
what I should do

865
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:50,152
or shouldn't do?

866
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,071
Why would I bully him?

867
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:56,191
Do you know nothing about yourself

868
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:57,071
or do you think

869
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:58,432
I know nothing about you?

870
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:01,591
The biggest flaw of yours

871
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:02,872
is you're too ambitious.

872
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:05,032
And your biggest virtue
is also too ambitious.

873
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:08,031
Let me put this right.

874
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:09,632
I'm just self-motivated.

875
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:13,111
Aren't you self-motivated too?

876
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:14,831
If you're asked to work at a common firm

877
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:16,831
and fight some common lawsuits

878
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:18,232
just for chicken feed salary

879
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:21,311
or to be a full-time wife

880
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:22,872
and stay away from the workplace,

881
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:23,511
will you concur with this?

882
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:24,632
Of course, I'd love to.

883
00:34:25,192 --> 00:34:25,992
My biggest dream

884
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:27,152
is to find a man

885
00:34:27,392 --> 00:34:28,271
who feeds and houses me.

886
00:34:28,472 --> 00:34:29,551
If I meet one,

887
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:30,952
I'll hand in the notice

888
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,472
and never step into the workplace again.

889
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:40,351
I've come around to this.

890
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:42,912
I'll see you as my role model.

891
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:44,511
With powerful willpower

892
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:45,551
and firm belief,

893
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:47,551
nothing is unachievable.

894
00:34:48,432 --> 00:34:49,071
So...

895
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:50,872
So, I'll definitely have Cao Yiren

896
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:51,591
to sign the agreement.

897
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,472
Are you sure?

898
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,111
I think

899
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,632
you better pray for a dragon.

900
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:58,551
With the help of Yang Hua,

901
00:34:58,831 --> 00:34:59,791
I think you can

902
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:00,872
get two dragons.

903
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:04,271
If I may ask,

904
00:35:05,232 --> 00:35:06,152
do you think

905
00:35:06,152 --> 00:35:09,192
Cao Yiren is just like Pang Dingfang?

906
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:11,712
You are complicit in it.

907
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:13,311
Can you really sleep soundly at night

908
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,952
with no regrets?

909
00:35:22,232 --> 00:35:22,912
I can.

910
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,152
I'm the attorney of Cao Yiren.

911
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,751
I must protect the rights of my client.

912
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:31,712
So,

913
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:33,031
all those nonsense

914
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,311
has nothing to do with me.

915
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,192
And I won't feel guilty.

916
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:38,392
Don't try anything tricky on me.

917
00:35:38,751 --> 00:35:39,351
It's useless.

918
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,551
Have it all.

919
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:21,672
If you intend to look into

920
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:23,232
the asset report of a company,

921
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:25,232
this document is merely
the tip of the iceberg.

922
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:28,152
Noted.

923
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,540
(Andy House)

924
00:36:47,712 --> 00:36:48,351
Hello, miss.

925
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:50,311
Do you want some briefing on this?

926
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:52,111
Sure, let's take a seat inside.

927
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:56,751
Annual fee?

928
00:36:56,992 --> 00:36:57,872
Why?

929
00:36:58,432 --> 00:36:59,071
Mr. Zhao.

930
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:00,591
Because you rent

931
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:02,351
the premium office condominium

932
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:03,551
and it's charged yearly.

933
00:37:03,912 --> 00:37:04,672
You pay for twelve months in one go

934
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:05,831
and get you the condominium
for fourteen months.

935
00:37:06,192 --> 00:37:06,872
The average fee per month

936
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:08,351
is lower than
the surrounding condominium.

937
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:09,632
Besides, you're offered

938
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:10,511
free weekly cleaning service

939
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:11,432
and butler service.

940
00:37:12,712 --> 00:37:14,232
But, you told me
that you accepted monthly payments.

941
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:15,712
Well,

942
00:37:15,912 --> 00:37:16,591
that's another package

943
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:17,751
our company launched.

944
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:18,791
A twelve-month loan for property rental

945
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:19,791
can be provided

946
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:21,071
without a guarantee.

947
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,632
And one can start paying
the rent monthly.

948
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:24,472
Are you interested in this?

949
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:25,392
Excuse me.

950
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:27,992
Can I get a loan to rent?

951
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,672
Yes.

952
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:30,111
This is the special package.

953
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:31,111
If you're interested,

954
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:31,912
I can brief you on this.

955
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:34,071
Miss, have you chosen yet?

956
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:35,591
I can brief you.

957
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:36,791
Sure.

958
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,071
Good.

959
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:41,071
Mr. Tao.

960
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,712
This condominium was furnished a month ago.

961
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:45,952
No worries.

962
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:46,912
The furnished materials we used

963
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:48,031
are from well-known companies.

964
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:49,472
It's eco-friendly.

965
00:37:53,192 --> 00:37:54,831
I've checked the utilities
like water, electricity and gas

966
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:56,672
and recorded the rates.

967
00:37:58,791 --> 00:37:59,511
There's a door here.

968
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:01,672
If you're fine with this,

969
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:02,912
I'll get going.

970
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:03,872
Thank you so much.

971
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:20,511
Dinner.

972
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:54,751
You lost your appetite?

973
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:56,311
No.

974
00:38:58,071 --> 00:39:00,511
You...how's the case going?

975
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:02,872
I've finished drafting the agreement.

976
00:39:03,472 --> 00:39:04,992
But I guess he won't sign it.

977
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:07,751
My gut tells me

978
00:39:07,952 --> 00:39:08,831
that something is fishy.

979
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:10,351
I'll get to the bottom of this.

980
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:19,551
You keep spacing out today.

981
00:39:22,351 --> 00:39:23,872
Well, I always do.

982
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:30,311
I go get you some soup.

983
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,791
Let's be honest.

984
00:39:46,472 --> 00:39:48,551
Did you bully Yang Hua

985
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:49,712
with your profession?

986
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:55,712
You better pray for a dragon.

987
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:57,712
With the help of Yang Hua,

988
00:39:57,992 --> 00:39:59,111
I think you can

989
00:39:59,311 --> 00:39:59,992
get two dragons.

990
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:06,111
(Does he hold grudges?)

991
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:08,672
(I did nothing wrong though.)

992
00:40:20,432 --> 00:40:22,031
Do you have something to tell me?

993
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:25,392
No, I don't.

994
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:30,791
Are you sure?

995
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:34,232
Yes.

996
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:48,511
I'm done.

997
00:41:16,912 --> 00:41:18,031
It's better to have a fight.

998
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,120
(Stop)

999
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:27,472
You should get things straight

1000
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:28,672
between both of you.

1001
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:30,632
Besides, you need to know

1002
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:33,672
that you're currently under siege.

1003
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:35,751
Hurry up and get armed

1004
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:37,031
so that people can't
take advantage of you.

1005
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:37,952
Alright?

1006
00:43:07,872 --> 00:43:08,591
What's up?

1007
00:43:09,952 --> 00:43:10,791
Do you have time to talk?

1008
00:43:12,912 --> 00:43:14,111
I thought you have nothing to tell me.
