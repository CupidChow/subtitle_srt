19
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:57,939
When my mother was the manager,

20
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,339
she settled the debt every six months.

21
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,178
That's rubbish.

22
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:04,738
We started settling our bills
every three months 10 years ago.

23
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,939
We settle all the bills
from big suppliers every two weeks.

24
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:08,338
Mr. Qin.

25
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:10,659
We're not a chain trust.

26
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:11,739
We're just a small company

27
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:13,898
with seven or eight shopfronts.

28
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,179
All right?

29
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:18,778
Meimei.

30
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:20,058
Finally, I realised

31
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:22,579
that I'm not capable to run the company.

32
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:25,138
Sooner or later, the company will
be ruined under my management.

33
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,058
You suit this post more than me.

34
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:32,618
Wait.

35
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:33,299
What do you mean?

36
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,579
Do you want to quit

37
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,498
and laze around at home?

38
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,099
Are you not afraid of others gossiping?

39
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:39,498
Meimei.

40
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:41,739
I reckon what you said just now

41
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,618
was an insult to men.

42
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,379
Material wealth

43
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,739
shouldn't be the sole benchmark

44
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:47,379
to gauge men's achievement.

45
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:49,258
Likewise, financial responsibility

46
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:50,459
shouldn't be fully borne by men.

47
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,538
Now that we advocate
men and women are equal,

48
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:53,219
right?

49
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:55,579
It's not about responsibility,
but suitability.

50
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:56,579
We should live our lives

51
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,099
based on our capability.

52
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,819
Where did you learn that from?

53
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,338
We have to concur with the trend, Meimei.

54
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,299
A capable person like you

55
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,698
simply rules the company on this seat.

56
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:13,498
Though I haven't located

57
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:14,579
where I'm of help,

58
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:16,019
I'll strive to find it.

59
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:17,618
If I fail to find one after trying,

60
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:18,819
I'll stay at home

61
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:19,659
to do the washing and cook

62
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:20,939
so as to be of your help.

63
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:29,579
Perhaps this is the mission of my life.

64
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:32,978
Honey.

65
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:35,498
I'm going home to make the soup.

66
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:39,338
With great power

67
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:41,778
comes great responsibility.

68
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:16,859
(I'm not a lawyer.)

69
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:17,619
(How can I help her?)

70
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,218
I know you're not,

71
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:21,739
but you're smart.

72
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:23,899
You're highly intelligent
and clear-thinking.

73
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,299
Most importantly,
both of you are partners in crime.

74
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:30,579
To make it sound nicer,

75
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,339
both of you share a common interest.

76
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:34,779
Hence, it'll only do you good

77
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:35,779
if you help her out.

78
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:37,818
Currently, Qin Shi is having a hard time

79
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:38,619
in the firm.

80
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:39,658
Her opponent

81
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:41,459
isn't as understanding as me.

82
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:43,538
If she thinks her petty trick

83
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:44,418
will help her to sail through,

84
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,098
I can tell she's going

85
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,378
to hit rock bottom and crush herself.

86
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:57,619
Little Fatty,

87
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,459
are you doing good today?

88
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,378
So far so good.

89
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:09,938
What about you?
Is your work busy?

90
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:15,538
It's a common day

91
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:17,459
with a common level of anxiety

92
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:18,579
as well as pressure.

93
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,978
Today, your mother phoned me.

94
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:22,779
She said my mother still looks forward

95
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:23,859
to the wedding.

96
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:24,698
So, she made a lot of requests

97
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,779
to your family.

98
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:36,299
What flavour is this?

99
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:37,779
Chocolate.

100
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:42,098
Can I take a bite?

101
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:44,019
Of course.

102
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,978
You've changed a lot recently.

103
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:09,818
You eat a lot in the meal

104
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:11,418
and now you're eating snacks.

105
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:13,779
Is it around

106
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:14,739
the range of 4,500?

107
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:17,418
Do you need help?

108
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:19,658
No need.

109
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:20,579
Regarding my mother,

110
00:06:20,818 --> 00:06:21,739
I'll talk to her.

111
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:22,938
I don't wish

112
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:24,658
to burden your family financially.

113
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:26,459
I'm not saying that.

114
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:30,019
Qin Shi doesn't like people patronising.

115
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:31,938
I'm not asking you to give her
a lecture.

116
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:35,098
Though she seems

117
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:36,179
cocky and cool,

118
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:38,619
however, she has an obvious flaw.

119
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:40,818
You could easily win her over

120
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:42,899
by granting her something.

121
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:44,459
She

122
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:45,938
is appreciative.

123
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,299
And she tends to act foolishly
under tremendous pressure.

124
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:50,938
So, you should make her feel relaxed.

125
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:54,619
It hurts.

126
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:56,418
Is it?

127
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:58,418
Not bad. This strength is just nice.

128
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,779
I didn't know you have this skill.

129
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:05,138
I learned it from the website
when I was bored.

130
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,418
I give my parents a massage.

131
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,579
You have stiff shoulders.

132
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:09,899
Do take care of it.

133
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,138
It's a habit during work.

134
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:14,818
You've entered

135
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,179
the 11th floor now,

136
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:17,658
are you stressed more out than before?

137
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:22,619
I can take it.

138
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:24,538
I need some time to adapt to it.

139
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:27,938
Do you get along well

140
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:29,098
with your colleagues?

141
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:37,938
Well.

142
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:40,179
They're quite arrogant

143
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:42,179
and seem indifferent,

144
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:43,499
but they're not bad.

145
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:45,258
Do you have an opponent

146
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,299
like Li Dai?

147
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,019
Li Dai has resigned.

148
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,339
I didn't expect that.

149
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:51,739
Speaking of her,

150
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:53,179
she handed in the notice

151
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:54,339
without the slightest hesitation.

152
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:55,538
She's brisk.

153
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:57,138
I'm quite impressed.

154
00:07:58,499 --> 00:07:59,218
What about you?

155
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,698
Do you have any plans?

156
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:01,299
No.

157
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:03,779
Why should I have a plan?

158
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:07,299
Didn't you go to the 11th floor

159
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:08,459
to mount a rebellion?

160
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:14,418
Well, it's more of a long-term plan.

161
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:15,579
I'm the kind

162
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:19,579
who thinks on my feet.

163
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:21,059
You know this.

164
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:22,459
True.

165
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:23,698
But, I think

166
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,619
you should be prepared for it well.

167
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,098
What if

168
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,218
you fail?

169
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:29,499
You need

170
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:31,179
a good extraction plan to keep you safe

171
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,338
no matter what happens.

172
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:33,259
What do you say?

173
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:01,418
Eating too much sugar

174
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:04,218
really makes one sleepy.

175
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:27,699
This morning, my mother called me

176
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,538
saying that she'll stay out
of the arrangement.

177
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:31,859
She won't be demanding,

178
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,098
but except for one thing,

179
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,499
that's to fulfill her request for the wedding.

180
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:37,458
I gave it some thought.

181
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:38,819
We can let Meimei handle

182
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,098
the wedding arrangement.

183
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:41,338
Since she's doing the catering business,

184
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:42,218
she has some connections.

185
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:43,978
Probably she can get a bargain.

186
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:46,538
This is the sole request from my mother.

187
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,179
So, I dare not turn her down.

188
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:49,139
No worries.

189
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:50,059
As for the wedding expenses,

190
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:51,379
we'll split the bill.

191
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:52,538
You don't have to cover all the expenses
by yourself.

192
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,098
Alright.

193
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:55,578
Don't feel stressed.

194
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:57,898
Here.

195
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,018
Actually, this has fulfilled

196
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:02,338
all of my mother's anticipation.

197
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:03,338
Apart from that,

198
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,179
what do you look for

199
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:04,939
in our wedding?

200
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,499
Honestly, I have no expectations

201
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:11,538
for the wedding.

202
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:14,299
Think about this. In my family,

203
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:18,658
my father and two brothers

204
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:19,739
have already

205
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:20,819
got married five times

206
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,299
which is too much

207
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:24,859
as compared to a common family.

208
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:27,499
I don't feel like
contributing to it anymore.

209
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:30,619
Besides, I've witnessed how they live

210
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:31,699
before and after getting married.

211
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,778
I see nothing worth

212
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:35,898
devoting myself to marriage.

213
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:37,418
So, why would I anticipate

214
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:38,299
my wedding?

215
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:45,338
I have a present for you.

216
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,418
I found that God of Wealth

217
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:03,578
is lonely,

218
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:06,139
so, I get it a partner.

219
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:07,538
Good things come in pairs.

220
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,259
I wanted to give you yesterday,

221
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,218
but I was too sleepy and I fell asleep.

222
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,338
Luckily, it has a strong vitality

223
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:17,338
and didn't die from suffocation.

224
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:21,819
Why did you give me this suddenly?

225
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:25,699
You've helped me a lot

226
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,379
so I got ascended
to the 11th floor.

227
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:29,939
It took me a lot of time
to prepare this.

228
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:32,098
I think

229
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,778
you're free from desires

230
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,338
and I couldn't think of something
to give you.

231
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,018
That's why I aimed at God of Wealth.

232
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:39,098
Give it a name.

233
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,978
I'll name it God of Longevity.

234
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:46,619
My grandfather would think of
a better name than this

235
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:48,059
if he's still around.

236
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:51,338
You'll do it, then.

237
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,139
I'll call it Sprite.

238
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:59,418
It's a male tortoise.
Why do you name it Sprite?

239
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:01,018
Because it's beautiful.

240
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,578
Beautiful doesn't bound
to either gender.

241
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:03,538
If you're beautiful,

242
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:04,619
I'll call you a sprite too.

243
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,338
How could you compare me
with a tortoise?

244
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:09,538
All living beings are equal.

245
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:11,379
If you're this is not fair,

246
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:12,619
you can call me fairy.

247
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:13,578
Try it.

248
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:14,939
Fairy.

249
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:28,299
Gosh, you got me.

250
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:30,978
Good boy. You're so obedient.

251
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:32,379
Time to go to work.

252
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:34,299
Fairy is going to work.

253
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:38,578
I'll clean this.

254
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:40,059
Thank you.

255
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:42,739
Yang Hua, you'll definitely

256
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:43,859
be a perfect husband.

257
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:44,739
As for the wedding arrangement,

258
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:45,499
I'll leave it to you.

259
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:46,778
I'm sure

260
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:47,898
you'll accomplish it perfectly.

261
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:49,018
I have no worries if you handle it.

262
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,418
Cheer up.

263
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,939
You got this. Bye-bye.

264
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:02,299
God of Wealth and Sprite.

265
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:04,939
Quite a good match though.

266
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:23,699
Shi.

267
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:25,018
The head of
the Food and Beverage Department

268
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,098
of Yuehua Hotel has informed me

269
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,499
that it's full on weekends.

270
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:29,458
But, Fridays are still open
for reservation.

271
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:30,499
Pick one.

272
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:31,499
Fridays are all available.

273
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:32,978
I'm not in charge of this.

274
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:33,778
You should ask Yang Hua.

275
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:47,499
Remind me again the dates.

276
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:50,739
1st, 8th and 15th.

277
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:51,090
(Cheng & Hui Law Firm Bestowed)
Pick one.

278
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:51,680
(Cheng & Hui Law Firm Bestowed)

279
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,658
1st, 8th and 15th.

280
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,179
The 8th is the day of blue chips.

281
00:14:09,978 --> 00:14:11,259
The price-earning ratio is suitable for

282
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:12,939
new energy sources exploitation.

283
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:15,578
Let's take the 8th.

284
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:16,699
It's pretty good.

285
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:18,658
Okay, let's take the 8th.

286
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,700
(Available dates of the month)

287
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,619
What are you doing today?

288
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:23,578
You better come

289
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:24,978
to check on the venue and food tasting.

290
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:26,018
Food tasting?

291
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:32,578
There are three tiers

292
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:33,778
for the wedding ceremony package,

293
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:35,018
6,999 yuan,

294
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:35,978
8,999 yuan,

295
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,699
and also 12,999 yuan.

296
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:38,898
The package we're trying now

297
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:39,699
costs 12,999 yuan

298
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:40,299
as you can see now.

299
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,338
Don't worry about the price.

300
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,379
They gave us a bargain.

301
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:48,218
The price has 30 per cent off.

302
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:53,939
Can I get a better bargain?

303
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:08,658
Madam.

304
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:10,458
The hotel provides

305
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,379
three kinds of ballrooms.

306
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:13,819
As for the small ballroom,
it accommodates

307
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:15,139
around 150 people.

308
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:16,139
The medium-sized room

309
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:17,179
accommodates around 300 people

310
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:17,939
and the big ballroom

311
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:19,018
accommodates 500 and above.

312
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:21,098
Sir,

313
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,259
please look out the outdoor facilities.

314
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:24,098
They provide lawn and terrace,

315
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,499
besides, we can set up camps
outside here.

316
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,739
This is suitable for

317
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:27,538
an outdoor wedding too.

318
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:28,179
That's right.

319
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:28,739
The environment is pretty good.

320
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:29,658
It looks good overall.

321
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:31,778
Yes. Most importantly,

322
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,018
it depends on your choice.

323
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:35,699
We can go in and take a look.

324
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:36,778
Inside here,

325
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:37,978
it's well-furnished.

326
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,179
You can have a look too.

327
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,299
I came across the merger cases

328
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:43,458
you were in charge of last year.

329
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:44,859
And I found that you applied

330
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:46,338
Article 51 of Mergers and
Acquisition Laws of Canadian Companis

331
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:48,059
instead of Article 47,
which people normally use it.

332
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:49,978
Why would you choose Article 51?

333
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:51,139
What were you thinking?

334
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,259
Can you please tell me?

335
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:52,578
Miss Qin.

336
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:54,538
This happened a long time ago.

337
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:55,379
I couldn't recall it.

338
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,538
I'll tell you once I could.

339
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:57,379
Is that fine? Okay.

340
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:58,739
Come on, let's begin.

341
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:07,098
Hello.

342
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:08,978
Isn't that your man

343
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:10,418
too ungenerous?

344
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:12,819
The wedding ceremony package
with 30 per cent off

345
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:14,739
includes all beverages and no service fares.

346
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,578
Yet he still chose the cheapest one.

347
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:18,259
Besides, I told me no killings.

348
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,778
He doesn't want fish and shrimp

349
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:20,939
and all sorts of seafood,

350
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:22,139
instead, a full vegetarian meal
will be fine.

351
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:23,018
Oh gosh.

352
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:24,499
Have you eaten
a full vegetarian wedding meal?

353
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:26,379
(His parents don't seem to be petty people.)

354
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:27,699
(Why is he so ungenerous?)

355
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:29,218
(Not only that,)

356
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,499
(he chose a small ballroom)

357
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,978
as there won't be many guests.

358
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,299
Plus, he doesn't need
a wedding planning company,

359
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:34,338
wedding emcee, makeup artist,
photographer and cameraman.

360
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:35,538
He really makes me baffled.

361
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:36,939
He doesn't need a bridal car.

362
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:37,458
What the heck?

363
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:38,699
Does he want you to drive
to the wedding ceremony?

364
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:39,859
I've told him

365
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:41,739
that wedding only happens once in a lifetime,

366
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:43,299
so, don't do anything

367
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,499
that will make him regret it

368
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,259
and feel bad.

369
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,059
Do you know what he said?

370
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:48,259
The wedding is merely a ceremony

371
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:49,699
announcing that the couple

372
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:50,859
has formed a marital relationship

373
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:51,898
to their friends and relatives.

374
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:54,018
A lavish wedding doesn't represent

375
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,098
a happy marriage.

376
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:56,379
Likewise, the hardness of a diamond
doesn't represent

377
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:57,418
the hardness of love.

378
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,458
A pompous wedding is merely a feint.

379
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:00,699
It's not necessary to spend much

380
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:01,699
on such events.

381
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:04,058
Pray tell.

382
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:04,938
Have you ever seen anyone

383
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:06,419
having such comments on his own wedding?

384
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,098
(Does he thinks of himself high and pure)

385
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:09,659
(and others are vain and hypocritical?)

386
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:13,178
Meimei, regarding the wedding arrangement,

387
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,178
I'll listen to Yang Hua.

388
00:17:14,938 --> 00:17:16,419
After all, you provide the ingredient
for the food.

389
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,019
Please do us a favour
and charge us the cost price.

390
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:20,739
Wait, Qin Shi.

391
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,818
Are you in your right mind?

392
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:22,779
Did he brainwash you?

393
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:23,818
This is the event

394
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:24,659
where men should contribute financially,

395
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:25,698
why do you help him to save money?

396
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:28,098
Because both of us are married.

397
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:30,298
Money is the marital property,
alright?

398
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:31,499
His money is mine as well.

399
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:32,978
Don't need to come to me

400
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:33,978
regarding the wedding.

401
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:35,779
Yang Hua will decide on it.

402
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:37,899
Fine.

403
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,218
Since that's your choice,

404
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:41,619
I'll give you some advice

405
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:42,458
as a married woman

406
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:43,419
who has experienced it before.

407
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,139
If you insist on this,

408
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,019
you'll regret it.

409
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:47,058
(The moment will definitely arrive)

410
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:48,139
(and prove you wrong.)

411
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:50,539
Hey.

412
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,098
Hey.

413
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,298
(Two weeks before the wedding)
Isn't this roll too much?

414
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:04,458
(Two weeks before the wedding)

415
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:04,739
(Two weeks before the wedding)
This is...

416
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,419
-Don't touch me.
-How's it?

417
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:07,218
Is the shooting started already?

418
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:07,698
Wenbin.

419
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:08,859
Not yet. They're getting changed.

420
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:09,818
Still changing clothes?

421
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:11,619
It seems they're serious about this.

422
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:13,058
Don't touch me.

423
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:18,139
Wow, he's so handsome.

424
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:20,218
Gorgeous.

425
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:37,818
Wow, Qin Shi.

426
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:38,859
I was right.

427
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:39,379
Didn't I tell you

428
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:40,739
you look beautiful in the wedding gown?

429
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:42,739
Honey, look.

430
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:44,859
She's like a heavenly fairy.

431
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,098
Qin Shi, this wedding gown

432
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,458
is gorgeous, isn't it?

433
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,779
As the saying goes,

434
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:51,619
clothes make the man.

435
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:52,938
Cut that out.

436
00:18:57,938 --> 00:18:58,978
I almost can't recognise you

437
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,619
after getting dolled up.

438
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,539
Are you still the little girl

439
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,178
who followed me

440
00:19:05,698 --> 00:19:06,499
and wanted to be my daughter

441
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,218
instead of my little sister?

442
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,019
And you're getting married now.

443
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:16,259
I'm truly missing you.

444
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:33,298
Yang Hua.

445
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:35,259
I'm not the person who holds her hand

446
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:37,379
walking down the aisle at the wedding,

447
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:39,698
so, I'd like

448
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:41,539
to say something to you.

449
00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:44,859
The lady beside you

450
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:46,578
is my sister

451
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:48,818
and my dearest family.

452
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:51,139
I witnessed the process

453
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:52,938
of her birth and growing up

454
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,619
and I accompanied her through

455
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:58,779
every pivotal moment in her life.

456
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,098
Now that she's going

457
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:01,978
to be your wife

458
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:05,379
who will go through thick and thin
with you

459
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:06,619
for the rest of her life.

460
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:11,458
Therefore, in the later days,

461
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:13,619
I hope you can

462
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:15,578
respect her,

463
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,178
love her,

464
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:19,818
protect her

465
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,578
and never abandon her.

466
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,218
Treat her as your loved one,

467
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,938
a good teacher
as well as a faithful friend.

468
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:26,818
Can you give me your word?

469
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:32,539
Wenbin.

470
00:20:38,818 --> 00:20:40,098
I don't think I'm capable of this.

471
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,659
What did you just say, Yang Hua?

472
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,698
We've treated you politely,

473
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:49,739
yet you didn't.

474
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,139
Do you think it's settled

475
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:52,019
after you registered marriage?

476
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:52,899
Qin Shi.

477
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:54,178
Your brothers are outstanding men.

478
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:55,379
Why did you find a man like this?

479
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:01,458
What I meant

480
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:03,698
is that I'm incapable of

481
00:21:03,818 --> 00:21:04,578
protecting Qin Shi.

482
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,859
Because she's more excellent than me.

483
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:10,058
She's the smartest
and most excellent lady

484
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:12,938
I've ever seen.

485
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:15,539
She's the most responsible
and brave person.

486
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:19,178
I can only be her faithful friend,

487
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,779
but she's a good teacher to me.

488
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,019
It's my pleasure

489
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:27,978
to go through thick and thin with her

490
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,899
and be her partner.

491
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:43,818
You didn't drink though.
How come you're so eloquent?

492
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:45,818
I don't need to drink
when I'm speaking my true thoughts.

493
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:51,978
Well.

494
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,539
I'll go and try more gowns.

495
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,379
I go with you.

496
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:00,379
Let's go.

497
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:02,659
Follow me.

498
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,419
I do. I'm behind you.

499
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,499
They're coming.

500
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:06,938
I need healing.

501
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:07,698
I did.

502
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,419
Shi.

503
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:10,539
Are you done?

504
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:12,619
Shi.

505
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:14,739
Do you need help, Shi?

506
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:15,859
Why is she dilly-dally?

507
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:16,779
Qin Shi.

508
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:18,178
Do you need my help?

509
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:20,139
Can you finish this round first?

510
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:20,739
Shi.

511
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:21,659
I'm playing.

512
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:23,178
Do you need help?

513
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:24,578
Yang Hua.

514
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,539
What a slowpoke.

515
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:29,058
Oh my.

516
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:29,818
Qin Shi.

517
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:30,938
Yang Hua.

518
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,098
They didn't use this.

519
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:37,259
Where's she?

520
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,810
♪I've gone through heartbreak,
I've seen hope♪

521
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,670
♪I have to keep going to keep growing♪

522
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,460
♪Getting lost in love,
the power of love♪

523
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,330
♪The feelings of love♪

524
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,420
♪Choosing to forget, choosing to stare♪

525
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:04,659
Got it, alright.

526
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,058
Is is inappropriate

527
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:07,899
to leave like this?

528
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:09,578
What do we do then?

529
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:10,739
As you could see,

530
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:12,178
Meimei has taken so many gowns.

531
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,338
I'm running out of time.

532
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:14,419
Besides,

533
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:15,739
didn't you refuse to come
to the photo shooting?

534
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:16,859
I think

535
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:18,058
they won't let it slide easily.

536
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,019
If we leave now,

537
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,659
there'll be more requests awaiting us.

538
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,019
Besides, you look gorgeous.

539
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:23,499
It's a waste if you don't take a photo.

540
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,139
Really?

541
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:28,818
Are you going back now?

542
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:33,019
They will give us an earful.

543
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:37,818
Come with me.

544
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:41,978
Make a smile.

545
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:48,259
Good.

546
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,259
Mission accomplished.

547
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:51,259
Let's leave.

548
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:53,218
Is your work going well lately?

549
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:54,539
Not bad.

550
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:55,379
I have a meeting later.

551
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,098
Can I drop you by the entrance
of the subway station?

552
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:58,779
If you need help,

553
00:23:58,938 --> 00:23:59,539
feel free to ask me.

554
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:01,739
What do you think you can do?

555
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:03,499
Qin Shi

556
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,019
is as stubborn as a mule.

557
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:07,779
If needed,

558
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:09,178
expose her

559
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,139
without showing her mercy.

560
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:13,779
She never appears weak before others.

561
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:15,298
I'm worried

562
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,578
that she takes everything to herself

563
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:20,938
until she couldn't get around.

564
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,019
At least I can help
give you some suggestions.

565
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,058
You just can't stay

566
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:26,298
in the reference room the whole time.

567
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,058
Why do you...

568
00:24:29,698 --> 00:24:31,978
Basically, if there's a reshuffle

569
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:33,419
of firm partners,

570
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,659
the amendment will be updated
on the website immediately.

571
00:24:35,178 --> 00:24:35,899
I didn't see your name.

572
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:36,938
Well, stop it.

573
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:38,659
First of all, I'd like to thank you

574
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,098
for pervasive concern.

575
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:41,458
I admit that you're smart.

576
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:42,139
I might even say

577
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:43,659
that you're a well-versed genius.

578
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:45,058
Do you study law before?

579
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:46,379
Do you how a lawyer works?

580
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:47,619
If not,

581
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,419
what makes you think

582
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:49,259
you can command on

583
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:50,539
what I should do or shouldn't do?

584
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,499
I just hope

585
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:52,419
that you can achieve your goal

586
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:53,578
as soon as possible.

587
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:55,019
Mr. Yang Hua.

588
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:57,499
I admit

589
00:24:57,938 --> 00:24:59,698
that my family has posed many requests
towards the wedding.

590
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:01,739
And I'm trying the downsize them.

591
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:02,578
Believe me.

592
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:04,539
You're not the only one
who wants to end this quickly,

593
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:05,338
so am I.

594
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:06,178
Miss Qin.

595
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:07,499
There are times

596
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:09,259
when one doesn't have to
accomplish things alone.

597
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:10,739
Asking for help
is considered an ability too.

598
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,419
Thank you for telling me this.

599
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:14,218
Afterwards,

600
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,098
I'll tell you if I need help.

601
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:16,938
Alright? Are you satisfied?

602
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:19,419
Where are you going?

603
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:20,338
Subway station.

604
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:37,739
Miss Qin.

605
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:38,698
Hey.

606
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,499
Please get me the file case

607
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:41,419
regarding the embezzlement

608
00:25:41,578 --> 00:25:42,499
dated last March.

609
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:43,779
The defendant in the case
is Lai Zhenxing.

610
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:44,458
Thank you.

611
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:46,818
Yes, I'm listening.

612
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,019
Miss Qin.

613
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:48,619
Miss...

614
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:50,259
How's it?

615
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:51,419
Do you have time now?

616
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:05,859
Mr. Chen.

617
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:07,578
The regular meeting this afternoon

618
00:26:07,578 --> 00:26:09,139
remains at 2 p.m., right?

619
00:26:09,578 --> 00:26:11,298
(Case study sessions have been
changed to virtual sessions.)

620
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,218
(Don't you know about that?)

621
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,338
How's that person doing?

622
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:17,499
Do you mean her?

623
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:19,458
Still managing the case files.

624
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:21,578
Doesn't she have a case yet?

625
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:30,458
It seems you're happy to see this.

626
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,379
Of course, I'm happy.

627
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:33,938
Do you know what that's called?

628
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:35,739
No evil deed goes unpunished.

629
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:37,978
What goes around comes around.

630
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:40,178
Hello, Mr. Hu.

631
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:43,259
Hello, I'm Qin.

632
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,338
I've been transferred
to the corporation department

633
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,178
in the firm.

634
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:47,338
Feel free to contact me

635
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:48,458
if you need legal services.

636
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:52,978
Mr. Shi.

637
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:55,539
Hello, I'm Attorney Qin.

638
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,050
(One week before the wedding)

639
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:25,698
Sure.

640
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,978
I'll get back to you

641
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:29,698
- in ten minutes.
- Shi.

642
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:31,978
- Shi.
- Sure.

643
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,259
Why did you disappear

644
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:34,739
in the blink of an eye?

645
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:36,859
- Shi.
- Yes.

646
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:38,379
Do you prefer a wool blanket

647
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:40,139
or a duvet?

648
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:41,539
I'm fine with either one.

649
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:44,419
I'm preparing for your dowry.

650
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:45,779
- Alright?
- Yes.

651
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,779
Look at this wool blanket.

652
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:48,659
It's made in Australia.

653
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,619
Mum, I need to reply to work messages.

654
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:51,978
Do you think you're the only one

655
00:27:51,978 --> 00:27:53,458
who works in this world?

656
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,218
Give me your phone.

657
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:56,338
You ran away
during the wedding photo shooting.

658
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:57,899
You're so uncooperative

659
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,298
when we're preparing the dowry now.

660
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:00,338
It's a work phone.

661
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:00,899
It's important.

662
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:02,899
- Mom.
- No.

663
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:03,938
Stay focused.

664
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:08,419
I think this blanket is pretty good.

665
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:09,539
It's soft.

666
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:11,139
Right? I like this.

667
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:11,619
Yes.

668
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,458
Look at the pattern.

669
00:28:13,218 --> 00:28:13,938
Mom, this is a very important call.

670
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:15,218
I mean it.

671
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:16,779
Buy anything you like.

672
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:18,739
I need to go now. I'm busy.

673
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,539
I really need to go now.

674
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:20,859
- Love you.
- Off you go.

675
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:21,818
Off you go.

676
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:22,818
I love you.

677
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:24,779
Enough. Leave now.

678
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,218
This is the document you requested.

679
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,298
Okay.

680
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,659
Why is it you?

681
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:40,139
I'm in charge of the reference room now.

682
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:43,859
I heard that you graduated
from Hua Zheng too.

683
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,899
So, you're my senior.

684
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:48,659
I was promoted to the 11th floor
not long ago.

685
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,259
Please look out for me

686
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:52,499
and guide me.

687
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,298
There's a case study session

688
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,698
at 2 p.m.

689
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:56,938
Do you want to join us?

690
00:28:56,938 --> 00:28:58,499
Sure, I have time.

691
00:28:58,499 --> 00:28:59,098
Good.

692
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:01,779
This is the material for the case.

693
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:03,578
- Go through the material first.
- Sure.

694
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:23,259
I've finished reading the material.

695
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:24,218
I think this case...

696
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:24,698
Who wants coffee?

697
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:25,539
Black for me.

698
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:26,499
I'll drink tea.

699
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:27,458
The usual one.

700
00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:29,779
Espresso, double shots.

701
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:33,218
A glass of water, thank you.

702
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,379
I...I'll go buy it.

703
00:29:36,218 --> 00:29:37,298
Thank you.

704
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:39,899
Cream cakes from Ruby Bakery.

705
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,259
Does anyone want it?

706
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,499
I don't like cream.

707
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:45,218
I prefer Affairs's chocolate.

708
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,178
Sounds regal.

709
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:47,779
What about you, Madam Tang?

710
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,019
I don't like sweet treats.

711
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:51,779
If there are
baked stuffed sesame biscuits,

712
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,019
I'd like to have one.

713
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:53,859
Mr. Tao.

714
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,058
No, thanks.

715
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,899
Alright, two pieces of cream cake,

716
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:58,978
one piece of chocolate

717
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:00,619
and two pieces of
baked stuffed sesame biscuits.

718
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,218
- Sure.
- Thank you.

719
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:10,259
I asked you to think out of the box
just now.

720
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:11,899
I think it's a bit long-winded.

721
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:14,499
Miss Qin.

722
00:30:14,818 --> 00:30:16,938
What do you think about this case?

723
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:19,499
What do I think about this?

724
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,698
What can I say?

725
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:23,818
All of them make orders.

726
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:25,058
Some of the stores
don't provide delivery service

727
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,259
and I had to run an errand.

728
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:27,298
Well, I went out to buy it.

729
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:28,218
But, the session almost ended

730
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:29,539
after I returned.

731
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:30,938
Yet

732
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:32,578
they still pretended

733
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:33,379
and asked me

734
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,619
what's my opinion on the case.

735
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:35,899
What could I say?

736
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:37,338
My only opinion is

737
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,578
americano is the combination of espresso
and water.

738
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:41,779
But why espresso is more expensive?

739
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:49,338
Are you done?

740
00:30:52,578 --> 00:30:53,379
I'm not done yet.

741
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,098
I can go for another round
after finishing this glass of water.

742
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:57,578
Will you attend the meeting again

743
00:30:57,698 --> 00:30:58,259
if you're asked to?

744
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:00,698
Of course, I'll go.

745
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:02,539
The weekly case study sessions

746
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,419
are essence and real stuff.

747
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:05,178
Why not?

748
00:31:05,978 --> 00:31:06,379
Do you know

749
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:07,139
what your problem is?

750
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:08,058
My problem?

751
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:10,938
If there are,

752
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:11,739
my problem will be

753
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:13,338
having a thin skin,

754
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:14,779
being too courteous and I'm a pushover.

755
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:16,019
I'm naive to believe that fellowship

756
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:17,019
does exist.

757
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:20,259
That's not true.

758
00:31:23,338 --> 00:31:24,098
Tell me, then.

759
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:24,899
What my problem is?

760
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:27,379
In my opinion,

761
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,178
since this is your concerns

762
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:30,058
and I know nothing about laws,

763
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:32,218
I can't give you any constructive ideas.

764
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:33,659
I'm tired already.

765
00:31:42,698 --> 00:31:43,619
Petty man.

766
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:45,938
He actually holds a grudge.

767
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:47,578
Oh, geez.

768
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:49,338
You don't understand anything, anyway.

769
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:52,019
Yuck! Sod you, Yang Hua.

770
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:00,578
Say that again?

771
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:01,539
What did you say?

772
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:03,098
He's going to get married.

773
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:04,779
He has repeated it three times.

774
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:05,739
Look at you.

775
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:06,578
I've told you

776
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:08,259
to take more ginkgo nuts.

777
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:09,458
Zhou.

778
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:11,338
You're so mean.

779
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:12,178
- Enough.
- It seems

780
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:13,338
you're not fully recovered
from the last treatment.

781
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:15,818
Yang, congratulations.

782
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,338
What does your wife do for a living?

783
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:19,218
My wife is a lawyer.

784
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,298
That's good.

785
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:22,539
I tell you what,

786
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:23,338
a lawyer is a fine job.

787
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:25,779
Many people are involved
in court cases now.

788
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,338
Being a lawyer is a lucrative job.

789
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:29,419
She's pretty as well.

790
00:32:30,218 --> 00:32:31,259
My son jumped ship to another company.

791
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:31,938
Do you know that?

792
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:34,058
His previous boss

793
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,978
has gone broke because of Luowei.

794
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,779
Now that he found a new job

795
00:32:40,978 --> 00:32:41,938
under an influential boss,

796
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:42,938
Hu Ping.

797
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:44,458
Hu Ping?

798
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:45,739
Do you know him?

799
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:47,619
That's great.

800
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:51,259
My son got an exclusive

801
00:32:52,218 --> 00:32:53,298
widely-known intel

802
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,058
from Mr. Hu.

803
00:32:56,178 --> 00:32:56,938
Are you curious about it?

804
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:00,379
Boring.

805
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:02,659
You're a fine guy

806
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:04,739
but you're a spoilsport.

807
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:06,419
Forget it.

808
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:09,379
Do you know about
New Energy Smart City?

809
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:11,058
I offer you a stock.

810
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,978
You can try to study it.

811
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:16,058
Don't tell anyone.

812
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:16,818
It's just between us.

813
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:18,619
Let's guess when the price soars.

814
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:19,338
Are you interested in this?

815
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:20,739
No.

816
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:25,259
Did you hear about that?

817
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:28,098
Miss Qin is having a hard time recently.

818
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,779
As expected, lawyers
from the corporation department are evils.

819
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:34,259
Hopefully, Miss Qin can
take it in her stride.

820
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:38,098
What goes around comes around.

821
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:42,338
Why did you roll your eyes at me?

822
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:44,659
She used to torture you a lot.

823
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:45,539
That's right.

824
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:48,298
Fine, everything you said is right.

825
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:51,739
- Here we are.
- Let's go.

826
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:06,818
Buy two flight tickets
to Jilin.

827
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,219
Is it the court case

828
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:08,699
of the mining case?

829
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:09,098
Yes.

830
00:34:09,939 --> 00:34:10,619
Can I tag along?

831
00:34:10,778 --> 00:34:11,459
I've studied this case.

832
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:12,298
- You?
- Yes.

833
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:13,538
I've read through all the documents.

834
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,179
Can you drink?

835
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:15,459
Drink?

836
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:16,778
Two jin of Chinese liquor.

837
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,379
That's out of my depth.

838
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:19,419
Why do we need to drink
for the court case?

839
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:20,419
How could I take you along

840
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:21,058
for the lawsuits in Northeast

841
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,258
when you can't drink?

842
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:22,738
What do you think

843
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:23,738
why I take Shen with me?

844
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:25,179
By the way, do you know

845
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:26,578
the sole recruiting requirement

846
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:28,139
of the northeast branch

847
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:29,699
depends on the drinking capacity?

848
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,258
Got it now?

849
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:30,818
I...

850
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:32,578
Oh, right.

851
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,459
Help me send the contract by today.

852
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:36,498
Don't forget to buy first-class tickets.

853
00:34:40,098 --> 00:34:40,578
Alright.

854
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:50,459
What are you doing?

855
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:54,778
What's with you?

856
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:57,139
Does it concern you?

857
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,298
You act tough before me.

858
00:34:59,818 --> 00:35:01,018
Why did you behave weakly
in front of others?

859
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:02,778
You want a case, right?

860
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:04,459
I have cases. Do you want?

861
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:06,419
Do you mean it?

862
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:07,338
Yes.

863
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:08,778
On what condition?

864
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:10,219
On your knees and beg.

865
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:12,659
Are you in your right mind?

866
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:13,219
Tao Junhui.

867
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,738
I won't show myself up

868
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:15,538
just for the case.

869
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:17,699
Are you proud of what you did just now?

870
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:19,578
You're a lawyer.

871
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:21,459
Yet you run errands like buying coffee,

872
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:22,859
flight tickets and cakes.

873
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:25,459
Have you done any decent job?

874
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:27,619
Look at

875
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:28,578
how servile you are.

876
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:30,379
Don't you think you're like a dog?

877
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:32,018
Mind your mouth.

878
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:36,578
That's right. This is how you should be.

879
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:39,098
Since you can say no to me,

880
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:40,619
you can say no to them too.

881
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:41,899
Do you think

882
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:42,939
I'm willing to please others

883
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:43,939
and curry favour with them

884
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,738
just to get a case?

885
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:47,979
No one forces you to do that.

886
00:35:48,338 --> 00:35:49,538
It was you who bow down

887
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:50,098
to others.

888
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:51,738
You can't even protect your own rights,

889
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,498
how are you going to protect others'?

890
00:35:53,738 --> 00:35:54,939
Are you fit to be a lawyer?

891
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:09,979
I'll drink tea.

892
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:11,939
A glass of water, thank you.

893
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:14,939
No, thanks.

894
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:16,619
In my opinion,

895
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:17,459
after reading the case,

896
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:18,419
I think the point...

897
00:36:19,098 --> 00:36:19,619
point...

898
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:25,219
I...I'll go buy it.

899
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:29,979

900

901

00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:03,379
You flattered me.

957
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:04,459
Let's go.

958
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:19,578
The coffee smells lovely.

959
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:20,498
Good.

960
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:21,859
It's cappuccino.

961
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:25,619
Slow down.

Geez, you should hold on tight.

966
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:34,379
I wanted to.

967
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:36,419

( Cheng & Hui Law Firm

971
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:04,818
I've missed several sessions

972
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:06,899
because of the business trip.

973
00:42:08,379 --> 00:42:09,899

Hold on.

It was a busy morning

976
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:14,098
and I haven't taken any food yet.

977
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:16,459
There's a new hamburger store
downstairs.

978
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:17,459
I heard that they offer good set meals.

979
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:18,738
Who hasn't taken lunch yet?

980
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:20,179
I must try it then.

981
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:21,098
Coffee, please.

982
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,018
No, thanks.

983
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:23,419
Thanks, but I don't need that.

984

I haven't eaten yet too.

988
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:31,498
Then, I'll have one set.

990
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,338

991
00:42:40,098 --> 00:42:40,778
Make the order now.

992
00:42:40,939 --> 00:42:42,139
I heard
that they're selling like hotcakes.

993
