Wenbin.

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,920
Let me ask you a question.

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,360
Give me an honest answer.

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,960
What is it?

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,760
You're going to question me?

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,040
Never mind then.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,880
Shi.

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,360
You're getting more and more

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
short-tempered.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,800
Alright, okay.

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Ask away.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,800
I'll answer you honestly.

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Do you love your wife?

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
About that question...

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,760
Zhao Qing and I do have feelings

34
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,240
for each other.

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,160
I agree with what you said before.

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,120
Marriage is only the beginning.

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,400
It's a contract.

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,720
But it cannot guarantee
the quality of emotions,

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
or how long it will last.

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,560
Put it this way.

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Between Zhao Qing and I,

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,240
it's not so much about love.

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,200
It's more about a connection.

44
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,960
To me,

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
it's more a responsibility.

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,960
Then,

47
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,960
are you happy?

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,960
Happiness is subjective.

49
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,760
Every person has their own standards

50
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,960
on the matter.

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,840
But for me personally,

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,920
with my standards,

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,600
I'm content.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,400
You're back.

55
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,200
Did it go well?

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,960
Yes.

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,040
What about you?

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,360
There's a case to be made.

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,760
I have a question for you.

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,680
Do you like me?

61
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,840
I've been thinking

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,000
about it for a whole day.

63
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,200
I think getting married

64
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,200
is much more beneficial

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,280
to me than to you.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,360
You're a pure-hearted loner

67
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,600
who wants to stay single forever.

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Why do you want to marry me?

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
There are benefits.

70
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,040
There are three reasons

71
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,440
why I wish to marry you.

72
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,920
Firstly,

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,520
I haven't done a great job managing my family.

74
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,640
Especially my mom,

75
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,040
she caused you

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,320
quite a lot of trouble in your work.

77
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,640
So I'd like

78
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
to make up for that mistake.

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,560
Reason accepted. Secondly?

80
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,960
Secondly,

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,000
marrying you,

82
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,400
my mom will finally get rid

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,960
of her whimsical fantasies.

84
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,320
Plus, you're currently the only woman

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,840
who can suppress my mom.

86
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,200
Thanks. Thirdly?

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
Thirdly,

88
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,920
God of Wealth and I

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,920
quite like this house.

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
We prefer not to move again.

91
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,480
So it's definitely

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,320
not because you like me.

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,280
Definitely not.

94
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,000
Verbal agreement is not legally binding.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,560
I'll put it down on paper.

96
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,560
(Marriage Agreement)

97
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,160
(Marriage Agreement)
This agreement

98
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,040
details the conditions
for the three-year marriage.

99
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,960
Three years should be enough

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,160
for you to finish what you have to do, right?

101
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,880
This is quite comprehensive. Good.

102
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,760
For the three years, I will continue

103
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,360
to pay the rent.

104
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,680
Here's another agreement.

105
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,360
It's a prenuptial agreement.

106
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,120
It details our assets

107
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
before and after marriage.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
It is to ensure that there won't be

109
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,200
any financial disputes after the contract ends.

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,760
You should be very familiar with it.

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,920
No problem. Leave it to me.

112
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,560
Also,

113
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,200
regarding the marriage.

114
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,160
I'd like to keep it as simple as possible.

115
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,480
Minimize expenditure.

116
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
It's best if we could skip the wedding ceremony.

117
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,280
What do you say?

118
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,840
I can't agree more.

119
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,120
I've checked online.

120
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
We only need our household register

121
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,160
and identity cards

122
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,440
to get registered at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

123
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,040
My household register is with my mom.

124
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,800
But it shouldn't be a problem to get it.

125
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,480
What about you?

126
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,800
My mom will most likely

127
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,840
be watching the booklet

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,800
like a hawk.

129
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,000
But I think it's doable.

130
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,200
It's settled then. Let's get it done.

131
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,960
Let's get it done.

132
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,840
Wait.

133
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,440

Ever since young,

the one thing

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,640
my mom has been telling me is,

169
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,880
she's always envied you.

170
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,440
Because you're always shining

171
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
in everything you do.

172
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,920
You're beautiful

173
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,560
and smart.

174
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
Sometimes,

175
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,240
she felt embarrassed to be known

176
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,560
as your little sister.

177
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,000
But, you never became snobbish

178
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,920
because of your greatness.

179
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,120
On the contrary, you always think

180
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,280
you're not doing enough.

181
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,440
In my mother's eyes,

182
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,480
you're beyond amazing.

183
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,320
Your mother is too kind.

184
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm not as great as she made me out to be.

185
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,120
I trust in her judgment of character.

186
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,320
As well as mine.

187
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,360
Aunt.

188
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,880
Over the years,

189
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,920
you've been living for other people.

190
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,080
But now,

191
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,520
you finally have the chance

192
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,400
to do something you would

193
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,920
never have dared try before.

194
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,920
In my mind,

195
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,560
your choice

196
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,240
is more important than what others think.

197
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,760
It's okay even if it's difficult.

198
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I'll be here with you.

199
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,960
-It's alright.
-What a good girl.

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,040
It's alright.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,480
It's almost time.

202
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
The meeting is about to begin.

203
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,600
How confident are you?

204
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,000
50-50.

205
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,040
Most of Yulan Group's

206
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
board of directors

207
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,760
won't be too hard to deal with.

208
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,880
The hardest person

209
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,920
would probably be Ms. Lan's eldest brother,

210
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,680
Lan Youguo.

211
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,200
Lan Youguo.

212
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,440
Forced out into the wild,

213
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,400
he lived as a recluse for decades.

214
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,920
His greed is like the weed.

215
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,240
It will grow out of control

216
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,560
with the smallest chance it gets.

217
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,600
About that,

218
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,000
you have the right to voice out.

219
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,320
Dealing with those old foxes,

220
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,920
I hope Ms. Lan

221
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,520
can hang in there.

222
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
As for who becomes the CEO,

223
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,760
it's important of course.

224
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,520
But, ma'am.

225
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,920
You need to explain the incident between you

226
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,840
and Luowei Yulan.

227
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,000
Our company

228
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,000
has been suspended for some time.

229
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,520
We have to answer
to the Securities Regulatory Commission.

230
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,800
I heard President

231
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,760
has to bear a few billions in debt.

232
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,720
Is that true?

233
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,400
How do you plan to handle the matter?

234
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,440
Are you going

235
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
to force Yulan Group to go under?

236
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,040
Right.

237
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,240
I don't think that's important.

238
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,440
What matters is,

239
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,040
a kingdom cannot be without a ruler.

240
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,560
Our company needs

241
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,720
a person who can walk the talk.

242
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,600
What do you think, Mr. Lan?

243
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,880
Quiet down, everyone.

244
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,920
Hear me out. Let me speak.

245
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,280
I know.

246
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,640
None of you is happy

247
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
to see me in this seat.

248
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,120
You doubt

249
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,960
I can manage Yulan Group well.

250
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,160
But I'd like to remind you all

251
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,320
that I care more

252
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,880
about Yulan than anyone of you.

253
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,560
To me, it's not just a business,

254
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,840
or a bargaining chip.

255
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,760
In my life,

256
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,800
it contains

257
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,280
my most precious and beautiful memories.

258
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,240
I agree with what Mr. Zhong said.

259
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,960
The priority right now

260
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,040
is to determine

261
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,400
the new candidate for president.

262
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
So, I'm going to exercise my right

263
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,000
to appoint

264
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,200
and fire personnel as the president.

265
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,360
Starting from today,

266
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,440
the new CEO

267
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,240
of Yulan Group will be...

268
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,680
Ms. Zhao Danping.

269
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,600
What?

270
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,000
-What?
-What?

271
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,400
Zhao Danping?

272
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
This is nonsense.

273
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,760
Is this child's play or what?

274
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,360
Right.

275
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,400
I'm pretty sure

276
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,480
they won't agree

277
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,680
to let Zhao Danping become CEO.

278
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
Although Zhao Danping is part of the Lan family,

279
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,440
she doesn't have the Lan surname.

280
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,080
Lan Youguo's son

281
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,320
is whom they're supporting.

282
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,200
We can only hope that Zhao Danping

283
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,480
can stand her ground.

284
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,720
Because she is the only one

285
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,960
who can help Ms. Lan.

286
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,320
That's right.

287
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,280
The battle has only just begun.

288
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,760
Ms. Qin, Ms. Li.

289
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
What are you girls gossiping about?

290
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,040
Ms. Qin.

291
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,040
I doubt you'd be interested.

292
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:14,840
She's not interested,

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,520
but I am.

294
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,920
In our law firm,

295
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,200
a person who's single

296
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,960
is pretending to be married.

297
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,120
Shocking, huh?

298
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,680
Hui.

299
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Lied to me?

300
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,800
(Li Dai, you cheat.)

301
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,840
(Why did I believe you?)

302
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,160
(I must have lost my mind.)

303
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
It wasn't me.

304
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,680
I'm telling you it wasn't me.

305
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,560
I know it wasn't you.

306
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,440
Listen.

307
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,440
I've been in HR

308
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,360
for over 20 years.

309
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,000
It's really

310
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,840
opened my eyes to the world.

311
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
Before, I only heard about people
hiding their marriage.

312
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
But hiding a divorce?

313
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,760
Now this is a first.

314
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
Divorce?

315
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,840
Yes.

316
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,280
Listen.

317
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,560
Now, if you tell me

318
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,800
that someone who's single

319
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,800
is pretending to be married,

320
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,760
I won't be shocked at all.

321
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,440
In order to get promoted and gain resources,

322
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,800
they stooped to such a low.

323
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,520
Did they really think

324
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,480
such a cheap lie

325
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
would hold up?

326
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,440
Who did they

327
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,120
take me for? An idiot?

328
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,640
Am I that dim-witted?

329
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
Why are you standing so far away?

330
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,680
Get over here.

331
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,720
Hui.

332
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,840
Whatever it is,

333
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
whether it's a punch of slap,

334
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,840
just go ahead and do it.

335
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,200
This is too stressful.

336
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,080
If I knew what to do,

337
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,920
why bother asking you to come?

338
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,240
I called you here

339
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,240
because I want to discuss with you

340
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,720
how to deal with that Steven.

341
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,240
Steven?

342
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,520
Ms. Li.

343
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,240
Seems like your mind

344
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,560
is a little fuzzy

345
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,240
again lately.

346
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm talking about Steven.

347
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,720
That senior lawyer

348
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,800
from the family department.

349
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,760
When you and Ms. Qin

350
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,920
tried so hard to get approval
for training in England,

351
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,480
he just reaped the benefits.

352
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
That Steven.

353
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,600
He's divorced?

354
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,960
How did you know?

355
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
A client's contract

356
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,600
had a bit of a problem.

357
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,160
The lady boss went to the group headquarters.

358
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,200
At last...

359
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,560
Normally, when people saw me,

360
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,840
they'd give me a courteous smile.

361
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This time?

362
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,280
Every one wore a cold expression,

363
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,480
as if they just came out from a freezer.

364
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,640
I only found out when I asked around.

365
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,520
That guy had divorced his wife

366
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,600
half a year ago.

367
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,680
Guess what's the reason?

368
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,640
He cheated. He cheated.

369
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,480
That's right.

370
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,800
Steven's performance is lackluster,

371
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,360
nothing to shout about.

372
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,000
Why was he

373
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,120
able to become a senior lawyer?

374
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,800
It's just because

375
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,160
his wife is the group's vice president.

376
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,520
Well, family background

377
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,920
has always been prioritized

378
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,680
in this law firm, no?

379
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,720
Are you joking?

380
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,000
I can't believe you said that.

381
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,680
If I really prioritized someone's background,

382
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,680
you wouldn't have

383
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,120
been able to get to your position today.

384
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,760
Hui.

385
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,800
Zip it.

386
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,440
I don't want to hear anymore.

387
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,600
That guy

388
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,280
had already divorced

389
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,480
his wife half a year ago.

390
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,160
But he just kept quiet about it.

391
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,080
His recent trip to England

392
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,560
to get training,

393
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,640
all the costs and expenses

394
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,240
were borne by the company.

395
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,760
He even signed an extra five-year contract.

396
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,640
This is an outright scam!

397
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,000
Hui.

398
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,000
No need to get upset

399
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,160
over this sort of person.

400
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,360
How can I not?

401
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,280
Such a person

402
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,160
is an embarrassment to the company.

403
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,120
That directly

404
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,560
affects your good standing.

405
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,200
You should

406
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,560
be banding together against the common enemy.

407
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,520
Band together against the common enemy.

408
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,520
Yes, we should.

409
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,840
How could this happen?

410
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,720
For sure I'll be standing with you.

411
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
So how should we punish him?

412
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,720
It's difficult.

413
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,680
Very difficult.

414
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,040
Why?

415
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,160
Think about it.

416
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
The company

417
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,240
invested 50,000 euros on him.

418
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,880
Before the training,

419
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,560
they signed a five-year contract with him.

420
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,560
If they let him go,

421
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,320
that would be

422
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,240
like giving away

423
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,480
a well-fed goose to another person.

424
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,280
Then just keep him.

425
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,360
Why should I keep him?

426
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,960
I've lost even the most basic of trust

427
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,000
for him.

428
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,040
How could I

429
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,000
feel reassured

430
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,920
to let him handle a case worth millions?

431
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,520
Who knows what else he could be

432
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,320
hiding from me?

433
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,040
Tell me.

434
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,480
Tell me what you'd do if you were me.

435
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,040
I, Tang Yihui,

436
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,600
can accept failure,

437
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,720
but never betrayal.

438
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,560
You're full of weird ideas.

439
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,080
Help me think

440
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,680
of a way to deal with this Steven.

441
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,800
I will make him

442
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,200
suffer more than dying itself.

443
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,840
I'll make him regret

444
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,360
ever lying to me.

445
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,720
Okay.

446
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,040
I'll think about it.

447
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,520
Tell me.

448
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,600
Could there

449
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,480
be more people

450
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,200
in the company who lied?

451
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,160
Is there someone else

452
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,360
who's hiding something

453
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,000
I should know about?

454
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,320
Do you think so?

455
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Say something.

456
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,680
There isn't.

457
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,280
Idiot...

458
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,480
Idiot...

459
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,240
Barely got out alive, huh, Ms. Qin?

460
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,000
So our Ms. Qin actually feels embarrassed

461
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,040
and scared.

462
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,600
If lives were not lost, leniency is possible.

463
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,640
If you turn yourself in,

464
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,080
you can get a lighter sentence, Ms. Qin.

465
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,600
Please turn right at the door for a good laugh.

466
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,320
What is a happy planet?

467
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,720
Childish.

468
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,240
Hello, this is Ms. Qin.

469
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,200
Hi, Ms. Qin.

470
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,440
I have a little favor to ask.

471
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,520
Here's the thing.

472
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,960
I'm sorting through

473
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,080
the HR data.

474
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,480
I noticed that

475
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,360
proof of marital status

476
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,440
is missing from your data.

477
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,280
Please submit it to me

478
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,720
at the soonest.

479
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,520
I didn't know the company

480
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,600
required documentation

481
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,480
like proof of marriage.

482
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,120
Yes, true.

483
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,480
Usually,

484
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,440
it's not mandatory.

485
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,640
But recently, our law firm

486
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,240
has seen some shenanigans.

487
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,360
Right?

488
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,840
I'm sure you know about Steven.

489
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:27,880
So,

490
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,080
Madam Tang specifically called me over

491
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,120
to sort this out.

492
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,280
The profile

493
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
of every personnel at the law firm

494
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,080
has to be completed and checked.

495
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,600
So,

496
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,480
can you submit it to me

497
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,440
as soon as possible?

498
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,160
Listen, I...

499
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,640
There's an incoming call from a client.

500
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,160
I got it.

501
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,200
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

502
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,240
Mr. Qin.

503
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
Quick.

504
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,920
Pinch me.

505
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,360
Am I... Am I dreaming?

506
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,040
You can pinch yourself.

507
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,520
You're hurting me.

508
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,440
Shi.

509
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,800
Tell me again.

510
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,760
Say it to me one more time.

511
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,200
I'm going to get married.

512
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,560
That's awesome!

513
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,200
What's awesome about it?

514
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,440
Who was it?

515
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,120
The person that vowed to not get married.

516
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,000
What now?

517
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,800
Did some earth-shattering thing happen?

518
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,520
What made you change your mind?

519
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Don't scare me.

520
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,240
Did you fall for some home-buying scheme

521
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,040
that said

522
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,520
you must be married to get it?

523
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,960
How old is our daughter?

524
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,520
She's no longer young.

525
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,200
She...

526
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,120
Gosh.

527
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,720
It's okay if she stays single.

528
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,440
But isn't it better if she found someone?

529
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:58,840
Wait.

530
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,960
Once she's married,

531
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,360
she'll have a baby sooner or later.

532
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,120
You sure are forward-thinking.

533
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,360
Can I finish what I have to say first?

534
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,600
Yes, go on. Finish what you want to say.

535
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,840
Previously,

536
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
on my dad's birthday,

537
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,440
I said something rude.

538
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,720
I hope you don't take it to heart.

539
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,040
I know,

540
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
as parents,

541
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,600
you've had

542
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,120
more than your share of worrying about me.

543
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,240
So, as the daughter,

544
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,440
I shouldn't be so self-centered

545
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,160
and neglect your feelings.

546
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,280
So I thought

547
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,040
I should get this thing done

548
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,440
so that you two could rest assured.

549
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,920
My goodness.

550
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,280
The iron tongue has softened.

551
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,320
This is gratification.

552
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,480
Don't worry.

553
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,280
Rest assured.

554
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,080
If you get married,

555
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,440
your dad and I

556
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,840
will be even more reassured.

557
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,680
When will it happen?

558
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,880
When do you guys plan to get married?

559
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm thinking as soon as possible.

560
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,280
Good to do it soon.

561
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,560
The sooner the better.

562
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,720
Because both of us

563
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,840
don't like big crowds.

564
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,960
And we're busy people.

565
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,440
So we thought we'd do

566
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
a simple ceremony.

567
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,560
That's good.

568
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,200
It's good to be simple.

569
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,920
You know what?

570
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,120
A marriage

571
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,800
is a personal matter.

572
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,720
We don't have

573
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
to compare our marriage to anyone else's.

574
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,240
Am I right?

575
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,720
And the ceremony

576
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,280
is just a formality.

577
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,800
Right?

578
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,200
Yes.

579
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,600
Money

580
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,960
should be kept

581
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,240
for living a good life later on.

582
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,040
Qin,

583
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,280
don't you agree?

584
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,200
Yes, that's right.

585
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,680
Dad, Mom.

586
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,160
You two are such forward-thinkers.

587
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,920
I'm so proud of you. Love you both.

588
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,320
Then, can I have the household register?

589
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,520
Sure.

590
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,040
What...

591
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,240
Why do you need the household register?

592
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,160
To register our marriage.

593
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,680
When are you going to register?

594
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,320
Today.

595
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,000
Today?

596
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,520
Mom.

597
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,080
Mom.

598
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,840
Mom?

599
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,520
Mom, don't be like this.

600
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,280
Don't keep me outside like this.

601
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,520
Open the door.

602
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,320
Let's talk.

603
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,640
Why are you being so unreasonable?

604
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,440
Because I'm just unreasonable like that.

605
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,160
You want to marry Qin Shi?

606
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,560
No way.

607
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,000
Mom.

608
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,720
Just open the door, okay?

609
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,040
Let's talk it over.

610
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,680
No use knocking.

611
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,400
She won't open the door.

612
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,720
Dad.

613
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,680
What about

614
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,760
you help me get my household register?

615
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,360
Your mom hid your booklet

616
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,600
long ago.

617
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,480
I have no idea where to start looking.

618
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,160
This is what happens when you spoil her.

619
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,160
I'm spoiling my wife.

620
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,360
What's that got to do with you?

621
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,360
Your wife

622
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,040
is making things hard for my wife.

623
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,000
What then?

624
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,720
Right.

625
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,680
The men of Yang

626
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,400
know

627
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,160
how to keep our wives happy.

628
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,760
How about this?

629
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,680
I'll figure something out

630
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,440
regarding your mom.

631
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,000
As for you,

632
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,600
you go back and reassure Qin Shi.

633
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,440
It's your job to coax her.

634
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,200
Okay?

635
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,360
Don't worry.

636
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,280
I'll make sure Qin Shi

637
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,160
is not aggrieved.

638
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,200
You promise?

639
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,240
Of course.

640
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,320
But you just agreed to it.

641
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,560
Yes, I did agree.

642
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,720
I'm saying yes to you getting married.

643
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
I'm more than happy
you wish to get married quickly.

644
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,480
But...

645
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,000
I didn't say you could get
the marriage certificate today.

646
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,240
Tomorrow then.

647
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,800
Not even tomorrow.

648
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Silly girl.

649
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,000
What do you take marriage for?

650
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,240
Did you think

651
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,840
it was some children playing house?

652
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,240
Never mind how long

653
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,720
you've been in a relationship

654
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,720
or how long you've known the man.

655
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,960
Tell me.

656
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,640
Has he visited us before?

657
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,160
Have your dad and I

658
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,240
met the man?

659
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,760
How is like as a person?

660
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,280
How does he look?

661
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,600
Does he treat you well?

662
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,360
Does he have a good temper?

663
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,240
How is his character?

664
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,040
We don't know any of that.

665
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,320
Does it make sense

666
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,280
to simply register your marriage with him?

667
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,560
Seriously,

668
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,480
no parent would agree to that.

669
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,640
That's true.

670
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
Didn't we just praise you
for being forward-thinking?

671
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,920
Being forward-thinking doesn't mean I'm dumb.

672
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,320
Whose suggestion is it?

673
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,840
Does it matter

674
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,120
who suggested it?

675
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Of course it does.

676
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,440
It matters a whole lot.

677
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,800
Whose son is that ignorant?

678
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,760
How could he not even pay a visit

679
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,040
to the girl's parents?

680
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,520
Without even a greeting,

681
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,120
he wants to marry the daughter

682
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,000
a family

683
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,400
spent years nurturing?

684
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,160
Without even spending a penny?

685
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,640
What is that

686
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,320
if not wishful thinking?

687
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,200
Mom.

688
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,200
Why are you bringing up money?

689
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,520
This is my idea.

690
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,560
Yours?

691
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,080
Don't get angry. Both of you.

692
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,720
Let's talk it out nicely.

693
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,520
Here, for you.

694
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,200
Listen.

695
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,400
It's okay not to have a wedding.

696
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,280
No, it's not okay.

697
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,360
Not okay.

698
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,720
For women, getting married

699
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,360
is a once-in-a-lifetime occasion.

700
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,200
The wedding

701
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,080
is the best way to see

702
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,720
where the woman is positioned

703
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,680
in the man's heart.

704
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,600
Shi.

705
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,760
Did you study too much

706
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,240
for your own good?

707
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,440
Have you lost your mind?

708
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,720
What are you trying to do?

709
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,280
Follow what other people do

710
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,560
and have a "naked wedding"?

711
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,280
Listen up.

712
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
You're getting married.

713
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,920
You're trying so hard

714
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,120
to help him save money,

715
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,960
not make any demands.

716
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,880
But will they appreciate it?

717
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
Will they thank you?

718
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,080
How will they look at you?

719
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,160
What will they think of you?

720
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,360
Mom.

721
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,800
Here.

722
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,080
Come on, eat it.

723
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
Why are you bringing up money again?

724
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,920
When you got married,

725
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,040
you didn't have a wedding either.

726
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,240
Nor did you accept gifts.

727
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,960
You even got the rings

728
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,080
after getting married, right?

729
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,120
Because that happened to me,

730
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,320
that's why

731
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,640
I...

732
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,720
was suppressed my whole life.

733
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,360
People walk all over me

734
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,120
my whole life.

735
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,560
Get it?

736
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,320
Hu Xiaomei.

737
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,120
Who's walking over you

738
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,240
your whole life?

739
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,520
We're talking about our daughter's marriage.

740
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,280
Why did the focus switch to me out of the blue?

741
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,320
Gosh, you...

742
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,640
Shi.

743
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,280
My life

744
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,920
is a living example.

745
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,000
A woman

746
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,040
who doesn't make demands

747
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,640
with the man she's marrying

748
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,000
is akin

749
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,120
to not being responsible for herself.

750
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,760
A fool, through and through.

751
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,320
So I'm not willing

752
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,480
to see the same thing happen to my daughter.

753
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,880
You're upset

754
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,560
that I talk about money.

755
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,680
That I'm too money-minded.

756
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,920
Let me ask you.

757
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,080
Without money,

758
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,120
could you have grown up so well?

759
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,160
Without money,

760
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,080
would you have

761
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
been able to get your education?

762
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,760
Can you buy a car or a house without money?

763
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,960
That's why,

764
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,120
you need

765
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,200
to have a good talk with that Yang kid.

766
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,960
You want to get married.

767
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,240
Your dad and I fully support it.

768
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,240
You want to get married early.

769
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,440
Of course we're happy. Right?

770
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,520
But,

771
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,040
he wants to get married?

772
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,960
Whatever he has,

773
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,760
we should have them too.

774
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
A family home.

775
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,280
A family car.

776
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,200
What about wedding ceremony?

777
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,520
Renovation.

778
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,960
Household appliances.

779
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,200
Once he has those all sorted out,

780
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
he can marry you.

781
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,440
The household register.

782
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,720
I'll keep it safe for you.

783
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,920
That kid wants to marry you

784
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,640
without spending any money?

785
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,320
No way.

786
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,680
What did I do to deserve this?

787
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,360
Why is everyone

788
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,960
going against me?

789
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,280
I just want to have a simple life.

790
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,280
Get registered, get married, get promoted.

791
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,720
Why is it so hard?

792
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,720
Is this some journey to the west crap?

793
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,920
Am I going after the holy scripture?

794
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,800
At least your mom made requests,

795
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,680
and they're within reason.

796
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,120
Mr. Yang Hua.

797
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,840
Can I trouble you

798
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
to go home with me?

799
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,680
Whatever request

800
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,480
my mom comes up with,

801
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,280
just pretend to say yes.

802
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,760
We just have to get our marriage certificate.

803
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,800
Once we have the certificate,

804
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,520
we can worry about the wedding later.

805
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,400
How about this?

806
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,960
Let's just think of the worst case scenario.

807
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,680
In case we have to have a wedding,

808
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,120
we can split the cost.

809
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:10,960
Okay.

810
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,600
I'll pay for it, for everything.

811
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm not worried about that.

812
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,880
Your mom

813
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,680
is not that big of a problem.

814
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,280
It's my mom I'm worried about.

815
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,320
Okay, listen.

816
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,440
Let's deal with the easier stuff first.

817
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,960
Let's handle my mom first.

818
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
We'll deal with your mom later.

819
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,080
Okay.

820
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,960
When are you free?

821
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,520
Any time is fine.

822
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:42,920
Great.

823
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,520
I'll send you something.

824
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,800
That is what my parents like.

825
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,840
And their preferences.

826
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,080
The thing with my family

827
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,680
is like this.

828
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,880
My dad gets the last say.

829
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,520
But my dad is not too particular

830
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,520
about us

831
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,080
registering our marriage earlier.

832
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,520
My mom is the one against it.

833
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,920
But she's easily persuaded.

834
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,240
So,

835
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,840
go over the list.

836
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,600
I'll support you when the time comes.

837
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,600
I'm sure we'll be victorious.

838
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,320
I'll ask someone else if you won't say.

839
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,520
No, hold on.

840
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,520
Gao, it's me.

841
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,240
I've something to tell you.

842
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,560
Yang Hua.

843
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
He's about to get married!

844
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,240
Do you remember

845
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,200
the bet I made with you before?

846
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,720
I told you Yang Hua

847
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,120
is a straight man.

848
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,600
He's interested in women like normal men.

849
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,840
Listen.

850
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,080
Go tell Daxiong and Vege

851
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,920
and Melon

852
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,800
to prepare to pay me.

853
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,800
No one's getting away.

854
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,120
Bro, I have to thank you.

855
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,800
You've really helped me out big time.

856
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,080
Although

857
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,120
I'm terrible at studying, at sports,

858
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,960
I still got the chance

859
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,400
to prove my worth

860
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,560
before you aces.

861
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,800
Although victory came late,

862
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,240
it still happened nonetheless.

863
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,000
Can you be serious?

864
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,920
Sure.

865
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,720
So what's Qin Shi's family's stance

866
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,560
on her getting married?

867
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,600
Has they agreed to it?

868
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,720
Basically, yes.

869
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,720
That's good.

870
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,760
Then the possibility

871
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,240
of getting rejected

872
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,120
is very low.

873
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,840
But, here's the thing.

874
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,400
Although you have

875
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,960
the bigger edge right now,

876
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,560
you mustn't let it get to your head.

877
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,600
I don't have to tell you

878
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,160
how important the first impression is, right?

879
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,560
So it's imperative

880
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,400
that you gain a favorable impression

881
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,360
when you meet your in-laws for the first time.

882
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,080
Here comes the problem.

883
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,760
In Qin Shi's family,

884
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,720
who is the harder one to please?

885
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
Is it the father or mother?

886
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,560
Qin Shi's mother.

887
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,680
Gosh, that's tricky.

888
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,720
A difficult mother-in-law

889
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,640
easily turns

890
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,920
heaven into hell.

891
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,280
But fret not.

892
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,440
Why?

893
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,960
Because you have me.

894
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,320
I can teach you.

895
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,760
Let me tell you a trick.

896
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,960
When dealing with the mother-in-law,

897
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,720
you just have to coax her and coax her.

898
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,560
There's a great saying.

899
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,560
A son-in-law is half a son.

900
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,360
Just treat her

901
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,600
closer than you'd treat your own mother.

902
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,160
I bet you'll win her over.

903
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,760
That's the guy you spoke of?

904
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,560
He looks like a kid.

905
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,360
How old is he?

906
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,360
Don't be annoying.

907
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I'm 28 this year.

908
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,480
28?

909
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,200
The prime of youth.

910
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,720
Not bad.

911
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:48,960
Qing.

912
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,040
How come you're also here today?

913
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,120
Your brother has a meeting in school today.

914
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,640
So he asked me

915
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,520
to come as a representative.

916
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,560
To check things out.

917
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,360
Alright, enough checking things out.

918
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,200
The food

919
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,640
is made to be eaten.

920
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,480
So let's start eating.

921
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,160
Yang...

922
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,360
Yang Hua.

923
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,320
Well, we're not sure

924
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,600
what you like to eat.

925
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,360
So I just made some simple dishes.

926
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,320
I hope it's to your taste.

927
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,080
She spent the whole morning cooking.

928
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,080
Prepared a full spread.

929
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,520
And she then said,

930
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,960
"Apologies. I only made a few dishes."

931
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,280
"Hope it's to your taste."

932
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,160
Now, how should you react to that?

933
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,320
Ma'am, you jest.

934
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,840
This is a huge spread, not just a few.

935
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,880
Wrong answer.

936
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,120
That will only get you 60 points.

937
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,800
In the mother-in-law's eyes,

938
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,880
the most perfect answer should be...

939
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,040
Ma'am, you're too humble.

940
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,320
You cooked so much

941
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,080
and they certainly don't look simple.

942
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,000
Thank you, ma'am.

943
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,920
Okay, let's eat.

944
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,400
Let's eat.

945
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,320
Eat.

946
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,800
What would you like? I'll serve you.

947
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,800
Meatball.

948
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,160
Pretty good acting.

949
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,200
You want meatballs?

950
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Dear, I'd like a meatball too.

951
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,120
Take it yourself.

952
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,720
Then I'll have the fish.

953
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,200
Yang Hua.

954
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,000
Am I right?

955
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,120
Can you drink?

956
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,160
When it comes to drinking,

957
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,320
it's definitely a bad habit.

958
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,360
But,

959
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,360
when you visit the family for the first time,

960
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,200
then it becomes a trick question.

961
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,360
You must be able to grasp the balance.

962
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,520
Especially when the elderly believes

963
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,640
that one's ability to drink equals character.

964
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,080
You have to be extra careful then.

965
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,760
Drinking is a test

966
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,680
of a man's determination, charm,

967
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,480
bravery and responsibility.

968
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,760
You cannot say no.

969
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,280
But don't overdo it.

970
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,440
Don't try to be smart.

971
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,040
So it's okay to be tipsy,

972
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,000
but not drunk.

973
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,160
You know,

974
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,160
back when I visited

975
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,160
my in-laws,

976
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,480
it was because I didn't grasp

977
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,400
the proper limit.

978
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,360
Forget it. It's a painful memory.

979
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,560
So what's the conclusion?

980
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,360
Do I drink or not?

981
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,960
Are you stupid? What do you think?

982
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,200
Are you crazy?

983
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,800
Hey, Yang Hua.

984
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,840
There's no rush. Drink slowly.

985
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,160
Drink slowly.

986
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,520
Drink slowly.

987
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,600
He seems like a good drinker.

988
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,560
Dad, he can drink.

989
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,480
Let's drink more then.

990
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,960
Qin Wenyu.

991
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,840
What?

992
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,600
What's wrong?

993
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,360
I'm helping him

994
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,520
gain some cookie points with Dad.

995
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:58,960
What?

996
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,440
This isn't much. He can handle it.

997
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,120
Qin Wenyu, stop pouring.

998
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,680
It's fine. It's only a little bit.

999
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,400
He can drink.

1000
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,040
Dad, he can drink. Look.

1001
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,000
No need to force yourself to drink.

1002
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm fine. I know my limit.

1003
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,840
Anyway, you guys enjoy.

1004
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,320
I'm going to prepare more dishes.

1005
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,640
Don't drink too much.

1006
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,800
Are you okay?

1007
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,160
Come, come.

1008
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,200
Let's continue drinking.

1009
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,200
Two of us can drink.

1010
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,240
Dad, together.

1011
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,000
Together, come.

1012
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,120
Not too much.

1013
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,120
What's wrong?

1014
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,800
Go back out and eat.

1015
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,760
Don't make trouble for me in here.

1016
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,120
I mean, I've brought him back

1017
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
like you wanted.

1018
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,280
Why are you still unhappy?

1019
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,920
What else are you preparing?

1020
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,760
I'll help.

1021
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,760
Dude, you can handle your alcohol.

1022
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,600
Can you drink more?

1023
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,440
Yes? Then let's drink till we drop.

1024
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,240
Wenyu, that's enough.

1025
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,520
-Dear.
-Stay out of it.

1026
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,960
It's okay. Come on.

1027
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,240
Dad, he just drank a little bit.

1028
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,160
He can drink.

1029
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,480
Yang Hua.

1030
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,480
How did you

1031
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,760
and Shi meet?

1032
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,000
How did you meet?

1033
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,840
Dad, they met

1034
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,320
while on a trip overseas.

1035
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,520
