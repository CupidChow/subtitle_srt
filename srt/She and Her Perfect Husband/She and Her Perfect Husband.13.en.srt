00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,810
=Episode 13=

19
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,680
There's no way Miss Qin
shows this much interest

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,441
over a case she can't handle.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,960
Unless...

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,401
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,481
Nothing.

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,201
Nothing.

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,320
Nothing.

26
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:11,880
Nothing. Nothing.

27
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:16,121
I just bought a brown sugar pearl boba

28
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,001
with double toppings.

29
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:18,680
Let me get it for you.

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,960
Thank you.

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Watch your mouth now, Feifei.

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,561
You almost got into trouble.

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
(We have to act quickly.)

34
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:44,921
(Lan Xiaoting and Pang Dingfang)

35
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,361
(want to get a divorce.)

36
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,600
Hui.

37
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:56,080
I just went

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,800
to Ms. Lan's mansion.

39
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:57,600
It doesn't look occupied

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,680
and there are many people
asking for their money.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,080
(Why are you looking for her too?)

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,361
(Who told you?)

43
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,201
The more the merrier.

44
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,520
Her mansion
has been searched thoroughly.

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,880
Anything from others?

46
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:10,041
We just went

47
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,401
to the office of the
Association for Women Entrepreneurs.

48
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,921
There are debt collectors too.

49
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:16,680
Fang and I

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,481
just asked

51
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:18,481
the security guard of Yulan Group.

52
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:20,481
(He hasn't seen Ms. Lan for a while)

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,641
(and from the camera footage,)

54
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,720
(we confirm that Ms. Lan)

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,041
(hasn't visited Yulan Group
in a long time.)

56
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:25,680
(Should you ask)

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,440
(her relatives?)

58
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
(Maybe she turned to them.)

59
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,600
Okay,

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,680
Tan.

61
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,561
My aunt doesn't have many friends.

62
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,761
She is very close to my mom.

63
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,680
After my mom passed away,

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,520
I became the second closest
person to her.

65
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:40,440
Other than her oldest brother,

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,680
she doesn't have many relatives.

67
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,240
My aunt and my eldest uncle

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,121
are not on good terms.

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,201
She can't possibly

70
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,481
turn to them.

71
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,761
There, there.

72
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,641
At the moment,

73
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,440
neither the police

74
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:53,401
nor the hospital has contacted us.

75
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,440
There's still hope.

76
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,361
I have watched

77
00:03:59,001 --> 00:03:59,880
this footage many times.

78
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:01,841
When your aunt left the hotel,

79
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,960
she looked like her shrewd self.

80
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,720
She wasn't hesitant

81
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,641
or drowsy.

82
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,121
So I highly

83
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,121
doubt that your aunt

84
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:11,600
left to kill herself.

85
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:14,160
I think she

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,560
might have left to see someone.

87
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,921
Who?

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,880
Danping.

89
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:28,641
I know you are the closest

90
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:29,761
to Ms. Lan

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
but that doesn't mean you know her best.

92
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:34,880
This closeness

93
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,761
might blind you at times.

94
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,681
Try and recall

95
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,081
who

96
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:44,641
is also very important to your aunt,

97
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:48,081
who can give her advice.

98
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,720
And she's

99
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
also very willing to listen

100
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,681
and to trust that person.

101
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,921
My aunt trusts

102
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,961
her husband the most.

103
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,440
What came to your mind?

104
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,641
My aunt used to visit an orphanage

105
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
and she is close to the principal.

106
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,400
Perhaps...

107
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,120
Lan Xiaoting lied

108
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,440
to her niece,

109
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,961
switched off her phone, and snuck out.

110
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,201
It's definitely not the orphanage.

111
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,681
If she had to sneak out,

112
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,840
it means who she's meeting

113
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,000
isn't someone she wants people to know,

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,481
including her own niece.

115
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,000
Who do you think has the power

116
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,000
to command her so?

117
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,400
Pang Dingfang?

118
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,720
I just checked.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,880
The latest flight from Los Angeles to Pujiang

120
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,481
landed 20 minutes ago.

121
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,460
(San Francisco ARRIVE at 22:00)

122
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,840
(I'm Qin Shi.)

123
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,041
(I found Ms. Lan.)

124
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,761
(She's fine.)

125
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:42,840
(Don't worry.)

126
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:55,840
Qin Shi said she found Ms. Lan

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,481
and that she was fine.

128
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,041
She told us not to worry.

129
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Where is my aunt?

130
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:02,361
Hi.

131
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,361
(The number you have dialed
has not been connected for the moment.)

132
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,921
- (Hi.)
- What's wrong?

133
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,400
(The number you have dialed
has not been connected for the moment.)

134
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,720
Geez, Qin Shi.

135
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:15,761
She said she found Ms. Lan and told us

136
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:16,921
not to worry.

137
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
But she didn't tell us where she is

138
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,961
before switching off her phone.

139
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Let me try.

140
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,201
(Hi.)

141
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,160
(The number you have dialed
has not been connected for the moment.)

142
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:29,921
(Sorry.)

143
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,120
(The number you have dialed
has not been connected for the moment.)

144
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,000
Ms. Lan, it's me.

145
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,600
The plane from San Francisco

146
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:57,000
has landed for more than an hour

147
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,880
and he hasn't come out?

148
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,041
It might take some time
to pass through the custom

149
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,481
and to claim the luggage.

150
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,361
Let me keep you company.

151
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,160
We can sit there.

152
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,880
Do you want to rest there?

153
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:23,961
No need. Thanks.

154
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,080
Why don't

155
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,160
we sit there and wait?

156
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,520
(Int., HK, Macao, Taiwan Arrivals)

157
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,481
Some food for Ms. Lan.

158
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,840
I'll wait for you over there.

159
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:22,921
Thank you.

160
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,001
He is a good husband.

161
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,321
Should we call Mr. Pang again?

162
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:37,801
Okay.

163
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,080
(Sorry.)

164
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,600
(The number you have dialed)

165
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,121
(has not been connected for the moment.)

166
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,561
(Please redial later.)

167
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:49,321
(Sorry.)

168
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,241
(The number you have dialed)

169
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,241
(has not been connected for the moment.)

170
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,681
(Please redial later.)

171
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,561
Why did he lie to me?

172
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,600
Ms. Lan.

173
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,640
You once told me that no woman

174
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:21,160
should be dominant

175
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,640
and that you were happy
with your current life.

176
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:25,400
Back then,

177
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:26,520
I wanted to reply

178
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,400
that a powerful businesswoman

179
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:30,960
or a housewife,

180
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:32,241
they are just a title.

181
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:34,760
Women are humans before anything.

182
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Don't lose yourself

183
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:38,640
in any kind of relationship,

184
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,121
especially in a marriage.

185
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,321
No one

186
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,241
should be an accessory to the other.

187
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,840
If you give yourself up

188
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
and place someone above you,

189
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,160
no one will truly love you
or respect you.

190
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm sorry for saying what I said.

191
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:58,280
Miss Qin.

192
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:01,321
In my family,

193
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,801
I was asked not to have an opinion.

194
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:05,640
Before I got married,

195
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,760
I was taught

196
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,041
to become a proper woman.

197
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:11,041
After I got married,

198
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,561
I inherited my life goal from my mom.

199
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,160
And that's to be a good wife,

200
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,681
to take care of my husband and my child.

201
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,760
I once thought

202
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:23,681
I had everything in my life.

203
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:26,840
But looking back,

204
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,640
it's as fragile as a bubble.

205
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,600
Miss Qin,

206
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:38,160
what should I do?

207
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:43,200
Trust me.

208
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,481
It will get better.

209
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,121
It will.

210
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:48,441
I'm serious.

211
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,280
It will get better.

212
00:11:58,681 --> 00:11:59,160
Ms. Lan.

213
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:03,001
Aunt.

214
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:05,441
Are you okay?

215
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:06,720
I'm okay.

216
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:09,001
Sorry for making you worry.

217
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:11,561
Lan, are you all right?

218
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,080
I'm fine.

219
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:14,481
Sorry

220
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,321
for troubling all of you too.

221
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:17,760
It's fine.

222
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
No need to apologize.

223
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,241
Rest now.

224
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,520
Ms. Lan.

225
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,441
I'm glad you're safe.

226
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:25,160
It's getting late now.

227
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:26,441
We should say our goodbye.

228
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,921
Thank you, Mr. Jin.
Thank you, Madam Tang.

229
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,441
And thank you too, Miss Qin.

230
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,080
Jin.

231
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:36,600
As for Pang and my affairs,

232
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,001
proceed as you see fit.

233
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:41,160
Miss Qin.

234
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,640
I count on you.

235
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,801
Thank you for your faith in me.

236
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,681
Are you okay?

237
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,481
Huihui, wait for me.

238
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,441
I'll bring the car.

239
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:58,080
Okay.

240
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,681
So, what happened?

241
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,561
I'm sleepy and hungry.

242
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,441
Another time, please.

243
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,760
I can't think straight.

244
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:13,921
I told you to stay

245
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,760
far, far away from this case.

246
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,200
Look what you're doing now.

247
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,441
Getting arrogant?

248
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,121
Getting cocky?

249
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:21,001
You won't listen to me anymore?

250
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,921
Of course, I will.

251
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,241
I'll always listen to you.

252
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,520
But I can't help myself.

253
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,160
I attract major cases naturally.

254
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,640
Among all of you here,

255
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,280
I was the one who found her.

256
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,241
Qin Shi.

257
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,921
Fortunately, you're a woman.

258
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:35,840
If you're a man,

259
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,400
with this ambition of yours,

260
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:38,921
you will grow too powerful.

261
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,561
I'm a woman and I can be powerful.

262
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,600
So teach me.

263
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,361
Groom me.

264
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,481
Hide your smug face now.

265
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:45,921
I will interrogate you tomorrow morning.

266
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,960
No problem.

267
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,720
Rest early too.

268
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:51,681
Bye.

269
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,121

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,400
When I had overtime, I took two bites

307
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:19,601
and called it my dinner.

308
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,640
When I wanted to use my lunchtime
to go through

309
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,160
some documents,

310
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,841
I took two bites and called it my lunch.

311
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,520
And sometimes when I had to pull
a white night,

312
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,520
I only had one meal for the entire day.

313
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,801
When I was hungry, I would hold it in.

314
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:32,321
When I could eat,
I wolfed down everything.

315
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,961
After two or three years,

316
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,321
my stomach was all worn down.

317
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
You just described my life.

318
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,561
I was describing myself.

319
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:40,000
I used to be like this.

320
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:41,961
I worked to live.

321
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:43,400
And living, for me, was eating
and sleeping.

322
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,880
No work is worth your health.

323
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,441
But this is a sign of my passion.

324
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,721
There will be no more passion
if you're dead.

325
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,000
I accept that.

326
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:02,321
Thank you for your help yesterday.

327
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,360
I'll treat you to hotpot today.

328
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,081
My meat! My car!

329
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,280
Let me handle it.

330
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,921
Just go to work now.

331
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,601
Really?

332
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:26,721
You're amazing.

333
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,681
You're a savior. Here you go.

334
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,041
Oh, Yang Hua.

335
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,520
If you don't have a place to stay,

336
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,520
you can continue living with me.

337
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:40,561
Not for free, though.

338
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,360
You have to do the chores for me

339
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,640
in exchange for free rent.

340
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:48,360
You can say no.

341
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:49,240
No problem.

342
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:06,000
Darling.

343
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:07,360
Should I come back this afternoon

344
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,120
to have lunch with you?

345
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:08,961
No need.

346
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:10,520
I'll have lunch with your mom.

347
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,721
She wants to buy

348
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:12,880
a birthday present for your dad

349
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,041
and she needs my help.

350
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:16,961
My mom is ruthless.

351
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,400
She's his ex-wife

352
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,801
so why is she doing this?

353
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,480
He might not even accept
her gift anyway.

354
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,520
You know what she did last time?

355
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:24,041
What?

356
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,441
She hired a fortune teller

357
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:26,360
to divine my father's fate.

358
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:27,601
He said my father
would get another divorce

359
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:28,921
at the age of 70.

360
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,961
So we shall see.

361
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,961
Tell her not to believe the crook.

362
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:33,961
But the fortune teller

363
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
is quite accurate.

364
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,480
When will my brother get married.

365
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:36,801
Hands.

366
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:37,921
When will I get married.

367
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:39,081
He has got the answers.

368
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,841
Really?

369
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:41,520
He also divined for Qin Shi.

370
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:42,441
What did the fortune teller say?

371
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
I already see the answer coming.

372
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,240
Qin Shi will only get married
in her next life.

373
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:47,681
Nonsensical.

374
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,480
She already has a boyfriend.

375
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,081
For real?

376
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,561
Who? How did you know?

377
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:53,841
None of your business.

378
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,801
I just feel like

379
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:55,640
they will get married soon.

380
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,721
So

381
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:57,841
listen to me

382
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,160
and don't ask your mom to meddle in this.

383
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,880
Neither can you.

384
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,480
Yes, darling.

385
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:03,041
Let me give you a kiss.

386
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:04,561
I have to work now.

387
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,760
Bye.

388
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,681
Bye.

389
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:08,520
Drive safely!

390
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:09,280
Okay.

391
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,880
I have to give you another kiss.

392
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
Wait for me tonight.

393
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:16,280
We'll eat together.

394
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,000
What do you want to eat?

395
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,441
Let me know when you have the answer.

396
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:19,441
Drive slowly.

397
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,120
I'll text you on WeChat.

398
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:21,880
Bye, darling.

399
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:22,640
Bye.

400
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:23,841
Another kiss.

401
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:25,480
All right.

402
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,640
Bye.

403
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,280
Bye.

404
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:28,640
Drive slowly.

405
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:29,240
Bye.

I see.

Okay.

420
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,280
I need to answer this.

421
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,520
Miss Sun.

422
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:25,721
It's all right.

423
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:26,961
Go ahead.

424
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:36,520
You can't say that, Miss Sun.

425
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,880
What do you mean by we

426
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,120
lied about my son's marital status?

427
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:41,520
I'm his mother.

428
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:43,520
I know if my son is married or not.

429
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,041
She's asking for compensation?

430
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,280
What does this have anything
to do with me?

431
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,681
I would like a refund too.

432
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,921
Why should I pay the compensation?

433
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:02,640
Lawsuit?

434
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,601
Sure.

435
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,880
Just so you know,

436
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:08,441
I have seen

437
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:09,441
all sorts of things out there.

438
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,400
Your threat won't work on me.

439
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:14,000
A lawsuit, it is.

440
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,081
Even if you bring it
to the Heavenly Court,

441
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:17,760
my son is still single.

442
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:20,880
Even if my son

443
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,921
has a girlfriend now,

444
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,480
he is still single.

445
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,640
Understood?

446
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:25,961
He is single.

447
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,081
Unbelievable.

448
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:41,321
This is the contract with Ms. Lan.

449
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,961
You two will be

450
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,601
in charge of this case now.

451
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:46,721
Jin asked me to convey

452
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:47,961
his opinion regarding this case.

453
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:48,721
Close it as soon as possible.

454
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,360
- Noted.
- Noted.

455
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,160
This is the list
of assets and their proof

456
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,000
under my aunt's and my uncle's names.

457
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,681
My aunt can't come now
so she gave me the right

458
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:57,760
to represent her.

459
00:22:58,321 --> 00:23:00,640
You can ask me anything.

460
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:07,841
Miss Qin.

461
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,480
I have everything.

462
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,520
I can come now.

463
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,321
Qianqian, Haitao,

464
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:14,640
Changming, and Dai.

465
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:15,961
Please come to the conference room.

466
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:31,280
Some ground rules first.

467
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,921

00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,681
in this conference room

469
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,921
stays in this conference room.

00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,400
And that includes

471
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:38,601
all proprietary information
of our client.

472
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:40,561
You cannot tell anyone.

- Noted.

your parents,

476
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:45,801
your partners, and friends.

477
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:46,520
Understood?

478
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,801
- Understood.
- Understood.

479
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,041
Qianqian.

480
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,160
Give me a divorce application draft,

481
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,441
citing irreconcilable differences
as the reason.

482
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
We have to submit it
to the court today.

483
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,441
Okay.

484
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,000
This contains all info regarding
the client's assets

485
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,280
including fixed assets,

486
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,240
bank savings,

487
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,721
stocks, and company assets.

488
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:04,441
Verify them one by one.

489
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:09,360
The client has been married
to her husband

490
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,400
for 30 years.

491
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:12,321
They have a 20-year-old son.

492
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,601
Their son is already an adult

493
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:14,721
so the core of their contention

494
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:15,841
will not be the child custody

495
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:18,841
but the distribution of wealth.

496
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,000
The client's husband

497
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,520
is facing criminal charges.

498
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,721
If he's found guilty,

499
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:23,921
all assets procured illegally

500
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:24,801
will be confiscated.

501
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,801
Therefore,

502
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,201
the source of each asset

503
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,081
has to be crystal clear.

504
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,640
Junhui.

505
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
I have done my best.

506
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:33,280
Most of Pang Dingfang
and his wife's assets

507
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,760
are acquired before the establishment

508
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,201
of Luowei Yulan.

509
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,561
If his wife divorces him,

510
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:38,441
we're screwed.

511
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:40,520
The stocks of Yulan Group

512
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:42,160
belong to Ms. Lan

513
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:44,400
and are part of her premarital assets.

514
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,480
Now, that's a huge red flag.

515
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,240
We might not get any money at all.

516
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,321
Can we argue

517
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,561
that it's marital joint debt?

518
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
According to the directive

519
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,961
from the Supreme's People Court

520
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,120
regarding a joint debt

521
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,201
taken out by a married couple,

522
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,240
it has to fulfill several criteria.

523
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:03,921
Firstly,

524
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:05,280
both parties have to sign it together.

525
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:05,801
Secondly,

526
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,120
it has to be for
general living purposes.

527
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:08,321
Obviously,

528
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,640
both cases do not apply here.

529
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,601
Although a marital joint debt

530
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:12,360
does entail the debt

531
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,041
accrued from conducting

532
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:14,760
a business activity,

533
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,000
but that activity

534
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:17,801
has to be run by both parties.

535
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,240
From what we gathered,

536
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,681
the client does not help

537
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,081
her husband to run

538
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,961
Luowei Yulan.

539
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:24,240
Any financial litigation

540
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
or loans arise from this situation

541
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:27,000
does not fall within the scope

542
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,081
of marital joint debt.

543
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,000
Therefore,

544
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
my aunt's personal property is safe?

545
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,601
For the wife,

546
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:42,601
in the worst-case scenario,

547
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:44,360
she gets to keep half
of the marital assets.

548
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,921
If the husband ever commits a mistake

549
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:46,721
that jeopardizes the marriage,

550
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:47,801
he'll be seen as the party at fault.

551
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,321
We can then ask the judge

552
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:51,601
to give him none or a minor part

553
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,400
of the marital assets.

554
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,240
Before this happened,

555
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,681
the couple is renowned

556
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:57,601
for their strong bond.

557
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:58,801
No record of adultery

558
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,681
or domestic violence.

559
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
Other than the fact that the husband

560
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,841
hid his scheme from his wife,

561
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:05,681
from a marital perspective, Pang Dingfang

562
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:06,681
did nothing wrong.

563
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,041
I have proof

564
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,961
that the husband did commit adultery.

565
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:30,921
When did you get this?

566
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,160
Yesterday.

567
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:33,681
To be precise,

568
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:35,880
around 10 a.m. local time.

569
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:38,360
Bastard!

570
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:41,041
My aunt is suffering here

571
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,961
while he cheats with his son's tutor.

572
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:46,640
He even lied to my aunt
that he was coming back

573
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:47,921
and she believed him

574
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,000
wholeheartedly.

575
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:51,601
You know the woman

576
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:52,721
on the photo?

577
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:57,000
Her name is Joyce Wang.

578
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,480
Also known as Wang Jialing.

579
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,321
She is my cousin's English tutor

580
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:02,081
and has taught him for five years.

581
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:03,601
From what I know,

582
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,441
she is married too.

583
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:09,400
He basically invited the mistress in.

584
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,000
Miss Zhao.

585
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:13,740
Suffering is more than happiness.

586
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,420
Life can be bumpy at times.

587
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,921
Let us handle the legal side.

588
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,360
At this stage,

589
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,360
you need to remain calm

590
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,760
and look after yourself.

591
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,000
Don't tell

592
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,601
my aunt first.

593
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,400
Otherwise, she would go crazy.

594
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,081
Miss Qin, Miss Li.

595
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,681
I count on you two.

596
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:35,841
Get it sorted out

597
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,921
as soon as possible.

598
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:40,801
They will want to close this case
as soon as possible.

599
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,921
Following the usual procedures,,

600
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,321
after we file the case,

601
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,201
the first hearing will be for mediation.

602
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:47,561
If that doesn't work,

603
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:49,041
the claimant
can withdraw the complaint.

604
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,160
An appeal is possible after six months.

605
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:53,160
Nothing we can do

606
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,360
to finish everything in one go?

607
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,360
If we have sufficient evidence

608
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,640
to prove that the couple
cannot reconcile

609
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,201
and have separated
for at least two years,

610
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:00,681
or if the mistress

611
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:02,561
has ruined the marriage

612
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,640
and the party at fault

613
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,400
agrees to assume all responsibilities,

614
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:07,201
or if there's evidence
of domestic violence.

615
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:09,400
Based on the case at hand,

616
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:10,480
the second situation
is more likely to happen.

617
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:11,841
But this isn't what makes it

618
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,961
so challenging.

619
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:15,561
The husband is abroad

620
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:16,601
and will never return.

621
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:18,721
We might not be able to reach him by phone.

622
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,480
In this case,

623
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,400
even after the court issues
a public announcement,

624
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:23,360
a trial in absentia

625
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,201
will take some time.

626
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:28,640
If you put it that way,

627
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:30,400
no one knows

628
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:31,961
who will receive a sentence first.

629
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,921
Maybe we can get our money back first.

630
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,321
I told you

631
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:38,441
to read more court cases

632
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,841
so that you won't be stuck
working as an investigator forever.

633
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:42,081
Did I

634
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,480
say something wrong?

635
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:45,360
After they file for divorce,

636
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:47,120
they can apply
for property preservation.

637
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:50,601
We can apply for asset freezing.

638
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,721
No one will get the money then.

639
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:54,601
We only know

640
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
part of the assets they own.

641
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:56,801
As for the exact number,

642
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,561
only the client knows.

643
00:28:58,841 --> 00:28:59,880
A divorce attorney

644
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,760
has more info than us.

645
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,721
Wait. You...

646
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:10,801
Where are you going?

647
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:12,120
To the procuratorate.

648
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,360
When we file the complaint,

649
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,321
we will apply
for property preservation too.

650
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,880
All assets will be liquidated too.

651
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:19,120
Go back to your work now.

652
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,081
Report to me when you have something.

653
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:20,921
- Noted.
- Noted.

654
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,441
Thank you

655
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,240
for the hard work.

656
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:28,961
You must have had a few rough days too.

657
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,561
Until now,

658
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:33,921
my education,

659
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:35,240
my work, my home,

660
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:36,480
everything I have

661
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:38,201
was given to me by my aunt.

662
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:39,561
And now,

663
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:41,240
she can't rely on anyone

664
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:43,041
except me.

665
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:44,201
So

666
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,640
I won't call this a rough day.

667
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:47,921
It's my duty.

668
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:00,360
Miss Qin.

669
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,400
You truly plan to take up this case?

670
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,041
Why?

671
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,801
It's a tricky case.

672
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,400
And you already have one foot

673
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,000
into the elevator
that leads to the 11th floor.

674
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:14,681
I'm worried that this case
might affect you.

675
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:19,201
What does my handling of this case

676
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,441
have anything to do with whether

677
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,721
I'm being promoted or not?

678
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,880
If it did affect me,

679
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:25,480
the first one to celebrate will be you,

680
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,480
won't it?

681
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,081
Among all the people in this law firm,

682
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,841
you came to offer me advice?

683
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:33,280
Miss Qin.

684
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:35,160
See? You're always

685
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,681
prejudiced against me.

686
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,760
I am an objective person.

687
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:43,681
I advocate for a fair competition.

688
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,000
So do I.

689
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:49,441
So we agree on this?

690
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,480
We've been colleagues for many years

691
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,480
but this is our first time
working on the same case.

692
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:56,240
I'm excited.

693
00:30:56,961 --> 00:30:58,240
Me too.

694
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,240
I'm sure I can learn

695
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,721
many things from you.

696
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,601
Miss Qin.

697
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,721
You had a humble pie today.

698
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,041
I'm so surprised.

699
00:31:07,321 --> 00:31:08,640
I have to learn from you,

700
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:10,000
Miss Qin.

701
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,160
How can I be

702
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:12,321
as exceptional as you?

703
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,681
I was born like this.

704
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,561
But Miss Li,

705
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:18,801
let's work hard together.

706
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,000
Mr. Zhou. Think about it.

707
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,000
Give me a call when you have an answer.

708
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:28,801
Why? He doesn't want it back?

709
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,921
He didn't get a heart attack.

710
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,000
He had a stroke.

711
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,041
But it fried his brain too.

712
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,041
He lost more than a million

713
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,801
but he doesn't care.

714
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:39,721
I don't get it.

715
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,841
Zhou.

716
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:58,520
You're here.

717
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,601
What's the matter?

718
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,280
It's about Luowei Yulan.

719
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:05,880
They are from
the debt-collecting company.

720
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:08,601
Funny,

721
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,441
don't you think?

722
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:11,321
Do you want one?

723
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,561
I said I didn't need the money back

724
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:16,921
but they tried so hard to persuade me.

725
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:19,601
Did you run into them?

726
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,240
They look scary.

727
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,280
People like them

728
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:26,201
come from rural areas.

729
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,721
I'm not stupid enough

730
00:32:27,721 --> 00:32:29,681
to ask them to help me.

731
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,961
Did you bring what I told you
to bring me?

732
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,120
As reliable

733
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,561
as always.

734
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,760
Zhou.

735
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:49,400
How many people are those

736
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,041
debt collectors helping right now?

737
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,601
Many, I suppose.

738
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,601
If you add everything,

739
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,160
it'll amount to tens of millions.

740
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,400
They sure love to take risks.

741
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,360
People always die
looking for great fortune.

742
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:10,000
And for a huge sum like this,

743
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:11,721
anyone would be enticed.

744
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,280
I have another news for you.

745
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,400
The lady boss

746
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,160
of Luowei Yulan

747
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,441
is getting a divorce.

748
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:27,760
Who told you?

749
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,801
They told me.

750
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,360
She found

751
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,760
a good law firm

752
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,400
and is preparing for the lawsuit.

753
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,081
Once again,

754
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,441
the common adage has been proven right.

755
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Lovebirds will fly separate ways

756
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:48,321
in the event of a disaster.

757
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
It's all

758
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,601
the money's fault.

759
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:02,041
Hua, what are you looking for?

760
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:03,081
I can help you.

761
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:03,961
It's okay, mom.

762
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,841
I found it.

763
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
You're leaving already?

764
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,200
You don't want to stay for dinner?

765
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,881
Sorry. Next time, perhaps.

766
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,000
But you haven't visited us
for a long time.

767
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:14,960
I haven't been able to talk to you.

768
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:15,401
You...

769
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,641
I worked to live.

770
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,200
And living, for me, was eating
and sleeping.

771
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,401
No work is worth your health.

772
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,000
Come in.

773
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:07,680
Miss Qin,

774
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,641
I want to help with Ms. Lan's case.

775
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,161
We have enough manpower there.

776
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,121
Miss Qin.

777
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,680
I know why you excluded me.

778
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,121
I can promise you

779
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:20,601
that I won't tell anyone

780
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:21,480
about the case.

781
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,081
Especially Tao Junhui.

782
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,401
I have learned

783
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:25,561
so much from you.

784
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,641
You have seen what I can do too.

785
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:28,881
Trust me.

786
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:29,760
I will be helpful to you

787
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:30,520
in this case.

788
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,720
You truly think

789
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,881
I excluded you because of him?

790
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,520
Is that not true?

791
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,801
Tell me.

792
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:44,561
Why did you come to Cheng & Hui?

793
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:45,881
I want to be an attorney

794
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:47,561
so I came to the best law firm.

795
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:48,881
Do you know

796
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,760
how likely is a legal assistant
in Cheng & Hui

797
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:52,480
to be promoted to be

798
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,520
an associate attorney?

799
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:56,480
In here,

800
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,321
the average time for a legal assistant

801
00:35:59,321 --> 00:36:00,720
to become an associate attorney
is six years.

802
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:02,680
And the average time
before people resign

803
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:03,361
is two years.

804
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,881
A whopping 65% turnover rate.

805
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,081
In other words,

806
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,561
counting from your first day of work,

807
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:09,041
you will go through

808
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,920
three different generations

809
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,520
of colleagues before you are considered

810
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:14,280
the candidate for a promotion.

811
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,401
And if you manage to pull through,

812
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,440
less than one in three candidates
will get the promotion.

813
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,121
During this period,

814
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:22,280
other than performing your duty,

815
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,081
you have to major

816
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,760
in another law degree other than

817
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,881
common laws.

818
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,161
Or, you get another degree in economics.

819
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:29,680
Miss Qin.

820
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:31,801
I don't get what you're trying to say.

821
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,720
Look at the legal assistants out there.

822
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:40,121
They give their 1,000%

823
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:42,440
to have a less than 33% chance
for their big break.

824
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,240
You might think

825
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,401
you have worked hard enough

826
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:45,960
but compared to them,

827
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,161
it's insufficient.

828
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,920
Miss Qin, are you doubting

829
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,280
my competence or my motivation here?

830
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:53,240
I believe

831
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,401
I have made myself clear.

832
00:36:58,361 --> 00:36:59,760
I believe an affluent household

833
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,440
or having connections that might help

834
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:03,881
my career isn't a drawback.

835
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,361
It's my advantage.

836
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,081
It allows me

837
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:07,321
to focus on my work

838
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:09,561
and I will prove my competence to everyone.

839
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,440
Your prejudice against me today

840
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,720
hurts my feelings.

841
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,000
(Because of jealousy,)

842
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,760
(you insulted)

843
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,881
(the spirit of a motivated girl.)

844
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:23,760
(Qin Shi, you're vile.)

845
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,440
(Miss Qin.)

846
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,161
Yes.

847
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:36,920
Speak.

848
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:38,321
Miss Qin.

849
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:39,530
(Shanghai New Pudong Real Estate Trading Center)
I just checked

850
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,400
(Shanghai New Pudong Real Estate Trading Center)
the ownership

851
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,161
of all three real estate properties
owned by Mr. and Mrs. VIP.

852
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,641
They have all been leveraged.

853
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:46,401
Wait.

854
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:46,960
Okay.

855
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:53,841
You mean

856
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:55,200
all of them have been leveraged?

857
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,041
(Yes.)

858
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:57,881
(I'm unsure of what else.)

859
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,801
We need to ask the bank for that.

860
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,520
Can you check

861
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:02,720
when he used them as leverage?

862
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,161
(Early this year.)

863
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:08,480
What about

864
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:09,641
the shops and the office buildings
under her name?

865
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:11,720
I have asked several agencies

866
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:12,440
to check them.

867
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:13,601
I should have the result soon.

868
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:15,520
Good. Well done.

869
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,081
Keep us posted.

870

(Leveraged Household)

871
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:35,720
Speak.

872
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:37,561
(Miss Li.)

873
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,960
I'm here at Mrs. VIP's

874
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,881
beauty parlor management office.

875
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:41,601
The finance manager here said

876
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,480
that Mr. VIP had leveraged

877
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,760
the company stocks

878
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,401
(to some lending companies.)

879
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:49,760
(He had done it several times)

880
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,960
(but he settled the debt very soon.)

881
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,440
That's why the manager
didn't suspect a thing.

882
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:54,480
(But this time around,)

883
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,601
(more than one company has been leveraged)

884
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:58,601
(and the sum has surpassed)

885
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:00,720
(20 million yuan.)

886
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:03,081
(They are now under
huge financial pressure every month.)

887
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:10,960
This is an omen.

888
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:11,760
It is not an omen anymore.

889
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:16,121
Hello?

890
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,520
Hello?

891
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,720
Okay. Thank you.

892
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,401
This...

893
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
Is a huge trap.

894
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:11,180
(Residence, Company, Beauty Parlor,
CEC Center, Yulan Group)

895
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,081
Hello.

896
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:18,641
Where are you?

897
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,881
What's wrong?

898
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,561
You sound upset.

899
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,720
I miss you.

900
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,240
I'm working now.

901
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:30,960
Wait for me back home.

902
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,321
I'll come back once I'm done.

903
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,081
Okay.

904
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,440
I'll wait for you.

905
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:38,801
Bye.

906
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,801
Cheer up.

907
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:42,041
Bye.

908
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:29,440
I...

909
00:42:31,601 --> 00:42:32,361
It's not here either.

910
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,520
Let me check here.

911
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:37,440
What are you looking for?

912
00:42:37,801 --> 00:42:38,801
A name card.

913
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,561
Whose?

914
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:42,480
That person.

915
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,121
You don't know anyway.

916
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:49,920
I put it here.

917
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,801
Stop scrambling about.

918
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:51,601
Think hard now.

919
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:53,881
When did you last see it?

920
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:56,601
Last time?

921
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:03,520
I remember putting it in this bag.

922
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,801
Let me check.

923
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,601
I think...
