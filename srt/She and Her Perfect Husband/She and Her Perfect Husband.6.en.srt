=She And Her Perfect Husband=

18
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,020
=Episode 6=

19
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,199
Was this report

20
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,759
given to you by your husband?

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,039
Do you see that? Wanjin Yongli.

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,199
Their product

23
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,479
with the highest circulation.

24
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,119
In the past 16 months,

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,599
their fund has been channelled

26
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
to a company called Suoluo Technology

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,920
to produce electric vehicles.

28
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,559
However,

29
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,000
the contact number

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,319
of Suoluo Technology

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,559
belongs to an Indian restaurant.

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,839
How did this company

33
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,559
pass its

34
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,640
risk assessment?

35
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,240
There's also

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,399
another biotech company

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,559
called Saint Gene.

38
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,440
Its shareholder is Feisha Bio.

39
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,240
In the past, a complaint was filed

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,839
for illegally adding antibiotics

41
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,399
in Chinese medicine oral liquid.

42
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,440
In the past three months,

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,559
Luowei Yulan actually

44
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,759
made a P2P Lending Platform product

45
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,160
for this company.

46
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,240
The funding was 100 million yuan.

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,479
Are all their products

48
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,440
like that?

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,520
Not all products.

50
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,119
The projects they invested in initially

51
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,319
were quite reliable.

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,559
The rate of return

53
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,720
was reasonable as well.

54
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,000
It has been having a very serious issue
starting last year.

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,559
Besides these two products,

56
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:20,640
Luowei Yulan

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,360
has 90%

58
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,800
long-term products.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,559
It's still early

60
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,800
to honour their payment

61
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,119
so the problem has not been exposed yet.

62
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
There won't be a problem

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,479
if they

64
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,559
pay on time, right?

65
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,000
Even if there's a problem,

66
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,759
it is still

67
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,199
a big group,

68
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,727
do you think Ms. Lan will abandon it?

69
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,520
Before

70
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,640
this P2P Lending Platform

71
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,959
fails

72
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,440
and has its problems exposed,

73
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,000
everyone will think the same.

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,440
That is why I'm wondering

75
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,839
if we can revisit the contract

76
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,679
with the Association for Women Entrepreneurs.

77
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:55,280
Aren't there a few products

78
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,559
that have reached
their payment due date?

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,399
Let's have a look before deciding.

80
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,240
It's too late.

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,280
I thought you haven't
sent the contract yet.

82
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,199
You sent it?

83
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,199
Wu Fei.

84
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,759
The contract about
Association for Women Entrepreneurs

85
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,360
that the company

86
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,479
last sent out,

87
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,039
get the courier to cancel the delivery.

88
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,039
Immediately.

89
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,080
Ms. Qin.

90
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,199
I'm still not in the office.

91
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,039
I'll investigate

92
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,199
when I arrive at the office.

93
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,039
I can do it myself when you arrive.

94
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,240
Hurry up and think of something.

95
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,240
Hurry.

96
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,439
Ms. Qin.

97
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,400
What's wrong?

98
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,240
I'll tell you later.

99
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,470
(The Stressed Guys' Roasting Conference)
Any one of you

100
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,800
has the receptionist, Annie's number?

103
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,120

It should be in the company's log.

104
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,840
What's wrong?

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,759
I have to check the contract.

106
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,479
It's urgent.

107
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:12,719
I will arrive

00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,680
at the law firm in ten minutes.

109

I can help you check.

Thank you. I'll treat you.

111
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,879
I have it. Treat me.

112
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:28,879
I'm going up.

113
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,039
I think

114
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,159
you've forgotten something.

115
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,640
No. They are all here.

116
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,400
Think carefully.

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
I need to go now.

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,400

Hello, Annie.

123
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:56,520
I am Wu Fei from the family department.

124
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,879
I have something to ask you.

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,920
Found it. Thanks.

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,920

Yes.

127
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,520

It's our company's problem.

Sorry to trouble you.

134

Please give a call

about the cancellation.

All right.

143

Qin Shi.

145
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm going to as you a serious question.

146
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,039
What is the credibility

147
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,560
of this assessment report?

148
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:04,840
Do you dare

149
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,240
take responsibility
for all the data on the report

150
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,879
and the problems it will cause?

151
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,319
Are you sure that everything here

152
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,240
is correct?

153
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,479
I've never been wrong

154
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,240
regarding numbers and money.

155
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,159
I wholeheartedly trust the person

156
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,120
who wrote this report.

157
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:24,360
So, I can take responsibility.

158
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,319
Ms. Tang.

159
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,560
No matter what she says or does,

160
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,360
do not agree.

161
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,279
They are not true.

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,279
Stop talking.

163
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,080
Ms. Tang.

164
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,240
Li Dai, what are you doing?

165
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,479
What are you doing?

166
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,560
Don't touch me.

167
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,479
Qin Shi.

168
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,680
This is too much.

169
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,279
I always tolerated you.

170
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,400
Do you think you are the

171
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,360
second-in-command now?

172
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,640
How did you tolerate me?

173
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,800
Is it tolerating
when you couldn't win an argument?

174
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,080
Winning in terms of mentality?

175
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,279
Regardless,

176
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
I made a deal with Zhao Danping.

177
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,759
No matter what,

178
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,360
this contract

179
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,199
has to be delivered.

180
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,199
What if I don't?

181
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,759
If you don't,

182
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,240
will you be responsible

183
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,999
for losing a huge client?

184
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:01,599
Sure.

185
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:17,680
Qin Shi.

186
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,039
What did you tell Ms. Tang?

187
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,759
Why don't you tell me?

188
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,199
Show me

189
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,039
the standard

190
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,599
of our best lawyer
in the family department.

191
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,920
If you can't persuade me

192
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,560
like how you persuaded Ms. Tang,

193
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,240
I won't forgive you.

194
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,560
I don't need you to forgive me.

195
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,519
Take a look, Scammer.

196
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,079
Who are you talking about?

197
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,360
Hello, Jin.

198
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,360
Where are you?

199
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm already

200
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,440
on my way to the airport.

201
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,920
I saw your text.

202
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Don't be anxious.

203
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,800
Let's discuss the countermeasures

204
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,839
when I'm back.

205
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,560
Are you alone?

206
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,279
Qin Shi and Li Dai are here.

207
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,200
We can leave

208
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
if you need us to.

209
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,200
No need. Stay here.

210
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,360
Yihui.

211
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:26,320
Tell me honestly.

212
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,440
Did you put any money

213
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,279
in Luowei Yulan?

214
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:32,719
Yihui.

215
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,920
I'm not asking someone
to be held accountable.

216
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
I need to know

217
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,760
our worst-case scenario.

218
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,200
Did you?

219
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
Mr. Jin, she says she did.

220
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,360
How much?

221
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,440
How much?

222
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:00,687
25...

223
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,920
Million?

224
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,320
I'll come back immediately.

225
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,959
Before I return,

226
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
the news

227
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,000
must not leave the office.

228
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,159
Turn back.

229
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,479
Sure, Mr. Jin.

230
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,660
(People's Park)

231
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Yang, I need to thank you.

232
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:48,959
Your news

233
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,200
was so accurate.

234
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,760
Two days ago, they announced

235
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,240
the stock replacement.

236
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:54,247
Suddenly,

237
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,200
a few stocks have hit limit up.

238
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,519
Today's coffee will be

239
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,159
my treat.

240
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,519
Don't be polite.

241
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,479
I also bought

242
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,240
a very awesome
financial management product.

243
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,159
Managed by a foreign funding company.

244
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,719
It is investing in
the electric vehicle project.

245
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,000
The interest I earned every month

246
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,079
will scare you.

247
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
Why didn't you introduce us

248
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,120
to such a great product?

249
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
It's no use telling you.

250
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,159
The product
is not available to the public.

251
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
My son

252
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
has a client.

253
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,959
He is a big boss.

254
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
My son

255
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,800
is close to him.

256
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,639
He got a bit of quota.

257
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,240
It's a project invested in

258
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,000
by entrepreneurs worth billions.

259
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,279
Our money

260
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,200
is nothing much.

261
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,120
That won't do.

262
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,760
It's two-wheeled, right?

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,719
Zhou.

264
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,519
What?

265
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,680
Are you talking about

266
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,719
Luowei Yulan?

267
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,240
Yes.

268
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,399
Yang.

269
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,719
You are quite well-informed.

270
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,320
What do you think?

271
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,320
There's nothing wrong

272
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,440
with this investment

273
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,680
from the contract.

274
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,120
There's also a third-party company

275
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,399
using a plot of land

276
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,240
as insurance.

277
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,279
At the moment,

278
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,839
they also paid the earnings on time.

279
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,519
If we have no evidence to proof

280
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,360
that Suoluo Technology

281
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,279
has credit and qualification issues,

282
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,519
we might have to pay

283
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,440
a huge compensation

284
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,680
to get our investment back.

285
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,000
What about you?

286
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,719
I don't agree.

287
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,839
From Luowei Yulan, Suoluo Technology

288
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,719
to Feisha Bio,

289
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,279
every company

290
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,680
seems like an empty shell.

291
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:05,839
We have never

292
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,959
seen their true nature.

293
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,479
Even if there's a third-party guarantee,

294
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,240
we don't know if the plot of land

295
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,519
is worth any money or

296
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,519
have any property rights issues.

297
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,360
I agree with Qin Shi.

298
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
I've sent someone

299
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,560
to investigate the plot of land.

300
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,039
According to my experience,

301
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:22,920
it's not optimistic.

302
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,479
Enough.

303
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:27,959
Our law firm

304
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,159
has many such cases.

305
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,760
Didn't you see

306
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,800
many of these contracts?

307
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,639
Why didn't you

308
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,800
discuss it with me?

309
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,519
If other people find out

310
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,120
Cheng & Hui's funds have been scammed,

311
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,320
it will be

312
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,399
a huge joke.

313
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,959
I don't get it.

314
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,120
Tell me.

315
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,959
Ms. Lan is so rich.

316
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,399
Why does she need to scam people?

317
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,680
Ms. Tang.

318
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,800
Zhao Danping's call.

319
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,680
She might be calling
to ask about the contract.

320
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,399
Don't answer it.

321
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,839
What can I tell her?

322
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,639
I even did so much

323
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,360
to flatter her.

324
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,519
Just great.

325
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,360
Ms. Qin.

326
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,760
Can you tell me honestly

327
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,399
where did you get this report

328
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,240
and who wrote it?

329
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:27,039
I need to make a decision now.

330
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,839
The credibility of this report

331
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:29,680
is very important.

332
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,399
My husband,

333
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,839
Yang Hua, wrote this report.

334
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,639
I remember your husband

335
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,039
is an investment consultant.

336
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,000
He is familiar with this.

337
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,440
He was the first one who reminded me

338
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,000
that there was something wrong
with Luowei Yulan.

339
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,159
Regarding this,

340
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,360
did you tell anyone else

341
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,839
besides your husband?

342
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:55,839
No.

343
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Hello, it's me.

344
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,200
Say it.

345
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,320
The land's situation has been confirmed.

346
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,920
It exists

347
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,000
but it has been pledged many times.

348
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
It can't be used as a guarantee.

349
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:33,719
Ms. Qin.

350
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:36,399
I need you to do something.

351
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,519
I hope your husband

352
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,880
can keep the data he saw

353
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,920
a secret.

354
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,599
Don't let anyone find out.

355
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,479
Is that possible?

356
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,639
I understand.

357
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,719
Don't be anxious.

358
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Right now,

359
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:00,399
don't tell anyone

360
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,639
before any payment issues

361
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,159
arise.

362
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,279
No matter what we do,

363
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,920
we need to get the money back

364
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,560
even if we pay a bit of compensation.

365
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,839
That's impossible.

366
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:21,680
The company

367
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,039
has a lot of funds to support it.

368
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,560
Its main shareholder

369
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,519
is Yulan Group's chairman.

370
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,519
It won't go bankrupt.

371
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,000
It's impossible.

372
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,120
Zhou.

373
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,519
Why are you so angry?

374
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,200
Yang has

375
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,680
his own sources.

376
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,079
Just hear him out.

377
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,399
Sure. I'll hear him out.

378
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,880
Tell me.

379
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,760
Where did you get the news from?

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,560
Hold on.

381
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,320
Hello.

382
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:45,680
Where are you?

383
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,120
I'm outside.

384
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,920
You didn't mention Luowei Yulan

385
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,320
to anyone else, right?

386
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,399
Did something happen?

387
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,240
It's nothing.

388
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,839
Just don't tell anyone

389
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:57,680
about this.

390
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,719
Not even a word.

391
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,920
Why?

392
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,880
Don't ask.

393
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,880
Don't tell anyone

394
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,800
before things become clear.

395
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,399
I'll tell you in detail later.

396
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:07,840
That's all.

397
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,680
Yang, quick. Tell us.

398
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,920
Where did you get

399
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,159
your news from?

400
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,039
We know people too.

401
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:20,399
About that,

402
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,800
I can't tell you.

403
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,159
Yihui, do you need that money?

404
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:27,519
They will

405
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,759
pay the dividend next week.

406
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,999
You'll be making a loss
if you pull out now.

407
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,359
Our project

408
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,080
is going well.

409
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,279
Many people are waiting

410
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,399
to invest with their funds.

411
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,399
If you pull out now,

412
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:38,039
you won't be able to join again.

413
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:40,952
Ms. Lan, I know.

414
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,639
You helped me back then.

415
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,560
But Jin

416
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,519
suddenly decided

417
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,480
to open ten new offices.

418
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,920
He didn't tell me anything

419
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,200
before this.

420
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,519
It's also my fault.

421
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,359
I didn't tell him

422
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,519
about making the investment.

423
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,840
When do you need the money?

424
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,600
Do you think it's possible

425
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,680
to get it by this week?

426
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,639
Hello, Ms. Lan?

427
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,359
I think it's possible.

428
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,159
It's not a big sum.

429
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,600
But Pang is currently abroad.

430
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,279
He will only come back after two days.

431
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,320
When he's back,

432
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,239
I'll ask him to

433
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:20,999
prioritise your case.

434
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,960
What do you think?

435
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,080
Thank you, Ms. Lan.

436
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:26,879
Give me an update

437
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:28,279
when Mr. Pang is back.

438
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,239
I am so sorry.

439
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,440
I will

440
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,159
apologise to you

441
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:33,440
when we meet next time.

442
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,560
There's no need.

443
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,879
We are all businessmen.

444
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:37,720
Everyone needs funds.

445
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,720
Don't worry.

446
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,200
Great.

447
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,480
Goodbye, Ms. Lan.

448
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,279
I'm giving you a like

449
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,200
for your contribution.

450
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:33,879
Two contributions.

451
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,239
Oh no.

452
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,800
It's over.

453
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,480
It's over.

454
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,600
It's over.

455
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
It's over.

456
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:51,879
Ms. Li.

457
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,279
What's wrong?

458
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,279
Do you feel sick?

459
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:55,200
A headache perhaps?

460
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:56,800
Why?

461
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:58,999
Do you have medicine?

462
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,840
No.

463
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,080
Drink more water. It's good for you.

464
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,680
Where are you going?

465
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,600
I'm going to find Ms. Tang.
Where else can I go?

466
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,440
Don't go.

467
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:12,759
Ms. Tang

468
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,359
is not in the mood to sign anything.

469
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,279
Payslips.

470
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,359
She has to sign these payslips.

471
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,080
If I were you,

472
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,039
I won't choose this time

473
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,879
to mention money

474
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,279
to Ms. Tang.

475
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:36,840
Why?

476
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,920
25 million yuan?

477
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,800
Not so loud.

478
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,359
This is serious.

479
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,879
Quiet.

480
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,359
They say they can return the money.

481
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,200
We will know

482
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,600
whether it's true in two days.

483
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,600
What if they don't return the money?

484
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,440
I need to ask you.

485
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,800
If they don't return the money,

486
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,600
will it heavily affect the law firm?

487
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,119
Of course.

488
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,399
The money is

489
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:10,999
our law firm's liquidity.

490
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,119
I hope Luowei Yulan

491
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:14,879
can return the money

492
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,399
before they go bankrupt.

493
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,740
(Zhao Danping)

494
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,999
Asking for the contract?

495
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,460
(Zhao Danping)

496
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,399
Qin Shi is now the hero.

497
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,800
I'm the one who is responsible

498
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:32,560
for this mess now.

499
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,800
Don't you think I'll feel aggrieved?

500
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
You can't

501
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,159
keep hiding from her.

502
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,519
What should I tell her?

503
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,519
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhao.

504
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,239
In the near future,

505
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
your investor

506
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,200
will be suing you.

507
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,080
We can't overcome your trouble with you.

508
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:51,399
You are

509
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,440
too impatient.

510
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:55,920
Understand?

511
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,519
Let me tell you honestly.

512
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,920
Not just once.

513
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:00,879
In the last two years,

514
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,800
everyone has been
watching your competition

515
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,279
with Qin Shi, right?

516
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,999
In terms of abilities,

517
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:07,159
both of you are similar.

518
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:08,720
However,

519
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,800
in terms of advantage,

520
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,560
she is better

521
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:12,840
than you.

522
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:14,920
What advantage?

523
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,999
She is married with children.

524
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,159
I'm still single and have no children.

525
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:20,039
Right?

526
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,759
But it's not that

527
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:22,519
I don't want to get married.

528
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,119
I gave up my life

529
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,960
because of my career.

530
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,399
I understand, all right?

531
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:29,440
I understand everything.

532
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,200
What will you do then?

533
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,359
Women always need to work harder

534
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,879
in their careers compared to men.

535
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,359
Right?

536
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,159
But you can't

537
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,239
sacrifice your youth and energy

538
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,879
for other people's company

539
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,159
and end up

540
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:47,759
as a mess

541
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,720
with a crumbled mind.

542
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,159
That's wrong.

543
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,500
(Century Matchmaking, Miss Sun)

544
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,320
Hello.

545
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,170
(High End Matchmaking Consultant)

546
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,159
Li?

547
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,519
I'm very sorry about last time.

548
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:30,239
Just now,

549
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:30,960
the mother

550
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,359
called me again.

551
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
She wanted me to help her

552
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,560
get another chance.

553
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:36,960
Stop mentioning

554
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,440
that person again.

555
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,918
I've already blocked him.

556
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:43,080
I paid a fee and joined the membership.

557
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,600
If this is the level

558
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,239
of service you provide

559
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,879
and introduce people like him,

560
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,440
it's doesn't match the standard

561
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,039
promised on the contract.

562
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,359
I understand.

563
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,879
That was

564
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,119
just an accident.

565
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,239
It was also the biggest mistake

566
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,960
since I started this business.

567
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,879
I apologise to you.

568
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,639
I'm very sorry.

569
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,800
However, this young man

570
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,399
is really nice.

571
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:08,159
He graduated from Fudan University.

572
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,080
I got

573
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,440
his picture this time.

574
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,200
Let me send it to you.

575
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,560
If you are

576
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,759
still not satisfied,

577
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,399
I can help you find another person.

578
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,279
I'll send it to you right now.

579
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,200
Forgive everyone.

580
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,239
(But you can't)

581
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,080
(sacrifice your youth and energy)

582
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:36,560
(for other people's company)

583
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,480
(and end up)

584
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,080
(as a mess)

585
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
(with a crumbled mind.)

586
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,920
(That's wrong.)

587
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,380
(Miss Sun)

588
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,999
Does he look different from the picture?

589
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:03,440
Don't worry.

590
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,519
I met him before.

591
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,600
He is handsome since young.

592
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:07,560
A man

593
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,279
won't change much

594
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,680
as long as he doesn't
become bald or fat.

595
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:11,879
What is his name?

596
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,480
I think his surname is Yang.

597
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,080
Yes. Yang Hua.

598
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:15,920
"Yang" which means the sun.

599
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,920
I've sent you his personal information.

600
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:18,920
Let me verify it

601
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,600
with him.

602
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Wait for me.

603
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
Yang Hua?

604
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,639
Why does this name sound so familiar?

605
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:34,840
My husband,

606
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:36,279
Yang Hua, wrote this report.

607
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,359
Yang Hua?

608
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,759
This is such a coincidence.

609
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,600
Ms. Tang and Mr. Jin
want us to meet them.

610
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,600
I got a friend of mine in finance

611
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,039
to take a look at

612
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,840
your analysis report.

613
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,440
He said it was professionally done.

614
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,920
I think he knows your husband.

615
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,119
Is that so?

616
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:18,999
Is your friend working abroad too?

617
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,119
Not really.

618
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,800
He told me he knows a Yang Hua

619
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,920
working in finance.

620
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,320
A graduate of Fudan University.

621
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,119
Well, the name Yang Hua

622
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,080
is quite common.

623
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
Perhaps it's not the same people.

624
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,759
Is his surname

625
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,999
"Yang", which means willow?

626
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:36,600
Yes.

627
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,519
"Hua" which means Chinese.

628
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,239
My husband's "Yang" means sun.

629
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,160
There's nothing wrong with the company.

630
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,759
I don't know.

631
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,200
Mr. Wang.

632
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,239
Some people

633
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,560
just want to see the world burn.

634
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,600
Sit down.

635
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,279
Yes.

636
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
I was very surprised

637
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,960
when I heard this news.

638
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,560
Why would

639
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,600
our law firm

640
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,560
work with Luowei Yulan? Seriously.

641
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,519
Hello, Mr. Xia.

642
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,159
It's been a long time.

643
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:45,879
- Sure.
- I can talk.

644
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:47,200
- Thank you for your concern.
- Say it.

645
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,119
We are also wondering

646
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,279
where the rumours come from.

647
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,080
We have never participated

648
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,359
in Luowei Yulan's project.

649
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,920
We don't know about their situation.

650
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,039
Yes.

651
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,680
There's nothing to hide from.

652
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,600
Sure.

653
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,560
All right. That's it.

654
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,399
Sure. Goodbye.

655
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,279
Jin.

656
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,399
Give me a recharge.

657
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,560
I've been answering the phone
for the whole day.

658
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,080
I'm almost

659
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,039
out of energy.

660
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,159
It's killing me.

661
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:18,239
Half of my friends

662
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,920
are asking me about Luowei Yulan.

663
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,119
Let me ask you two.

664
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,519
How did the news spread?

665
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,759
I was in your office

666
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,999
at 8 a.m.

667
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:40,560
I return at 2 p.m.

668
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,320
I didn't even have lunch.

669
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,480
I only had some chocolate

670
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,519
and read some reports

671
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,519
before being summoned here.

672
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,840
Are you sure
your husband didn't say anything?

673
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm sure.

674
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,560
I just wanted to go down

675
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,639
and buy bread.

676
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:00,519
I met Qiao

677
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,960
and had a quick chat.

678
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,320
What did you talk about?

679
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,239
I didn't say anything. Just complaining.

680
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,879
Well,

681
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:22,200
in the morning,

682
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,279
the whole company knows

683
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,680
Qin Shi and I

684
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,920
are fighting to become

685
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,519
the association's attorney
because of the contract.

686
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,039
Qiao advised me

687
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,399
not to be so anxious

688
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,320
and wants me to date someone

689
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,800
to balance my hormones.

690
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,119
How can you laugh?

691
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,039
When something happens here,

692
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,440
everyone in the world

693
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,359
knows Cheng & Hui

694
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,759
has a liquidity problem.

695
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,359
I'm really suspecting

696
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,840
there's a camera inside this office.

697
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,519
You shouldn't be too angry.

698
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:05,960
Yes.

699
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,759
The whole world

700
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,999
knows about this now

701
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:08,840
but it's not

702
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,039
a bad thing for us.

703
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:11,519
Now,

704
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,840
Ms. Lan will be stressed.

705
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,639
She has no choice

706
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:14,840
but to return the 25 million yuan.

707
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:16,560
Otherwise, it'll be bad
for Luowei Yulan.

708
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:19,560
However, we would have offended

709
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,759
Ms. Lan surely.

710
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,239
Now, I really hope

711
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:27,480
there's a problem with Luowei Yulan.

712
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,519
Otherwise, we'll become

713
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,720
a company that doesn't keep a promise

714
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,159
and badmouth people

715
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:34,080
behind their backs.

716
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,359
Let alone Ms. Lan,

717
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:35,879
I would have

718
00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:37,239
offended 80% of the female entrepreneurs

719
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:38,759
in Pujiang.

720
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,320
Eat something

721
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,440
and have a drink of water.

722
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,159
Transfer all your calls

723
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,279
to me.

724
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,159
I'll answer it for you.

725
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,039
We weren't the ones

726
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,480
who spread the news.

727
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,239
Our conscience is clear. All right?

728
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,279
It's fine.

729
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,279
I can

730
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,399
still handle this.

731
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,119
Go and do your work.

732
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,279
Call me again if you need anything.

733
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:24,080
Do you know what is the thing about you

734
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,879
that impressed me most?

735
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,879
I think

736
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:27,200
you have very good mental qualities.

737
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:29,840
What do you mean?

738
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:32,159
If I were you,

739
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,639
I will immediately

740
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,440
find Qiao to make sure
we get our stories accurate.

741
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,639
Why should I

742
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:40,320
do that with Qiao?

743
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,399
If it's about

744
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:44,320
Luowei Yulan itself,

745
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,639
you can say it's none of your business.

746
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,600
However, only four people

747
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,920
know about the 25 million yuan.

748
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,039
Both of them won't tell anyone.

749
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,560
We are the only ones left remaining.

750
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,159
After I return to the office,

751
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,960
my internet history and chat logs

752
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,279
can be easily retrieved.

753
00:31:59,279 --> 00:31:59,800
What about you?

754
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:05,759
Even if you are in a law firm,

755
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:06,920
it doesn't mean

756
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,159
the news won't spread.

757
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:09,920
Oh.

758
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,879
What is your husband doing?

759
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:13,999
Financial investments?

760
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,759
I heard

761
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,960
news travels even faster

762
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,519
in his industry.

763
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,399
My husband said he never told anyone.

764
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,759
I'm sure he didn't.

765
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,239
Sometimes, you shouldn't

766
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,600
fully trust the things men said.

767
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,600
It's not just Luowei Yulan,

768
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,359
they also know

769
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,519
our firm's financial situation.

770
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,119
My husband won't know all these

771
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,639
no matter how great he is.

772
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:38,279
Let me tell you.

773
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,519
Mr. Jin and Ms. Tang

774
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,720
can't be bothered about this

775
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,239
because they are in this mess.

776
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,879
When they have calmed down,

777
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,440
they will figure it out

778
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,759
since it is something

779
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,560
that even I can figure out.

780
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,279
Hello, Qiao.

781
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,200
I have a very important thing

782
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
to tell you.

783
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:23,960
Hello, Mom.

784
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:25,600
Hua,

785
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,080
what are you doing?

786
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,359
I bought some ingredients
and am going home to cook.

787
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,480
Cook?

788
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,119
You really

789
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,399
love your girlfriend.

790
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,600
It's right.

791
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,840
Qin is working hard.

792
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,119
You should do well as her support.

793
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,359
Mom.

794
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:44,920
Why did you still arrange
a blind date for me

795
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,119
with the matchmaking company?

796
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:48,639
No. It's not me.

797
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,359
Mom.

798
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,920
You should know.

799
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,239
Didn't you

800
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,359
miss the last blind date

801
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,800
and lost a chance?

802
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:58,800
They have to

803
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,080
provide us with good service

804
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,359
since they are charging
such an expensive membership fee.

805
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,080
I didn't contact them.

806
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,200
They probably think

807
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,240
you are still single.

808
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,000
Hua,

809
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,079
since you are free,

810
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,079
it's fine to have a look.

811
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,440
You just need to

812
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,200
not let Qin find out.

813
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,440
Mom, I already tell her

814
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,280
I have a girlfriend.

815
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,799
Besides, I think

816
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:19,639
it's morally wrong

817
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,839
to go on a blind date
when I have a girlfriend.

818
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:23,680
You are right.

819
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,399
My son is right.

820
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,680
I support you.

821
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,040
My son is excellent.

822
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,359
I already watched

823
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:32,680
the video you showed me.

824
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,720
I'm very happy

825
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,639
to see both of you in love.

826
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,159
I even sent the video

827
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,960
to my dancing group's

828
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
younger members.

829
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,000
All of them said
both of you were a match.

830
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,760
Oh.

831
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,920
I still don't know

832
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,639
where Qin is working at.

833
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
I couldn't answer

834
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,720
when other people ask me.

835
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,879
That's not too good, right?

836
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,799
Qin Shi

837
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,240
is working in a law firm.

838
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,559
Which law firm

839
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:03,520
is she working at?

840
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:05,119
Why are you asking so many questions?

841
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,760
Are you going to find her?

842
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,879
No. I'm not that free.

843
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,280
Mom,

844
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,559
I got together with Qin Shi

845
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,040
according to your arrangement.

846
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:14,879
Besides,

847
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,240
we are getting along well.

848
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,480
You are also satisfied with everything.

849
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:18,960
Just stop

850
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,280
doing something new.

851
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,119
She is busy working.

852
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,520
Don't disturb her.

853
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,680
Isn't Qin a lawyer?

854
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,240
Let me help promote her

855
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,520
and introduce some clients to her.

856
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,520
She has big cases to work on.

857
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,440
She can't accept

858
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,599
your friends' cases.

859
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,200
All right. I'm hanging up.

860
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm almost at my stop.

861
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:46,480
Come in.

862
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,440
Ms. Qin.

863
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,520
The indictment
for Mr. Xiao's divorce case.

864
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,799
All right.

865
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,200
Send it by today.

866
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,599
Here.

867
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,520
This is...

868
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,440
Since you like

869
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,159
Egg Yolk Pastry,

870
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,119
I bought some just now.

871
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:04,760
You can eat it

872
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,520
when you are hungry.

873
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,159
Thank you.

874
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:11,839
What is your relationship

875
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,559
with Xi Mei PR?

876
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:14,920
Do you know anyone

877
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,960
working there?

878
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,240
We are quite close.

879
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,599
We knew each other since young.

880
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:23,879
Do you know

881
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,280
someone called Tao Junhui?

882
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,760
I think I heard his name.

883
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,319
He's a lawyer, right?

884
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,440
From the same school as you.

885
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:38,119
What else do you know?

886
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,720
I also know his girlfriend

887
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,599
is the daughter of Xi Mei PR's boss.

888
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,280
Do you know Mr. Tao?

889
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,920
We were in the same debate team

890
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,240
when we were in university.

891
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,599
Do you still need to know

892
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,839
anything else about him?

893
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:05,480
I know he is working at

894
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
New World Law Firm right now.

895
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,000
Can you ask around

896
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,000
to see which department he is in

897
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,399
and what cases he is accepting?

898
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,040
Why do you want to know all this?

899
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,520
I suspect he has

900
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,639
Luowei Yulan's case.

901
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,399
Investigate this in secret

902
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:23,399
and give me an update soon.

903
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,359
Don't worry.

904
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:25,200
I'm leaving now.

905
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,639
Hello.

906
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,040
What's wrong?

907
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,000
From your voice,

908
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,639
I feel like

909
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,079
I'm annoying you.

910
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,079
Someone annoyed me in the afternoon.

911
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:44,559
Who annoyed you?

912
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:45,480
Forget it.

913
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,599
What's wrong?

914
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,399
I'm troubled

915
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:50,159
and bored.

916
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,599
I want to drink with you.

917
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,240
Drink?

918
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,559
Do you know what time it is?

919
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,000
I know you are busy.

920
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,720
I've prepared

921
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,920
wine and snacks.

922
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,119
I'll wait for you at your house.

923
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,599
Sure. I'll do my best
to get off work early.

924
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:03,440
Sure.

925
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,680
Let's get drunk tonight.

926
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:17,839
Hold it!

927
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,399
Hold it!

928
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,920
Did you just move here?

929
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,000
(When did a handsome guy)

930
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,520
(move to the seventh floor here?)

931
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,680
(He's a family man.)

932
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,879
When did you have

933
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:03,960
such a handsome neighbour?

934
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,720
Handsome neighbour?

935
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,639
Pick up the phone.

936
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,799
Hey.

937
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,119
I suddenly remember

938
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,440
I have many meetings

939
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,520
so I will be very late.

940
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,079
Let's meet again another day.

941
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,399
I see.

942
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,079
It's fine.

943
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,559
I'm already at your house.

944
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:36,879
Someone is drinking with me.

945
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,639
Hello, are you at home?

946
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,440
Where are...

947
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm at home.

948
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,879
Don't worry.

949
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:07,119
Just do your work.

950
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,240
We will have a good time drinking.

951
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,200
Is it him?

952
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,839
I'm not short-sighted.

953
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,319
Is it him?

954
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,079
I think...

955
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,399
It is?

956
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,760
I don't know.

957
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,879
Weren't you there?

958
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,399
I was there

959
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:52,960
but there were too many people.

960
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
There were many people

961
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,960
between me and Ms. Qin.

962
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,480
Back then, I saw...

963
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,119
What did you see?

964
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,839
I saw...

965
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:07,879
I saw Ms. Qin

966
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,240
kiss him.

967
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,440
Why should I stare

968
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,159
at them?

969
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,399
Why do you care about

970
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,040
what her husband looks like?

971
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:29,440
What's wrong?

972
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,520
Is it wrong

973
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,760
to be curious?

974
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,960
I want to find a husband

975
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,720
who is similar to him.

976
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,200
Can I?

977
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,920
That's quite difficult.

978
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,599
Why?

979
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,119
Tread carefully.

980
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,559
Sure.

981
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,799
It's easy. All right?

982
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:54,920
Go do whatever you want

983
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,200
and find any type of guy you like.

984
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,639
You might be free

985
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,559
but I am really busy.

986
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,599
Can you

987
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,920
let me finish my work first?

988
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:02,960
Can you?

989
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:11,367
Isn't there a picture

990
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:12,760
of Ms. Qin and her husband

991
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,520
on her desk?

992
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,680
Ms. Li.

993
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,359
What are you doing?

994
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,879
Looking for Ms. Qin?

995
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:56,079
She went out because of an emergency.

996
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,359
It's nothing. Leave me alone.

997
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,319
Sure.

998
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:08,920
Call me if you need me.

999
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:11,639
