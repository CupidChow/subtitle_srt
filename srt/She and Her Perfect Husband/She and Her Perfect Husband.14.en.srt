=She And Her Perfect Husband=

18
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,090
=Episode 14=

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,520
Any entry point

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,279
for the foreign assets?

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,160
According to what the client
gave us,

22
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,839
their overseas account is all

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,399
her husband's personal bank account.

24
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,600
It'll be difficult to investigate them

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,160
and even if we manage to do that,

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,080
the division of foreign assets

27
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,199
will be challenging too.

28
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,440
The court has frozen

29
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,960
the business accounts of

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,440
the beauty parlor and the ECE center.

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,160
Other than paying the employees' wages,

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
no money can go out.

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
Financially,

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,720
it is healthy.

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,440
But

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,360
no one knows what the future holds.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,720
He is the worst

38
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,399
of the worst husbands.

39
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,759
The only good news we have now

40
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,639
is that our client's biggest asset

41
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,360
is her stocks

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,559
that represent 28% of the Yulan Group.

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,520
She inherited this asset

44
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,320
and one of the conditions of the inheritance

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,559
is that it cannot be transferred
to her spouse.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,639
Even though

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,399
the client's husband

48
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,679
has been the de facto operator
of the business,

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,960
he doesn't own any shares.

50
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,039
To put it crudely,

51
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,160
he's just an employee.

52
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,279
However,

53
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,360
he did help

54
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,479
expanding the Yulan Group.

55
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,399
The client's brother

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,919
used to run the company.

57
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,520
Why did the management

58
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,679
fall into the hands
of the client's husband?

59
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:19,320
Keen observation, Miss Qin.

60
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:20,639
Indeed.

61
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,600
The earliest leader of the Yulan Group

62
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,839
wasn't the client's husband.

63
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,080
After the founder of Yulan Group

64
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,720
passed away,

65
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,039
his three offspring were given shares.

66
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,759
The eldest son got 23%.

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,919
The client and her sister

68
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,039
each got 14%.

69
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,199
However,

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
there was a change of equity.

71
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,279
The client's sister,

72
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,600
Zhao Danping's mother,

73
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,320
transferred her shares to the client.

74
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,479
The client then became

75
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,639
the biggest shareholder
of the Yulan Group

76
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,559
and her husband

77
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,839
became the group's general manager.

78
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,440
Zhao Danping once said

79
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,119
she wasn't on good terms

80
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,800
with her brother.

81
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,479
The source of their animosity

82
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,080
might be from this alteration.

83
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,279
Yes.

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,279
A change of equity and leadership,

85
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,639
resulting in a fallout between siblings.

86
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:57,399
That makes sense.

87
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,600
Although the client's husband

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,039
runs the Yulan Group,

89
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,000
he doesn't have

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,720
any direct link to the group.

91
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,279
I suppose

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,559
it bothers him too.

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,160
He's running

94
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,600
a company that will never

95
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,399
belong to him.

96
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,600
How much are the stocks worth

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,359
if we liquidate them?

98
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,399
Anyone did the math?

99
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,279
Using the market price...

100
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,839
Let me calculate.

101
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,670
(Residence, Company, Beauty Parlor,
CEC Center, Yulan Group)

102
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,279
2.2 billion yuan.

103
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,040
Yes, 2.2 billion yuan.

104
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,119
Everything has been calculated.

105
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,640
Pang Dingfang planned

106
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:46,799
to use the Yulan Group

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,320
to bail Luowei Yulan.

108
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
Does he hate his wife that much?

109
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,640
Luowei Yulan was founded five years ago.

110
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,160
Did something happen

111
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,119
five years ago?

112
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,880
Five years ago...

113
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,480
Five years ago, his son went
to study abroad.

114
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,359
He befriended his son's current guardian,

115
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Joyce Wang.

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,279
No way.

117
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,200
Other than her youth,

118
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,000
Joyce Wang isn't like a supermodel.

119
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
Why would Pang Dingfang devise

120
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,119
such a scheme for her?

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,239
If he wants,

122
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,640
he can find someone more beautiful.

123
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,279
He has weird taste.

124
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,760
It's not just

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,760
about the woman.

126
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,679
The son of our client's brother

127
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,000
entered the Yulan Group five years ago.

128
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:32,679
Obviously,

129
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,079
as the company's future leader,

130
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,040
Pang Dingfang,

131
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,799
felt threatened.

132
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,920
Pang Dingfang must have repressed

133
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,799
himself a lot when he was younger.

134
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,799
He had to rely on his wife

135
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,679
to get his big break.

136
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:47,880
At his age,

137
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,279
an affair isn't just a game of lust.

138
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,440
It's also a declaration of his existence.

139
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,839
Let's eat.

140
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,839
Okay.

141
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,600
Let's order something.

142
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,079
What's up?

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,040
I have overtime today.

144
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,359
I can't treat you to a meal.

145
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,600
All right.

146
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,600
When will you be done?

147
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,040
Not sure. Why?

148
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,679
Nothing.

149
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,399
Let me know when you're done.

150
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,040
I'll pick you up.

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,399
No need.

152
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,000
I have another call.

153
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:24,600
I have to hang up now.

154
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,839
Hello?

155
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,359
Hello?

156
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,519
(It's me.)

157
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,880
Hello?

158
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,519
What's up?

159
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,160
I want to talk to you

160
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,200
about Luowei Yulan.

161
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,200
Luowei Yulan

162
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,640
has nothing to do with me.

163
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,799
I know Cheng & Hui is representing

164
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,399
Ms. Lan in the divorce case.

165
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,880
If this is what

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,040
you want to talk about, just forget it.

167
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,839
I won't divulge

168
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,200
anything regarding Luowei Yulan.

169
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,519
Change is always one step ahead
of our plan.

170
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,279
We should talk about it in person.

171
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,799
If you can,

172
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll wait for you around your law firm.

173
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
I have a meeting now.

174
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,880
It will last for several hours.

175
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,760
I can wait.

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,799
Miss Li, the food is here.

177
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,600
So soon.

178
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,519
It's still hot.

179
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,239
- What is it?
- No idea.

180
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,880
- It's hot.
- Congee, perhaps.

181
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,839
It stinks!

182
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,440
Don't touch me!

183
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,920
A tissue paper, please?

184
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:32,519
Give me one.

185
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,600
What is that?

186
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,239
Someone delivered it to the front desk

187
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,399
and said it was for Miss Qin.

188
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,200
For me?

189
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,119
We thought

190
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,000
it was the food you ordered

191
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,279
and we were just wondering
why it arrived so quickly.

192
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,920
It stinks!

193
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,420
(Mind your own business)

194
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,440
This is just

195
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
a childish, dirty trick.

196
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,399
Take it away.

197
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:52,559
You do it.

198
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,519
You.

199
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Hurry up.

200
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,200
Hurry.

201
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,679
I'll help you.

202
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,679
Call the police.

203
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:00,920
Okay.

204
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,440
Stop spraying that.

205
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,000
It makes it smell weird.

206
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,880
Let's call it a day here.

207
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,480
Let's go back.

208
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,079
A drink on me.

209
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:11,839
You want to join me?

210
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,079
No, thanks. I have plans.

211
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,040
Wipe this spot too.

212
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,959
Me?

213
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,480
Of course.

214
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,520
(2007 Debate Tournament Champion)

215
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,239
(The meeting ended prematurely.)

216
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,359
(Where are you?)

217
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,719
(The underground parking.)

218
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,960
(Should I come to you?)

219
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,080
(No, I'll come to you.)

220
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,920
(Yang Hua)

221
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,840
Hello?

222
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,400
Yes.

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,599
You called

224
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,840
at a great time.

225
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,119
Miss Qin, is it?

226
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,799
No.

227
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,400
Darling.

228
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,640
I'm at Gate No.6.

229
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,960
Okay.

230
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,119
I'll come find you now then.

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,559
How sweet of you

232
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,000
to call me today.

233
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,640
Miss Qin.

234
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,479
It's okay, Miss Qin.

235
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,919
My friend wants to see you.

236
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,640
It's about Luowei Yulan.

237
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,359
You're mistaken.

238
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,239
- I'm not Miss Qin.
- Come with us.

239
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,039
Darling.

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,440
Miss Qin, you...

241
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:18,719
Give chase!

242
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,799
(Hello?)

243
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,640
(Miss Qin?)

244
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,320
(Miss Qin?)

245
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,840
After so many divorce cases,

246
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm afraid of marriage now.

247
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,799
I lost all hope in humanity

248
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,840
and good conscience.

249
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Is this an occupational injury?

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,960
The marital system

251
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:37,119
was constructed to protect the males.

252
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,000
In a matriarchy,

253
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,320
there is no marriage.

254
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,039
You want protection for women

255
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,440
in a patriarchy?

256
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,520
Our legal system

257
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,280
is doing its best now.

258
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,559
I agree.

259
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,200
No.

260
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,200
I don't.

261
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,400
Our laws

262
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,599
protect the most vulnerable

263
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,559
but the most vulnerable

264
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,159
is not necessarily women.

265
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,520
Isn't everyone

266
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,840
asking for

267
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,080
gender equality now?

268
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:00,000
When it's convenient,

269
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,200
you're all for equality.

270
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,039
When it's inconvenient,

271
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,840
you call it discrimination.

272
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,080
Unless men get a womb too

273
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,880
to share the risk of pregnancy,

274
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,840
otherwise,

275
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
equality will never truly exist.

276
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:11,840
Miss Li.

277
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,119
Don't you agree, Miss Li?

278
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:18,919
If men have a womb,

279
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,440
then

280
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,760
this world only has one sex,

281
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,880
not two.

282
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,679
Have you not read the news?

283
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
Women in China

284
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,159
are becoming more and more independent.

285
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,479
Now, it's not

286
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,000
a Chinese problem.

287
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
It's a problem worldwide.

288
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,000
And here,

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
independence for female

290
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,760
isn't just about the family

291
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,039
or the responsibilities
that come with it.

292
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,200
Hi, this is Li Dai. Who's speaking?

293
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,159
Miss Li.

294
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,159
I'm Yang Hua's mom.

295
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,679
Hi, Mrs. Yang.

296
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,919
Did you find her?

297
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,640
No.

298
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,520
She's so elusive.

299
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,479
I will find her.

300
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,039
Let's go.

301
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,719
Why are you here, dude?

302
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,359
This has nothing to do with you

303
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,840
so don't meddle.

304
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,359
Do you know you are

305
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,119
committing a crime here?

306
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:16,479
I'm a lawyer

307
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,840
and I have called the police.

308
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:18,880
Leave now.

309
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,039
Fine.

310
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,320
Dude.

311
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,400
You know laws

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,799
but so do we.

313
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,799
We just want

314
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
to talk

315
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,159
to Miss Qin.

316
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:30,320
We won't do anything else.

317
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,719
Also, I'm glad the police are coming.

318
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,239
I have reasons to believe

319
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,159
that you are assaulting Miss Qin.

320
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:43,799
Let her go.

321
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:44,479
Let her go!

322
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,640
Qin Shi.

323
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,960
Remember what I taught you?

324
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:53,760
Does it hurt?

325
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:54,559
Yes.

326
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,080
Get up.

327
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,159
I can't.

328
00:14:59,359 --> 00:14:59,880
Get up.

329
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,359
I want to be a lawyer.

330
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,799
Not a security guard.

331
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,599
Being an attorney
is a dangerous job.

332
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,479
Protect me then.

333
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,719
I can't stay

334
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,640
by your side forever.

335
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,000
Get up.

336
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,359
Listen to me.

337
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,479
For girls,

338
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,400
your self-defense consists
of one technique.

339
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,000
The surprise attack.

340
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,479
Run if you can't subdue them.

341
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,200
I'll run now.

342
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,239
Why are you here?

343
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:42,960
Let's go.

344
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,479
Wait.

345
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,080
That side.

346
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,479
He can deal with it.

347
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,359
We're not doing him a favor
by going there.

348
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:46,719
Let's go.

349
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,280
No.

350
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,080
He is outnumbered.

351
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,799
He can't get out.

352
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,599
Just go back.

353
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,359
Wait for me here. I'll go.

354
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,440
Sorry.

355
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,159
I...

356
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:24,919
Are you okay?

357
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,840
I'm fine.

358
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:47,520
Darling.

359
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,960
Are you hungry?

360
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,320
What do you want to eat?

361
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,119
I'll cook for you.

362
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,200
I don't have the appetite.

363
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,239
There are some leftovers in the fridge.

364
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,440
Just reheat them.

365
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,040
Darling.

366
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,760
What's the matter?

367
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,680
They say once your son

368
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,560
finds a wife,
he will forget about his mom.

369
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,680
But I thought

370
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,800
since I raised my own son,

371
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,880
he won't do that to me.

372
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,439
But then,

373
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,359
he's gone, just like that.

374
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,880
Filial piety? Gratitude?

375
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,280
None.

376
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,920
He tossed me away just like that.

377
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,160
He moved out just like that.

378
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,119
And you always say a son
will always be close to his mom.

379
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,640
But you

380
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,079
don't know your son at all.

381
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,479
What do you mean?

382
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,760
Our son

383
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,839
is possessive.

384
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,079
Whenever he likes something,

385
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,239
he won't make compromises

386
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,520
for anyone else.

387
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,520
He's always been like this.

388
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,760
Just like me.

389
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,479
But...

390
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,719
But they hardly met.

391
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,479
You mean what exists between them

392
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,959
is real?

393
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,719
Look.

394
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,680
We are the victims.

395
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,040
We have the letter of authorization.

396
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,920
We're doing this for our client.

397
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,040
They hit us first.

398
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,839
It looks fine. Just a bit swollen.

399
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,439
You're fine.

400
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,560
What do you mean?

401
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:30,239
You're not a doctor.

402
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,040
You don't know whether I'm fine.

403
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,520
If you can talk back like that,

404
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,400
it means you're fine.

405
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,040
Does it hurt?

406
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:40,959
Let's go.

407
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,520
In my car.

408
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,880
We'll head to the police station

409
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:44,719
and leave a statement.

410
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,280
We have a car already.

411
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,760
It's the same.

412
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,319
I still need to speak to Qin Shi.

413
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,560
All the reasons not to.

414
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,839
If you want to speak to my wife,

415
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,640
you sit in my car.

416
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,520
It's getting late.

417
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,839
Let's make it quick.

418
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,880
I still have your ID card.

419
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,439
I'm not interested

420
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
in someone else's relationship.

421
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,319
All right.

422
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,160
Let's go. I'm starving.

423
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,280
What's the matter?

424
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
I don't like the cushion.

425
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,719
Get off the car then.

426
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:47,000
You insisted

427
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,839
on coming with us.

428
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,000
It is my car.

429
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,119
Mr. Tao.

430
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,280
Weren't you looking for me?

431
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,040
I want to talk to you

432
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,839
about the debt settlement.

433
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,000
Debt settlement?

434
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,359
Find Pang Dingfang.

435
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,079
Why me?

436
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,280
You've been investigating

437
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,479
their community assets, haven't you?

438
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,520
Pang Dingfang will definitely

439
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,319
be found guilty.

440
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,400
But if he's keen to settle his debt,

441
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,079
we can plead for leniency.

442
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,640
The debt is Pang Dingfang's

443
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,760
problem.

444
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,359
It has nothing to do with my client.

445
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,199
But the problem

446
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,719
occurred during their marriage.

447
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,239
Pang Dingfang and Ms. Lan are married.

448
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,400
She cannot walk out

449
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,439
of this scot-free.

450
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,560
In a marriage,

451
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,880
the couple shares profits

452
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:39,800
and liabilities.

453
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,400
If one party makes a mistake,

454
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,560
the other won't walk away immediately.

455
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:45,920
Just like your husband here.

456
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,719
Unemployed.

457
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,599
You won't divorce him

458
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,000
right away
because he's unemployed, will you?

459
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,880
(Wu Fei, you blabbermouth.)

460
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,040
A married couple not only
owes shared responsibilities

461
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,439
to each other,

462
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,239
but also to society,

463
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,640
like the creditor.

464
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,280
Ms. Lan

465
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,040
represented Luowei Yulan once.

466
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,079
The victims trusted her

467
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,280
and the Yulan Group.

468
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:23,199
But they fell into this scheme.

469
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,040
I don't like

470
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,079
how you phrased this.

471
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,839
In business, we talk about profits.

472
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,040
Don't gaslight me

473
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,199
when you suffer a loss.

474
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,920
I didn't

475
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,439
see them give my client

476
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,760
dividends when there were profits.

477
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,479
Also,

478
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,199
whether my client

479
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,959
had a role in Luowei Yulan or not,

480
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:44,319
that's up to the relevant authorities to decide.

481
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,319
You don't get a say.

482
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,119
Besides,

483
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,560
in this whole debacle,

484
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,239
my client

485
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,479
is the biggest victim.

486
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:52,239
Asking her to settle Pang Dingfang's debt?

487
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,560
Absolutely not.

488
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,839
The creditors will not be pleased

489
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,560
with your attitude.

490
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,319
If you make an effort

491
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,319
to settle the debt,

492
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,760
I can guarantee

493
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,439
that her other businesses

494
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,439
will remain operational and unperturbed.

495
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,199
Otherwise, all her companies will be frozen.

496
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,760
And when you finally get
the divorce judgment,

497
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:12,800
those companies

498
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,119
will have to file for bankruptcy.

499
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,280
Pardon?

500
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,239
Are you threatening me now?

501
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,199
Eyes on the road.

502
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:39,959
Just go back.

503
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,880
We'll hail a cab.

504
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,599
Think about

505
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,160
what I told you in the car.

506
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,239
Don't impose your values

507
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,359
on your client.

508
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,439
If this carries on,

509
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,000
no one will win.

510
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,839
I'll be frank.

511
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,040
I did not involve personal emotions

512
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:01,880
in my work.

513
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,839
Don't underestimate me.

514
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,839
Call me when you make up your mind.

515
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,319
Wait.

516
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,319
As an attorney,

517
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,560
I know you're doing your best here.

518
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,000
But this case

519
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,920
cannot be solved by one person alone.

520
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,599
Don't take it too far.

521
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,119
I don't know

522
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,839
if other law firms
just want the retainer fee

523
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,079
before they say ciao.

524
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,439
But not me, at least.

525
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,119
I just want my clients

526
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,959
to get their money back,

527
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,079
and not just a court decision
that they have won.

528
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,479
Therefore, I won't give up.

529
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,800
We're home soon.

530
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,959
Why are you eating junk food?

531
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,959
I just can't wait any longer.

532
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,000
It's so delicious.

533
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,880
I was starving.

534
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:57,319
Do you want some?

535
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:58,880
Radish.

536
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,119
Just one bite.

537
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,400
Whatever.

538
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,359
Speak now.

539
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:12,800
What?

540
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:14,800
Stop pretending.

541
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,680
Why were you there?

542
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,479
What?

543
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,199
What?

544
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,199
Stop repeating my question.

545
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,760
I do not believe in coincidence.

546
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,160
Don't tell me

547
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,599
you came to pick me up.

548
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,040
Coincidentally, you have a weapon.

549
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,280
Coincidentally, you appeared

550
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,800
at the right moment.

551
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,839
When will you be done?

552
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,239
Let me know when you're done.

553
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:53,839
I'll pick you up.

554
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,319
Why did they ambush me?

555
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,839
I have a friend who suffered a loss

556
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,880
due to Luowei Yulan too.

557
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,880
And I learned about debt collectors from him.

558
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,520
Those people are willing to do anything

559
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,560
for the right price.

560
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,719
I have met

561
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:19,680
all three of them.

562
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,479
Either way,

563
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,439
thank you.

564
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,400
You risked yourself to save me.

565
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,520
You have done

566
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,640
what our contract

567
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,880
didn't ask you to do.

568
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:33,880
So...

569
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,800
Thank you very much.

570
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:39,920
No need.

571
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:40,760
I can't just

572
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,280
stand there and do nothing
when you're in danger.

573
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,239
As a humanitarian...

574
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,359
Stop ruining the moment.

575
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,239
Wait.

576
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,680
Am I bleeding?

577
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,400
Does it hurt?

578
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:06,359
Yes.

579
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:18,839
Be gentle.

580
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,160
Oh,

581
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,239
I need to compliment you today.

582
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,920
That was a masterful act.

583
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,199
The rage and hostility

584
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,400
a husband has

585
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,439
against his wife's ex-boyfriend.

586
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,640
It was vivid.

587
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,520
Breathtaking.

588
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:43,280
100 thumbs-up to you

589
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,119
and a seal of approval.

590
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Miss Qin.

591
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:47,920
If you can stop

592
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,079
being clumsy, I'll give you

593
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,959
my seal of approval too.

594
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,760
Thank you.

595
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:58,800
No need to keep it away.

596
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,040

Miss Qin,

608
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,359
based on what happened today,

609
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,920
I advise you to quit this case.

610
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,400
Why?

611
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,760
Aren't you afraid?

612
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,319
I am.

613
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,640
But I can't

614
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,439
back off whenever I'm afraid.

615
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,599
Have you heard of the saying?

616
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,800
Evil prevails

617
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,599
because when someone does something bad,

618
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,439
people do not intervene.

619
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:02,959
If I, from the family department,

620
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:05,439
quit because of this,

621
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,719
then my colleagues from the

622
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,839
criminal case department
can't even work.

623
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,680
Protect justice.

624
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:14,439
Protect the rights of every citizen.

625
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,560
They are why I want to be an attorney.

626
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,560
Are you touched now?

627
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,800
Do I look like a saint now?

628
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,000
No.

629
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,079
I thought your pursuit

630
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,040
of fame and glory

631
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,280
will compel you to take risks for others

632
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,000
and you wouldn't regret a thing.

633
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:35,800
All right.

634
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,040
Done.

You're back.

642
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:43,920
Why so late?

643
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,400
Did I wake you up?

644
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,079
A lot of work today

645
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:51,920
so I came back late.

646
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,760
What happened to your face?

647
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,479
Why are you injured?

648
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,599
I hit something.

649
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,280
Let's go to the hospital now.

650
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,439
It'll leave a scar otherwise.

651
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,280
It won't.

652
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,119
Let's go.

653
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:11,239
Your arm is injured too?

654
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,439
I'm fine.

655
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,119
What do you mean by you're fine?

656
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,640
Your face and your arm are injured.

657
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,040
You came back this late.

658
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:17,959
What happened?

659
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,319
Don't make me worry.

660
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,439
I'll tell you everything.

661
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,479
Hurry.

662
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:32,239
Why did the debt collectors go to Miss Qin?

663
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:34,119
She didn't owe them money.

664
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,839
They don't want her

665
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,640
to handle Luowei Yulan's case.

666
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,160
I went to the procuratorate today.

667
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:41,680
Pang Dingfang fled abroad.

668
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,959
Criminal charges will take some time.

669
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,280
Even his representative wants

670
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,760
to use civil laws to mediate

671
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
the debt settlement.

672
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,119
Your firm

673
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,760
asked Lan Xiaoting to divorce
Pang Dingfang.

674
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,000
Do you know

675
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,520
how tough that makes my work?

676
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,640
If you...

677
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,599
No, no, no.

678
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,000
Stop accusing me.

679
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,280
This has nothing to do with me.

680
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,560
But aren't you

681
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,680
handling this case?

682
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,560
Thanks to your pointing out loud and clear

683
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,319
that she shouldn't use me to fish out info,

684
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,479
she kicked me out of the case.

685
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,400
I can't help you even if I want to now.

686
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,640
It's my fault.

687
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:20,959
Sorry.

688
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
It is your fault.

689
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,599
Others can benefit from nepotism

690
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,199
but it somehow

691
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,239
becomes my drawback.

692
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,439
And you're all wounded too.

693
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,319
I already apologized to you.

694
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,119
Not in the way I like.

695
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:42,280
Fine.

696
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,079
It's all my fault.

697
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,000
No more next time.

698
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,839
I take your silence as forgiveness?

699
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:04,719
Come.

700
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,520
Heal me.

701
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,800
Bear with me.

702
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,800
That looks like it hurts.

703
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,600
Want some more warm water?

704
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,000
Let me know

705
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,280
if you need my help.

706
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,840
(I went to work.)

707
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:17,879
(Try the breakfast I made.)

708
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,120
Hello?

709
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,320
Hey.

710
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:48,280
It's me, Zhou.

711
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,320
I'm in the factory now.

712
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:51,479
Okay.

713
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:53,320
Follow

714
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,800
my orders now.

715
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,280
Okay.

716
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,950
(Cheng & Hui Law Office)

717
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,600
(Cheng & Hui Law Office)
Thank you.

718
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,280
Hi.

719
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,280
Good morning.

720
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:02,840
Have you heard?

721
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,399
There was a brawl in the office yesterday.

722
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,000
Really?

723
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:08,280
How do you know?

724
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,199
I heard from the security guard.

725
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,120
Several thugs tried to kidnap a female lawyer.

726
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,679
- A female lawyer?
- A female lawyer?

727
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,159
From our firm?

728
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,479
From our firm?

729
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:20,719
- Morning, Miss Li.
- Morning, Miss Li.

730
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,439
When did that happen?

731
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,840
Last night.

732
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,120
Around eight or nine.

733
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:28,879
But it should be fine.

734
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,000
Two men were there to help her.

735
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,080
We were wondering if it was Miss Qin.

736
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,080
Stop speculating.

737
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:42,000
Ready your documents.

738
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,239
We have a meeting soon.

739
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,159
- Okay.
- Okay.

740
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,439
Back to work.

741
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:02,919
Haitao.

742
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,879
- Qin Shi.
- Miss Qin.

743
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,919
Who attacked me just now?

744
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,959
Didn't you say

745
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,120
you had plans last night?

746
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,320
Why did you sleep in your office then?

747
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,560
Don't tell me you argued

748
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:17,360
with your husband?

749
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,679
Miss Li.

750
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,199
You should

751
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:25,439
mind your own business.

752
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,959
Meet more men. Get on more dates.

753
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,320
You did spend a fortune already.

754
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:31,040
Don't you agree?

755
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:39,520
Your tongue is as sharp as always.

756
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,679
I will not forget

757
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,800
what you said today.

758
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,719
See you in the conference room.

759
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:01,520
What are you doing?

760
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,439
Who told you to erase it?

761
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:05,560
Madam Tang came

762
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,320
and said we didn't need

763
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,120
to handle this case anymore.

764
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,159
Really?

765
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,320
Why?

766
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,719
I meant it literally.

767
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:18,199
- Why?
- Why?

768
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,520
Isn't it clear?

769
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,600
Both of you

770
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,320
already did the math yesterday.

771
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:28,479
Although Lan Xiaoting

772
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,159
does not run Luowei Yulan

773
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:31,159
nor participated

774
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,520
in the illegal fund-raising or fraud,

775
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,639
she's still the company's shareholder.

776
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,760
She has to settle the company's debt.

777
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:39,439
But the capital goods launched

778
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,320
by Luowei Yulan

779
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,439
is part of their business activities.

780
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,719
It's not the company's liabilities.

781
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,439
And that includes real estate,

782
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:45,639
the ECE center,

783
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,080
and the beauty parlor who had
their stocks leveraged.

784
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,600
Although the monthly installment
is heavy,

785
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,879
there isn't a huge problem.

786
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,120
After all, she still owns

787
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,199
the shares of the Yulan Group.

788
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:56,719
Pang Dingfang used the company's name

789
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:57,760
to take out loans

790
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:59,600
worth up to one billion yuan.

791
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:02,399
When did that happen?

792
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,320
We didn't find it.

793
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,000
(The loan agreement)
Have a look at the loan agreement.

794
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,879
(Guarantor: Lan Xiaoting)
Who is the guarantor?

795
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:13,320
I have face-checked with Ms. Lan.

796
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:14,760
Whether she gets a divorce or not,

797
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:16,280
she'll be left with nothing.

798
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,719
I have discussed this with Jin.

799
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,439
Based on the current situation,

800
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,280
there isn't much room left

801
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,159
for us to wiggle.

802
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,639
The firm shouldn't

803
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,399
waste too many resources on it.

804
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:30,360
So we leave Ms. Lan high and dry now?

805
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:33,840
Because there's nothing much we can do.

806
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,040
I will find someone else

807
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,439
to follow up on this case.

808
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,239
You two can move on to other tasks.

809
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,560
If there's nothing else,

810
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,679
I will go back to my work.

811
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:58,600
Madam Tang,

812
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:01,840
if we abandon Ms. Lan now,

813
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,879
no one can help her.

814
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,879
Last night,

815
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,719
I came up with a plan.

816
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,280
It could use some tweaking

817
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:09,439
but it's feasible.

818
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,000
Qin Shi.

819
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,479
This is non-negotiable.

820
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,000
I'll leave then.

821
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,879
Wait.

822
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,439
Are you all right?

823
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:32,320
I...

824
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:36,600
I heard about last night.

825
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,120
I was so scared.

826
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,239
If something

827
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,560
happened to you, what should I do?

828
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,399
I'm fine now.

829
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,000
Don't work today.

830
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,479
Take a day off.

831
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,679
Go home and rest up.

832
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,320
Do a full body check-up too.

833
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,320
You can claim us.

834
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,239
I'm fine.

835
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,760
Really?

836
00:42:58,679 --> 00:42:59,600
A thank-you present

837
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,360
from Jin and me.

838
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:04,840
I'll accept it.

839
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:07,000
You always do.

840
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,360
This is still a work in progress.

841
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,439
After the trimming,

842
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,639
they will be assembled here.

843
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:18,399
(Investigating)

844
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:19,280
(the manufacturing industry is easy.)

845
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:21,000
(Look at these five elements.)

846
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,080
(Teamwork, management,)

847
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,760
(technology, market, and finance.)

848
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:25,760
(They will show you)

849
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
(the best spots.)

850
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,479
(The staged ones.)

851
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,600
(So you have to look into)

852
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,560
(the details.)

853
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,040
(For example,)

854
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,840
(are the materials organized?)

855
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,679
(Is it clean?)

856
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
(How is the worker's)

857
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:38,560
(morale?)

858
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,080
(Is the uniform up to the code?)

859
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:42,800
(Are the bicycles placed)

860
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:44,040
(in a tidy fashion?)

861
00:43:44,479 --> 00:43:45,600
(Don't overlook these details.)

862
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
(The bigger the company,)

863
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:48,800
(the more these details can tell you)

864
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,239
(about its management.)

865
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:52,679
Also,

866
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:53,719
