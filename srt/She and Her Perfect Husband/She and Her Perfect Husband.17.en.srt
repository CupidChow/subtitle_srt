=Episode 17=

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,359
Yang Hua.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,639
How did you meet Shi?

21
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:02,879
Yes, how?

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,160
It was

23
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:08,799
the most perfect encounter.

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,600
Life is like an endless journey.

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,879
As time goes by,

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,639
you might forget

27
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,879
where you started

28
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,480
and where you should stop by.

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,760
Until I met Qin Shi.

30
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,879
-After meeting her.
-What is he on about?

31
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,120
Suddenly, all the paths I took

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,159
have an end.

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,359
All the waiting has a meaning.

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,760
She is the sea of the universe.

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,680
So full of love and kindness.

36
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,120
Dude, you're a poet.

37
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,200
The sea of the universe, you said?

38
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,560
More like a tsunami.

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Do you have seasickness?

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,719
Wenyu.

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,359
But...

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,680
You don't get it.

43
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,560
Qin Shi is the most adorable person

44
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,680
I have met.

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,840
Was it love at first sight?

46
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,400
Well,

47
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,960
I fell in love with her right away.

48
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:26,879
All right.

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,799
Yang.

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,439
You two love each other deeply.

51
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,519
That's great.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,359
But that can't

53
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,320
sustain a marriage.

54
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,999
You need to live with each other.

55
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,639
You live with her separately.

56
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,799
That's not good.

57
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,600
Not at all.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
Have you thought about

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
moving to another place
and getting a new job?

60
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,480
Mister.

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,480
Actually I lied.

62
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,400
I didn't study abroad.

63
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,120
I...

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,719
I do...

65
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,960
Are you drunk?

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,999
Are you making

67
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:03,719
things up now?

68
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,639
No, I'm not drunk.

69
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,359
That's what

70
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:07,799
a drunk person would say.

71
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,320
Are you done eating?

72
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,680
Can we go back? Let's go.

73
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,839
No one leaves.

74
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,999
Wenyu, stand before the door.

75
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,159
Sure.

76
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,480
I'm serious.

77
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,279
If none of you can tell me
what's happening,

78
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,719
no one leaves this house.

79
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:23,600
Speak now.

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,279
Mom, you have no idea.

81
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,719
It was so crowded down there.

82
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,839
It's true then?

83
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:39,839
So

84
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,240
what does this Yang Hua do for a living?

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
Are they in a relationship for real?

86
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,320
Will they get married?

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,959
Give me the important details.

88
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:47,719
Eat later.

89
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,240
So... Ouch.

90
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,439
Everything became crystal clear today.

91
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,480
Yang Hua got drunk

92
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,600
and confessed everything.

93
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,240
International experience?

94
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,119
An annual income of millions?

95
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,040
All of them are fake.

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,119
He's worse than me.

97
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,559
He's unemployed.

98
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,200
Unemployed?

99
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,360
How does he feed himself then?

100
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,920
How can he date Qin Shi?

101
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,959
Stock investment?

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,080
Yes.

103
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,839
Do you have a place?

104
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,719
Yes, I live with my parents.

105
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,320
Don't tell me

106
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,959
you will still live with them

107
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,760
after you marry Shi.

108
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
I can

109
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,480
live with Qin Shi.

110
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,879
So you're

111
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,279
marrying into our family.

112
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,159
After you two tie the knot,

113
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,480
I suppose the wife
will be the breadwinner.

114
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,600
And you will be the househusband?

115
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,879
If possible,

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,879
why not?

117
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,800
Why not?

118
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,600
You're very smart actually.

119
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,240
How much can you earn

120
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,360
with your investment?

121
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,119
Can you feed yourself?

122
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,439
Or are you asking Qin Shi

123
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,719
to feed you instead?

124
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,480
Stop it.

125
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,719
Human desire is bottomless.

126
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,719
To have the best lift,

127
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,080
a monthly income
of 4,500 yuan is enough.

128
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,800
Are we done?

129
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:09,959
Hey!

130
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,999
Leech!

131
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,959
You're a leech.

132
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,200
There, there.

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,920
I knew it.

134
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:20,200
You date my daughter for this.

135
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,800
Shi, look at you.

136
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,879
Look at you.

137
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Tao Junhui and you were doing fine

138
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,719
but you broke up with him

139
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,240
for this man here.

140
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,999
Is that true?

141
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,559
Look.

142
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,839
How is he better than Tao Junhui?

143
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,559
Shi.

144
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,920
I don't need you to marry

145
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,800
a rich husband.

146
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,279
But find

147
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,719
someone reliable at least.

148
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,559
What is this?

149
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,999
Yang Hua is reliable.

150
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,920
You...

151
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,719
What about him screams reliable?

152
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,320
Does he have a reliable job?

153
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,600
Does he have a house?

154
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,520
He has nothing.

155
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,959
What got into your mind?

156
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:00,839
You know,

157
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,760
Tao Junhui is such a good choice.

158
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,760
You dated him for a long time

159
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,080
but you would never marry him.

160
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,719
And you found this thing here?

161
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,439
Tao Junhui. Tao Junhui.

162
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,439
All you can talk about is him.

163
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,360
I...

164
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,719
I'll tell you the truth then.

165
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,080
His family doesn't like me.

166
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,439
I dated him for many years.

167
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,040
But he never told his family

168
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,360
about my family.

169
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,320
Do you know why?

170
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,559
Because his family

171
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:31,119
doesn't want someone

172
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,119
from a broken family.

173
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,959
Someone like me

174
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,200
is a pariah, a parasite,

175
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,040
a delinquent, and a lowly being.

176
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,719
Do you get it?

177
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
It's not that
I didn't want to marry him.

178
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,839
They didn't want me to marry him.

179
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,719
Happy now?

180
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,240
They didn't want her.

181
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,839
What a twist.

182
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:02,399
Mom.

183
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:04,719
You know how

184
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,839
she's always cocky and arrogant?

185
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,320
And you remember

186
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,920
how proud she looked
when they broke up?

187
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,240
She was dumped.

188
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,480
I love

189
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:12,999
this drama...

190
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,520
Mom, why did you hit me?

191
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,839
Why can't I?

192
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,200
Who is Qin Shi?

193
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,719
Is she your sister or not?

194
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,640
They

195
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,719
are bullying your sister.

196
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,360
Your father

197
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,640
was humiliated.

198
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,719
Shouldn't I hit you?

199
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,080
You fail as a brother.

200
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,760
But, mom...

201
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,959
It was history now.

202
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,399
There's nothing I can do about it.

203
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,399
She also...

204
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:34,880
Mom, why are you hitting me?

205
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:35,880
Stop.

206
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,719
You...

207
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,240
Why are you hitting me?

208
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,319
Why are you hitting me?

209
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,279
Why are you hitting me?

210
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,319
You...

211
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,120
Why are you doing this?

212
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,839
Stop. Why are you hitting me?

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,040
Calm down.

214
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,199
It's over. Let's go.

215
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,319
Mr. and Mrs. Qin.

216
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,719
I don't know

217
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,440
what your ideal son-in-law is.

218
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:57,839
All I know

219
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,079
is that I won't be the perfect husband.

220
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
However, I can promise something.

221
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:03,279
I won't ask Qin Shi

222
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,519
to change for me

223
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,959
nor will I

224
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,079
get in Qin Shi's way

225
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:07,880
in her pursuit.

226
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:09,759
Please trust me.

227
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,319
What are you doing?

228
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,360
Do you have the car keys?

229
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,480
Shi.

230
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:54,600
You forgot something.

231
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,580
(Household Register)

232
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,920
Mom.

233
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,839
Marriage is your personal matter.

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,360
You pick your own husband.

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,959
And you decide

236
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,440
which path to take.

237
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,480
I won't meddle anymore.

238
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,159
Let's go.

239
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,560
You're impossible to deal with.

240
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,639
Before we left, I told you

241
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,159
the model answers were in the draft.

242
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,000
And you decided to play truth or dare.

243
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,319
I finally get

244
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,399
what Meimei felt.

245
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,680
I know how it's like

246
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:51,959
to have a bad teammate now.

247
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,880
It feels like

248
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,199
I'm ready to grill you on a BBQ skewer.

249
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,880
Fortunately, it went well.

250
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
Can you handle your parents?

251
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,560
Do you need...

252
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,560
Junhui.

253
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:19,319
Excuse me.

254
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I want what he has.

255
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,279
Thank you.

256
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:27,279
Thanks.

257
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,839
That's all?

258
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:33,360
Learn to be content.

259
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,159
You gave me a name

260
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,399
and nothing else.

261
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,480
Be glad

262
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,759
that I could pull all these out.

263
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,480
The latest professional experience

264
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,480
was from five, six years ago.

265
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,519
Junhui, he doesn't look like

266
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,680
he could stir up any big trouble.

267
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,159
Is this a new case?

268
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,040
Stop asking questions.

269
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,279
You're not yourself lately.

270
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,000
Wu Fei.

271
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,079
Where is Miss Qin?

272
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,240
No idea.

273
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,040
She left?

274
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,319
Perhaps.

275
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,399
When she returns,

276
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,519
tell her I'm looking for her.

277
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,199
My dear elite colleagues,

278
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,240
please send me your diploma,

279
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
your graduation certificate,

280
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,000
and your certificate of marital status

281
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,800
before this Friday.

282
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:39,480
All right.

283
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,440
- Noted, Mr. Qiao.
- Noted, Mr. Qiao.

284
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you.

285
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,600
Scandalous news!

286
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,880
According to the latest census
from the law firm,

287
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,360
we have several married men
who concealed their marital status.

288
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,639
They date, cheat, and flirt around.

289
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,839
Two of them are in this firm.

290
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,000
One in the finance department.

291
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,440
Another at the front desk.

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,560
They are smart enough

293
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,079
not to flirt with female attorneys.

294
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,319
Otherwise, it wouldn't just be

295
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,199
a brawl.

Do you know Qin Shi?

309
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:50,880
She's from Pujiang Poli-sci.

310

She's my superior now

311

and the head of the family department.

312
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,600
I think

313
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,079
she's my junior.

314
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm not close to her.

I'm not sure.

someone called Tao Junhui?

318
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,000
He's a lawyer too.

319

Good.

324

329
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,159
Get up.

330
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:06,880
Relax your hand.

331
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:08,800
Good.

332
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:23,519

No, Junhui, please.

334
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,880
Get up.

335
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,560
No.

336

I can't do this anymore.

337
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,319
No more.

338

Get up. Again.

339
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:41,240
Again?

340
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,480
Just kill me already.

341
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,319
Please.

342
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,199

Me.

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,719
Are you sure?

351
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,279
Yes. Let's do it.

352
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,680
So what is the deal between this cutie and Tao?

353
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,480
You're so nosy.

354
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,600
Also, you can't call her that.

355
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:52,639
Wait.

356
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,000
Will Tao throw her to the floor?

357
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:56,759
No way.

358
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,000
Tao will never hit a cutie like that.

359
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,719
Get up.

360
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,839
He's rough.

361
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,120
Again.

362
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,919
You forgot what I taught you.

363
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,760
Ouch.

364
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,039
Continue?

365
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,240
It hurts.

366
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,839
What's the matter?

367
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,160
Are you all right?

368
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:47,760
A comeback.

369
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,959
Beautiful.

370
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,039
You lost.

371
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,799
I didn't teach you that.

372
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,319
You raised your conditions last time.

373
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,120
Do they still hold true?

374
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,400
If you make an effort
to settle the debt,

375
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,839
I can guarantee that her other businesses

376
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,839
will remain operational and unperturbed.

377
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,559
Otherwise, all her companies

378
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,559
will be frozen.

379
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
So that's why you came to me?

380
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,240
I thought Cheng & Hui

381
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,000
quit handling

382
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,559
Lan Xiaoting's divorce.

383
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,799
They quit but I didn't.

384
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,640
Did I ever give up on my case?

385
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,679
The conditions are still effective.

386
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,240
But there's one supplementary condition now.

387
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,959
Stop gawking.

388
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:37,400
Let's go.

389
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,000
She will never be yours anyway.

390
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,400
You did not mention
a guarantee last time.

391
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,199
You know better than I do

392
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,959
how many properties Lan Xiaoting owns.

393
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,760
Your debt settlement plan

394
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,240
spans across three years.

395
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,799
Do you know

396
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:02,760
how many things can happen

397
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,760
within three years?

398
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,160
Can you guarantee

399
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,520
that Lan Xiaoting's companies

400
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,439
will not run into any issues
during these three years?

401
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:12,439
If you're a creditor,

402
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,199
will you agree to the terms?

403
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,719
Either you offer a collateral

404
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,480
or you find a guarantor.

405
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,799
That will protect both parties.

406
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,480
You're making it tough for me.

407
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,000
In Ms. Lan's current situation,

408
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,520
no bank or enterprise

409
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,719
is willing to be her guarantor.

410
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:25,959
That's your problem.

411
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,839
Tao Junhui.

412
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:49,240
Tao Junhui.

413
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,839
If you force a vulnerable woman

414
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,719
to a corner,

415
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,760
you will just harm both parties.

416
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,439
Do you know?

417
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,360
Ms. Lan promised to settle the debt.

418
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,400
She didn't accrue those debts.

419
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,719
But she shows courage determination.

420
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,120
Shouldn't we help her?

421
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,160
I can talk to your clients

422
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,600
if you aren't convenient.

423
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,559
Women change all the time.

424
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,160
An anti-marriage woman

425
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,559
broke up with me

426
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,559
and married someone else.

427
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,360
Nothing remains unchanged.

428
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,199
I will not reduce

429
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,360
any of my conditions.

430
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,640
Allow me to remind you.

431
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,480
You only have one week left.

432
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,799
The judge still has

433
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,520
a lot of similar cases to handle.

434
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,880
If you miss this opportunity of arbitration,

435
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,520
no one can help you.

436
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,280
Leave now.

437
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,760
Or I sue you for sexual harassment.

438
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,400
No one wants to see it anyway.

439
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,079
Yes.

440
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,160
I just left the court.

441
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,919
(Fairness and Equality)
All cases

442
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,430
(Fairness and Equality)

443
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:54,640
(Fairness and Equality)
have been grouped together.

444
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,240
(Fairness and Equality)

445
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,919
(Rights for the People)
I also talked to the judge.

446
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:57,320
(Rights for the People)

447
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,199
(Fairness and Equality)
Creditors filed a lawsuit

448
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:58,319
(Rights for the People)

449
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,559
(Rights for the People)
to get their money back.

450
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,520
(Rights for the People)
It's good that Ms. Lan is willing

451
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,280
(Fairness and Equality)
to repay the debt.

452
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,600
(Fairness and Equality)

453
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,199
(Fairness and Equality)
But a guarantor is a must-have.

454
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:04,880
(Fairness and Equality)

455
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,280
(Fairness and Equality)
I already called Danping.

456
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,799
(Fairness and Equality)

457
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,039
(Fairness and Equality)
She's trying to find a solution now.

458
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,640
(Fairness and Equality)

459
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,480
(Fairness and Equality)
This is what

460
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,839
(Fairness and Equality)

461
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,600
(Fairness and Equality)
we can do.

462
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
(Rights for the People)

463
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,559
Why? No more appetite?

464
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,839
You said you were starving just now.

465
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,319
My arm hurts. I can't raise it.

466
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,039
Thank you.

467
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,760
Drinks, please.

468
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:40,520
Don't rush things

469
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,000
when it comes to sports.

470
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,880
You need to go step by step.

471
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,439
So

472
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:48,959
how's your side?

473
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,480
The bank

474
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,640
won't just look at her.

475
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
A private business

476
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,280
comes with a high investment risk.

477
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,000
Unless...

478
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,520
Unless?

479
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,039
Unless we break her business down
and start refinancing.

480
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,240
So we need to make her companies

481
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,079
go public?

482
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,919
Otherwise, it'll be difficult

483
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,400
to refill this financial sinkhole.

484
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,360
What?

485
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,199
Did your parents

486
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,799
mention me again after that?

487
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,439
You still want to deal with them?

488
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,880
No, I was tipsy that day

489
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,600
so I was quite frank with my words.

490
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,719
Sorry.

491
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,640
It's okay. You did save yourself
at the end

492
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,280
so you made up for it.

493
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,000
Also,

494
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,959
that day was about me.

495
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,079
I am not an irrational adult.

496
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
I said what I said

497
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,439
and I made a mess.

498
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,919
I need to do something.

499
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,559
No need.

500
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,919
But

501
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,319
if you truly want

502
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,160
to make up to me,

503
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,240
I might need

504
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,319
a favor from you.

505
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,199
What?

506
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,760
You want me

507
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,760
to help Ms. Lan find investors
for her CEC center?

508
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,160
Many of our clients

509
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,480
can do this.

510
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,640
So...

511
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,559
Stop.

512
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,280
Qin Shi, is this a huge joke?

513
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:34,559
Why should

514
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,520
my clients help Ms. Lan?

515
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:37,919
And considering

516
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,520
Ms. Lan's financial predicament,

517
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,799
it'll just be a futile investment.

518
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,559
Yang Hua.

519
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,520
Continue.

520
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,079
I have gone through

521
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,760
its financial statement
for the last three years.

522
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,959
It was very lucrative.

523
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,799
Before their financial problem snowballed,

524
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,919
they were preparing

525
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:57,679
to launch an IPO.

526
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,360
They planned to open

527
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,640
15 branches at the end of this year.

528
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,679
Due to the rising debt,

529
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,679
many investors withdrew.

530
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,839
If someone invests now,

531
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
he or she can purchase a lot of shares

532
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,160
with the cheapest price.

533
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,199
If the IPO was a success,

534
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,120
just imagine the ROI.

535
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,199
Qin Shi,

536
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,600
are you talking

537
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,039
to me as a staff member

538
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,240
of Cheng & Hui

539
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,240
or as the representing attorney

540
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,000
of Ms. Lan?

541
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,679
Yihui.

542
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
Even though
Cheng & Hui gave up on Ms. Lan,

543
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,400
I didn't.

544
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,559
Qin Shi, you...

545
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,439
How long has this gone on?

546
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,400
Yang Hua.

547
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,199
Which side are you on?

548
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,600
Mr. Jin.

549
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,240
If Qin Shi is not your wife,

550
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,880
as my investment consultant,

551
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,600
do you think

552
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,719
I should invest in it?

553
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,559
If I have clients

554
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,839
who might be interested,

555
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,000
they ask me the same question,

556
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,839
how should I answer them?

557
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,039
Will they trust me?

558
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,520
If I were you, I would say

559
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,959
that investment is a personal choice

560
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,799
and no one should listen

561
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:20,919
to others' advice.

562
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,559
So that was how

563
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,919
you convinced your clients from before?

564
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,600
That's very irresponsible.

565
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:30,919
As an analyst,

566
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,439
I am only responsible for my data.

567
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,880
The choice to invest

568
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,760
is up to you.

569
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,799
You have the money

570
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,120
so you bear the win and loss.

571
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,319
No business is lucrative forever.

572
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:16,760
Are you all right?

573
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
If I didn't have a cramp now,

574
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,919
I would be leaping in joy.

575
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:22,760
Would you believe me?

576
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,160
Your boss hasn't said yes yet.

577
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,640
You don't know her.

578
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,319
If she doesn't reject me outright,

579
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,199
it means she's interested.

580
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,480
And it's likely to be a yes.

581
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
She must have

582
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,160
a list of clients already.

583
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:37,919
You're confident.

584
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,520
But not in myself.

585
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:42,760
I am confident in you.

586
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,240
100% confident.

587
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,919
Are you all right?

588
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,400
I'm okay.

589
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:10,719
Is it that serious?

590
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,839
What's the matter?

591
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,480

You're crushing me.

Sorry.

599
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,520
I have pins and needles on my hands.

last time.

647

and what's bad on others.

650
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,000
Maternal love

651
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,240
can be blinding at times.

652
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,240
I ask for your understanding.

It's all right.

654
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:06,880
I know

655
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,959
you two just met each other

656
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,199
but I believe

657
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,760
how long you have known each other

658
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,719
isn't the only criteria

659
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,719
for true love.

660
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,880
I know my son.

661
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,240
I have seen many changes

662
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,760
on him lately.

663
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,400
And I know

664
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,199
they came from you.

665
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,679
And for that,

666
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,199
I owe you a thank-you.

667
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:32,799
Thank you

668
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,319
for showing me

669
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,319
this passionate side of his.

670
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,600
Dad, I didn't do anything.

671
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,160
You have done too much.

672
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:46,000
And very well too.

673
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,719
My son

674
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,559
isn't a great partner

675
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,360
by the most conventional standards.

676
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,760
He's lucky

677
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,160
to have found you.

678
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm very happy to see this.

679
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,559
Dad, you're not drunk.

680
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,839
Why are you talking about this?

681
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,319
Dad.

682
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,600
You don't mind

683
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,880
my family at all?

684
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,079
Mom once said

685
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,880
that no one in your family
had a divorce before.

686
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,480
How should I put this?

687
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,600
The divorce rate is sky-high now.

688
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:36,559
Do all divorcees

689
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:38,640
come from a broken family?

690
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,400
Not necessarily.

691
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:41,919
Besides,

692
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,360
a divorce is not a crime.

693
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,799
An excellent individual can come out

694
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,160
from a broken family too.

695
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,600
And I believe

696
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,039
those people cherish

697
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,319
marriage even more than others.

698
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:02,480
My father

699
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
divorced twice.

700
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
It doesn't matter how others view you.

701
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,799
It's how you view yourself that matters.

702
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,239
Others might think this is a problem.

703
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,039
But do you?

704
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,160
In my opinion,

705
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,799
it's not a problem at all.

706
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,839
(The touching moments in life)

707
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:48,039
(always come when you least expect it.)

708
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,759
(I know)

709
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,400
(that maybe he didn't think much of it)

710
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,160
(or perhaps he was just acting)

711
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,319
(but somehow,)

712
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:58,400
(I believe this is)

713
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,440
(Yang Hua's honest thought.)

714
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,440
Oh.

715
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,999
I brought you one thing.

716
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,440
Yang.

717
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:13,839
Yang.

718
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,920
Yang!

719
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,210
(Household Register)

720
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,559
Dad.

721
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,880
Didn't mom hide this away?

722
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,360
You thought I couldn't find it?

723
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,680
You thought I couldn't read her?

724
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,120
I knew it.

725
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:07,839
Miss Qin

726
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,680
is behaving suspiciously lately.

727
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,680
She is hiding something.

728
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,799
She impressed me.

729
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,680
She actually pulled it off.

730
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:24,039
So you knew?

731
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:25,600
Of course.

732
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,239
I just came out

733
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,680
from lady boss' office.

734
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,120
Honestly,

735
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,839
I have worked here

736
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,279
for a long time

737
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,479
but never have I seen Madam Tang

738
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,079
this mad before.

739
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,640
She only has herself to blame.

740
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,559
So no more promotion

741
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,160
for her then?

742
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,440
I...

743
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,160
I don't know about that.

744
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:56,200
But Madam Tang did say

745
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,559
that for this month,

746
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,319
all performance bonuses,

747
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:04,519
transport and meal subsidies
will be canceled.

748
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:07,559
Miss Qin will suffer

749
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:08,960
for the next three months.

750
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,680
That's all?

751
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,720
Her mistake is much worse than Steven's.

752
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,600
Steven was sidelined.

753
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,839
And she merely got her bonuses reduced?

754
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,680
Although I do agree

755
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,720
that helping Ms. Lan privately

756
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,079
does make Madam Tang look bad,

757
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,440
it is still different

758
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,720
from Steven's mistake.

759
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:34,640
What?

760
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:37,680
You didn't know?

761
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:43,880
Miss Qin is handling Ms. Lan's case privately.

762
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,120
She even wants Madam Tang

763
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,559
to help her find a guarantor

764
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:48,200
for Ms. Lan's company.

765
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,079
What did you think I was talking about?

766
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,360
Nothing.

767
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,680
I was talking about this too.

768
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,960
That thunder-stealing,

769
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,559
haughty Qin Shi.

770
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,519
Unbelievable, isn't it?

771
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:22,759
You know,

772
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,559
I thought

773
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,680
you had a part in it.

774
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,360
Me?

775
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,319
No.

776
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:31,160
Impossible.

777
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,160
Good.

778
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,960
If Madam Tang knew

779
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,200
you played a part in it too,

780
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,400
you would get roasted too.

781
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,400
You would

782
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,279
join Steven and be the second one

783
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:48,279
to be sidelined.

784
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,880
Yes, my baby?

785
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,400
Don't tell me

786
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,799
you're still working.

787
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,880
Bingo.

788
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:13,200
I'll be arriving
at your mom's place soon.

789
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:14,640
I'll buy you some time.

790
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,720
Oh, remember to buy

791
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,519
her favorite cake.

792
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:20,120
Right.

793
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,279
You're the best, baby.

794
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,999
Now, you know.

795
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,999
Love you.

796
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:26,759
Bye.

797
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:27,559
Bye.

798
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:45,440
Mom.

799
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:47,720
You're back.

800
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,519
Braised pork belly again?

801
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:55,720
Here.

802
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,039
Feifei asked me

803
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,720
to bring you this savory moon cake.

804
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,160
And your birthday present.

805
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,200
Stay 18 forever.

806
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,680
No need for the present.

807
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,960
Feifei has arrived.

808
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,479
She's been waiting for you
for more than an hour.

809
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:12,799
More than an hour?

810
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:13,759
I have to see her then.

811
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:15,360
Feifei.

812
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,880
What are you looking at?

813
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:29,839
I'm looking at how my boyfriend

814
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:32,559
is such a wonderful man.

815
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:35,839
Shouldn't you

816
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,239
reward him then?

817
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,799
No.

818
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,479
It's just trophies.

819
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,200
The real person is more fun.

820
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:48,600
Do you notice him?

821
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,039
No.

822
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:54,319
One trophy

823
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,839
is missing.

824
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,120
No.

825
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,559
The best speaker of 2007

826
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,519
isn't you?

827
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,600
Let me think.

828
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:08,279
No.

829
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,720
Impossible.

830
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,200
Who else can win the prize?

831
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:14,440
What do you mean by impossible?

832
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,880
My school

833
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,319
has so many talented juniors.

834
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,360
If I was the speaker all the time,

835
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:22,160
no one else would be able
to gain experience.

836
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,519
Which junior then?

837
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:28,479
Must be very smart.

838
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:30,239
You've been waiting
for more than an hour.

839
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,880
Aren't you hungry?

840
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:31,960
Let's eat.

841
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,519
Tell me.

842
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,120
I'll tell you while we eat.

843
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:40,799
Happy birthday to you.

844
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,279
Happy birthday to you.

845
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,720
Happy birthday to you.

846
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,120
Happy birthday to me.

847
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,640
All right.

848
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:59,239
Happy birthday to you.

849
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,360
Stop it.

850
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,799
Okay.

851
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,200
Let me make a wish.

852
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,120
May Jun and Feifei

853
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,799
stay healthy and happy.

854
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,120
May their career prosper

855
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,239
and they live happily ever after.

856
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,479
Mom,

857
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,799
may you stay 18 forever. I love you.

858
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,400
Okay.

859
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,839
Let's blow the candles.

860
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,039
Nice.

861
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,039
Happy birthday.

862
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,039
Thank you.

863
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,960
Let me bring the cake to the kitchen.

864
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,680
Okay. Careful.

865
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:29,880
Let's eat.

866
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:31,039
Come.

867
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,519
Mom, let me serve you soup.

868
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,680
Okay.

869
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:37,600
Feifei.

870
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,120
You must have worked very hard lately.

871
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,999
You have lost weight.

872
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,920
Let me do it.

873
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,720
I'm fine.

874
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:49,200
Just one word from Mr. Tao here

875
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:51,839
and I won't have anything to do.

876
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:55,799
You don't work for Jun.

877
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,319
What do you mean by
one word from him and...

878
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,039
Mom, the braised pork belly

879
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,360
looks different today.

880
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,839
Judging from its color,

881
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:04,880
you cooked it perfectly.

882
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,039
Eat more then.

883
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:07,440
Let me try.

884
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,759
Delicious.

885
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,960
Mom, my superior

886
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,039
and he came from the same school.

887
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,759
But it seems like they were rivals.
