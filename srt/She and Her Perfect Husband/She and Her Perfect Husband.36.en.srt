Hello?

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,959
Hello, Mr. Yang.

21
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,559
Hello, I am Hu Ping.

22
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,400
(I have read your report.)

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,279
(It left quite an impression on me.)

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,839
I also looked into your background.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
So tell me.

26
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,600
What exactly are you trying to achieve

27
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,479
(by sending me the report?)

28
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,160
Mr. Hu.

29
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,759
If you agree with my analysis,

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,399
I suggest you reconsider

31
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,000
your investment in Cheng & Hui.

32
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,119
Kolincin Gel...

33
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,119
You hired them to check

34
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,279
Triple Supply's due diligence.

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,039
Correct.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,600
Before I got the analysis

37
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,039
you sent me,

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,639
I had already received

39
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,600
their report.

40
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:40,919
And the result?

41
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,080
Their analysis data

42
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,919
is similar to the report

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,759
you gave me.

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,399
It mentions that at the initial stage

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,039
the occupancy rate of
businesses and surrounding areas

46
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,240
is low,

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,240
hence the skyrocketed cost.

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,919
But the conclusion

49
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,679
is totally different.

50
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,600
They think the project is promising.

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

52
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,080
Mr. Hu.

53
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,960
If you accept their suggestion,

54
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:11,360
why did you agree

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,080
to my request?

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,160
Mr. Yang.

57
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:20,399
I'll pour you a cup of tea

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,559
so express my apology.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,199
Before this,

60
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,559
I didn't know

61
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,199
Miss Qin was your wife.

62
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,919
With her caught up in my case,

63
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,839
there were some misunderstanding

64
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,240
and issues for her.

65
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:38,440
Therefore,

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,639
I must apologize.

67
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,160
My wife has always

68
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,160
taken her job seriously.

69
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:45,839
You need not apologize

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
for this matter.

71
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,080
But I am curious.

72
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,240
If you had received

73
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,839
the assessment result of Kolincin Gel,

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,679
Why did you accept

75
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,600
my report?

76
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,039
Mr. Yang.

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,320
Show some confidence.

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,880
It has nothing to do with confidence.

79
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,440
I'm not ignorant enough

80
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,279
to assume I have the means

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,160
to shake up

82
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,279
a massive organization.

83
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:09,039
Very well.

84
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,679
I'll tell you the truth.

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,000
I only made up my mind today.

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,680
I made up my mind

87
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:22,209
mainly because

88
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,760
of your words

89
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,839
in the report

90
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,199
that left quite an impression on me.

91
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,280
Can you be more specific?

92
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,000
"A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush."

93
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,759
Could you explain

94
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,440
what do you mean by that?

95
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,440
It's an expression

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,280
my investment mentor told me.

97
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,400
He told me that

98
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,440
investment is very much the same as

99
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:53,319
other undertakings.

100
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,199
The main takeaway is
learning when to let go.

101
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,440
The industry is ever-changing.

102
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,400
Many outstanding
corporations from ten years ago

103
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
have become nothing

104
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,240
but memories.

105
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,639
The so-called standardized data

106
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,840
are always changing.

107
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
Therefore, investment

108
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,079
is constantly

109
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,479
self-affirmation

110
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,759
that what's right

111
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,120
and important,

112
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,120
should be upheld

113
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,000
and that the less significant

114
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,359
should be let go.

115
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,280
Mr. Yang.

116
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,359
there is a question

117
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,319
that's troubled me

118
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,599
for a long time.

119
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,680
I'd like you to enlighten me.

120
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,879
In your opinion,

121
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,280
what will be the most important

122
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,639
in the next 10 years

123
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,759
or even 20 years?

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,240
What will be the best investment choice?

125
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,919
Mr. Yang.

126
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,120
I hope you

127
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,440
reconsider my proposition.

128
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,039
Mr. Hu, I have...

129
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:03,960
It's alright.

130
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,960
I don't need an answer right away.

131
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,359
Take your time.

132
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:19,960
Come on.

133
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,759
May Mr. Su and Mr. Yin's partnership

134
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,919
with Nanzhou Group go well.

135
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,159
Thank you.

136
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,479
- May everything go well.
- May everything go well.

137
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,400
May everything go well.

138
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,000
Hu Ping is not
investing in Triple Supply.

139
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,479
Our peers said

140
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:36,840
the annexation

141
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,199
would go south.

142
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,759
He's not all-knowing.

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,680
Everyone miscalculates sometimes.

144
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,319
Indeed.

145
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,599
With our corporations

146
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,520
merged,

147
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,280
there will be tons of

148
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,319
legal tasks for us every year.

149
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,599
So,

150
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,440
Madam Tang, Mr. Tao, and Mr. Chen,

151
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,039
we'll be counting on you.

152
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,319
Mr. Su, I'm flattered.

153
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,159
Cheers.

154
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,520
We should work
together more, Mr. Su, Mr. Yin.

155
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,359
Cheers.

156
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,639
Yes, agreed.

157
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:04,960
Thanks.

158
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,879
I'm needed elsewhere,

159
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:11,800
so I must get going.

160
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,199
Mr. Su.

161
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,479
Are you leaving already?

162
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,800
Stay a little longer.

163
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,560
Yeah.

164
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,840
I am old.

165
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,759
My body can't handle it.

166
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:20,840
But Yin,

167
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,440
make sure you drink my fill with

168
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,759
Mr. Tao and the others.

169
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,960
I'd spoil the mood for everyone.

170
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:26,520
Okay.

171
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,759
Make sure

172
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,079
you close the deal.

173
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,400
Yes, Mr. Su. Leave it to me.

174
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,199
Madam Tang.

175
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,639
Mr. Tao, everyone, see you.

176
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,240
- Bye, Mr. Su.
- Bye.

177
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,520
Your mission tonight

178
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,680
is to serve Mr. Yin well.

179
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,599
I made it clear for the rest.

180
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:49,960
Don't fail me.

181
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:50,800
Don't worry.

182
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,120
I should get going.

183
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,520
Sure.

184
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,280
Madam Tang is leaving.

185
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,639
See you around.

186
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,560
Sure.

187
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,919
Okay. Have fun.

188
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,400
Okay.

189
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,000
Goodbye.

190
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,000
Bye.

191
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,319
Bye, Madam Tang.

192
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:17,599
Miss Qin.

193
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,039
I heard you got
promoted to associate attorney.

194
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,800
Yes.

195
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,599
Congratulations.

196
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:27,000
Miss Qin,

197
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,840
I...

198
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,919
I know.

199
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,479
You were sending Wu Fei messages.

200
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:34,919
Sorry.

201
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,440
Are you truly sorry or are you afraid

202
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,399
I might take revenge on you?

203
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,240
I know.

204
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,680
You consider the pros and cons

205
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,000
before you take action.

206
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,080
There is nothing wrong with

207
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,000
taking shortcuts

208
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
with your superior.

209
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,719
However, the success you secure

210
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,519
is never reliable.

211
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,919
You might not earn as much

212
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,800
with your own effort.

213
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,800
It takes longer too.

214
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,680
But every bit of it

215
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,959
accumulates to form the foundation.

216
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,719
I won't lecture you on work.

217
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,159
I hope that

218
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
you know where to
draw the line next time.

219
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,980
(Calling Yao Yao)

220
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:47,760
(Outgoing call: Yao Yao)

221
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,680
Raise a toast to Mr. Yin.

222
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,120
- Mr. Yin!
- Cheers.

223
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,719
Come on.

224
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,719
We've been waiting for ages for you.

225
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,760
Come on. Hurry up.

226
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,039
Mr. Tao.

227
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,159
These are the beauties

228
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,680
of Tianhang Hotel.

229
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,200
Not bad, right?

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,959
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

231
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,800
Come on. Sit with us, Xiaotong.

232
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,159
Allow me to introduce them.

233
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,080
This is Mr. Chen.

234
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,200
Hello, Mr. Chen.

235
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,519
- This is Mr. Tao.
- Hello.

236
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,279
Take a seat.

237
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,240
Let's sit down.

238
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,599
The young talents

239
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:20,080
from Tianhang

240
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
and Cheng & Hui

241
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,120
are having a mixer tonight.

242
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,120
Alright, everyone is single tonight.

243
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,200
To single life!

244
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
Cheers.

245
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,640
Cheers!

246
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:34,519
By the way,

247
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,200
I need

248
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,200
some information.

249
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,120
It's about Yao Yao...

250
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,760
Yao Yao?

251
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:42,680
Yao Yao?

252
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,640
What's wrong with her?

253
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,200
She hired a lawyer

254
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:49,880
to sue Tianhang.

255
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,440
What is it, Mr. Tan?

256
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,320
I'm listening.

257
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,519
Miss Yao,

258
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,959
there have been many labor disputes

259
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,440
in recent years.

260
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
But this kind of lawsuit

261
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,240
has pros and cons for an individual.

262
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,080
You can quit, of course.

263
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,399
The difficult part

264
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,919
of this case is not the public record.

265
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,120
It's the labor agreement

266
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,479
you signed.

267
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,359
It's a ten-year contract.

268
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,320
It's only been five years.

269
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,719
If you quit now,

270
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,080
you must have a huge sum

271
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,080
for the breach of contract.

272
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,200
It's one million yuan.

273
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,519
One million yuan...

274
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,279
What is that sum

275
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:22,959
based on?

276
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,279
Of course.

277
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,159
We sent her abroad

278
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,080
for training programs.

279
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,880
The training fee, daily necessities,

280
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,120
and the wine taster

281
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,080
were all reimbursed by the hotel.

282
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
She has her success

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,039
because of us.

284
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:38,560
We have the power

285
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,839
to take her out.

286
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,120
That won't
be necessary, Mr. Yin. Calm down.

287
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,000
That's not necessary.

288
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,719
Mr. Yin.

289
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,320
Don't let a mere employee

290
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:46,719
spoil your mood.

291
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,599
I am not a petty person.

292
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,359
But Yao Yao

293
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,599
is outright shameless!

294
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,719
I get it.

295
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,919
Enough about that.

296
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,640
Let's change the topic.

297
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,000
- Talk about something else.
- Drink up.

298
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,560
Drink up. Come on.

299
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,279
Hurry, Mr. Yin.

300
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,440
What if the court

301
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,200
makes it mandatory?

302
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:05,800
Mr. Tan?

303
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,560
Let me talk to him.

304
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,039
Hello, Mr. Tan.

305
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,680
I am Li Dai from Union Law Chamber.

306
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,440
I am now handling

307
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,599
Miss Yao's case.

308
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,240
Thank you for the work so far.

309
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:22,240
Goodbye.

310
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:23,959
Hello?

311
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,120
Let's have a word.

312
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,000
Are you alright, Mr. Tao?

313
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,880
Should I send you home?

314
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,039
I'm fine.

315
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:05,880
Have some water.

316
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,120
Thanks.

317
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,159
Over here.

318
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:21,959
Watch the steps.

319
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:22,959
Come back here!

320
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,680
Mr. Yin!

321
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
No! Stop it, Mr. Yin!

322
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,800
Boss?

323
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,359
Was that

324
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,440
Han?

325
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Who's Han?

326
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,399
Stay still!

327
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,640
I'll send you back to customer service!

328
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,519
Stop it, Mr. Yin!

329
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,440
You'll be the head of the department!

330
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,399
I...

331
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:38,680
Mr. Tao, why...

332
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,240
Mr. Yin!

333
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,399
(It's done.)

334
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,159
Watch the steps, Mr. Yin.

335
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:15,800
Watch the stairs.

336
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,399
Where are you, pal?

337
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm right here.

338
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:19,399
Right behind you.

339
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,640
Tell him

340
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,240
we'll meet again.

341
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,800
We'll grab another drink.

342
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,599
We'll drink heartily again!

343
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,479
Let's grab a drink again.

344
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,320
Bye.

345
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,320
I'll tell my pal.

346
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,800
See you, Mr. Yin.

347
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,919
You're welcome at the law firm!

348
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Rest well!

349
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,479
Bye!

350
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,320
Where are the girls?

351
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,599
I got them a taxi.

352
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
I'll send them home later.

353
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:44,440
Okay.

354
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,399
Make sure all of them reach home.

355
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,479
Yes.

356
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,399
You can leave it to me.

357
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:48,800
Okay.

358
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,399
Where is Mr. Tao?

359
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,120
(What are the chances
of winning this lawsuit?)

360
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,039
The chances

361
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,880
depend on whether Tianhang
will go easy on us.

362
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,240
If they could go easy on us,

363
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,640
it's a matter of price.

364
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:02,719
If not,

365
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
we'll be in trouble.

366
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
Why would I need you if it were easy?

367
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,640
It's not like I can help

368
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
if they are going all-out.

369
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,120
I am a lawyer, not a deity.

370
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,159
But you are the legendary Li Dai.

371
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,080
You are more capable than that.

372
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,519
Where is that sharp look

373
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,039
you had when you glared at

374
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,880
the enemies?

375
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,640
Hey, it was you
who had the arrogant look

376
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,760
in the eyes.

377
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,039
I'm taking the case.

378
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,159
But I'm not sure

379
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,760
if we can win.

380
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:32,560
By the way,

381
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,599
do you know Yao Yao has a son?

382
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,359
Do you need something to drink?
How about black tea?

383
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,560
Sure.

384
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:00,479
That is my son.

385
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,320
He doesn't look like you.

386
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,599
He takes after his dad.

387
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,680
How old is he?

388
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:12,959
He's five.

389
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,279
He's been living in Australia

390
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,880
with his dad.

391
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,359
He'll be coming back soon.

392
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,839
Why are you telling me that?

393
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,240
Qin Shi, where's wrong with you?

394
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,640
You were always very sharp.

395
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:26,800
How can you be so dense

396
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,839
at the moment like this?

397
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,760
Let me be clear with you.

398
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,880
It's not right for you

399
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,039
to care so much about Yao Yao.

400
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,240
How so?

401
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,839
I'm just helping out.

402
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,800
Just helping out?

403
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,719
You're projecting
your love for him on her.

404
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,359
Be straight with me.

405
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,479
Did your ruse with Yang Hua

406
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,839
turn out to be real?

407
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,760
I have a word of advice for you.

408
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,279
Ex-girlfriends should not

409
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,159
be basked in your love.

410
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,359
It's best to cut off the loose end.

411
00:16:59,279 --> 00:16:59,919
It's time you stay

412
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,440
out of Yao Yao's case.

413
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:02,360
Remember,

414
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,639
do not let Yang Hua find out.

415
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
What if they get back

416
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,639
to each other?

417
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:06,639
What will you do?

418
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,519
If you don't mind at all,

419
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,119
what about me?

420
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,200
I'm still waiting in line.

421
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:13,680
Bye.

422
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,919
Hung up just at the best part.

423
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,399
Tao Junhui.

424
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,080
Why are you sleeping here?

425
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:32,960
Are you drunk?

426
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:36,360
Wake up.

427
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:37,680
You're here.

428
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,480
What does that mean?

429
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:40,639
You got yourself

430
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,600
totally wasted.

431
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:44,600
Don't lie down here. Get up.

432
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,680
You'll catch a cold.

433
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,200
Get up.

434
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,200
Grab your briefcase.

435
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,440
Get up.

436
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:51,039
Get up.

437
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:51,919
You're heavy.

438
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,200
Where did you park your car?

439
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,360
My car...

440
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:16,200
My car...

441
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,480
Over there.

442
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:23,960
That way?

443
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,080
Yeah...

444
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:27,999
Get down.

445
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,600
I'll help you

446
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:29,279
to the elevator.

447
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,279
You can sleep there.

448
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,519
I went over the place.

449
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,639
Where did you park your car?

450
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,320
Try to recall.
Where did you park it?

451
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Water. Do you have some water?

452
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,279
Car...

453
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,680
The car is up there.

454
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,519
Up there? Are you sure?

455
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,279
Yeah.

456
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,519
Why isn't Wu Fei picking up?

457
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,200
Where do you live?

458
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,879
Where is your home?

459
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,879
Home...

460
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,680
Over there...

461
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,279
Don't pull

462
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,919
any tricks on me right now.

463
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,159
I don't have time

464
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,600
for your nonsense.

465
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:27,919
The address!

466
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,200
Give me your address.

467
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,320
703, Block 3, Runhua Apartment.

468
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,320
That is my home.

469
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,519
I need your address.

470
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:39,720
I told you!

471
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,639
703, Block 3, Runhua Apartment.

472
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:15,519
Hello?

473
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,639
Yang Hua,

474
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,720
could you help me out?

475
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:45,879
You got drunk.

476
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,200
Learn better self-control.

477
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,720
Is Tang Yihui trying to close

478
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,919
the deal with Tianhang?

479
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,080
You had a drink with Mr. Yin?

480
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,879
You can nod. You're not drunk.

481
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,080
Did you make them

482
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
your buddies

483
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,800
and get really close to them?

484
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,480
Did he mention

485
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,639
Yao Yao's case?

486
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,999
What is his plan for this lawsuit?

487
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:20,159
Will he go easy on her?

488
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,560
Let's talk. What's wrong?

489
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,239
Acting again.

490
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,159
Fine. Whatever.

491
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,279
Can you still walk?

492
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,879
I'll get you a taxi.

493
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,159
Or maybe I can get you

494
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:44,680
to a hotel nearby.

495
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:45,999
You can spend the night

496
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,159
in a room.

497
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,279
Where are you?

498
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,239
Hey!

499
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:02,200
What's wrong with you? Give it back.

500
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,800
Let go.

501
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:04,840
Let go!

502
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:05,960
- No.
- Hello?

503
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,119
Qin Shi?

504
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,399
Don't act like a drunken madman.

505
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm warning you.

506
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,759
I let you go once.

507
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,080
I'm still regretting it.

508
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:22,440
I'm not letting go again.

509
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,399
You are engaged.

510
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,519
Stop embarrassing yourself.

511
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:25,919
Let go!

512
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,279
What do you want?

513
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,239
Why didn't you listen to me?

514
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,680
Listen to what?

515
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:42,919
Why did you admit

516
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,159
you faked getting married?

517
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,360
I could have helped you.

518
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,879
You can't help me.

519
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,800
Give me the phone.

520
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:57,480
Qin Shi.

521
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,080
Can you give me another chance?

522
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:03,919
You are drunk.

523
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,759
Can you give me another chance?

524
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,399
You are drunk.

525
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,919
Can you give me another chance?

526
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,039
What chance?

527
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,440
Another chance for both of us.

528
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:15,840
Will you marry me?

529
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:19,440
I'll get you a taxi.

530
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:20,480
Give me the phone.

531
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,440
Let go!

532
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,360
What are you doing?

533
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,440
It's been two years.

534
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
I thought I could let it all go

535
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
and start again.

536
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:31,320
Tao Junhui.

537
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,239
Junhui!

538
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:32,840
I thought I could

539
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,999
be with another woman
and form a family with her,

540
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,480
and live a peaceful life.

541
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,239
Let go of me!

542
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,440
Hear me out.

543
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,360
I thought I could forget you.

544
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:42,680
The more I try,

545
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,840
the more I think about you.

546
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:44,999
Ever since you and Wang Jiesen

547
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:45,999
went to Hangzhou,

548
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,720
I came to realize something.

549
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,360
The more I hate you,

550
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,560
the more I care about you.

551
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,279
You are drunk.

552
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,279
Qin Shi!

553
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:02,999
Marry me.

554
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,200
Let go.

555
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:06,399
Stop torturing!

556
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:07,680
You are hurting me!

557
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,840
You're hurting me!

558
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,759
You're hurting me!

559
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,600
Give me the phone.

560
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:21,480
Sorry.

561
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,720
Not a step closer.

562
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,960
Stay there.

563
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,519
You are drunk.

564
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,480
You'll know

565
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,680
how embarrassing you are the next day.

566
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:28,840
I've

567
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,360
wanted to tell you ever since

568
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,720
I came back from Hangzhou.

569
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,480
I've told myself

570
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,480
countless times.

571
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,720
I will not marry you.

572
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,639
Why?

573
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
I am already married. Did you forget?

574
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,360
Don't you remember?

575
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,399
I didn't forget.

576
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,320
But it was just a ruse.

577
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:51,279
Did you forget?

578
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,279
We are both lawyers.

579
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,800
Legally speaking,

580
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,200
you can still marry me

581
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,720
after you get divorced.

582
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,039
I don't mind at all.

583
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,800
Remember.

584
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,080
You want to be a partner.

585
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,159
Madam Tang and Mr. Jin

586
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:10,879
can run a law firm.

587
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,080
We can do the same!

588
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:12,919
Marry me.

589
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,200
You can do whatever you want.

590
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
That's enough. Stop.

591
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,360
I won't get a divorce.

592
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,440
A Qin may lose their spouse,

593
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,399
but never divorce them. Is that clear?

594
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,119
It's alright.

595
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:22,800
I can

596
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,919
convince your dad.

597
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,680
I'll convince anyone who disagrees.

598
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,519
Even Yang Hua!

599
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,360
If he's against it,

600
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,360
I can talk to him!

601
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,039
You'll convince no one!

602
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:29,960
There is no need for that.

603
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:30,999
I'm not getting divorced.

604
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:32,399
I'm not going remarry.

605
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,519
Is that clear?

606
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,800
If I made it clear, go back to sleep.

607
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,639
Is that clear?

608
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:37,480
Yeah.

609
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
But I don't get it.

610
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,720
You didn't want to get married.

611
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,119
So why did you

612
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,159
marry Yang Hua?

613
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,680
Besides, your marriage is a ruse.

614
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:52,720
It's not real.

615
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,680
So why can't you get a divorce?

616
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,239
I don't get it.

617
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:01,840
You are drunk.

618
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,999
I'm not.

619
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,039
Did you fall in love with him?

620
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:15,560
Tell me.

621
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,560
Did you fall in love with him?

622
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,519
That has nothing

623
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,039
to do with you.

624
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,279
Of course it has.

625
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,480
Go home and sleep.

626
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,519
I don't get it.

627
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,999
What has Yang Hua done for you?

628
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Tao Junhui, let go!

629
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:31,480
I don't get it.

630
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,759
Yang Hua.

631
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,200
Go home.

632
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,320
You are drunk.

633
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,879
You know Qin Shi.

634
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,919
If there's anything,

635
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,320
talk to her when you are

636
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:56,080
sober again.

637
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,480
The bag.

638
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,279
Just now...

639
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,239
We'll talk at home.

640
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,800
Do you want to get cleaned up first?

641
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,039
What you saw there

642
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,200
was Tao Junhui acting like a drunkard.

643
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,159
I couldn't get in touch with his family.

644
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,800
I couldn't send him home.

645
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
So, I called you,

646
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,440
hoping you could help out.

647
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,919
I don't know how much

648
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,320
of his drunken talk you overheard.

649
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,639
I hope you don't

650
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,639
take it to heart.

651
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,999
Why don't you want to get married?

652
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,759
He and I?

653
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,919
That would be bigamy.

654
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,960
I don't mean

655
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:05,919
marrying him.

656
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:06,759
I mean,

657
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,800
why don't you want to get married?

658
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
I am already

659
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,279
married to you.

660
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,080
You know it's not real.

661
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,960
You know

662
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,119
you can leave anytime you want.

663
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:20,840
No.

664
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,159
I think marrying you is great.

665
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,879
I don't plan to

666
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
marry anyone else.

667
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,960
Do you love me?

668
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,039
I thought

669
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,840
we were already in a relationship.

670
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:02,879
Marriage aside,

671
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,320
would you choose Tao Junhui?

672
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,159
I get it now.

673
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:10,800
You want payback.

674
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,200
I asked

675
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,759
if you'd choose Yao Yao,

676
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:14,600
so now you're asking

677
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
if I'd choose Tao Junhui.

678
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,440
You're petty.

679
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,279
Remember

680
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,600
what you said the other day?

681
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:21,999
You said

682
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,759
the hypothesis wasn't valid.

683
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,440
Even if there was a parallel world,

684
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:27,840
you wouldn't be able

685
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,279
to decide for someone from

686
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,879
another world.

687
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,519
I'm telling you

688
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,840
the exact words you told me.

689
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,519
One more thing.

690
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,360
We are married.

691
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,360
You are my husband.

692
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,279
I am your wife.

693
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,480
If I choose Tao Junhui,

694
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,480
that is having an affair.

695
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,840
Yang Hua, I will never leave you.

696
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,279
I have something for you.

697
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:22,820
(Deposit Agreement of Property Purchase)

698
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
(Prenuptial agreement)

699
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,519
What is this?

700
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,879
Miss Qin, I hereby inform you

701
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,200
that you have violated

702
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,320
all lines of Section One

703
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,600
of our agreement.

704
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,680
When we signed the agreement,

705
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,600
we wanted

706
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,519
to have a free life.

707
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:01,840
That includes

708
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,519
the right to choose
the lifestyle we want,

709
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:04,999
the right to fall in love,

710
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,399
and the right to work.

711
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,159
But this agreement

712
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:12,279
is not an excuse to run away.

713
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,560
It's not a shield for cowardice.

714
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,639
Your action violated

715
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,039
the original intention.

716
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,440
I hereby terminate our agreement.

717
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,320
What is this about?

718
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:31,960
I want a divorce.

719
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,919
Stop throwing a tantrum,

720
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,800
okay?

721
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:57,519
I know

722
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,800
you're upset over

723
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,119
Tao Junhui's action.

724
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,159
But trust me,

725
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,600
there is nothing between us.

726
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,480
There will never be anything.

727
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,399
Believe me.

728
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,759
I can swear if you want.

729
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:11,879
It's been

730
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,720
a long day for both of us.

731
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,159
Rest well.

732
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,399
We'll get the paperwork done tomorrow.

733
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,600
What is it that you want?

734
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,440
Was it all because

735
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,879
of Tao Junhui's drunken words?

736
00:33:38,879 --> 00:33:39,399
You know

737
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,800
my stance on this.

738
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,840
Is this necessary?

739
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,639
It has nothing to do with him.

740
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,960
I should thank him.

741
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,200
Had he not forced you

742
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,519
into speaking your mind,

743
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,759
I would never have made up mine.

744
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,080
What do you mean?

745
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,680
You wanted to tell me this?

746
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,320
Is that it?

747
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:03,480
Is that it?

748
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,279
What about

749
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,640
all the flowery words?

750
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,320
What about the support, understanding,

751
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,759
and company you promised?

752
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,199
Did you not mean it?

753
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,360
I meant

754
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,439
every word of it.

755
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,479
But you need to figure out

756
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,320
what this marriage

757
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,360
means to you.

758
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:27,039
Is it just a barrier

759
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,400
to shield you from reality

760
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,279
and real life?

761
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,400
I want to be

762
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,519
your fortress.

763
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,080
I want to shield you from the rain.

764
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,759
I'll be your wind in hot summer days.

765
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,999
After a long day at work,

766
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,759
I'll be the safe haven you return to.

767
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,239
I want to be someone you can rely on.

768
00:34:57,999 --> 00:34:59,080
I don't want to be an excuse.

769
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,160
It can't give you

770
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,120
a real life.

771
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,160
It can't help you

772
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,279
face the real life.

773
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:06,800
I don't want you

774
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,640
to live in a lie.

775
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,719
Tomorrow...

776
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,840

Why didn't you

814
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,320
beg for his forgiveness

815
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,959
so you two wouldn't get divorced?

you want to be with him?

you love him?

You wanted to marry him.

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,600

826
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:05,999

I want both.

852
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,360
Was marrying Yang Hua

853
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
a right choice?

854
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,719
Of course.

That's not what I mean.

858
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:22,840
What do you mean, then?

859
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:29,840
I was happy

860
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,160
when I was

861
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:33,080
with Yang Hua.

862

00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,360
it'd be nice to lead that life

00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,479
forever.

865
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,679
But what if Yang Hua

866
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:46,800
wanted more?

867
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,279
I think I was born

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,759
a long and intimate relationship.

871
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,160
What if

872
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,600
that was what Yang Hua wanted?

873
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:11,560
I don't think

874
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,679
I can give him that.

875
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,120
So I thought

876
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
I shouldn't

877
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,439
so selfishly enjoy

878
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:21,080
the time I spend with him

879
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:24,120
and ignore what he actually needed.

880
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,080
So,

881
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,959
if separation

882
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,640
was the ultimate outcome

883
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,560
of a relationship,

884
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:33,640
wouldn't it be better

885
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,640
to never start one?

886
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:41,039
I am even more confused now.

887
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,439
Do you like him or not?

888
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,880
I love him a lot.

889
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:46,479
That settles it.

890
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,999
There is no right or wrong

891
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,719
in a relationship.

892
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,279
It's about what you're willing to do.

893
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,199
If you miss him,

894
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,160
you should see him.

895
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,759
If you want to be with him,

896
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,400
grab his hand.

897
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,679
No one can know for sure

898
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,439
what the outcome

899
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,999
will be anyway.

900
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:05,679
However,

901
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,239
if you give up the process

902
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:08,640
of loving someone

903
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,120
over uncertainties,

904
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,239
trust me,

905
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:13,039
the regret that comes with it

906
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,199
is much worse.

907
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,920
Did you take

908
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,600
some kind of

909
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,400
upsetting divorce lawsuit?

910
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:20,640
No.

911
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,880
You're in the corporation department.

912
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,759
Why would you take divorce lawsuits?

913
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:28,600
I'm not sure myself.

914
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,120
Was I ever

915
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,999
promoted to the 11th floor?

916
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,160
It feels like a dream to me.

917
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,439
It was fake?

918
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:47,279
Calm down.

919
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,999
Legally speaking,

920
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:50,600
it was real.

921
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:53,279
You really went out of your way.

922
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:56,719
You and Qin Wenyu

923
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:58,039
are one of the same.

924
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,759
You seem smart,

925
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,239
but your actions are always silly.

926
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,160
Look, if you are

927
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,400
already sacrificing so much

928
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,600
for your noble and weirdly secretive

929
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:07,479
ambition,

930
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:08,160
you should

931
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,160
tell your boss.

932
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,039
Of course I must.

933
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,840
Otherwise, I'd be a fraud.

934
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,999
They are sexists.

935
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:16,920
They put you up to this.

936
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,999
And now, you got soft?

937
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,279
Are you suffering from

938
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:20,439
the Stockholm syndrome?

939
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,080
Don't be ridiculous.

940
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:24,560
I'm done with you.

941
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:25,959
You wouldn't understand.

942
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:27,519
No one ever understands me.

943
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:28,199
Tell me

944
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,120
and help me understand.

945
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,679
I am confused.

946
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:31,560
Look.

947
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,679
You've made it clear for yourself.

948
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
It's over,

949
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:36,160
so you are

950
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:37,239
not a fraud.

951
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:38,080
Why did you agree

952
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,640
to get divorced?

953
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,719
I asked myself the same thing.

954
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,999
My feelings for Yang Hua

955
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:51,920
are real.

956
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,800
However, the marriage was not.

957
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:58,120
Even if we could have a future together,

958
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,039
it shouldn't be built

959
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,239
one a lie.

960
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,039
So, it was best for Yang Hua

961
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,600
and I to first

962
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,880
put an end

963
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:08,640
to this lie

964
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:10,920
before we can start a new life.

965
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:12,920
It's no big deal.

966
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,959
Your ruse

967
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:15,999
turned out to be true.

968
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,439
Just go with it.

969
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,759
Why are you

970
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,999
so obsessed with formality?

971
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,840
How is now any better?

972
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
You lost him.

973
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,160
Nothing you say can change that.

974
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,679
What reaction are you expecting?

975
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:29,439
Should I go crying to him

976
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,719
and beg for him to come home?

977
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,439
We've gone our separate ways.

978
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,479
I think...

979
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:43,039
We should calm down for the time being.

980
00:44:43,959 --> 00:44:45,560
Maybe that's for the best.

981
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,640
No.

982
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:51,360
Judging by the expression,

983
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,679
you're troubled.

984
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:55,999
