Madam Tang.

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
I received this just now.

21
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,280
Yao Yao dropped the charges.

22
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,000
With the charges dropped,

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,800
is it time for me

24
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,360
to wrap up the work?

25
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,519
The labor dispute is over.

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,920
But Yao Yao

27
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,119
has been secretly contacting

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,519
the employees of Tianhang Hotel.

29
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,599
Someone is investigating Mr. Yin's

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,039
sexual harassment against his employee.

31
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,599
Are you aware of this?

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,879
Sexual harassment?

33
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,759
I have no idea.

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,440
Are you sure?

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,840
I'm Tianhang's attorney.

36
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,000
My duty is to

37
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,399
defend Tianhang Hotel's rights.

38
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,720
Have no doubt about that.

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,399
Qin Shi, what is the meaning of this?

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,759
Yao Yao called and said

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,720
the charges have been dropped.

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
She said it was your suggestion.

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,160
What are you trying to achieve?

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
(Why would you defend someone)

45
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,119
(like Yin Zhiqiang?)

46
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,879
(Where is your conscience?)

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,679
Li Dai,

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,000
use your brain for once.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,640
Who benefits the most

50
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,519
from the dropping

51
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,440
of those charges?

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
(Think about it.)

53
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,679
When this lawsuit begins,

54
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,720
Yao Yao will become

55
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,519
totally unemployed.

56
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,720
Yin Zhiqiang's motive is pretty clear.

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,319
He is using Tianhang

58
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,479
to save his own neck.

59
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,599
He'll stall and exhaust you.

60
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,160
(As the attorney,)

61
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,759
(did this not cross you mind?)

62
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:33,080
(The labor dispute is over.)

63
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,080
You can work on other cases.

64
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:36,399
Other cases?

65
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,840
Such as?

66
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,280
It has to be

67
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,920
linked to Yin Zhiqiang.

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
Get him out in the light.

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,039
(It has to be a big case
that can cause an uproar.)

70
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,800
(It has to grab the public's attention.)

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,519
Such as...

72
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,679
Sexual harassment.

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,720
Sexual harassment?

74
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,000
(I have a list.)

75
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,840
(The people on that list and I)

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,599
(fought against Yin Zhiqiang.)

77
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,800
(At the time, we had hoped)

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,440
(to resolve the problems
as internal affairs.)

79
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,959
(But, it didn't work.)

80
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
(If we are to take legal actions,)

81
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,119
(we can try persuading them.)

82
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,280
Hello, are you Miss Hou?

83
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,239
I am Yao Yao's attorney.

84
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:18,639
Madam Tang.

85
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,720
Since Yao Yao is accusing him
of sexual harassment,

86
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,359
it will be civil litigation.

87
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,440
She is going after Yin Zhiqiang.

88
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,359
Cheng & Hui should

89
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,639
stay out of this.

90
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,280
Li Dai and I

91
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,119
were the defendant's defense lawyer.

92
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:55,799
It's normal for us

93
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,919
to meet up.

94
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,959
Yeah.

95
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,359
I told

96
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,079
Yin Zhiqiang the same thing.

97
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,399
Do you think he buys it?

98
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,280
It's not my fault he doesn't believe it.

99
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,320
We were supposed to close

100
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,160
the legal counsel deal

101
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,040
with Tianhang.

102
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,600
I waited for two hours

103
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,399
in Tianhang's meeting room.

104
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,000
Yin Zhiqiang never showed up.

105
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,239
Qin Shi.

106
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
I don't care

107
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
if you're involved or not.

108
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,639
I need you

109
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,799
to get her to drop the charges immediately.

110
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,399
I can't do that.

111
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:34,720
I beg your pardon?

112
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,199
Hui.

113
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,639
Do you have any idea

114
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,959
what horrible things

115
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,440
Yin Zhiqiang has done over the years?

116
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:45,560
Do you know

117
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,440
that he used his power in the company

118
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
to sexually harass

119
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,799
a number of female employees?

120
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,639
Some actions

121
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,399
even constitute raping.

122
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,000
The girls he violated

123
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,600
had no means to press charges.

124
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:58,560
They even suffered

125
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,760
his oppression.

126
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,480
If we are to defend him

127
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,519
over a contract,

128
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,919
I think it's worth it

129
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,040
to give up on the deal.

130
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,959
Are you the owner

131
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,519
of this law firm?

132
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:14,919
Hui.

133
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,600
Cheng & Hui exists

134
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,440
to uphold justice

135
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,480
and defend what's good.

136
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,480
I like our company

137
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,760
because we don't

138
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,560
put profit before everything.

139
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,519
I will never go against

140
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,480
my ethics as a lawyer.

141
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,440
Qin Shi.

142
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,799
This is my final warning for you.

143
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,399
Tell Yao Yao to drop the charges.

144
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,199
If not,

145
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,919
I want you out of Cheng & Hui.

146
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:50,840
Qin Shi!

147
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,480
You will regret this.

148
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,799
I never regret

149
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,919
any of my decisions.

150
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,720
If I were to choose again,

151
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,799
I'd do the same.

152
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,919
Miss Qin.

153
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,480
Alright, show some spirit.

154
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
Take care, everyone.

155
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,000
Miss Qin.

156
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,040
Please stay.

157
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,239
I'll give you a hand.

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,320
Yao Yao

159
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,840
is suing Yin Zhiqiang
for sexual harassment.

160
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Are you taking the case?

161
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,359
I took the case.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,440
You're bound to lose the lawsuit.

163
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,119
We won't know unless we try.

164
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,560
It's hard to present evidence

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,959
for this kind of lawsuit.

166
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,799
The court prefers
evidence over witnesses.

167
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,919
Direct evidence

168
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,320
is preferred over the indirect.

169
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,480
You are bound to lose.

170
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,199
Besides,

171
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,560
you wouldn't leave
even when I told you to.

172
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,639
I thought you liked this place.

173
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,000
To fight for your own goal,

174
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,359
you left so willingly.

175
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,680
Cheng & Hui

176
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,600
is not the same firm

177
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,879
I recognized.

178
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:37,999
Qin Shi.

179
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:40,759
Can you please

180
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,280
don't be so headstrong?

181
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Quit the job if you want.

182
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,920
But what about

183
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,480
your next step in this career?

184
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,559
If Madam Tang and Mr. Jin report

185
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,519
your action

186
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,680
to the All China Lawyers Association,

187
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:53,959
you will have no place

188
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,079
in this industry.

189
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,920
Now is not the time to be so willful.

190
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,959
So when is the right time?

191
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,639
Must we wait until the day

192
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
when justice is no more?

193
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,800
The world

194
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,160
is never fair to all.

195
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:09,920
Nothing is ever easy

196
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,519
for grown-ups.

197
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,920
I'll talk to Mr. Jin.

198
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,720
Wait here.

199
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,040
He's so quiet.

200
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,319
He looks like you.

201
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,160
We were

202
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,959
going to do some swimming.

203
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,920
We were passing by.

204
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,280
I thought I should drop by.

205
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,360
But I didn't think you'd be leaving.

206
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,759
Good boy.

207
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,519
Jing.

208
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,559
I am sorry.

209
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:30,519
You've done so much for me

210
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,360
and given up so much for me.

211
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,319
In the end,

212
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,399
I have let you down.

213
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,480
Why makes you say that?

214
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:40,639
I couldn't

215
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,920
secure a position

216
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,600
and become a partner.

217
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,160
You set up so many

218
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,079
grand plans and goals.

219
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,040
But because of my failure,

220
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,680
everything went down the drain.

221
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,639
Actually,

222
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,840
I've heard about

223
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,480
your case.

224
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
You see this as a failure.

225
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,240
But I beg to differ.

226
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,160
In the past, I used to think

227
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,999
changes from top to bottom

228
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,840
were the most effective

229
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,240
solutions to problems.

230
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I used all the radical methods

231
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,280
I could at the time.

232
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
I even got you involved.

233
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,079
I want you

234
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
to help me realize my grand ambitions.

235
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,360
But after I left the law firm,

236
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,879
I came to realize that

237
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,120
justice in society

238
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,920
can't be upheld by only one person.

239
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,999
However,

240
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
as long as people think it's meaningful

241
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,639
and are willing to take action,

242
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,559
even the smallest amount of attention

243
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,480
can be a huge step forward.

244
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,079
I know.

245
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,840
You've done so much

246
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,759
and worked very hard.

247
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,519
Perhaps with you gone,

248
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,959
the others might
become motivated to improve.

249
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,519
That empowers

250
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,840
the self-worth of a woman
more than any fancy words.

251
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,639
Am I right?

252
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,079
It's never easy

253
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,600
to do what we think

254
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,519
is the right thing.

255
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:23,600
You see this as a failure.

256
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,559
But defeat

257
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,519
can be honorable.

258
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
Excuse me.

259
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Your time for this booth is

260
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,319
almost up.

261
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Do you wish to extend it?

262
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,680
Just a while longer. Sorry.

263
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,319
Very well.

264
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,280
Hello? Miss Hou?

265
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,040
Yes.

266
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,879
Understood.

267
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:18,959
I understand.

268
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,160
Miss Li, it's alright.

269
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,999
At least we tried.

270
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:33,999
No one came?

271
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,800
I have

272
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:47,759
bad news

273
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,079
and good news.

274
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:50,199
Which do you want first?

275
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,639
The good news.

276
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,759
I need good news very badly.

277
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,759
The good news is

278
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:58,439
I can focus all I have

279
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,879
on this case

280
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:00,759
starting today.

281
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,519
This is also

282
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,160
the only case I'll be working on.

283
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,759
What do you mean?

284
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,720
Did you resign?

285
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,680
I did.

286
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,559
How is that the good news?

287
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,720
It's terrible news.

288
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,160
What is the bad news?

289
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,840
The bad news is

290
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,040
Yin Zhiqiang caught wind

291
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,959
of our plans.

292
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
From now on,

293
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:26,120
it will be even more
difficult to gather evidence.

294
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,639
Without evidence,

295
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
we can't even build a case

296
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,199
with the allegations.

297
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,040
Now,

298
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,240
here comes the problem.

299
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,600
Do you wish to continue

300
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,639
or give up?

301
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,879
If you want to give up,

302
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,840
we can grab a meal and dismiss.

303
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,079
We'll go back to our lives.

304
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,800
You can carry on

305
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:43,959
with your labor dispute.

306
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,319
I'll go looking for a new job.

307
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,759
What if I want to continue?

308
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:48,399
If that's what you want,

309
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,160
get ready to be flat broke.

310
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,920
The path is a tough one.

311
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:53,800
It's full of

312
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,559
uncertainties.

313
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,639
We could fail,

314
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
or we might succeed.

315
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,519
If we succeed,

316
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,319
we can make Yin Zhiqiang

317
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,280
pay for his actions.

318
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,399
All the other scoundrels like him

319
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,559
will understand

320
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,240
women should not

321
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,759
be messed with.

322
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,959
Make him pay.

323
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,079
Make him pay.

324
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,600
Make him pay.

325
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:20,600
This is our

326
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,319
bullpen.

327
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,360
The rent starts at 1800 yuan.

328
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:23,680
That is our

329
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,280

Miss Hou.

332
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,720
Our meeting room costs

333
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,120
36 yuan for every 30 minutes.

Yao Yao and I

358
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,759
went to so many places

359
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,199
and talked to so many people,

360
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,840
we couldn't find the victims

361
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,199
who would press charges with us,

362

let alone a witness

363
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,319
who would testify for Yao Yao.

364
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:21,999
Not even one?

365
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,280
Not even one.

366
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,439
Don't yell.

367
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,079
Yelling won't

bring the witnesses to you.

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,559
I have no idea

370
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,280
how this lawsuit can go on.

371
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:34,720
Give me some time.

372
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,840
Let me figure something out.

373
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,120
Leading a frugal lifestyle?

374
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,519
You eat that for dinner?

375
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,360
How did you find me?

376
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,759
I know and see everything.

377
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,959
I also know

378
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,319
nothing is going as planned for you.

379
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,000
If you're here to gloat,

380
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,959
please leave.

381
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,079
You haven't found your

382
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:13,959
witnesses and plaintiffs.

383
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,640
I can't disclose that.

384
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,000
I have good news for you.

385
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,079
You can keep the job.

386
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,679
I talked to Mr. Jin.

387
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,400
He will have a word with Madam Tang.

388
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,799
Do you want me to go back there

389
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,679
or are you

390
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,559
asking me to drop Yao Yao's case?

391
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,959
I want you to

392
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,400
mind your own business

393
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,480
and not the others.

394
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,959
What's wrong with me?

395
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,039
I am fine.

396
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,760
Alright, enough about me.

397
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,079
Did you break up with Wu Fei?

398
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,120
I can't disclose it.

399
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,919
Who cares?

400
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,360
But this is

401
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,600
my advice for you.

402
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,400
Didn't you

403
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,959
plan to get married?

404
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,240
How is your relationship so fragile?

405
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,840
You can always talk it through

406
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,880
with each other.

407
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:03,760
As a grown-up,

408
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,840
you should be sensible.

409
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,360
How are you any better?

410
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,079
What are you scratching?

411
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,439
What's with your face?

412
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,439
It's turning red.

413
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,039
See for yourself. It's getting red.

414
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,400
Go on, take a look.

415
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,919
You should have checked before you eat.

416
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,919
There was beef in it.
You should have avoided it.

417
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,799
How should I know
the meat floss egg rolls

418
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,520
were made with beef?

419
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,600
Stop laughing. Mean jerk.

420
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,679
What else do you know?

421
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,640
Thankfully, the owner was reasonable.

422
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,520
I got your deposit back.

423
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,840
You owe me

424
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,039
big time for this.

425
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:14,520
Thanks.

426
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:15,679
Don't thank me.

427
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,319
You're my future boss.

428
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,439
It's my duty to take care of things

429
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,199
for the boss.

430
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,039
The job

431
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,000
might have to wait.

432
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,159
What is it?

433
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,039
Did it go south again?

434
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,840
No.

435
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,480
But before that,

436
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,120
there is a matter I must deal with.

437
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:45,600
Hello, Yang Hua.

438
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,159
What do you need?

439
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,360
Mr. Hu.

440
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,120
I want to postpone
the work to a week later.

441
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:55,520
Is there a reason

442
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,079
I should know?

443
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,439
You asked Hu Ping to wait

444
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,520
so you can deal with Mr. Yin?

445
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,279
Have you lost your mind?

446
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:04,959
Listen to me.

447
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,880
Let me explain.

448
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,679
We can start working

449
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,439
and use Mr. Hu's influence

450
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,640
to go after him later on.

451
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
That's much easier.

452
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
This is personal.

453
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,600
I want to do it myself.

454
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,360
No, it's not.

455
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
This is about Qin Shi.

456
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,640
You two

457
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,000
are divorced. Remember that.

458
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,600
It concerns me.

459
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:25,760
So,

460
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,240
did Mr. Hu say yes?

461
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,480
Tell me something.

462
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,720
Did you drug Mr. Hu?

463
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:36,959
Why would he

464
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,760
say yes to everything?

465
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,039
I answered

466
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,240
an important question he had.

467
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,360
Mr. Yang.

468
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,520
There is a question

469
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,679
that's troubled me

470
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
for a long time.

471
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,279
I'd like you to enlighten me.

472
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,959
In your opinion,

473
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,199
what will be the most important

474
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,720
in the next 10 years

475
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,959
or even 20 years?

476
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,520
What will be the best investment choice?

477
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,079
Mr. Hu.

478
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,360
Perhaps you want to know

479
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,480
if there is a set of standards

480
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,720
that determine

481
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,079
whether an enterprise

482
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,840
has sustainable growth.

483
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,360
That's one way to put it.

484
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,439
I have an idea.

485
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,279
But I'm not sure if that

486
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,559
applies to you.

487
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,959
Let's hear it.

488
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:31,279
Conscience.

489
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,959
I know how ridiculous

490
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:36,760
it sounds.

491
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,720
In the pursuit for profit,

492
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,840
many businesses

493
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,120
are competing with this
"kill-or-be-killed" mindset.

494
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,120
Conscience seems
childish in this context.

495
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,880
That was what I thought.

496
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,360
But based on my observation,

497
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,439
if a business

498
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,360
and its products

499
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
can benefit the industry and society,

500
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,600
or even humanity,

501
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,600
the life force and resilience

502
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,880
it possesses

503
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,799
are infinite.

504
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,199
I am surprised.

505
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:21,039
You're a romantic.

506
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,039
Tell me something.

507
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,000
Are you doing this for Qin Shi

508
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,199
or Yao Yao?

509
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,679
It's Yao Yao, right?

510
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,000
I knew you couldn't forget her.

511
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,400
She is your first love, after all.

512
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,480
I didn't think

513
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:41,159
someone who is

514
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,079
always so hesitant

515
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,480
can be so decisive

516
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,039
with relationships.

517
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,079
Enough chitchat.

518
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:49,799
I think it's a shame

519
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,919
that you gave up on Miss Qin.

520
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,039
But, you have my support.

521
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:54,679
Who told you

522
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,000
I gave up on her

523
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,319
after we were divorced?

524
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,000
I see.

525
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,319
You don't like Yao Yao,

526
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,120
but you gave up everything for her.

527
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,279
You like Miss Qin,

528
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,360
but you let her go.

529
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,480
Don't forget,

530
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,600
Miss Qin has Tao Junhui

531
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,760
by her side, and he is a fearsome rival.

532
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,279
Not bad.

533
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,679
You deserve a compliment.

534
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,240
The medicine is not expired.

535
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,720
Yang Hua installed

536
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,439
the reminder app

537
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,000
on my phone so I don't forget.

538
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,760
Where's the water?

539
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,279
No idea.

540
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,940
(Divorce certificate)

541
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,420
(Qin Shi)

542
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,559
Are you two divorced?

543
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,020
(Divorce certificate)

544
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,400
Don't simply go through my stuff.

545
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,159
Why didn't you

546
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,199
tell me you are divorced?

547
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,400
Qin Shi, marry me.

548
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,279
We'll get married tomorrow.

549
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,319
I don't want to

550
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,959
talk about that right now.

551
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,079
I'm not joking.

552
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,520
I'm serious.

553
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,240
Marry me.

554
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,959
Come back to Cheng & Hui.

555
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,279
Mr. Jin gave his word.

556
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,480
If you come back,

557
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,959
you get to stay on the 11th floor.

558
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,480
You can even become a partner.

559
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,360
But I must drop

560
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,640
Yao Yao's lawsuit, right?

561
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,600
You can set the work aside.

562
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:55,959
Let's get married.

563
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,679
Tao Junhui.

564
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,400
You're a good man

565
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,319
in my book.

566
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,240
You will

567
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,199
certainly be a good husband

568
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,520
and a great father.

569
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,799
But not everyone

570
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,959
should get married.

571
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:13,799
Take me for an example.

572
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,720
I don't believe in marriage.

573
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,439
I don't believe in eternal love.

574
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,199
Or perhaps you believe in love,

575
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,840
it's just that I'm not

576
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,400
the one you want to love.

577
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:28,439
I know what people say.

578
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,120
Fall in love and get married.

579
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,840
That's the norm.

580
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,640
But from what I see,

581
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,480
it's an option in life.

582
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,559
I don't even want to consider it.

583
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,039
I had thought

584
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:40,799
maybe

585
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,840
I should

586
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,120
marry a good man

587
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,720
and enjoy a peaceful married life.

588
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:46,480
Then, we form a family together.

589
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,000
I am not mentally

590
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
prepared for that life.

591
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:50,520
I...

592
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,319
I have no idea

593
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,640
how to get ready for that life.

594
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:54,919
I don't have

595
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,039
the answer in my heart yet.

596
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,319
That is why I can't lie to myself

597
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,840
or you.

598
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,279
Thank you for the appeal.

599
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,919
I will never give up

600
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,360
on Yao Yao's lawsuit.

601
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:10,760
You shouldn't

602
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,760
give up on Wu Fei.

603
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:16,240
You should be with her.

I don't believe in eternal love.

608
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,640
Or perhaps you believe in love,

609
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,240
it's just that I'm not

610
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,959
the one you want to love.

611
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,039
When you love someone,

612
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,480
how can you be sure the love never dies?

613
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,199
It depends on the person.

614
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,480
If it's you, maybe it's possible.

615

(These words came from)

616
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,159
(the bottom of my heart.)

617
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
You need to figure out

618
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,439
what this marriage

619
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,679
means to you.

620
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,760
It is an excuse for you

621
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,159
to run away from reality

622
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,199
and this life?

623
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,400
I want to be

624
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,679
your fortress.

625
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,559
I want to be someone you can count on,

626
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,880
but not your excuse.

627
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,559
You won't get a real life

628
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,439
out of it.

629
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,079
You won't learn

630
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,520
how to face reality.

631
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:31,840
I don't want you

632
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,919

In school, how do we tell

638
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,559
if a student is smart

639
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,240
or not?

640
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,199
With exams.

641
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,959
Who are more afraid of exams?

642
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:53,360
Those with bad grades.

643
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,039
No.

644
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:56,880
Those with bad grades

645
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,360
will always get bad grades.

646
00:27:59,039 --> 00:27:59,679
They don't care

647
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,079
about exams.

648
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,480
Therefore, they are not afraid.

649
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,799
But the top students

650
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,439
are more worried.

651
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:06,959
Their judge

652
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,480
their self worth

653
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
mostly with the good grades

654
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,400
they get from exams

655
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,919
and recognition
from teachers and parents.

656
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
In their eyes,

657
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,600
success should be taken for granted,

658
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,400
failure is unforgivable.

659
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,959
They are used to

660
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,360
living up to others' expectations.

661
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,039
The thought of being a disappointment

662
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,360
terrifies them.

663
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:30,799
Life is but

664
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,240
a very long exam.

665
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:34,400
Marriage

666
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,439
went from a mandatory subject

667
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,480
to being an elective.

668
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:41,959
It comes with many credit units.

669
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,279
But, the curriculum is long,

670
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,799
there are a lot of extra subjects,

671
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,919
and you are very likely to flunk it.

672
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,159
When you flunk it,

673
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,520
all the time and effort

674
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,799
go down the drain.

675
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,400
You even lose credit units for it.

676
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:56,919
Anyone in their right mind

677
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,559
would skip this subject.

678
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,959
You're saying

679
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,079
Miss Qin is not going to take

680
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,720
this subject.

681
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,799
Her dilemma comes from the fact

682
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:14,159
that she wants to take it,

683
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,959
but she's seen too many

684
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,640
who flunked it.

685
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,159
She cares about

686
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,760
this subject more than anyone.

687
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,240
She even tries to

688
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,640
protect everyone

689
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
as best as she can

690
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,120
in her complicated family.

691
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,720
She cares too much,

692
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,079
so she is more afraid than anyone.

693
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
She is afraid of failure.

694
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,919
She doesn't believe

695
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,360
she can have happiness.

696
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:43,959
What is

697
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,679
the best way to avoid failure?

698
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:47,840
Skip the exam.

699
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:49,600
Correct.

700
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
(Thanks, Mom. I love you.)

701
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,039
Silly girl.

702
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:49,799
What got into her this time?

703
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:54,199
After the lengthy explanation,

704
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,640
I'm even more confused.

705
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,000
You knew Miss Qin was against

706
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,079
marriage.

707
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,120
You love her so much.

708
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,880
Why did you

709
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:02,640
get divorced?

710
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,760
Are you crazy?

711
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,640
You're giving her a hard time.

712
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:07,439
What's worse than

713
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,400
failing the exam?

714
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,400
Cheating.

715
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:15,600
A marriage bound

716
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,720
by promises is not real.

717
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,640
I know better

718
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,799
than anyone

719
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:20,799
that running away

720
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,159
never solves anything.

721
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,120
Tell me.

722
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,319
You said

723
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,240
a top student would be
more afraid of the exam.

724
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,520
Aren't you afraid?

725
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:33,919
If you know the trick,

726
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,120
you won't be afraid.

727
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,919
The exam would be just a game.

728
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,360
It'd be a display of skills.

729
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,640
So you're saying

730
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:44,760
you know the tricks of exams?

731
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,360
In other fields, yes.

732
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,880
But marriage

733
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,039
is never about

734
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,240
finding the answer alone.

735
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,919
Two must work together
to answer the question.

736
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:03,720
It boils down to finding someone

737
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,600
who can answer it.

738
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,240
It's not about fear.

739
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,360
I'm returning the right

740
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,480
to choose a partner

741
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,000
to her.

742
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,559
That's the fair way

743
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,400
for both of us.

744
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:19,959
Poor thing.

745
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,640
If she knows

746
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,559
you've done

747
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,720
so much for her,

748
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,439
and she still doesn't change her mind...

749
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,279
You have my pity.

750
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,199
This is my decision.

751
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,319
That's not her fault.

752
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,159
On the contrary, I should thank her.

753
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,760
Without her,

754
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,640
I might have never found

755
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,000
the exam

756
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,319
where I belong.

757
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,880
Excuse me.

758
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,199
We didn't order this. We are full.

759
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,799
I ordered this.

760
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,480
Are you not full yet?

761
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,120
It's not for me.

762
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,079
The project budget

763
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,439
and the delivery note from the supplier.

764
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,919
They treat these

765
00:32:58,919 --> 00:32:59,520
like trash there.

766
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,279
It only took me

767
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,079
three days.

768
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,240
So easy.

769
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:03,840
What are you having here?

770
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,760
Let me have some.

771
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,360
I am starving.

772
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,319
Who is it?

773
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:10,199
What budget?

774
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,319
Dishonorable bunch.

775
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,760
They forsake me.

776
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,980
(Yang Hua)

777
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,780
(Contact Setting)

778
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,580
(Contact Blocked)

779
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,880
I don't want to see you.

780
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,000
Well...

781
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,760
Han Huiting decided

782
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,799
to sue Yin Zhiqiang?

783
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,720
Are you sure?

784
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,160
She is in my office.

785
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:08,960
I think

786
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,999
we can sue him

787
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:10,960
for molestation.

788
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,640
Okay, I'll be right there.

789
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:28,600
I know

790
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:31,960
you've been nervous and hesitant.

791
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,600
You wanted the nightmare

792
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,960
to end.

793
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,200
You want to stop

794
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,840
feeling this fear.

795
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,239
But I assure you,

796
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,999
from this moment on,

797
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,559
you don't have to be afraid anymore.

798
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
We are on your side.

799
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,559
We are in this with you.

800
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:55,680
Don't worry.

801
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,640
Have faith in the law.

802
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
The victims wouldn't

803
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:01,039
stand up and fight

804
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:02,440
because Yin Zhiqiang

805
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,440
is still in power.

806
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,440
They fear revenge from him

807
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,120
What changed their mind?

808
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:09,079
Of course it's different now.

809
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,640
I dug up some dirt

810
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,680
on him.

811
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,799
I reported

812
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:14,279
the messed up stuff in the project

813
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:15,880
to their company.

814
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,719
Yin Zhiqiang's days are numbered.

815
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,319
Just one project?

816
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:24,160
This is just a start.

817
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,079
Listen.

818
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,600
People don't change.

819
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:27,799
We can follow the tracks

820
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,400
and dig up more secrets.

821
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,960
Tianhang is a powder keg

822
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,759
waiting to explode.

823
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,719
A spark is all that we need.

824
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
This is a lot spicier

825
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:35,840
than Miss Yao's plan.

826
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:39,999
Miss Qin.

827
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:46,360
Han.

828
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,519
It's alright.

829
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,840
Alright, it's time for my exit.

830
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,039
- So long.
- Wait.

831
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,680
I need answers.

832
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,880
I didn't ask you to investigate

833
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,559
Yin Zhiqiang.

834
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:07,600
Why did you go after him?

835
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,559
I'm not in Cheng & Hui.

836
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:11,440
I can't pay you.

837
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,239
Don't worry about that.

838
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:15,160
You didn't hire me,

839
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,999
but someone else did.

840
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:16,600
Who is it?

841
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,920
I get it now.

842
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,160
It's Yang Hua, of course.

843
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,640
I said no such thing.

844
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:29,640
Time to go. I'm taking this

845
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,160
bottle of water.

846
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:33,120
Yang Hua surprised me this time.

847
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,600
He went to great lengths

848
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,960
for Yao Yao.

849
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,319
Who said he did it for Yao Yao?

850
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:41,160
What else could it be?

851
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,319
He did it for you?

852
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:45,440
In that case,

853
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:46,440
he would have charged

854
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,880
to the officer of Cheng & Hui.

855
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:50,479
They basically

856
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,279
worshipped

857
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:53,120
the guy named Wang Jiesen.

858
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,039
Yang Hua is now

859
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,440
Hu Ping's right-hand man.

860
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,719
Tang Yihui should

861
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,999
get a Rolls-Royce convoy

862
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,160
to pick you up.

863
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,960
Why would she leave you

864
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,239
jobless out here?

865
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:05,360
Maybe he did it

866
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:06,999
for the good of this nation.

867
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,840
The good of this nation?

868
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:12,999
My goodness.

869
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,360
Hearing that phrase at this moment

870
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,319
sure is surprising.

871
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,519
What is it?

872
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,680
Are you jealous?

873
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:36,400
Are you crying?

874
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,400
Do I look like crying to you?

875
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,440
Should we still help with

876
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:47,559
Yao Yao's case?

877
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,360
Of course.

878
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,440
We finally

879
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,960
have an ally in the fight
against Yin Zhiqiang.

880
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,440
We must make use of this momentum.

881
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,079
Are you sure about this?

882
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,479
You are helping

883
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,960
your rival.

884
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,319
What if they actually

885
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,519
end up falling in love?

886
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:02,079
That will be your doing.

887
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:03,360
You might regret it.

888
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,360
Who says she is my rival?

889
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:08,640
I don't care about her.

890
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,200
Not worthy enough?

891
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,360
Gang, you said

892
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,680
Yin Zhiqiang's days were numbered.

893
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,640
He is still alive and kicking.

894
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,400
Be patient. It will happen soon enough.

895
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,400
We don't need you to be our witness.

896
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,759
We just want to talk.

897
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,799
Han Huiting

898
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:39,039
was wrong.

899
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,640
You have to believe us.

900
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,200
I don't know

901
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,160
what to do.

902
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,999
Only you can help us now.

903
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,960
Based on our statistics,

904
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,920
over the past ten years,

905
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,920
Yin Zhiqiang

906
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:53,799
has victimized

907
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:55,239
over 40 people.

908
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,999
Only 20 of them are willing to provide

909
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,799
useful evidence.

910
00:38:59,279 --> 00:38:59,920
Only 11 of them

911
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,960
are willing to be part of

912
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:01,519
this class action.

913
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
We can press charges now.

914
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,440
Hold on.

915
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,200
I don't think this is enough.

916
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,600
What's not enough?

917
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
We managed to find

918
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:11,920
so many victims

919
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:12,840
after a tremendous effort.

920
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,440
But the thing is,

921
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,239
what are the laws

922
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:17,200
corresponding to these charges?

923
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,759
Right?

924
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,600
It's either Law on the Protection

925
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,799
of Women's Rights and Interests

926
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,479
or

927
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,160
something like

928
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,960
Regulations Concerning the Labor
Protection of Female Staff and Workers.

929
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,479
These only inflict civil penalties.

930
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:29,200
Right?

931
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:31,279
The best you get

932
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:32,479
is compensation and apologies.

933
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,799
They restore your reputation.

934
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,319
Then, they pay damages.

935
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,200
Are these what we want?

936
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,239
Gang.

937
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,039
That was impressive.

938
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:42,880
Have you been secretly

939
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,840
reading law books?

940
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:44,840
When are you the lawyer?

941
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:48,559
You are right. This is wisdom.

942
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,880
You know how it works.

943
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:51,680
One's wisdom

944
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,360
has nothing to do

945
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,640
with your qualification.

946
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,719
To solve a problem,

947
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,880
you need the right train of logic.

948
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,200
Any problem

949
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:02,719
can be solved with ease.

950
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:05,680
That is very deep.

951
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,799
Who taught you that?

952
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:09,719
Our trump card

953
00:40:09,759 --> 00:40:10,479
at the moment

954
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:11,880
is Han Huiting's testimony.

955
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,440
That's all we have.

956
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,680
If we can find more

957
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,279
witness and evidence,

958
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:17,680
we can sue him for

959
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,319
attempted molestation and rape.

960
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,920
These will be criminal charges.

961
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:22,999
Let's not

962
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,239
count our chickens.

963
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,999
Let's be realistic.

964
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,640
For this case,

965
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,640
our victims

966
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,319
want the justice and respect

967
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,759
they deserve.

968
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,719
It's not about money.

969
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,239
Justice delayed is justice.

970
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,360
Well said.

971
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,479
- Come back here!
- Mr. Yin!

972
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:53,239
No! Stop it, Mr. Yin!

973
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:53,600
Boss?

974
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,880
Do you want to keep your job?

975
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,640
Was that

976
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,440
Han?

977
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:00,279
I'll send you back to customer service!

978
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:01,279
Stop it, Mr. Yin!

979
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:02,360
You'll be the head of the department!

980
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:03,759
I...

981
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:05,759
Mr. Tao, why are you...

982
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,719
Keep the evidence.

983
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:09,719
Your phone.

984
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,039
We got it.

985
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,039
Keep drinking.

986
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:23,840
Mr. Tao, we got the wrong room.

987
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:24,680
It's the other room.

988
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,200
It's not our room.

989
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,640
Not our room?

990
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,999
Hey there, Mr. Yin.

991
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:30,759
Brother.

992
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:32,640
What are you doing here?

993
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,239
I've been looking for you.

994
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:36,719
Don't run away from a drink!

995
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,680
I've been looking for you too.

996
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,680
Let's drink!

997
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,239
Come on.

998
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:39,999
I can still walk.

999
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:40,680
Yeah.

1000
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,960
Listen up.

1001
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,840
What you said...

1002
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,999
I gave it some thought on the toilet.

1003
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,640
No...

1004
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,319
No...

1005
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:00,360
Haitao.

1006
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:02,479
Is the plan ready?

1007
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,680
Plan?

1008
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,079
What plan?

1009
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Oh, it's done.
I'll send you the file.

1010
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:17,759
Come with me.

1011
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,200
Are you aware

1012
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,440
of the consequences?

1013
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,400
I know.

1014
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,279
If you sent that email,

1015
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:38,680
your lawyer's license
would get suspended.

1016
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,600
Is it worth it?

1017
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,559
Mr. Tao.

1018
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,120
Do you remember

1019
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,960
the girl you asked me

1020
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:45,880
to find?

1021
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,400
Here.

1022
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,640
Thanks.

1023
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,799
I drove Han home.

1024
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,319
I asked if she wanted
to file a police report.

1025
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,319
If she would,

1026
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,239
I could be her witness.

1027
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:18,880
But she said no.

1028
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,799
She would

1029
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,880
explain to the police

1030
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:22,999
why she was drinking

1031
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,279
with her superior.

1032
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,039
She couldn't afford to lose the job.

1033
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,799
Looking at her

1034
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
reminded me of my sister.

1035
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,120
I don't want my sister

1036
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:37,479
stay silent when she runs into

1037
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,600
scum like him.

1038
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:39,400
Not to mention

1039
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,799
getting oppressed by him.

1040
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,559
I'll help you.
