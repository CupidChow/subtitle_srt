How about this?

20
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:00,828
Let's find a place

21
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,038
to sit down and talk.

22
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:02,517
I promise

23
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:03,797
you will not regret it.

24
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,198
Miss Qin Shi,

25
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:09,918
I knew it.

26
00:02:10,237 --> 00:02:10,918
People like you

27
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:11,637
will never realize

28
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:12,838
what did you do wrong.

29
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:15,797
A person like me?

30
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:17,077
What kind of person am I?

31
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:18,877
Am I not clear enough?

32
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,478
You do anything to achieve your purpose,

33
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:23,077
always choose the easy way
to gain something.

34
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:24,877
You considered others' loss

35
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:26,357
as your cost.

36
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,198
You do whatever it takes.

37
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:29,517
All you care about is your benefit.

38
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:30,398
You are a dirty person!

39
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:00,717
I'm a good lawyer.

40
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:02,437
Miss Qin.

41
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,157
Shut up.

42
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,478
I'm saying that

43
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:09,198
not just because I want to win the case,

44
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:10,877
but also because

45
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,517
I'm upholding the justice system.

46
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,118
I'm not against an individual,

47
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:16,437
but a group of people,

48
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:18,678
an institution,

49
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:20,157
a system,

50
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:21,997
or even a society.

51
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:24,198
Foolhardiness is likely to fail.

52
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:26,237
A failed justice is meaningless.

53
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:27,717
Miss Qin.

54
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:29,038
I said, shut up.

55
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:35,958
A lawyer like me

56
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,237
has to end my career

57
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:38,558
solely because of

58
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:39,717
such an unreasonable personnel system.

59
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:41,997
I couldn't get into a great firm,

60
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:43,198
or take

61
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:44,717
any influential cases.

62
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:46,198
Have you ever thought about

63
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:47,558
whose loss is this?

64
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:49,918
I'm not denying my responsibilities.

65
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:52,118
But now isn't the time

66
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:53,398
for me to give up.

67
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:57,997
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:58,437 --> 00:03:59,437
I made a mistake.

69
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:00,877
I lied,

70
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:03,597
and it hurts you.

71
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:06,517
I don't have a choice.

72
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:21,037
You asked me

73
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:22,438
why did I choose you.

74
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:24,797
I didn't tell you the truth.

75
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:28,118
The trembling feeling of your soul

76
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:29,438
is extremely satisfying.

77
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:30,477
It's enjoyable,

78
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:32,317
yet,

79
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,598
puts you in a risky

80
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:34,838
and dangerous situation.

81
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:37,357
All good things

82
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:39,357
must come to an end.

83
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:42,398
You posted

84
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:43,958
this on Weibo.

85
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:46,278
You deleted it.

86
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:50,678
This sentence impressed me.

87
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:53,637
That's why I chose you.

88
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:03,598
But it seems like,

89
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:05,637
I've picked the wrong person.

90
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:12,558
Wait.

91
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:21,718
Hey, what are you waiting for?

92
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:22,958
Listen.

93
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:23,878
You have just dissed

94
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,477
your one and only fan.

95
00:05:25,637 --> 00:05:26,637
Go after her!

96
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:29,158
What do I say to her?

97
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,197
Wait, are you dumb?

98
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:32,917
Apologize.

99
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:35,438
Tell her, I am sorry.

100
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:36,958
Just leave.

101
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,077
You are so stubborn.

102
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:03,797
Cai Liang.

103
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:05,118
Can you lend me some money?

104
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:05,838
Sure.

105
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:07,158
Two hundred. Deal?

106
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:07,998
Twenty thousand.

107
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:09,357
Twenty thousand?

108
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:11,237
Are you kidding me?

109
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,398
I don't have that much money.

110
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:13,718
All my savings

111
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:14,558
are with you.

112
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:15,598
You know that.

113
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:20,278
Why do you want so much money?

114
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:21,917
I'm moving out.

115
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:22,998
Moving out.

116
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:24,118
That's good.

117
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:24,558
Use

118
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,037
the money in your trading account.

119
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:27,718
The trading account

120
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:28,757
is under my mother's name.

121
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:29,958
She changed the password.

122
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:32,158
Madam She leaves no leeway for you.

123
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,317
It's fine. I have a trick.

124
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:35,237
You can change it back.

125
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:36,317
The registered phone number

126
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:37,357
belongs to my mother as well.

127
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:40,357
So,

128
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:41,757
you don't have any savings?

129
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:44,878
It's better to put my money

130
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:45,878
in the stock market than in the bank.

131
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:47,357
The stock market is my bank.

132
00:06:48,477 --> 00:06:49,398
Come on.

133
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:50,998
Only now you remembered

134
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:52,477
such a big deal.

135
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:53,797
You win.

136
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:47,237
(The trembling feeling of your soul)

137
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:48,558

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:17,540
(Changchun hotel)

146
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,077
Fine. Sit down.

147
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,197
I don't have much.

148
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:26,998
I've sent you

149
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,037
all I have.

150
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:31,637
As for the rest, I'll think of a way.

151
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:32,757
I can get some from my wife.

152
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:34,358
It won't be much.

153
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:36,398
A few thousand, okay?

154
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:37,517
But remember,

155
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:39,918
you must pay me back

156
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,197
before my credit card payment.

157
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:42,317
Must!

158
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:43,517
Otherwise, I'm doomed.

159
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:44,437
Okay.

160
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,077
I'm not finished yet.

161
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:51,677

00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,358
What is it? Not enough scolding?

182
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:08,278
Miss Qin,

183
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:10,478
I went overboard today.

184
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:11,158
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:12,757
Can we meet up?

186
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,200

190
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,398
So,

191
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,437
you are looking for

192
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:33,958
a temporary fiancee.

193
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:36,317
So your mother will give up

194
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:37,757
forcing you to marry.

195
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:39,238
You are looking for someone

196
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,798
who is a good match
in terms of appearance,

197
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:41,478
but at the same time,

198
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,838
not attached,

199
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:44,798
to deal with your mother's idea

200
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:46,478
of ostensibly forcing you to marry

201
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,117
but is actually asking you to work.

202
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:48,598
Am I right?

203
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:49,598
Absolutely correct.

204
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:54,238
Well, last night

205
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,117
you were pointing the finger at me,

206
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,478
accusing me as a dirty person.

207
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:58,517
You've changed your mind so quickly.

208
00:10:59,437 --> 00:10:59,997
Ms. Qin,

209
00:10:59,997 --> 00:11:01,038
I think you are right.

210
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:02,677
I don't know you

211
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:03,598
very well,

212
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:04,197
but

213
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:05,958
but if you tell lies

214
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,278
for justice and righteousness,

215
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:08,517
I think the approach

216
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,117
is somewhat flexible.

217
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:12,557
Understand.

218
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,077
But, no.

219
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:20,517
I can put the grace period
for the divorce

220
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:21,637
to three months.

221
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:24,038
Mr. Yang,

222
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:26,517
the terms proposed
are not tempting at all.

223
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,437
Talk to me when you think it over.

224
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,077
Ms. Qin,

225
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:34,437
it seems like

226
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:36,478
you don't take
your career seriously too.

227
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:37,517
It's not that

228
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:38,598
I don't take it seriously,

229
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:41,038
it's because I found out

230
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,718
your condition is worse than mine.

231
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:47,718
One doesn't change

232
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:48,877
their opinion easily.

233
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:50,598
And you've not only changed

234
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:52,158
but are willing to

235
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,398
sit down with me,

236
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:54,958
someone you hate the most,
to negotiate.

237
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:56,757
It indicates

238
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:58,677
that your current situation

239
00:11:58,677 --> 00:11:59,918
is worse than mine.

240
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:04,598
And so,

241
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,677
you are not in a position

242
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:07,158
to negotiate with me.

243
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,398
Fine, tell me what you want.

244
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:10,677
What I want is simple.

245
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:11,997
Be my husband.

246
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:15,437
But don't worry,

247
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:16,798
just a husband in name.

248
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:19,557
Everything else is still the same.

249
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:20,798
All you need to do

250
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:21,757
is attend some important social events

251
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:22,838
with me, occasionally,

252
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:24,317
as my husband,

253
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:25,877
and pretend to be a lovely couple.

254
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:27,517
The rest of the time,

255
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:28,437
you are

256
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:29,278
a professional manager

257
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:30,278
working overseas.

258
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:31,238
You can do whatever you want.

259
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:32,478
It has nothing to do with me.

260
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:34,398
How long will this last?

261
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:35,158
Six months?

262
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:36,358
What about after that?

263
00:12:36,877 --> 00:12:38,358
You are free
and you can go your own way.

264
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:40,598
Deal.

265
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,278
A verbal promise is not enough.
Let's sign a document.

266
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:44,637
I'll draft the contract.

267
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:07,437
Ms. Qin.

268
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:08,358
You have six months

269
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,718
to prove that you are a good lawyer.

270
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:11,197
If I found you lying,

271
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:11,877
or your action

272
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:13,478
is harming others' interest...

273
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:15,958
You can always come to my firm

274
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,798
to expose me.

275
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,180
(Party B: Yang Hua)

276
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:24,598
Happy to work with you.

277
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,117
- Let's go on a work trip with me today.
- Can you come to my home today?

278
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:31,117
Work trip?

279
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,278
Pinghu. A charity dinner.

280
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:35,517
When are we going back to your home?

281
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:38,158
Today, if possible.

282
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:41,517
Sure.

283
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:42,757
I'll go to your home at 1 p.m. later

284
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,437
and stay for two hours,

285
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:45,598
then you'll go on a work trip with me.

286
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:48,637
Two hours.

287
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:50,958
It should be more than enough

288
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,197
to deal with my mother. Okay.

289
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:54,718
Mr. Yang.

290
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:55,958
Ms. Qin, in my opinion,

291
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:58,038
for future cooperation purposes,

292
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:58,637
it'd be better

293
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,038
if you call me Yang Hua.

294
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:01,317
Alright, Yang Hua.

295
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:03,038
I have a question for you.

296
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:04,918
You can choose not to answer me.

297
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,038
Well...

298
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,278
Why did you

299
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:08,398
delete the Weibo post?

300
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:15,358
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,238
Forget what I just said.

302
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:20,197
I'm whining

303
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:22,077
because my value judgment

304
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:23,278
is different from others.

305
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:25,437
But in fact, this is a childish act.

306
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:26,877
I didn't expect

307
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,317
it to be seen

308
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,877
and recognized.

309
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:37,557
Take it as

310
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:38,637
one of the reasons

311
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:39,598
I contacted you.

312
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:58,757
What?

313
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:00,838
You are getting married?

314
00:15:02,598 --> 00:15:03,958
I'm planning to work

315
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:05,158
and date for a year.

316
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,038
A year later,

317
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,358
if there's no disagreement,

318
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:08,358
then we'll get married.

319
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:10,077
Qin Shi is a nice girl.

320
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:11,877
She doesn't want a wedding,

321
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:12,757
a diamond ring,

322
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:14,117
or a new house.

323
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,117
But as her boyfriend,

324
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,278
I should show my sincerity.

325
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:18,997
I've decided to add her name

326
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:20,197
to the property title deed.

327
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:22,437
What?

328
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:24,197
And,

329
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,437
the way of living of

330
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:26,757
young people and elders is different.

331
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:28,557
So, it's better to live separately.

332
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:29,478
Since I'm the one

333
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:30,437
who buys the house,

334
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:31,757
I'm afraid both of you

335
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:32,918
might need to move.

336
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:35,437
Moving forward, the owner of the house

337
00:15:35,437 --> 00:15:36,677
will be Qin Shi.

338
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:37,478
By the way, mom.

339
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:39,117
You may need to give her the money

340
00:15:39,117 --> 00:15:40,598
that you've been safekeeping for me.

341
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:41,437
Oh,

342
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:43,278
and we are not
planning to have children.

343
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:45,358
No way.

344
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:47,117
Absolutely no!

345
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:48,557
Come.

346
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:57,478
Hua,

347
00:15:58,077 --> 00:15:59,757
where did you know this girl?

348
00:16:00,637 --> 00:16:01,117
Did she

349
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:02,278
come up with all these ideas?

350
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:04,238
She looks pretty

351
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:05,598
but is a black-hearted woman.

352
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:07,637
Hua, I'm not in a hurry.

353
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:08,598
I meant it.

354
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:10,238
There's no need for you
to rush into marriage.

355
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:11,158
Hurry up,

356
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:12,557
send this woman away.

357
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:16,077
Mom, what did you say?

358
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:17,637
No need to rush into marriage?

359
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:32,598
Here?

360
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:37,997
You don't even know your house?

361
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:41,358
Here is it, let's go.

362
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:42,038
Wait.

363
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:44,877
Let's go.

364
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:10,437
I'll get some hot water.

365
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:15,958
Mom, I've just said.

366
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,197
I'm planning to go to work.

367
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,238
We'll date for a year,
then we'll get married.

368
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:21,157
I heard that.

369
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,238
Qin,

370
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:24,718
what's your zodiac sign?

371
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:27,518
I'm six years older than Yang Hua.

372
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:30,037
Surely.

373
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:31,917
Love transcends age differences.

374
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:34,638
Yang Hua chooses to be with you,

375
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:37,077
I bet you must be outstanding.

376
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:38,917
What is your education level?

377
00:17:40,797 --> 00:17:42,518
I study law at university

378
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:43,917
and have a Master's degree in economics.

379
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:46,838
You are a lawyer.

380
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:49,358
People nowadays,

381
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:51,197
love to file a lawsuit.

382
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:53,437
Law is a great career choice.

383
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,197
Your firm must be making a lot of money.

384
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,958
Which law firm are you working in?

385
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:00,518
Mom,

386
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:02,797
I told you we are getting married.

387
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:03,797
And the house...

388
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:04,397
Marry?

389
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:05,998
It's natural for the man

390
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,598
to pay for the house.

391
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,358
Furthermore, Qin is such a great girl.

392
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:10,958
It's our blessing

393
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,758
to have her in our family.

394
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:14,478
You should definitely

395
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:15,917
add her name to the property title deed.

396
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:17,998
This house is reserved

397
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,277
for you to live in after married.

398
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,358
I've discussed it with your father.

399
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:22,998
As soon as you get married,

400
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:24,157
we'll buy another smaller house

401
00:18:24,157 --> 00:18:25,718
near the community.

402
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,037
We are not going to

403
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,638
disturb your love life.

404
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:41,277
We are not going to hold
a wedding ceremony.

405
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:45,077
It's fine.

406
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:46,917
I'm very open-minded.

407
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:48,638
Wedding...

408
00:18:56,277 --> 00:18:57,397
We are not planning to have kids too.

409
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:01,317
No problem.

410
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,598
We are old,

411
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:05,277
and we are also

412
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,157
eager to meet our grandchildren,

413
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:08,998
but after all,

414
00:19:08,998 --> 00:19:10,598
it's your life.

415
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:11,677
Am I right?

416
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:13,518
Don't worry, Qin.

417
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:15,677
When you are married to our family,

418
00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:16,677
I'll treat you

419
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,638
like my daughter.

420
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:20,277
You can't find

421
00:19:20,277 --> 00:19:22,238
such a great mother-in-law in the world.

422
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,157
(Little brat,)

423
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:38,718
(do you think I'll fall for it?)

424
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,557
(Trying to make me surrender?)

425
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:42,077
(You're still too young.)

426
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,557
(I'll see how are you
going to continue with this.)

427
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:49,598
Mom.

428
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:50,758
I...

429
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:51,397
Hua,

430
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,478
in my opinion,

431
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:55,358
one year is too long.

432
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:56,317
Six months.

433
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:57,758
No.

434
00:19:58,478 --> 00:19:59,317
Three months.

435
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:01,718
Get along with each other
in three months.

436
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:02,998
After three months,

437
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:04,077
you can settle down.

438
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:06,518
If you are not holding
a wedding ceremony,

439
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:07,838
you can go on wedding travel.

440
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:08,998
By then,

441
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:11,197
four of us

442
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,878
can travel together.

443
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:14,878
What do you think?

444
00:20:25,238 --> 00:20:26,077
Three months?

445
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:30,197
(I bet you can't hold it back.)

446
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:35,118
I think three months

447
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:36,557
is like a waste of time.

448
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:40,478
Madam,

449
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,317
what Yang Hua just said

450
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:45,037
are his ideas.

451
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:46,238
As you know,

452
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:47,718
he's more of a traditional person,

453
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,397
and he's afraid
that you can't accept it.

454
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:52,157
It seems like

455
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:54,197
you don't know your mother very well.

456
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:58,077
Since you are an open-minded person,

457
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,638
I'll say my opinion then.

458
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:08,557
I only know Yang Hua

459
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:10,518
for a short period,

460
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:12,157
but I think he is a man

461
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:14,037
that I can count on.

462
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:15,838
Well,

463
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,238
I'm not young anymore.

464
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:18,077
So,

465
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,718
I wanted to get married right away.

466
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:26,878
You've been living here,

467
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,838
there's no reason for me
to make you leave.

468
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,037
I own a house.

469
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:32,277
After marriage,

470
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:33,718
Yang Hua can live at my house.

471
00:21:34,037 --> 00:21:35,437
To work or not to work is not a problem.

472
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:36,557
My salary

473
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:37,797
is more than enough for the two of us.

474
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:39,758
The only thing is

475
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,437
that I'm quite busy at work.

476
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:42,917
So after we get married,

477
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:44,238
you have to do

478
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:45,638
household chores.

479
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:47,638
Wait a minute.

480
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:48,437
Well.

481
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,358
Do you mean

482
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,197
Yang Hua

483
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:53,758
will be a matrilocal son-in-law?

484
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:57,598
You can say so.

485
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:00,878
This...

486
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:02,118
In my opinion,

487
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:04,518
marriage is the cooperation of
two people.

488
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:08,358
I'm good at working and making money,

489
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:10,197
while Yang Hua is a detailed person,

490
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:11,998
so he can take very good care
of our home.

491
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:13,998
I think this is perfect

492
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:14,998
for the two of us.

493
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:21,878
Well, I think marriage

494
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:23,197
is a big deal.

495
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:25,118
You should know each other well,

496
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:26,797
and spend more time with each other.

497
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:28,118
There's no need to rush into marriage.

498
00:22:28,118 --> 00:22:28,758
Well...

499
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:29,878
Yang Hua,

500
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:32,638
do you think the same?

501
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,317
Madam,

502
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:35,998
he listens to me.

503
00:22:45,718 --> 00:22:47,317
(Good job.)

504
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,157
(Challenging my mother's)

505
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:50,557
(authority as the female lead
of the house.)

506
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:52,077
(Control issue,)

507
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:54,478
(that's my mother's pain point.)

508
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:04,758
Miss Qin,

509
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,718
I have no objection to your marriage.

510
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:09,758
But at least,

511
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:11,317
both families

512
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:12,598
should meet up before the marriage.

513
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:21,197
In fact, a meet-up is not necessary.

514
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,157
I'm in charge of my family.

515
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:25,157
My father is like you.

516
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:25,838
He is

517
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,118
a very open-minded person.

518
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,557
My dad has been married three times.

519
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:32,518
Every time he sees me,

520
00:23:32,518 --> 00:23:33,317
he would say

521
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,598
he has been married twice

522
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:35,917
and has two children my age.

523
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:37,958
Time waits for no one.

524
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,718
Mom.

525
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:06,277
How is it?

526
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:07,397
I'm good, right?

527
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:08,557
Now you believe

528
00:24:08,557 --> 00:24:09,638
I'm a good lawyer.

529
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,358
It's good that you are confident.

530
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,260
(Mother)

531
00:24:19,277 --> 00:24:20,358
Mother.

532
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:24,037
Hang up.

533
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:26,917
Hang up.

534
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,720
(Mother)

535
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,860
(Mother)

536
00:24:38,197 --> 00:24:39,238
Yang,

537
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:40,397
give me your phone.

538
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:41,917
I... I...

539
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:45,157
Do you think you can get through
if you change to another phone?

540
00:24:45,157 --> 00:24:46,118
Get me a glass of water.

541
00:24:47,478 --> 00:24:48,118
Turn off the phone.

542
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:53,277
Mr. Yang,

543
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,197
don't make me

544
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:56,118
repeat my word.

545
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:57,638
I'm a negotiator.

546
00:24:57,638 --> 00:24:58,838
Trust me.

547
00:24:59,238 --> 00:24:59,797
Turn off.

548
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,100
(Power Off)

549
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:08,878
The number you have dialed
is not available.

550
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,838
I've told you not to push him.

551
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:12,638
Look.

552
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:15,397
Am I the only one pushing him?

553
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:17,277
As if you are not involved.

554
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:18,077
You are

555
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:19,437
the best person in the world.

556
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,157
I didn't say that.

557
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:22,557
Take it easy.

558
00:25:22,557 --> 00:25:23,838
Told you to get me a glass of water.

559
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:25,317
What's with all the nonsense?

560
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:25,758
Alright.

561
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,478
Yes, Madam.

562
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:30,677
You've heard what the lawyer

563
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:32,157
said just now.

564
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:34,118
If our son is married
to this kind of person,

565
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:36,397
there'll be no peaceful day.

566
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:38,358
Your son likes her.

567
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:39,677
That's nothing you can do.

568
00:25:40,197 --> 00:25:41,437
Six years older.

569
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:43,118
She's six years older than him.

570
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:44,758
Our son...

571
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:45,838
When she graduated from university,

572
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,478
our son is still a minor.

573
00:25:48,118 --> 00:25:49,958
She asks our son
to stay at home, unemployed.

574
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:50,718
Who does she think

575
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:51,998
our son is?

576
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,118
Why do you bother?

577
00:25:54,118 --> 00:25:55,998
After all, your son likes her.

578
00:25:55,998 --> 00:25:57,317
Bullshit!

579
00:25:57,317 --> 00:25:58,397
Can't you see

580
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,718
that he did this on purpose to annoy us?

581
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:02,838
So, do you agree

582
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:04,157
or not agree?

583
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:08,677
You are so hard-headed.

584
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,077
I have nothing to say to you.

585
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:12,037
I'm sure

586
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,037
I could beat him.

587
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:15,238
He is smart,

588
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:16,557
but he's still my son.

589
00:26:16,557 --> 00:26:18,037
Look at you, why are you

590
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:19,037
so mad?

591
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:19,878
No matter what you do,

592
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,358
still, he's your son.

593
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:22,197
Right?

594
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:25,197
I drafted it this afternoon.

595
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:26,118
I was in a hurry

596
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,037
but I tried to recall

597
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:27,878
all the details.

598
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:29,197
What is it?

599
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:30,677
Everything

600
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:31,917
about my husband,

601
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:32,958
about you.

602
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:42,677
(My husband works in finance in Canada.)

603
00:26:44,998 --> 00:26:46,718
(He specializes in
mergers and acquisitions.)

604
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:06,598
(He majors in International Business.)

605
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:10,397
Do you know

606
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:11,358
what international business is about?

607
00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:17,317
(As a working woman,)

608
00:27:17,998 --> 00:27:19,317
there must be a give and take.

609
00:27:19,998 --> 00:27:20,397
I...

610
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:24,718
I think when he grows up,

611
00:27:24,718 --> 00:27:25,758
he'll understand me.

612
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:26,758
No one

613
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,277
would understand you more than me.

614
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,638
I'm also a mother.

615
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:31,638
My kid

616
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:32,878
is not in good health.

617
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,677
My kid is being treated overseas.

618
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:36,238
Do we have a son?

619
00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:38,478
He's two and a half years old.

620
00:27:38,478 --> 00:27:39,317
Aries.

621
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:40,557
His blood type is AB.

622
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:41,878
His idol is Ne Zha.

623
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:46,277
Wait a minute.

624
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:48,518
We've only been married for two years.

625
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:49,917
How do we have a son
who is two and a half years old?

626
00:27:56,838 --> 00:27:57,758
I don't care if there's a bug.

627
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:58,758
This is

628
00:27:58,758 --> 00:27:59,958
the most mature version.

629
00:28:00,197 --> 00:28:01,478
Memorize it.

630
00:28:01,838 --> 00:28:03,478
If we bump into acquaintances
at the dinner,

631
00:28:03,478 --> 00:28:04,917
make sure you don't get me into trouble.

632
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:06,397
If you can't memorize it,

633
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:07,397
then try not to talk.

634
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,820
(Li Dai)﻿

635
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,238
Hello.

636
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:21,437
Qin Shi, where are you?

637
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:24,277
Can you stop being so childish?

638
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:26,197
The candidate for legal counsel of

639
00:28:26,197 --> 00:28:27,677
the Association for Women Entrepreneurs
has been decided.

640
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,437
You can't change anything

641
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:30,878
even if you go to Ms. Lan now.

642
00:28:31,638 --> 00:28:32,758
This will

643
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,077
put all your effort in vain.

644
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:37,958
The connection is bad over here.

645
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:39,917
What did you say? I can't hear you.

646
00:28:40,277 --> 00:28:41,557
Stop pretending.

647
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:43,518
I'm reminding you.

648
00:28:44,037 --> 00:28:45,358
If you don't take my advice,

649
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:46,598
you'll make a fool of yourself.

650
00:28:46,677 --> 00:28:47,917
In the meantime, bring disgrace

651
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:48,478
to the law firm.

652
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,317
Do you understand?

653
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:52,077
Ms. Li, you're so smart.

654
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:53,758
You know idioms.

655
00:28:54,878 --> 00:28:55,638
Qin Shi,

656
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:58,358
you'd better come back right away.

657
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:00,518
If you have any comments,

658
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:01,718
we can communicate.

659
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:04,518
I'm sorry.

660
00:29:04,518 --> 00:29:06,317
My husband has been bugging me

661
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:07,758
to go on a holiday with him.

662
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:08,758
I gotta hang up.

663
00:29:08,758 --> 00:29:09,677
Love you. Bye.

664
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:15,397
Ms. Tang.

665
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:16,878
Look.

666
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:24,397
I know what's on Qin Shi's mind.

667
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:25,917
She is seeking validation.

668
00:29:26,157 --> 00:29:28,197
She knows when to stop.
She's not going to make things worst.

669
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:30,277
If she can change their mind

670
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:31,797
with a couple of words,

671
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:33,478
well, then she's capable.

672
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:47,197
Hi.

673
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:49,317
It's Ms. Qin Shi and Mr. Yang Hua

674
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:50,478
from Xi Mei PR, right?

675
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:51,598
Okay, please give me a moment.

676
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,518
Is Ms. Lan here already?

677
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:54,878
Yes, she is.

678
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:56,917
(Check-in)
The dinner starts at 8.30 p.m.

679
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:58,557
(Check-in)
The banquet hall is located on the second floor.

680
00:29:58,718 --> 00:29:59,277
(Check-in)
Both of you

681
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:00,358
(Check-in)
can have a rest in the room

682
00:30:00,397 --> 00:30:01,358
(Check-in)
or walk around

683
00:30:01,358 --> 00:30:02,118
(Check-in)
the resort.

684
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:02,758
Thank you.

685
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,397
Welcome.

686
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:10,557
Hello.

687
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:11,478
Hello, Sir.

688
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,470
(Check-in)

689
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:17,958
(Check-in)
Mr. Tao Junhui from New World Law Firm,

690
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:18,838
am I right?

691
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:19,317
Yes.

692
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:21,358
May I ask where is your partner?

693
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:21,998
I'm sorry.

694
00:30:21,998 --> 00:30:22,998
She can't make it

695
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:23,718
due to an emergency.

696
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:24,998
I've already talked to
Ms. Lan about this.

697
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:27,397
I'm sorry, Mr. Tao.

698
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:28,998
There's a special requirement
from Yulan Group.

699
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,197
Singles are not allowed.

700
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:33,838
I'm his partner.

701
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:34,917
- Ms. Lan.
- Ms. Lan.

702
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:38,077
Why is Feifei so busy?

703
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:39,277
Tell her,

704
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:40,638
Aunt Lan is unhappy.

705
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,758
I'm really sorry.

706
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,037
Feifei is caught up with urgent work.

707
00:32:05,317 --> 00:32:05,917
Hey.

708
00:32:07,598 --> 00:32:08,358
Lend me a hand.

709
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:14,677
Zip.

710
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:48,878
Stuck... It's stuck.

711
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:57,838
Done?

712
00:32:57,838 --> 00:32:58,317
Yes.

713
00:32:58,317 --> 00:32:58,917
Thanks.

714
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,277
Why aren't you getting changed?

715
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,317
I did.

716
00:33:12,718 --> 00:33:14,037
Where did you get the clothes?

717
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:17,397
This is my formal wear.

718
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:19,238
Do you have any other clothes?

719
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:23,437
Let's go.

720
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:24,718
Where to?

721
00:33:46,077 --> 00:33:47,037
I think my clothes

722
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:47,998
look pretty good.

723
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:04,998
Go get changed.

724
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,540
OK.

725
00:34:21,078 --> 00:34:21,837
Later,

726
00:34:21,837 --> 00:34:23,278
I might not be able to look after you.

727
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:25,397
Anyway, answer their questions
if you understand,

728
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:27,798
and pretend to lose them
if you don't understand.

729
00:34:28,078 --> 00:34:29,637
Just don't expose yourself.

730
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:31,117
Are you done?

731
00:34:35,597 --> 00:34:36,478
How much?

732
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:37,917
Do you want them all?

733
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:39,637
- No.
- Yes.

734
00:34:48,117 --> 00:34:49,958
I can't afford this.

735
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:50,837
What is it?

736
00:34:51,117 --> 00:34:52,078
The clothes.

737
00:34:53,318 --> 00:34:54,637
It's fine. Keep it clean.

738
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,117
We'll return later.

739
00:34:58,917 --> 00:34:59,637
Oh.

740
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:00,758
Aren't you trying to

741
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:01,357
get your client back?

742
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:02,278
Tell me your plan.

743
00:35:02,278 --> 00:35:03,238
So I can play along.

744
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,318
Touch with heart, reason by truth.

745
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:06,278
Question.

746
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:08,078
Zhao Danping lost 1.2 million

747
00:35:08,117 --> 00:35:09,877
because of Li Dai.

748
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:11,917
But why would she choose Li Dai

749
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:13,117
to be her attorney?

750
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,437
It's simple.

751
00:35:14,558 --> 00:35:15,518
If I am defeated by that person,

752
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:16,197
it means

753
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,197
that the person is capable.

754
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:18,278
If I get into trouble,

755
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:19,197
I would definitely go to this person.

756
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:20,157
Because I know

757
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:21,238
she will do her very best

758
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:22,798
for her client.

759
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:24,478
They had never met me,

760
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:26,518
but they concluded that Li Dai
is more capable than me.

761
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:27,917
This is not fair to me.

762
00:35:28,518 --> 00:35:29,917
What I'm going to do today

763
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:31,157
is to showcase

764
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:32,078
my ability.

765
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:33,677
But how?

766
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:35,518
I'm here today,

767
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:36,117
but Li Dai isn't.

768
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:37,357
That speaks for itself.

769
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:39,877
I recognize Li Dai's

770
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:41,157
professional skills.

771
00:35:41,157 --> 00:35:42,877
We are equally good

772
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:43,677
in different aspects,

773
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:44,597
but there's one thing,

774
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:46,278
I'm so much better than her.

775
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:49,597
That is,

776
00:35:49,758 --> 00:35:50,397
there is no turning back

777
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:51,518
for me.

778
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:53,238
If I want to achieve something,

779
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,157
no matter how difficult it is,

780
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:55,637
I'll do my best to achieve it.

781
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,478
Everyone knows how to

782
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:58,518
act in front of the client.

783
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:00,318
But ultimately, a lawyer's job is to

784
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:01,718
protect the client's interest

785
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:02,758
not be compromised.

786
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:04,758
Once I take on a case,

787
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:06,397
I'll do my very best

788
00:36:06,718 --> 00:36:08,397
to optimize the client's benefit.

789
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:08,958
What do you think?

790
00:36:09,998 --> 00:36:10,837
That's all?

791
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:12,117
Should I be more sincere?

792
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:15,958
If you are trying to convince them

793
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,238
with these two sentences,

794
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:18,238
I think you can

795
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:19,397
be chill about the outcome.

796
00:36:20,397 --> 00:36:21,437
Why?

797
00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:22,677
If you do want to convince them,

798
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:25,917
that person over there
will be more convincing.

799
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:30,637
Pang Dingfang?

800
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:32,718
He is the president of

801
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:34,117
Luowei Yulan Foundation

802
00:36:34,117 --> 00:36:35,478
and the CEO of Yulan Group.

803
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:36,518
As the saying goes,
capture the leader first.

804
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:37,837
In this case, he is the leader.

805
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,278
Do you know him?

806
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:42,877
No. It's my first time meeting him.

807
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:43,837
Then how do you know...

808
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:47,597
I bet you don't read
the conference materials

809
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:48,798
or user manual.

810
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:50,958
I bet you are someone

811
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,038
who follows the user manual.

812
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:53,318
Well, the user manual

813
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:54,197
exists for a reason.

814
00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:55,637
I'm not going to continue
with this useless conversation.

815
00:36:56,357 --> 00:36:57,357
That theory you mentioned

816
00:36:57,357 --> 00:36:58,877
might be more convincing for him.

817
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:00,437
There are two ways to approach him.

818
00:37:00,437 --> 00:37:01,677
First, technical.

819
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:02,837
You may ask him,

820
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:03,998
what's his opinion on

821
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:05,357
the future of economics

822
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,117
as an entrepreneur.

823
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:08,038
After you catch his attention,

824
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:09,397
you can go with your theory.

825
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:12,117
How about the non-technical way?

826
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:13,558
Non-technical way...

827
00:37:15,197 --> 00:37:15,837
Like that.

828
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:19,877
Miss, are you okay?

829
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:20,677
- My leg.
- Is the injury serious?

830
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:22,637
I think I sprained my ankle.

831
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:26,038
It hurts.

832
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:27,197
If it hurts,

833
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:28,437
you'd better go to the hospital.

834
00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:29,637
Dear, are you okay?

835
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:31,318
Did you sprain your ankle?

836
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:31,998
That's a serious injury.

837
00:37:31,998 --> 00:37:33,357
Let's send you to the hospital.

838
00:37:34,078 --> 00:37:35,397
Who are you?

839
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,478
We had dinner together yesterday.

840
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:38,397
Don't you remember me?

841
00:37:38,518 --> 00:37:39,597
Where is your husband?

842
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,397
I'm not even married.

843
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:42,637
Why would I have a husband?

844
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,917
You got the wrong person.

845
00:37:44,718 --> 00:37:46,117
I thought everyone
is bringing their partner

846
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:47,238
to the dinner tonight.

847
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:48,758
I must have mistaken you
for someone else.

848
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:55,518
Madam,

849
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:57,278
everyone at this dinner

850
00:37:57,278 --> 00:37:57,917
is VIP.

851
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,758
It's our responsibility
to take care of everyone's

852
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:01,478
health and safety.

853
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:02,917
There is

854
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:03,998
a medical team in the resort.

855
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,197
We can send you there for a check-up.

856
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,558
It's okay. There's no need.

857
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:09,837
It's okay, I'm fine.

858
00:38:10,677 --> 00:38:11,798
Let me go.

859
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:13,157
Let go of me.

860
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:19,278
I don't agree with Mr. Pang

861
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:20,357
on a few things.

862
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:21,318
Recently released data

863
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:22,758
showed that
the scale of nongovernmental financing

864
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,558
is not up to expected.

865
00:38:23,558 --> 00:38:25,157
So, I think the domestic economy

866
00:38:25,157 --> 00:38:26,758
tends to contract.

867
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:27,798
Besides,

868
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:29,518
Mr. Pang seems to underestimate

869
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:30,758
the government's determination

870
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:32,038
to regulate overseas assets.

871
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:32,798
We are

872
00:38:32,798 --> 00:38:33,958
the world's second largest economy.

873
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,597
We are capable and have all means.

874
00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:38,357
I think his opinion

875
00:38:38,437 --> 00:38:39,877
is inconsistent.

876
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:40,637
Mr. Pang,

877
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:42,677
if he is confident in

878
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:44,718
the country's capability,

879
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:45,597
then why is he

880
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:46,917
so pessimistic

881
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:48,357
about the economy?

882
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:50,998
Since the first half of the year,

883
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:53,038
we have proven

884
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:54,278
that we can do

885
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:55,078
what many think

886
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:56,397
is impossible

887
00:38:56,397 --> 00:38:57,597
and difficult to achieve.

888
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,558
It's too early

889
00:38:58,558 --> 00:38:59,718
to make such a statement.

890
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:09,117
My apologies, Mr. Pang.

891
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:10,238
I'm embarrassing myself.

892
00:39:12,038 --> 00:39:13,078
Very well said.

893
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:15,558
How do I address you?

894
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:16,318
Tao Junhui.

895
00:39:17,197 --> 00:39:18,718
You are Mr. Tao.

896
00:39:18,718 --> 00:39:20,078
Xiaoting always talks about you.

897
00:39:20,078 --> 00:39:21,718
We finally have the chance to meet.

898
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:22,278
I've heard so much about you.

899
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:26,718
How do I address you?

900
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:28,038
I...

901
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:30,357
Here you are.

902
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:33,038
Hello, Mr. Pang.

903
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,637
He is Yang Hua, my husband.

904
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:36,278
I'm a lawyer from Cheng & Hui.

905
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:37,157
I'm Qin Shi.

906
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:37,877
Nice to meet you.

907
00:39:38,038 --> 00:39:38,637
Hello.

908
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,397
Here, Mr. Pang.

909
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:50,397
Cheers.

910
00:39:50,718 --> 00:39:53,278
Sure. Nice to meet you.

911
00:39:53,278 --> 00:39:54,318
Nice to meet you.

912
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:09,718
Mr. Pang.

913
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:10,917
Actually, we are here today

914
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:12,637
to talk to Ms. Lan

915
00:40:12,718 --> 00:40:14,078
about the cooperation with Cheng & Hui.

916
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:15,558
Pang.

917
00:40:15,558 --> 00:40:16,397
It's almost time.

918
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:17,357
We can start now.

919
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:18,437
Apologies.

920
00:40:18,437 --> 00:40:20,558
I have to give a speech.

921
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:21,437
Please excuse me.

922
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:22,758
Ms. Lan,

923
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:24,758
do you remember me?

924
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,518
I'm Qin Shi from Cheng & Hui.

925
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:27,558
We've met before.

926
00:40:28,238 --> 00:40:29,238
Ms. Qin.

927
00:40:30,278 --> 00:40:31,078
My apologies.

928
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:32,238
You look amazing.

929
00:40:32,238 --> 00:40:33,758
I almost didn't recognize you.

930
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,718
Yihui and Jin told me they were busy,

931
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:36,637
so I didn't send them

932
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:37,718
the invitation.

933
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:38,357
How do you know

934
00:40:38,357 --> 00:40:39,478
about this event?

935
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:40,677
Ms. Lan,

936
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:42,278
they know

937
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:43,437
Mr. Wu from Xi Mei PR.

938
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,998
You know Mr. Wu from Xi Mei PR.

939
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:50,437
Acquaintance.

940
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,157
Ms. Lan,

941
00:40:57,837 --> 00:40:59,078
they are waiting for you.

942
00:40:59,597 --> 00:41:00,437
Excuse me.

943
00:41:00,637 --> 00:41:01,677
I have to attend to

944
00:41:01,677 --> 00:41:02,558
my guests.

945
00:41:03,357 --> 00:41:05,078
I can introduce you
to your fellow colleagues.

946
00:41:07,238 --> 00:41:08,078
Tell them...

947
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:10,278
Where are you going?

948
00:41:10,278 --> 00:41:11,397
I only agree to help you with business.

949
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:12,758
As for your ex-boyfriend,

950
00:41:12,758 --> 00:41:13,677
you can deal with him alone.

951
00:41:13,677 --> 00:41:14,718
Or you can choose to leave with me.

952
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:16,637
No one is leaving.

953
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:17,637
Tao.

954
00:41:18,397 --> 00:41:19,038
Come.

955
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:19,998
Apologies.

956
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:20,837
Please excuse me.

957
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:23,917
Ms. Lan, what is it?

958
00:41:25,078 --> 00:41:26,718
Tao, let me introduce you to someone.

959
00:41:26,837 --> 00:41:27,597
This is...

960
00:41:27,597 --> 00:41:29,078
Qin Shi, Ms. Qin.

961
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,238
Do you know each other?

962
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:35,238
We are alumni.

963
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:37,278
I graduated two years earlier than her.

964
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,157
That's great.

965
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:40,078
Ms. Qin,

966
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:40,677
Tao

967
00:41:40,677 --> 00:41:42,078
is here alone.

968
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:43,437
She is close with Mr. Wu

969
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:44,718
from Xi Mei PR.

970
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:46,038
Both of you are lawyers.

971
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:46,758
Could you please

972
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:48,197
take care of them?

973
00:41:48,197 --> 00:41:49,117
Sure.

974
00:41:49,117 --> 00:41:49,917
Have a nice chat.

975
00:41:51,038 --> 00:41:51,518
See you later.

976
00:41:51,597 --> 00:41:52,157
Sure.

977
00:41:56,038 --> 00:41:56,758
Let's have a drink.

978
00:41:57,637 --> 00:41:58,798
Sorry, I don't drink.

979
00:42:00,278 --> 00:42:01,357
Mr. Yang,

980
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:02,397
your opinion

981
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:03,677
is inconsistent,

982
00:42:04,518 --> 00:42:05,837
but you are very articulate.

983
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:08,038
Are you a lawyer too?

984
00:42:08,397 --> 00:42:09,917
Hubby, I'm hungry.

985
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,078
Let's go eat.

986

989
00:42:20,357 --> 00:42:21,877
good evening.

993
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,318
Before I deliver my speech,

994
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:37,038
may I have your attention and time

995
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:39,397
to watch a short video clip?

996
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:41,318
This video

00:42:41,597 --> 00:42:43,197
documented

It is

1002
00:42:50,038 --> 00:42:51,597
a short video of 20 minutes...

1003
00:42:51,597 --> 00:42:53,877
I don't agree to marry

1004
00:42:53,877 --> 00:42:54,958
a girl from such a family.

1005
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:55,597
Keep it down.

1006
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:58,278
I would have stopped you

1007
00:42:58,278 --> 00:42:59,357
if you told me earlier.

1008
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:00,798
Seven years in a relationship.

1009
00:43:00,798 --> 00:43:02,478
You've wasted seven years.

1010
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:05,038
What do you mean by waste?

1011
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:06,318
I'm marrying Qin Shi,

1012
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,397
not her family.

1013
00:43:07,637 --> 00:43:08,597
I don't agree.

1014
00:43:08,597 --> 00:43:09,597
I don't care if you disagree.

Look!

1019
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,518
She left

1020
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:23,798
