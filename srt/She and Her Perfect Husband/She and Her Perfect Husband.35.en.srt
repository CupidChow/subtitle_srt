(Supplementary Terms
on Partnership's Interests)

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
This is the benefit solely for you.

21
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,080
Our company treats everyone with respect

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,999
and we don't hope our members
devote themselves to the career

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
at the expense of their families.

24
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,080
Therefore, after discussing with Yihui,

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,440
we decided to solely provide

26
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:16,479
some subsidies to you
as the benefits of your partnership.

27
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,520
Have a look at it.

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,080
If you agree to it,

29
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,320
sign it.

30
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,919
Because the conditions I raise

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
are necessary conditions for the partnership

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,119
so if she signs it but fails to fulfill them,

33
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,559
she violates the contract.

34
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,359
Madam Tang, you are her friend.

35
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,160
Shouldn't you be frank with her

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,279
and talk to her in person?

37
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:49,759
If she did

38
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,080
regard me as a friend,

39
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,279
she wouldn't have lied to me.

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,999
An adult is liable for her actions.

41
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,639
Don't you agree?

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,199
Mr. Jin.

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,919
I would like to tell you something.

44
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,639
- Mr. Jin.
- Don't sign it.

45
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,440
Don't sign anything.

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,520
It's a trap.

47
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,479
They are testing you.

48
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,359
A trap?

49
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,119
Listen.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,199
If you sign it,

51
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,160
you'll become a fraudster.

52
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,520
Mr. Jin.

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,839
Miss Qin is a capable attorney.

54
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:50,919
She has done so much

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,040
for your firm

56
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,880
but your firm has harsh

57
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,759
and unfair rules.

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,600
That's why she...

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,559
Yang Hua.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,680
Just listen to me.

61
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,559
They already knew.

62
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,199
I know.

63
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,559
You do?

64
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,080
Mr. Jin, Madam Tang.

65
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,240
As to why

66
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,240
I hid my true marital status from you,

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,680
I will not give any excuses.

68
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:48,599
But

69
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,520
I need to say my piece.

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,759
The law firm

71
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,680
imposes a glass ceiling

72
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,879
for single female attorneys.

73
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,479
I hope

74
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,759
you can give everyone a chance
and only promote those

75
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,199
who are capable.

76
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,319
That's how you can prevent

77
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,280
another situation like mine.

78
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:15,479
I respect you as my seniors

79
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,199
and my superiors.

80
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,080
I hope you

81
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,400
can see the sincerity

82
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,319
in my apology.

83
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,720
Are you criticizing us here?

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,319
Feifei doesn't want to see you

85
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,159
and wants you to go back.

86
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,560
What happened to you two?

87
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,759
Junhui.

88
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,960
What are you doing here sitting there quietly?

89
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,720
That can't solve the problem.

90
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,039
I'm so worried about you two.

91
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:30,359
You're always like this.

92
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,960
One is a crybaby

93
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,359
while another is a robot.

94
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,159
You two are engaged.

95
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,680
What is this episode?

96
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,120
Mrs. Wu, it's all my fault.

97
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,479
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,240
You already said that

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,319
many times.

100
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,919
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

101
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,479
What exactly did you do?

102
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,639
Come with me.

103
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,680
You.

104
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,720
Is there another woman?

105
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,439
What I'm about to tell you

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
will stay between us.

107
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,439
You're a talented man.

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,000
30 years ago,

109
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,240
you could

110
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,039
very well outdo me.

111
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,120
But in this society,

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,759
most wealth is gathered

113
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,599
in the hands of the few.

114
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,240
What you can have

115
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,000
depends on how much the one above

116
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,280
is willing to give you.

117
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,199
Without a network,

118
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,439
how high can you reach

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,599
if you're just relying on yourself?

120
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,879
A law partner of Cheng & Hui?

121
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
Its senior partner?

122
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,159
Without talent and network,

123
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,359
you can't even be a partner.

124
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,039
You can establish your own law firm.

125
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,280
Take up some trivial cases here and there.

126
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,080
You want an important case?

127
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,479
You need to pull the strings.

128
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,840
Do you have it?

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,359
Xi Mei was founded 25 years ago.

130
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
I plan to retire

131
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,560
when it celebrates its

132
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:14,080
30th anniversary.

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,919
Junhui.

134
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,199
A good relationship

135
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:20,240
can make a woman happy forever.

136
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,720
But what makes a man

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
happy forever

138
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,840
is not just a good relationship.

139
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,520
Do you know what else?

140
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,520
A career.

141
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,600
I thought you were smart.

142
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,040
A smart person always weighs the pros and cons

143
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,799
before picking the best option.

144
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,040
Do you get it now?

145
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:47,559
I do, Mr. Wu.

146
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,759
Feifei might not be the best woman

147
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,080
you will encounter in your life.

148
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,480
But she is the one who truly

149
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,080
has your interest at heart.

150
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,400
Don't hurt her.

151
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,360
Don't let her down.

152
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,400
Let me pour you a glass of water.

153
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,600
I want some wine.

154
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,199
Wear your slippers.

155
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:41,160
How do you know it was a trap?

156
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,119
How do you...

157
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Whatever.

158
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,439
It doesn't matter anymore.

159
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,119
Come.

160
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,119
What do you think Mr. Jin

161
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,600
and Madam Tang will do?

162
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:03,920
A firm partnership

163
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,679
is out of the picture.

164
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,559
Maybe I'll be fired too.

165
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,520
Madam Tang

166
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,520
won't want

167
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,679
to let me go like that.

168
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,160
In fact,

169
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,960
she has been very kind to me.

170
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,360
Slowly.

171
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,799
Why should I let this slide?

172
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:40,799
She should go out and see

173
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,999
which law firm will treat

174
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,439
its employees as kindly as I do.

175
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,679
She is like a sister to me.

176
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:49,040
But she

177
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:50,920
lied to me for two whole years.

178
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,840
She's a fox.

179
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,040
She grew arrogant

180
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,639
because I pampered her.

181
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,160
How can she do

182
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,400
such a ridiculous thing?

183
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:01,679
And she even

184
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,840
had the audacity to say we

185
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,999
forced her to do that.

186
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,160
She has no shame at all.

187
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,280
Shameless!

188
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,520
There, there.

189
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,920
I get why she lied.

190
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,759
Our recruitment system

191
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,559
was a bit discriminatory.

192
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,080
Don't lecture me on discrimination.

193
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,280
What does this business require?

194
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,119
Talents.

195
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,999
Do you know how much I have to invest in

196
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,559
to nurture a senior lawyer?

197
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,280
When those women came,

198
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
they came with sweet promises.

199
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,400
Like, no, I'm not going to get married.

200
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,319
No, I'm not going to have a child.

201
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:35,199
But then what happened?

202
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,160
Remember?

203
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,879
20 incumbent attorneys,

204
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,679
6 of which got pregnant within a year.

205
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,799
I couldn't fire them.

206
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,759
I had to pay them. But no one was working.

207
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm a woman too

208
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,639
so I know I should sympathize

209
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,520
with expecting women.

210
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,080
But I'm also the owner.

211
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,559
Who can sympathize with me?

212
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,119
That's why I understand why she did that.

213
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:56,759
Qin Shi

214
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,879
did a spectacular job

215
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,920
in our firm.

216
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,600
To preserve her cover,

217
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,040
she even registered with Yang Hua.

218
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,600
I'm impressed.

219
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,360
She did a spectacular job

220
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,040
because I gave her the stage.

221
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,439
And we already made an exception

222
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,559
by offering her a partnership this early.

223
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,160
Don't meddle in this.

224
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,319
Fortunately, she did the good thing today

225
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,360
by coming clean.

226
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,920
It means she still has a good conscience.

227
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,280
If she did sign the contract,

228
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,439
then she would be caught lying to us red-handed.

229
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,840
We could even send her to jail.

230
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,239
See?

231
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,960
Even you don't want her

232
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,080
to sign it.

233
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,400
That's why I told you to move on.

234
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Don't hold grudges.

235
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,119
If you're mad at her,

236
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,679
just make her resign.

237
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,960
Qin Shi is capable

238
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,439
but she isn't irreplaceable.

239
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,160
She's not worth

240
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:00,920
frowning over.

241
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,199
Resignation? Impossible.

242
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,040
Calm down now.

243
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:20,360
Getting some wrinkles for this

244
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,639
isn't worth it.

245
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Stop drinking.

246
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,480
You drank too much.

247
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,920
When Mr. Jin took out that contract,

248
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,040
I really wanted to come clean.

249
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,920
But there were

250
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,199
two voices in my head.

251
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,119
One of them was you.

252
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,960
You asked me to judge with my heart.

253
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,799
But the other voice was from...

254
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,480
Either way,

255
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:56,080
he told me to judge with my career.

256
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:57,160
He told me to remain silent.

257
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,439
I was in a dilemma

258
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,239
but you won.

259
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:03,720
Do you know why?

260
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,480
Because in that crucial moment,

261
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,759
I thought of someone.

262
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,239
Who?

263
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,520
I thought about my brother.

264
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,879
I came clean to him

265
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,080
and told him I lied to him.

266
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,799
Did he scold you?

267
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:25,400
He said he felt bad for me.

268
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,400
He said

269
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,879
I didn't have to be this competitive,

270
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,679
this hardworking.

271
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,639
But...

272
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:38,119
But I saw what my mom was like.

273
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:40,040
I know I can't be weak.

274
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,720
Because I'll be bullied.

275
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,799
I will become stronger.

276
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:44,119
I will work harder.

277
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,360
I want to be the top 20%.

278
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,720
I don't want to be a nobody.

279
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,920
But at that moment,

280
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,920
I faltered.

281
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,720
I didn't know

282
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,280
what my heart wanted.

283
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,280
Yang Hua.

284
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,119
After I graduated from my school,

285
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:06,400
I worked in a law firm as an intern.

286
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,319
I followed behind

287
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,160
a criminal defense lawyer.

288
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,759
I saw many, many criminals.

289
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,840
Murderers, arsonists,

290
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,720
rapists. I saw them all.

291
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,319
Everyone said

292
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,799
they made a bad decision

293
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,239
in the wrong moment.

294
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,080
But I didn't believe them.

295
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:24,960
I said that was impossible.

296
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,280
They were born evil

297
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,639
and greedy.

298
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,679
But today, I realized

299
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,720
I'm not exactly

300
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,520
beyond them.

301
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,679
Yang Hua.

302
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,759
I am a hypocrite.

303
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,920
Do you look down on me?

304
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,280
Yang Hua, I think I'm screwed.

305
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,480
I thought I could use

306
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,879
empowering women as an excuse.

307
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,239
I feel criminal.

308
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,400
Come.

309
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,600
No, you aren't.

310
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,879
I know you're just consoling me.

311
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,559
No, I'm not.

312
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,679
I just want to let you know

313
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,999
that I've been there.

314
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,840
Really?

315
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,080
You're not the only one here

316
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,360
who has been enticed

317
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,920
and who later found out

318
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,239
how weak and greedy you are.

319
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,040
Really?

320
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,720
You asked me

321
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,239
about Yao Yao.

322
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,040
I didn't tell you

323
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:21,999
that I broke up with her

324
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,239
because Qiu Jianxiang

325
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,879
wanted me to be with his daughter.

326
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,119
(I was young and cocky.)

327
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,400
(I had everything.)

328
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,759
(Everyone wanted me.)

329
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,799
(They told me)

330
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,439
(I would eventually)

331
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,439
(be more successful)

332
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:40,360
(than Qiu Jianxiang.)

333
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,480
Yang Hua.

334
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:57,799
I know

335
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,199
Yao Yao is a good girl.

336
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:01,319
But have you thought this through?

337
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,799
She is an air stewardess.

338
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,000
She will reach her ceiling soon.

339
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
But you're different.

340
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,880
You will be a giant in finance.

341
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,319
You two are not good for each other.

342
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,919
Instead of dealing with this mess

343
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,159
in the future,

344
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,919
why don't you break up with her now?

345
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,439
It will be less ugly.

346
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,399
Mom, I don't have time for this.

347
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,600
Just mind your own business.

348
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,960
(I promised Yao Yao many times)

349
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,319
(that I wouldn't leave her)

350
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,120
(and I wouldn't)

351
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,080
(accept Qiu Jianxiang's offer.)

352
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,640
(But)

353
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,319
(was I)

354
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,559
(enticed?)

355
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,480
(I kept telling myself)

356
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,880
(that I was still young, only 22 years old.)

357
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,960
(Let's see when I became a fund manager.)

358
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,600
(Let's see when I had more money.)

359
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,080
(I was a hypocrite and a coward.)

360
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:50,720
(And then,)

361
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,159
(Yao Yao had had enough)

362
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:52,919
(and left me.)

363
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:53,640
(Back then,)

364
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,600
(I did not know)

365
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,799
(how hollow I was.)

366
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:58,679
And then,

367
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,159
Yongli 21 happened

368
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,000
and I lost what I thought

369
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,199
was mine.

370
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:07,720
That's when I know

371
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,919
prodigies or geniuses

372
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,120
are nothing

373
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,159
in front of greed.

374
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,840
But you're different.

375
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,840
You made the right choice

376
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,399
in the key moments.

377
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,319
You reflected upon yourself.

378
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,760
You felt guilty for your

379
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,080
deviousness and that means you have

380
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,399
a brave and kind soul.

381
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,679
If I need a lawyer,

382
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,919
I'll entrust everything to you.

383
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,279
If Madam Tang and Mr. Jin see this,

384
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,919
they won't let you go.

385
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,360
If they fail to see it,

386
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,600
then forget it.

387
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,640
We'll find another way.

388
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,199
You have the talent.

389
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,199
You will shine wherever you go.

390
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,780
(You can do it!)

391
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,600
(I have switched off the alarm for you.)

392
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,039
(Just sleep in.)

393
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,399
(If your stomach is grumpy,)

394
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:18,919
(there's honey on the bedside table.)

395
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,039
(If you think you caught a cold,)

396
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:22,760
(drink some cough syrup.)

397
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,039
(Make your decision once you feel better.)

398
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,360
(If there's a problem,)

399
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,240
(call me.)

400
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,880
Good luck, Qin Shi.

401
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,399
A real warrior can face a bleak life.

402
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,880
I can't.

403
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,880
Don't they say rest for a bit

404
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,039
when you fall?

405
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,840
I haven't had enough rest yet.

406
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,120
It's okay.

407
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,480
Unlike Yang Hua,

408
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,919
you can't earn money at home.

409
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,000
You have to face it.

410
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:25,600
You can do it.

411
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,790
(Cheng & Hui Law Office)

412
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,199
You have the audacity

413
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,600
to appear before me.

414
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,880
How shameless of you.

415
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,240
Hui...

416
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,039
Madam Tang.

417
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,559
So many things have happened yesterday

418
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
so I didn't have time to say it.

419
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:54,799
I know

420
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,720
I owe you an apology

421
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,720
in person.

422
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,799
An apology?

423
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,760
Why?

424
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,840
Aren't we the ones at fault?

425
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,120
I know

426
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:11,080
I let you down.

427
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,279
I failed you.

428
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,439
You viewed me as your sister.

429
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,240
You look after me. You pampered me.

430
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,199
Without your guidance,

431
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,640
I wouldn't be who I am today.

432
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,960
So

433
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,519
I should apologize to you.

434
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,600
I...

435
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,640
Yes?

436
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm willing to accept whatever decision

437
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,720
you have in mind.

438
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,600
If you don't want to see me,

439
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,240
I will resign right away.

440
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,319
If you make a mistake,

441
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,120
you should be punished for it.

442
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,319
But you think

443
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,720
a resignation can make up

444
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,559
for the damage you caused?

445
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:04,120
I'm willing to accept any forms

446
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,480
of punishment.

447
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,360
You said it.

448
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,039
But considering

449
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,799
my work and what

450
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,279
I have done so far,

451
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,080
can I ask for leniency?

452
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,919
If possible, I...

453
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,399
Qin Shi.

454
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,240
Whether you can be an attorney or not

455
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,080
and where

456
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,360
your office will be or

457
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,519
what cases you will handle...

458
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:27,679
Your entire career is in my hand.

459
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,439
You have no leverage.

460
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,039
I just have a very tiny

461
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,360
suggestion.

462
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,039
Am I smiling?

463
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,360
You will have one last chance.

464
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,439
My treat later.

465
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,000
Brown sugar milk tea with tapioca pearls.

466
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,080
I'll take your word for it.

467
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,039
No taking back.

468
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:56,840
It's my job.

469
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,919
Congratulations.

470
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,559
Thank you.

471
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,640
Mr. Qiao, we have a newcomer?

472
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,120
I guess so.

473
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:07,760
You'll be her colleagues now.

474
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,039
So please look after her.

475
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,080
- Don't worry.
- Sure.

476
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,360
Miss Qin?

477
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,679
Hi, I'm Qin Shi.

478
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,199
I'm the new legal assistant.

479
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,080
I look forward to learning from you.

480
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,480
Now you'll be in charge

481
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,039
of Tianhang acquisition.

482
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,919
Isn't Qin Shi in charge of it?

483
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,880
I gave her another project.

484
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,680
(Li Dai, Enterprise Lawyer)

485
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,279
Serve you right, Qin Shi.

486
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:55,919
Serve you right.

487
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,039
I am so unlucky.

488
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,679
(I am unable to witness
this magnificent scene.)

489
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:04,919
(This will be the biggest regret of my life.)

490
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,120
Qiao can't keep a secret, can he?

491
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,519
Are you done laughing?

492
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,640
I'm going to hang up then.

493
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,399
Let me guess.

494
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:21,600
You must be hiding in the toilet now.

495
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,840
Right?

496
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,799
Impossible.

497
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,760
Qin Shi, I commend your bravery.

498
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,760
If I were you,

499
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:35,840
I wouldn't have the cheekiness

500
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,559
to return to the family department like this.

501
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,840
You sure a cut above me.

502
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,559
Are you still on that sanctimonious duty

503
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,640
to overturn the unspoken rules

504
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,039
in Cheng & Hui?

505
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,720
Yes, why shouldn't I?

506
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,080
Qin Shi.

507
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,640
Do run a genealogy test.

508
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:58,319
I think you might be

509
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,880
a descendant of Don Quixote

510
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,640
(Do you need me to comfort you?)

511
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,679
I could buy you lunch.

512
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,760
We can take a photo

513
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
to commemorate today.

514
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:09,439
It will be

515
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,159
my source of happiness for a long time.

516
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,199
I have to hang up now.

517
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,240
My client is calling.

518
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,960
Client? What client?

519
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:16,600
Hey.

520
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,240
Hi, I'm Qin Shi.

521
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,199
You are a bunch of crooks.

522
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,039
You promised

523
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:24,960
so many things

524
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:25,960
before me

525
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:26,600
but in the end,

526
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
it's all a lie.

527
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:28,720
Miss Qin.

528
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:29,880
I'm telling you now.

529
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,360
If Tianhang will not hand over

530
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,159
my file within three days,

531
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,480
just wait for the court summon.

532
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,799
Hello?

533
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,519
Okay.

534
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,240
I see.

535
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,519
Thank you.

536
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Tianhang is closing the deal

537
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,000
with Nanzhou Group and Anlyu.

538
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,360
We don't need

539
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,360
Yao Yao's cooperation anymore.

540
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,000
They are now drafting

541
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,199
the acquisition contract.

542
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,480
Isn't that great?

543
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,439
Why are they making it difficult for Yao Yao?

544
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,760
Don't they want a happy ending?

545
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,960
You have to ask Mr. Yin about that.

546
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Don't stop me.

547
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,840
You can't come in, Miss Yao.

548
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,640
What are you doing, Yin Zhiqiang?

549
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,799
How dare you switched my post?

550
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,439
Two days ago,

551
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,760
you asked me to cooperate with the company.

552
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,880
I did.

553
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:18,919
And what are you doing now?

554
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:20,439
Yao Yao.

555
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,720
You are beautiful

556
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,600
so don't get angry.

557
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,120
Don't forget

558
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,039
that as a member of our staff,

559
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,799
you should follow our rules.

560
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,559
Why should I lead the training program?

561
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,000
Indeed.

562
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,399
We spent a fortune to let you study

563
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,360
overseas.

564
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,319
And now, we

565
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,799
need more capable individuals

566
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,039
like you.

567
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,360
Therefore, we will establish

568
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,279
a training program

569
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,279
and you will be its leader.

570
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,360
As the program leader,

571
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,240
you'll have more time

572
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,960
for your family.

573
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:52,960
Isn't that a win-win solution?

574
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:54,679
What?

575
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:55,760
What on earth

576
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,559
is wrong with Mr. Yin?

577
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,159
He begged her to help

578
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,840
and now, he kicked away the ladder.

579
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,360
From the Head of Client Service

580
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,760
to a Training Program Leader,

581
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,159
isn't that a demotion?

582
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,679
If I were Yao Yao, I would quit.

583
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,840
Mr. Yin and Yao Yao

584
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,039
are not on good terms.

585
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,720
If it weren't for the acquisition,

586
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,080
he wouldn't turn to Yao Yao at all.

587
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,840
No wonder.

588
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,279
Only selfish people

589
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,399
will lose

590
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,199
a lawsuit intentionally.

591
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,799
Having a boss like him

592
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,600
is a nightmare.

593
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:26,360
Our reputation

594
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,480
is at stake now. What should we do?

595
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,240
We're just handling the acquisition.

596
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,799
The rest has nothing to do with us.

597
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,600
Knowing

598
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,319
Yao Yao,

599
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:37,600
she will file a lawsuit.

600
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And then, Cheng & Hui

601
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,039
will most probably have to handle it.

602
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,080
We have to be the bad guys again.

603
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,360
Yao Yao this, Yao Yao that.

604
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,039
What about your current situation?

605
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,399
I'm fine.

606
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,559
Why didn't you listen to me?

607
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,360
Just deny it.

608
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,720
He didn't have the evidence.

609
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:55,880
Do you know

610
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:56,679
you missed the chance

611
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,840
to be a firm partner?

612
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,439
Why do you want me

613
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,760
to obey you all the time?

614
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,600
It's not

615
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,199
as serious as you made it out to be.

616
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:08,919
Madam Tang needs to vent.

617
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,960
And I'm cheeky enough

618
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:11,519
to be placed

619
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,960
on an exhibition.

620
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,120
But didn't you want

621
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,000
to be a partner?

622
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,039
Do you know why

623
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,360
you're not one?

624
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,000
You're too emotional

625
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:21,640
and naive.

626
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,399
Gullible.

627
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,880
Not all good people get a good ending.

628
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,240
You're too kind.

629
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,960
Feifei, where are you going?

630
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,199
To work.

631
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,439
The meal is ready.

632
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,480
Leave once you have eaten.

633
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,360
What work?

634
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,679
Feifei?

635
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,319
Goodness.

636
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,360
Why are you so quiet?

637
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,120
Are you regretting it now?

638
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,199
No.

639
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,319
Yes.

640
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,519
No.

641
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,399
Yes.

642
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,199
Why is it hard to do

643
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,519
the right thing?

644
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:36,640
But that's

645
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,519
precisely why

646
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,640
those who attempt it are strong.

647
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,080
No.

648
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,080
What no?

649
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:49,919
You can't just comfort me

650
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,279
that easily.

651
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,519
No.

652
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:53,760
You have to continue to comfort me.

653
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:56,960
If I tell you

654
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,039
Tianhang's acquisition

655
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:58,960
will fail,

656
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,279
will you be happy?

657
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,399
Go ahead.

658
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Do you know why Tianhang,

659
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,640
a company with unimpressive revenue,

660
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,720
high asset depreciation rate,

661
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,439
and bad management,

662
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,760
is highly sought after

663
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,559
by its peers?

664
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,840
Are you referring to

665
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,120
the Smart City?

666
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:21,439
I heard

667
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Hu Ping is taking part in it.

668
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,319
He is considering

669
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,120
but

670
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,279
I don't think

671
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,199
it will take a long time.

672
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,039
The project is not feasible.

673
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:30,480
Why?

674
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,840
In this project,

675
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:32,720
Hu Ping covets

676
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:34,240
the new power station.

677
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,600
It has an excellent production model

678
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,240
and it embodies the future trend

679
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,439
of the energy market.

680
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,039
The projected yield

681
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,880
is very promising too.

682
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,679
However, when established in a new city,

683
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,159
from the construction, to operation,

684
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,600
and to self-sufficiency,

685
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,720
it will take a very long time.

686
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,240
The global economy is taking a downturn.

687
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,720
The factory's productivity is declining.

688
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,199
And the vacancy of the office building

689
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,319
is at an all-time high.

690
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,840
All these are not good

691
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,199
for a power station.

692
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,360
Regardless of how many occupants there are,

693
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,919
it has to keep churning out energy.

694
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,480
And this alone implies

695
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,360
that its cost is astronomical.

696
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,000
In that case,

697
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,279
Hu Ping should have turned this project down.

698
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,720
What is stopping him

699
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,240
then?

700
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:20,744
The cost of energy.

701
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:22,624
The cost of energy?

702
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:24,425
From a macro perspective,

703
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:25,864
this is a good project.

704
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:27,065
The challenge

705
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:28,905
lies in covering the potential losses

706
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:30,744
stemmed from its costly early stage.

707
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,624
For this project,

708
00:32:32,945 --> 00:32:34,185
many assume

709
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,780
that the cost of energy will rise.

710
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,100
As a result,

711
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,980
the loss that comes with it will rise too.

712
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,740
Therefore, the fluctuation of energy price

713
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,540
in the next few days

714
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,660
will affect Hu Ping's decision.

715
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,780
So you are pessimistic about it.

716
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,140
Knowing him,

717
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,340
he won't take the risk.

718
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,500
Hi, Mr. Zeng.

719
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,180
Yes.

720
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,380
I have made up my mind.

721
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,900
I might have to let you down.

722
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,740
Sorry.

723
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,420
Tell Yang Hua

724
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,540
to come here

725
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,820
for dinner.

726
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,420
Yes, sir.

727
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,820
Miss Qin.

728
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,460
(Starting over)

729
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,740
(isn't scary.)

730
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,340
(Muster your courage)

731
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,420
(and take their paths)

732
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,580
(so they have nowhere to go.)

733
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,460
Hi Miss Kong.

734
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,580
We have received

735
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,580
the notice of hearing.

736
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,300
Next Wednesday.

737
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,340
Let me know when

738
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,420
you can come here.

739
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:32,980
We can discuss

740
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,060
our strategy.

741
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,580
Do you need help?

742
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,460
No,

743
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,180
Miss Qin.

744
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,700
It's a small matter. I can handle it.

745
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,460
I can handle all cases.

746
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,820
Feel free to ask me.

747
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,420
Wrong.

748
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,380
A complaint should be simple.

749
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,340
No need to be verbose.

750
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,060
Thanks, Miss Qin.

751
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,900
Thanks for your hard work, everyone.

752
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,900
Get some milk tea. It's my treat.

753
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,300
Thanks, Miss Qin.

754
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,220
It's my favorite

755
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,340
brown sugar milk tea with tapioca pearls.

756
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,020
Back to work.

757
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,780
Want some milk tea?

758
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,940
You want to buy a house?

759
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,580
You want to buy a house for real?

760
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,740
Don't forget your promise.

761
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,780
You'll help me apply

762
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,980
for the internal bank loan interest discount.

763
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,500
Let me hug you.

764
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,180
Welcome to the world of real estate slavery;
(Account Department Office)

765
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,100
Do you remember

766
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,380
what you said to me?

767
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,740
You said I had lost my mind

768
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,940
because I was willing to trade my future

769
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,380
and my happiness for a cold, concrete box.

770
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,940
And now, I shall return them to you.

771
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,460
As the famous adage goes,

772
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,020
karma always catches up to you.

773
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,060
Wait.

774
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,180
You said you wanted

775
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,340
to use your pension

776
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,260
to buy a house.

777
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,260
What changed your mind?

778
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,460
I want to propose to Qin Shi with it.

779
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,500
Pro...

780
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,340
Don't tell anyone.

781
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,140
But aren't you married?

782
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,900
Wow.

783
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,260
Have a seat.

784
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,260
Miss Wu,

785
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,740
do you need me?

786
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,780
I'm quite busy.

787
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,820
You are quite resilient.

788
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,900
You lost everything

789
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,540
and you still have the guts to stay here.

790
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,300
Just how obsessed are you with Cheng & Hui?

791
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,180
I always think

792
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,500
people like you are proud.

793
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,500
Where are your dignity and pride?

794
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,220
Gone?

795
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,940
You would do everything

796
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,780
to achieve your goal.

797
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,380
Are you done? Continue.

798
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,980
I'm all ears.

799
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,060
Qin Shi...

800
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,980
Do you know?

801
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,780
As an attorney, insulting others without profanity

802
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,820
is our bread and butter.

803
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,420
I could reproach someone

804
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,700
for 30 minutes straight without repeating

805
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,700
the same vocabulary.

806
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,700
Do you want me to teach you?

807
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,580
Just how shameless are you?

808
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,740
Besides, did you just give me

809
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,740
a compliment?

810
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,780
Go out and ask

811
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,260
those people out there

812
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,660
who

813
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,580
didn't play by the office politics?

814
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,340
Before they

815
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,740
got their position here,

816
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,900
they have been tested countless times.

817
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,300
Oh.

818
00:37:59,300 --> 00:37:59,900
Back then,

819
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,180
in the very same office,

820
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,220
I asked you

821
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,180
if you had what it took

822
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,340
to survive in this environment.

823
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,740
If you do not,

824
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,220
you should go back and rest.

825
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,060
Just so you know,

826
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,700
I'm different from the likes of you.

827
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,220
Indeed.

828
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,260
You are a senior lawyer,

829
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,900
in a spacious office.

830
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,300
But how did you become

831
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,420
a senior lawyer again?

832
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,540
Whether you deserve this position

833
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,020
or how long

834
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,420
you can stay there,

835
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,900
you know the answer

836
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,180
better than I do.

837
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,100
Also,

838
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,940
do you know?

839
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,340
Although you

840
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,340
are a senior attorney now,

841
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,020
but none of them...

842
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,020
Sorry.

843
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,500
Other than the one you bribed,

844
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,580
none of them

845
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,220
has any respect toward you.

846
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,100
Do you know why?

847
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,540
Because they know

848
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,180
they can't learn anything from you.

849
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,220
You didn't get

850
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,300
into this office on your own.

851
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,860
You relied on your dad.

852
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,020
Compared to them

853
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,740
who fought their way here,

854
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,060
your action

855
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,940
is the greatest

856
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,660
insult and disrespect.

857
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,020
Don't you lecture me

858
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
while standing on a moral high ground.

859
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,060
There's no way your hands are clean

860
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,540
or you didn't pull any tricks.

861
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,300
I did.

862
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,380
I admit

863
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,820
that to circumvent the unspoken rules here,

864
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,500
I lied.

865
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,300
I'm not proud of that

866
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,580
nor will I find an excuse.

867
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,620
And so

868
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,180
those people out there

869
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,140
can criticize me

870
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,100
and look down on me.

871
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,580
I deserve that.

872
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,420
Because I did snatch what

873
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,620
could have been others'.

874
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,700
But you

875
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,700
can't do the same.

876
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,820
I... What about me?

877
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,340
You hoard company resources. You took shortcuts.

878
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,500
But worse, you didn't even outsmart me.

879
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,580
All you ever did was saying "Daddy, please".

880
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,860
But our law firm was generous enough

881
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,740
to turn a blind eye to it.

882
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,980
But after you pulled the daddy card,

883
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,580
where's your brain and competence?

884
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,940
Other than some dirty tricks
and stirring up catfights,

885
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,180
what can you do?

886
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,500
Using the daddy card is fun

887
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,300
but will it work all the time?

888
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,300
My dear friend.

889
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,020
Nepotism makes you look cheap.

890
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,540
By the way, this is a law firm.

891
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,540
A society.

892
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,460
Not your home.

893
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,620
If you think

894
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,900
you are above everyone,

895
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,700
then prove it to everyone.

896
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,500
Otherwise,

897
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,780
anyone beyond this office

898
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,980
can get rid of you

899
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,380
at any given moment.

900
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,380
And then,

901
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,900
you might need to start calling them daddies too.

902
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,900
Qin Shi, leave now!

903
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,340
Sure.

904
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,580
Do you want some coffee?

905
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,020
With cream and sugar?

906
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,540
Miss Qin.

907
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,300
Back to work.

908
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,220
Well done, Miss Qin.

909
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,660
(Resignation Notice)

910
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,260
Is this your final decision?

911
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,700
My father

912
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,140
wants me to go back to help him.

913
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,060
I guess I can only

914
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,460
turn you down.

915
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,700
What about Mr. Tao?

916
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,060
Will he leave with you?

917
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,260
Why will he?

918
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,780
I think he fits in here

919
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,660
better than I do.

920
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,980
Isn't that right?

921
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,660
If this is your final decision,

922
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,980
I will not make you stay.

923
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,340
Cheng & Hui and Xi Mei

924
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,020
can always collaborate,

925
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,700
can't we?

926
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:06,940
Of course.

927
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,140
All the best.

928
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:13,980
Thank you, Madam Tang.

929
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,220
You came at a great time.

930
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,660
I haven't cooked

931
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,500
for many years.

932
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,140
Try it and tell me

933
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,260
if it's good.

934
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,940
If it's not good...

935
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,420
Oh, well. I tried.

936
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,260
You look cheery, Mr. Hu.

937
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,420
I thought

938
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,300
losing the Triple Supply project

939
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,700
will put a damper on your mood.

940
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,740
It can't possibly sour my mood.

941
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,060
You can't earn all the money

942
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,540
in the world.

943
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,860
And at my age,

944
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,340
you know

945
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,940
money isn't the most important thing.

946
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,140
So your firm wants Hu Ping

947
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,300
to invest in it?

948
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,340
Take that question mark away.

949
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,740
It is a fact now.

950
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,460
(Zhou,)

951
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,220

952
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,860
(work in Hu Ping's investment company?)

953
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,180
