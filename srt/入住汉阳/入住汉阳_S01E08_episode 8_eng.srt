1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
   

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,360
   

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,750
 Buy yeot! Yeot is here! 
   

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,830
 - Since when did you like snacks? 
 - Yes, hello. 

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,390
 My wife has craved sweets often since she got pregnant. 

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,820
 Is your wife not like that? 

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,610
 Get her proper ones, not this cheap stuff. 

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:22,340
 Sir, I have not sold any since yesterday. 

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,790
 Is that so? I will buy all this pumpkin yeot, then. 

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,920
 Pardon? All of this? 

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,930
 Aigoo, sir! 

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,130
 Sir, I have a very small talent. 

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,420
 I tell fortunes with yeot. 

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,740
 Would you like to check yours? 

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,670
 Yeot fortune? That sounds fun. 

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,500
 - Here. Check for me. 
 - Yes. 

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,000
 Aigoo, you are about to have a very smart young lady. 

18
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,150
 For her name... 

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,840
   

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,730
   

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,770
 If you use Jae as in fortune and Hwa as in wealth, 

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,160
 she will have all the fortune in the world. 

23
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,540
 Jae Hwa? Jae Hwa. 

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,340
 It is too good of a name. 

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,470
 Anyway, thank you. 

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,900
 I am satisfied as long as I have a healthy baby. 

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,010
 Let me have that name, then. 

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,900
 Gosh, sir! 

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,700
 He already paid for this name. 

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,120
 Giving it away will not have any effect. 

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,580
 Perhaps you could split it. 

32
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,840
 I will give it to him, then. 

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,380
 Why would I not split a name with my friend? 

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,050
 You take Hwa, then. 

35
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,900
   

36
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:19,040


37
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,480
I will let you make money.

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,230
Money?

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,090
Is that all?

40
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,650
No one has more money than me in all the provinces of Joseon.

41
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,590
That is why I am telling you.

42
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,170
A large amount of money always reveals hidden greed.

43
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,540
See what kind of flies swarm using this opportunity.

44
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,400
What do you know that you are blabbering your mouth?

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,670
Please listen to my plan first and judge.

46
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,570
 Put the expulsion on hold. 

47
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,350
 Master Cheon, to the other innkeepers... 

48
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,560
 This will set an example. 

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,470
 It will prove whether Yongcheonru cares about people or not. 

50
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,280
 Prove yourself as you said you would. 

51
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,860
 Yes, I will. 

52
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,660
 Once you achieve what you promised, 

53
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,470
 I will reinstate you then. 

54
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,510
 That should be fine, right? 

55
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,310
 You should not have returned to Yongcheonru. 

56
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,970
 Why should I not? 

57
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,540
 I worked so hard to come this far. 

58
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,450
 You must have a lot to say to me. 

59
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,150
 No matter what anyone says, 

60
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,130
 I came this far on my own. 

61
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,480
 There is nothing I cannot do. 

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,590
 I came back alive from jail, too. 

63
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,510
 Hong Deok Su, you— 

64
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,100
 The person who reported me to the Investigation Bureau and framed me. 

65
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,520
 I know who it was. 

66
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,990
 I will never... 

67
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,970
 run away like a coward. 

68
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,820
What are you doing there, Lee Eun Ho?

69
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,160
You bastard!

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,280
You should have come back immediately if you got released.

71
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,180
What took you so long to come back?

72
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,980
Were you worried about me?

73
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,030
This Hong Deok Su, the true man?

74
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,580
That is not our room.

75
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,220
- What? 
 - Follow me.

76
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,960
Did you switch rooms?

77
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,800
Hurry up!

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,310
- Hurry up. 
 - Well...

79
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,190
Where are we?

80
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,790
- Here he is! Get him! Get him. 
 - What...

81
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
- What are you doing? 
 - Say, ah!

82
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,070
What is this, Go Su Ra?

83
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,530
You have to eat this after spending time in jail.

84
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,100
- It is tasty, right? 
 - Yes.

85
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,480
By the way, how did you know I was coming?

86
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,920
I am Cheon Jun Hwa.

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,860
I know everything about you.

88
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,980
Jun Hwa prepared all this for you, Deok Su.

89
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,770
You need to recover since you have been in jail.

90
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,300
What do you need for that? There is nothing better than pork.

91
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,610
Yes.

92
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,060
What do you think? It tastes premium, right?

93
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,370
Yes.

94
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,350
It is tasty, Cheon Jun Hwa. Thank you.

95
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,360
I suddenly feel rejuvenated.

96
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,200
Here.

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,960
I brought you the white rice cake.

98
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,600
However, I have been staying and working on your behalf.

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,000
Would you have been safe without me, Go Su Ra?

100
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,070
Yes, Go Su Ra. You are the best.

101
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,490
I do have a good friend. Say, ah!

102
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,540
The Bottom-Tier Room is the best. The best.

103
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,290
Here. Cheon Jun Hwa.

104
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,490
Eat.

105
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,950
Yes, it is tasty.

106
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,310
It is tasty.

107
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,440
It really is good.

108
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,260
Go on and try some.

109
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,940
Why are you still at Yongcheonru?

110
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,650
I still...

111
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,310
need more time.

112
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,360
Master Cheon will soon realize the golden key is missing.

113
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,200
You need to move before that.

114
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,610
Hong Deok Su just managed to return.

115
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,400
Pardon?

116
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,410
I need to check if the two pieces fit together first.

117
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,000
You even visited the Minister of Defense because of that half

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,900
and asked him to release Hong Deok Su. What have you been doing—

119
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,100
A person comes first, still. Does he not?

120
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,140
He returned after experiencing hardship.

121
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,200
I cannot demand the golden key immediately.

122
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,250
- Forgive me for saying this, but— 
 - I know, too.

123
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,640
I know why I entered this place, hiding my identity.

124
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,380
Do not worry, Beom Ho.

125
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,820
Everything will be over soon.

126
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,490
You like Hong Deok Su, do you not?

127
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,030
What?

128
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,180
No.

129
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,980
- You do not? 
 - Do not get the wrong idea.

130
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,100
How could I like Hong Deok Su?

131
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,850
- He is— 
 - You know he is a woman, too.

132
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,990
I thought you found out before I did.

133
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,050
When did you find out?

134
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,460
I learned when he fell in the stream while laundering bedsheets.

135
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,470
You knew that long ago?

136
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,220
I tried to change him out of the wet clothes, and...

137
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,070
 No! You cannot. 

138
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,360
I see. That is why you did not let me in.

139
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,150
How about you? When did you learn he was a woman?

140
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,690
When Myeong Ho accused her.

141
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,930
I found out while helping her.

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,100
If people found out like this one by one, everyone would end up finding out soon.

143
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,170
I know. Lee Eun Ho shares a room with Hong Deok Su, too.

144
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,240
Should we tell him beforehand?

145
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,300
No. We should keep it a secret until she tells him.

146
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,870
Is that so?

147
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,320
 It is over once I put them together. 

148
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,130
Hong Deok Su, you have not changed into the uniform yet?

149
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,710
Get changed quickly. We need to go to work.

150
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,830
Well, the thing is...

151
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,270
there is a bit of a situation.

152
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,690
You were freed from the Investigation Bureau.

153
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,090
What situation do you have?

154
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,320
I thought you were reinstated as an innkeeper yesterday.

155
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,180
Well, I have not been approved yet.

156
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,690
Approved?

157
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,230
Who needs to approve it?

158
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,390
- The thing is— 
 - Stop frustrating me.

159
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,410
Tell me right now!

160
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,770
   

161
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,240
   

162
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,580
A gambling house?

163
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,420
Hong Deok Su,

164
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,400
was that really the only option?

165
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,070
 So, what are you proposing? 

166
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,110
 All of Joseon's businesses are in Yongcheonru, 

167
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,940
 but there is one thing that is missing. 

168
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,600
 What Yongcheonru does not have? 

169
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,440
 That is... 

170
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,440
 a gambling house. 

171
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,250
 You want to open a gambling business, which is illegal? 

172
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,490
 Are you being brave or reckless? 

173
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,050
 The riskier it is, the more profitable it is. 

174
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,110
 Is it not? 

175
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,300
This will determine my reinstatement.

176
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,560
Master Cheon promised to reinstate me if this became a success.

177
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,700
Master Cheon proposed that?

178
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,640
Well. Listen carefully.

179
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,610
This will be the best entertainment venue

180
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,910
and Yongcheonru's highlight.

181
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,320
I will create a place where anyone can enjoy themselves.

182
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,080
So, you want to start a gambling house?

183
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,470
It is against the law. I cannot allow it.

184
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,390
I am against an illegal business, too.

185
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,640
It is not like an illegal gambling venue that gets set up secretly in taverns.

186
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,900
We will follow the proper procedure, only invite special guests, and let them in.

187
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,920
What is Master Cheon thinking, anyway?

188
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,630
You have to be reinstated since you returned from the Investigation Bureau.

189
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,240
Hong Deok Su, you are determined to find success in Yongcheonru.

190
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,200
I understand that, too.

191
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,200
- But this is not right. 
 - To me...

192
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,060
To me, this is my last chance.

193
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,890
I must make this gambling house a success.

194
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,800
Hey, Go Su Ra, we are from the Bottom-Tier Room.

195
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,380
We have been through hardships together.

196
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,430
Right?

197
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,750
I will not ask you to help me.

198
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,250
This is something I need to be responsible for.

199
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,930
It is my task to solve.

200
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,770
Go Su Ra, that fellow...

201
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,230
he talks that way, but he will come around quickly.

202
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,370
If you get arrested by the Investigation Bureau for this,

203
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,470
you will not be freed easily again.

204
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,670
Hong Deok Su, find another solution.

205
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,190
The reinstatement is on hold? That is not what you promised.

206
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,040
Father.

207
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,840
You called me "Master Cheon" and even knelt right there.

208
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,480
But you are throwing a tantrum in just a few days?

209
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,340
You will reinstate him anyway.

210
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,060
That is why you went to see the Minister of Defense, too.

211
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,880
It was not me who got him out of there.

212
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,460
Pardon?

213
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,740
What do you mean by that?

214
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,180
How did he get free if it was not you?

215
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,380
The Bottom-Tier Room kids whom you call friends.

216
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,850
How much do you know about them?

217
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,590
I know my friends well.

218
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:44,470
Then, did you know one of them is the King's son, Prince Mu Yeong?

219
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,940
Did you know it was Prince Mu Yeong who got him released?

220
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,890
Cheon Jun Hwa,

221
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,970
did you say you know your friends well?

222
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,620
No, you know nothing.

223
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,640
 Hong Deok Su is not the culprit. 

224
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,030
 I need to go somewhere. Go back without me. 

225
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,740
 Lee Eun Ho! 

226
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,110
 If you get arrested by the Investigation Bureau for this, 

227
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,090
 you will not be freed easily again. 

228
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,900
Lee Eun Ho is...

229
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,210
Prince Mu Yeong?

230
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,960
If you do not even know the people you call friends,

231
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,650
you will be outpaced like that.

232
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,090
Will you let that happen?

233
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,520
You need to make your move first to get what you want.

234
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,450
Think about...

235
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,960
what you should do.

236
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,430
Please let me take charge of what Hong Deok Su is doing, Father.

237
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,940
Let me ask you directly.

238
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:51,390
Cheon gave me a piece of paper that said, "Cheon."

239
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,760
What is that?

240
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,470
That is worth a fortune, is it not?

241
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,790
Did Master Cheon gift that to you?

242
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,880
Gosh...

243
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,130
I was tricked by that sly Cheon.

244
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,960
He brought that and asked me to free Hong Deok Su, the red card thief, or whatever.

245
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,090
Is that why you freed Hong Deok Su?

246
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,510
No, no. I did not.

247
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:26,480
I was going to hand him over to you as promised,

248
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,680
but I did not know Prince Mu Yeong would ask me to free him.

249
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,610
I apologize for that.

250
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,500
He was freed without issues. Is that not good?

251
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,030
By the way, that Hong Deok Su.

252
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,390
Something is unusual about him.

253
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,690
He is nothing but a red card thief.

254
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,730
It did not seem that way.

255
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,380
There is nothing you do not know. How could you not notice...

256
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,550
how suspicious he is?

257
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,550
If I had known, I would not dare to keep it a secret.

258
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,120
You mean it is not time to tell me yet?

259
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,930
Fine.

260
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,250
I will trust you and wait.

261
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,460
Should I start cleaning first?

262
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,090
  ­ 

263
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,070
Thank you.

264
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,290
What is your name?

265
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,100
What are you doing? Help him with his luggage.

266
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,590
Three days and four nights.

267
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,260
 - Bring the Cheonguigak card.  
 - He is way too slow. So useless.

268
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,090
The Bottom-Tier Room kids have always been together,

269
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,060
but he is alone now. It makes me so happy.

270
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,980
By the way, Hyeongnim,

271
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,500
I hear Hong Deok Su is back.

272
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,610
He was expelled without being appointed.

273
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,270
What do you mean he is back?

274
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,690
He apparently slept in the innkeepers' dormitory last night, too.

275
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,930
Where is Cheon Jun Hwa?

276
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,930
I do not know.

277
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,980
How is working at Cheonguigak?

278
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,710
I am not sure.

279
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,990
It is all probably similar.

280
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,990
Lee Eun Ho,

281
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,040
should we not stop Hong Deok Su?

282
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,690
It is a dangerous thing to do.

283
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,470
Ten tables, 90 chairs, 10 pil of silk,

284
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,390
and pine wood to make a sign.

285
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,480
The generic kind is fine, too.

286
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,280
All right. I can get them for you.

287
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,600
- Thank you, Head Manager. 
 - Well, then.

288
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,040
- You need to pay me. 
 - Pardon?

289
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,520
However, this is for Yongcheonru.

290
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,160
I cannot help you without a payment.

291
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,160
Head Manager! Head Manager!

292
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,420
Do not follow me.

293
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,910
I-I need to tell you something.

294
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,370
No.

295
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,060
All innkeepers have set schedules.

296
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,390
How about on days off?

297
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,830
Master Innkeeper is against it, too. I cannot help you.

298
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,590
Forget it.

299
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,710
However,

300
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,700
this is for Yongcheonru, too.

301
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,150
Master Innkeeper is my direct senior.

302
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,170
What am I supposed to...

303
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,930
Gosh, whatever...

304
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,600
Just leave. Oh my...

305
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,220
For that reason, I would like you to create a dessert as addictive as Geumbing.

306
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,030
It is your chance to let your talent be known.

307
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,060
My talent is already well known.

308
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,440
Please help me just once.

309
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,680
For free?

310
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,660
Move!

311
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,500
I will peel onions if I have to.

312
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,540
- Or I will grind the millstone— 
 - Hey!

313
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,560
I am a bit expensive.

314
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,390
Do you know how much Yongcheonru pays me monthly?

315
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,610
I will let you have a share if it succeeds.

316
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,120
- If it succeeds? 
 - Yes.

317
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,540
- If it succeeds? 
 - Yes.

318
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,010
If it succeeds, come then.

319
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,500
Pardon?

320
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,900
Head Chef.

321
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,240
- Please— 
 - I said, come when you succeed.

322
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,400
Head Chef!

323
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,950
What are you doing here, Cheon Jun Hwa?

324
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,470
I said I do not need your help.

325
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,540
Come on. I came during my lunch break.

326
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,020
I have been thinking a lot, and...

327
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,360
I think this will be a success. Let us work together.

328
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,290
Do not bother.

329
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,120
- It is my duty. 
 - Hey!

330
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,390
I did not think you were, but you are selfish.

331
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,140
Let me join you.

332
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,630
- So... 
 - What?

333
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,700
You do not ever listen to me, Cheon Jun Hwa.

334
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,490
You cannot.

335
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,550
Go!

336
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,860
Would you ignore me if I were in your situation?

337
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,320
Would you not help me?

338
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,540
We are friends, Hong Deok Su.

339
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,270
What?

340
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,040
Of course, you owe me my portion of the profits.

341
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,500
50%.

342
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,430
All right. Follow me.

343
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,170
Let us go!

344
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,860
All right.

345
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,620
- Be careful. 
 - Put it here.

346
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,260
Here?

347
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,500
 No, no. 

348
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,090
Hey, hey! Stay seated.

349
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,500
Come on.

350
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,000
Wait for me.

351
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,000
 How dare you come in here? 

352
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,350
What is this about, Instructor Bang?

353
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,870
Hong Deok Su was not expelled.

354
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,270
I heard the expulsion was put on hold.

355
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,770
But you are not an official innkeeper.

356
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,690
You cannot enter the innkeepers' dormitory.

357
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,350
I will be reinstated soon.

358
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,290
Who says you can be reinstated?

359
00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:00,040
You ruined the appointment ceremony and got arrested.

360
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,800
How dare you show your face here?

361
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,870
Kick him out immediately, Instructor Bang.

362
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,560
Be quiet, you bastards!

363
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,850
I got your belongings packed. Take it with you now.

364
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,920
However, Instructor...

365
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,200
How could you kick out someone like this overnight?

366
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,310
Instructor Bang, please give him some time.

367
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,890
The rules are still rules.

368
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,380
You can enter the dormitory after you get reinstated.

369
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,350
And take your apprentice's uniform off, too.

370
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,090
Are you not going too far?

371
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,310
That is enough, Cheon Jun Hwa.

372
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,750
Safe travels.

373
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,500
It is all right.

374
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,130
It is all right.

375
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,030
It was so tiring to go back and forth.

376
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,420
I might as well stay there from now on.

377
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,970
It is all right. See you.

378
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,330
Hong Deok Su.

379
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,200
You came back.

380
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,990
Why do you keep coming here?

381
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,300
This is worth ten silver nuggets.

382
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,430
Those things are...

383
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,060
This is worth five gold nuggets.

384
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,450
Excuse me, this is a pawn shop.

385
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,700
We cannot make a living if we pay you full price.

386
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,300
So?

387
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,500
All of these were only worth one silver nugget?

388
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,130
Aigoo!

389
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,610
I will pay you twice as usual today. Yes.

390
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,820
Last time, Yongcheonru banned transactions,

391
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,610
but you dared to scam me using my belongings.

392
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,980
You said only you would

393
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,880
pay me the original price.

394
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,700
Aigoo, it was because you begged me so much.

395
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,130
Have a look.

396
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,340
Come on. This will not change anything.

397
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,580
Cheon? The Cheon family is...

398
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,460
You have a business in this market, but you do not know the Cheon family?

399
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,600
You really have no fear.

400
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:59,840
What are you, the son of Master Cheon of Yongcheonru?

401
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,190
Are you really?

402
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,990
Yes.

403
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,810
Can you do the math properly this time?

404
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,110
Please take this first.

405
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,270
Yes, please. Of course.

406
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:22,700
I am so grateful you gave me this opportunity.

407
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,620
I knew you were different the moment I first saw you.

408
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:32,870
I am someone who does the math

409
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,910
very accurately.

410
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,970
It is ash wood.

411
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,230
It makes a very solid club.

412
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,040
Are you awake?

413
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,400
If you carve this, you can use it as playing cards.

414
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,110
It can be flexible, too.

415
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,340
I used it to save money, but it is not too bad.

416
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,120
You are insisting on opening a gambling house.

417
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,470
I have to.

418
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,070
I came this far for a reason.

419
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,680
I cannot stop now.

420
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,170
Did your late father tell you to be successful...

421
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,790
at Yongcheonru in his last words?

422
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,780
Is that why you came this far with his keepsake?

423
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,620
Why do you want to know about that?

424
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,550
It is not something you should be interested in.

425
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,020
 Master Cheon will soon realize the golden key is missing. 

426
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,790
 Do not worry, Beom Ho. 

427
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,250
 Everything will be over soon. 

428
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,700
I will help you.

429
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,650
What?

430
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:40,700
Instead, you need to do something for me after this.

431
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,150
- Lee Eun Ho... 
 - Will you accept...

432
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,910
my condition?

433
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,900
Stop acting suspiciously and leave.

434
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,570
I told you.

435
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,110
This is something I need to deal with.

436
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,240
 Then, did you know one of them is the King's son, Prince Mu Yeong? 

437
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,400
 If you do not even know the people you call friends, 

438
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,040
 you will be outpaced like that. 

439
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,480
 Will you let that happen? 

440
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,220
Considering you were against the gambling house, you are very interested in it.

441
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,300
I could change my mind if it benefits me, too.

442
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,660
Let us talk. Sit here.

443
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:12,200
I have been running around all day to get money.

444
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,350
I am so tired.

445
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,100
Are you lacking a lot of money?

446
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I took care of it myself.

447
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,420
Right, Lee Eun Ho, where are you from?

448
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,320
Thinking about it, we know so little about each other.

449
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,310
Ask me what you are curious about.

450
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,330
When we went to the Investigation Bureau together last time,

451
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,720
you did not come back to the dormitory all night.

452
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,670
Where were you then?

453
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,820
Did I do that?

454
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,170
I do not remember it.

455
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,170
I spent all of my money to save Hong Deok Su that day, but I failed.

456
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,420
Someone had freed him from jail already, apparently.

457
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,960
Whoever it was, it was a relief that he got free.

458
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,650
It is a relief,

459
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,260
but I did not feel so great.

460
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,830
That made me want to achieve something.

461
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,500
What is it?

462
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,950
I want to become the owner of Yongcheonru.

463
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,530
How unexpected...

464
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,230
Why? Do you think I cannot?

465
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,770
You seemed like the most relaxed and free one.

466
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,280
I did not know you were so ambitious.

467
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,450
Did I seem that way?

468
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,880
But I have a goal now.

469
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,410
I will not be outpaced this time.

470
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,100
Let us work hard together.

471
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,610
This is from Yongcheonru, Your Majesty.

472
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,060
How should I tell them to host the guest?

473
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,620
Let Cheon handle it himself.

474
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,380
Did you finally find it?

475
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,040
I did find this half in Cheon's residence,

476
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,760
but there are many suspicious aspects to it.

477
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,570
Suspicious?

478
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,630
It was as if he was expecting me to look for it.

479
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,890
It is strange that I found it so easily.

480
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,250
Cheon left out the fake one intentionally and waited?

481
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,560
He is sly enough to do that.

482
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,030
Father, who created this golden key?

483
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,490
Why are you asking me that?

484
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,920
It is an unusual key that comes in two pieces.

485
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,720
I got curious that it might have a story to it.

486
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,830
What story?

487
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,440
- There is no such a thing. 
 - Please tell me if there is one.

488
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,610
There is none, I said!

489
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,120
My apologies.

490
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,930
The proclamation ceremony is coming up soon.

491
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,770
Hurry up.

492
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,330
Find the golden key quickly

493
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,950
and return to the palace.

494
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:08,130
I will find out the secret he is hiding, no matter what.

495
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,500
Prince Mu Yeong...

496
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,320
you are my eldest son, and you have to become the crown prince

497
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,210
for this country and the royal family.

498
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,330
Keep that in mind.

499
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,000
Yes, Father.

500
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,670
You know, that bastard from last time?

501
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,260
The one named Hong Deok Su we arrested from Yongcheonru.

502
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,230
Do you mean the one you released without pressing charges?

503
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,790
Yes.

504
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,720
Seol Mae Hwa is after him for some reason.

505
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,780
Prince Mu Yeong got involved, too.

506
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,650
And why is Cheon showing interest in him?

507
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:14,200
I am very curious.

508
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,490
Find out everything about him.

509
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,950
Yes, sir.

510
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,170
The name is important. The name.

511
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,770
I want you to find out more about Hong Deok Su's father.

512
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,580
Find out how his late father was related to Cheon.

513
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,880
Use more people if necessary to find out quickly.

514
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,200
Yes, got it.

515
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,900
And...

516
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,990
Yes, ask me anything.

517
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,590
Beom Ho,

518
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,280
do you have some money?

519
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,650
Pardon?

520
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,230
For some reason, no staff has been assigned to the Geumokdang.

521
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,400
Yes, I am aware.

522
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,900
   

523
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,530
It is Master Cheon's guest. I will take care of them.

524
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,930
You do not have to worry.

525
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,560
Yes, madam.

526
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,660
Will the Geumokdang guest arrive today?

527
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,380
Is there something I need to prepare in advance?

528
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,830
Just leave it.

529
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:15,420
You cannot continue to manage every little thing forever.

530
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,620
A gambling house might be too risky.

531
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,400
The law prohibits it.

532
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,840
My money is above the law.

533
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,120
What are you worried about?

534
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,600
Everything will be fine as long as the news does not travel outside.

535
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,580
- But even Young Master Jun Hwa is— 
 - It is a perfect way to train him.

536
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,920
Why are you trying to give Hong Deok Su a chance?

537
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:50,690
You know, Hong Deok Su has a talent for setting up a game.

538
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,520
It is fun for me to watch, too.

539
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,120
Jun Hwa needs to learn, anyway.

540
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,340
It would be even better if it was fun, too.

541
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,640
Which one do you prefer?

542
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,750
I think I prefer the purple one.

543
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,950
Let me serve you tea.

544
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,730
This is for the skirt, and this is for the shirt-

545
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:27,550
What is this? Do you know how much this silk costs?

546
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,770
Reimburse me right now!

547
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,120
- My apologies. 
 - Go Su Ra!

548
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,870
Apologize properly. What are you doing?

549
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,800
Call your superior immediately!

550
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,470
How dare you touch my daughter's wedding gift?

551
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,930
I will clean it thoroughly and bring it back.

552
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,710
How could you be so clumsy?

553
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,410
- My apologies. 
 - I do not want to hear it.

554
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:06,390
I heard it cost a fortune since it is silk from the Qing dynasty.

555
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,510
- That is too bad. 
 - I can pay for it from my salary.

556
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,620
How will your family survive, then?

557
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:18,780
Just swallow your pride and work for me.

558
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,580
You will upset the seniors if you hang out with the Bottom-Tier ones.

559
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,990
Seize the opportunity when I am offering one.

560
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,160
Go Su Ra!

561
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,450
What is it?

562
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,150
Nice weather.

563
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,430
Let us go.

564
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:02,790
You will reimburse the guest for the silk with this money for Go Su Ra?

565
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,610
I thought you were paying me the security expenses.

566
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:09,520
I will get money for that quickly.

567
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:14,030
You must be richer than I thought.

568
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,150
I will wait for you,

569
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:19,190
but there is not much time. You should hurry.

570
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,700
Yes.

571
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,940
Please keep it a secret from Go Su Ra.

572
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,270
All right.

573
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,190
 What? 

574
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,170
You spent all that money?

575
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,120
Well, the thing is...

576
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,150
I am sorry.

577
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:49,680
I know I borrowed it, but I should have discussed it with you.

578
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,600
It was for a good thing. Something good. Something meaningful and worthwhile.

579
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,270
What did you spend it on? What?

580
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,880
I thought you were getting new chairs.

581
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,280
Well, they all look the same now that I fixed them.

582
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,400
Hong Deok Su, do not keep a secret from your business partner.

583
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,340
By chance, did you...

584
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,790
"Would you ignore me if I were in your situation?

585
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:25,190
Would you not help me?

586
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,880
We are friends."

587
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,160
Those are your words.

588
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,920
Yes, good job. Good job.

589
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,910
What am I supposed to sell now?

590
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,680
- What? 
 - There is no need.

591
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:29,100
This is your hyeongnim, right, Lee Eun Ho?

592
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,280
He is not my sibling,

593
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,870
but he is my distant cousin.

594
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,230
Come to think of it, are you...

595
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,030
the yeot...

596
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,740
Gosh, it is good to see you again.

597
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,330
It is your hyeongnim I met at Wunjong Market last time.

598
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:55,090
He is one of the wealthiest people in Hanyang.

599
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,400
Oh my!

600
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,600
He told me there was a good investment opportunity, so I came by.

601
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,130
He has nothing but money. Feel free to take his money.

602
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,380
Oh, all right.

603
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,760
Something is suspicious.

604
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,100
Are they really related? They do not look alike.

605
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,130
I am better looking than him.

606
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,290
You said you were in a hurry.

607
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,730
Make a decision quickly.

608
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,390
Yes, take the investment money, grow it, and pay it back.

609
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,790
What if he is a scam artist?

610
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,380
Excuse me.

611
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,810
I can hear you.

612
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,730
Lee Eun Ho, you told me...

613
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:38,600
to beware of a favor without a reason.

614
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,670
I will leave if you do not want it.

615
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,960
- No, no... 
 - Hyeongnim.

616
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,930
I said I guarantee it.

617
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,750
He will charge the minimum interest rate. Go on and take it.

618
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,820
What minimum—

619
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,160
Minimum interest, it is.

620
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,830
No.

621
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,450
I will pay the interest properly.

622
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,900
Looks like we made a deal, then.

623
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,330
Cheers!

624
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,210
Hey, it is so sweet!

625
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,000
I love how sweet it is.

626
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,910
Did you pay for the silk on my behalf?

627
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,960
- Oh, that? 
 - When did I ask for your help?

628
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,700
Who asked you to pay my debt?

629
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,900
I borrowed money. I happened to get the money that day.

630
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,600
You said you have to succeed with the gambling house.

631
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,360
But, still...

632
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,840
you are important, too.

633
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,010
We agreed to become successful together.

634
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:16,940
 - Is this all right?  
 - Let me help you.

635
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,900
 Hurry up. All right, all right...

00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:00,510
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, you'll feel it  ♫

659
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:04,110
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, this overwhelming feeling  ♫

660
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,260
♫  Shall we match our free steps? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  ♫

661
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,820
♫  Shall we match our free steps? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  ♫

662
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,750
Is he dim or carefree?

663
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,210
He can sleep comfortably anywhere.

664
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:42,860
Hong Deok Su, wake up. Your face will get frozen.

665
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:44,930
Have I been overextending myself?

666
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,800
It was for good reasons.

667
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,730
I should have a physician check my pulse.

668
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,590
Wake up, Hong Deok Su. Hong Deok Su!

669
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,900
Hey, you came.

670
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,820
You cannot just sleep outside.

671
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,750
Why is your face so red? Are you sick?

672
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,610
You cannot get sick before the grand opening.

673
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,700
Are you more concerned

674
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,710
about the gambling house than me?

675
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,600
Of course.

676
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,160
I am sick. Check my temperature.

677
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,890
You are fine. You will not die.

678
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:17,720
I have a fever. Check more carefully.

679
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,800
I need to go organize the boards.

680
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,410
Here.

681
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,140
This will point to the winning number.

682
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:11,090
All right. One, two, three.

683
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,660
Three...

684
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:19,120
Oh, Lee Eun Ho! Congrats...

685
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,220
- What are they doing, anyway? 
  - Go, go. 

686
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,830
This is a gambling house.

687
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:29,800
Gambling is strictly prohibited by the law.

688
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,950
- Dong Gyu seonbaenim. 
 - Yes?

689
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:37,550
What if Ulju took over Yongcheonru?

690
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,390
 That is right! 

691
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,950
Pardon?

692
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,430
 Congrats! Congrats! 

693
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:46,020
No, no, no.

694
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,320
Only take what is here.

695
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,740
It is all right.

696
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,020
Everything is all right, Hong Deok Su.

697
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,010
It will be over soon.

698
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:23,280
   

699
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,470
"Bulrakho."

700
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,390
"Is it not joyous?"

701
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:45,720
You hung a quote from the Analects. How cheeky.

702
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:50,610
Anyone can enjoy each other like old friends here.

703
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,180
I like the meaning,

704
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:58,120
but we will see if it will continue to be joyous.

705
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,960
Saengsado is a game about life.

706
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:15,960
Depending on the number you get, you get all the money in the world

707
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,840
or you get chased by the Grim Reaper and die.

708
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,780
Would you like to give it a try?

709
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,860
No, I do not.

710
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:26,910
The owner only observes.

711
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:31,170
We cannot make a profit if only guests played.

712
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:34,610
Therefore, we need a host who manages the games.

713
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:37,070
- A host? 
 - Yes.

714
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:41,440
I happen to know the perfect person.

715
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,760
 You wanted to see me. 

716
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,720
She is so talented that she could trick the guests

717
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:01,280
and she hides her cards better than anyone.

718
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,100
Would you like to become the host, Master Innkeeper?

719
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:20,190
Thinking now, you used to be good at Ssangpae.

720
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,760
That was a long time ago.

721
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,940
I am sure you still have it.

722
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,750
Give it a try.

723
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,690
You play first. I will be the Grim Reaper and chase you.

724
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:42,060
I will... try hosting today.

725
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:50,860
Do you think you can catch me?

726
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,210
Yes. I will make sure to catch you.

727
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:04,400
Be careful.

728
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,910
You won treasure, Master Innkeeper.

729
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:47,590
It is my turn this time.

730
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,790
Death is...

731
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:58,360
right ahead of you, Master Innkeeper.

732
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,980
 Welcome. 

733
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:06,000
What a shame.

734
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,060
I caught...

735
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,860
your horse and is dead.

736
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:21,520
Even the richest person who has all the gold in the world

737
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,710
is powerless in front of death.

738
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,370
Yes.

739
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:35,340
You won.

740
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,600
A game of life and death.

741
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,580
How interesting.

742
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,870
I prepared Sapaejung and Haengwunrun, too.

743
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:55,770
If you want to be the host,

744
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:58,710
you should practice with me first.

745
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,890
Go easy on her. Go easy.

746
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,670
Did you find the game fun?

747
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:19,030
You had better stop now.

748
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,620
You are the one...

749
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,130
who pushed me this far.

750
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,230
Are you not looking forward to tomorrow?

751
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,690
Bulrakho...

752
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,630
Did you carve the sign yourself?

753
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,790
You are very talented.

754
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:32,190
Are you ordering your underlings around well?

755
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:35,190
You put up a sign, too. Bulrakho.

756
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:40,330
Yes. It went smoothly because we all worked together.

757
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:46,920
Here is the general.

758
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,890
I will block it.

759
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,740
I lost.

760
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:14,570
The general got you because you saved the pawns for no reason.

761
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,160
Which one do you think you are?

762
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,730
You are neither the cannon nor...

763
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:26,060
the chariot.

764
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:29,730
You are not the king, either.

765
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,430
You need to become the game maker.

766
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:39,710
Do not be one of the pieces on the board.

767
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:42,990
You should be the one to move the pieces!

768
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:49,030
You should own the game.

769
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:06,190
 I noticed something unusual while investigating Cheon. 

770
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:11,190
 It is regarding the missing person's poster at the market recently. 

771
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,730
 Cheon had a business partner who died long ago. 

772
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:25,180
 He put up the posters to look for his daughter. 

773
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,200
 Why do you think he is looking for her? 

774
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,800
 My late father willed it to me. 

775
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,100
 It is the only thing he left behind in this world. 

776
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:36,380
 It is also the reason I have to be successful at Yongcheonru. 

777
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,400
 Please tell me if there is one. 

778
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,640
I am still investigating,

779
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,950
but I brought it because I saw this posted in the market.

780
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:14,180
The person of contact on the poster works at Yongcheonru.

781
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:30,940
 I happen to know the perfect person. 

782
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,110
 You wanted to see me. 

783
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:37,340
 She is so talented that she could trick the guests 

784
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:41,830
 and she hides her cards better than anyone. 

785
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:54,110
How does he know about that?

786
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,940
 Leave. 

787
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,350
Seol Mae Hwa...

788
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:56,490
 Come to the place where you taught me Ssangpae to get the sword back. 

789
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,820
A long time ago, you told me

790
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,440
to switch to a game

791
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:26,290
you are better at if you want to win.

792
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:36,710
I finally realized...

793
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:39,950
what that meant today.

794
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,450
Jae On...

795
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:53,170
   

796
01:13:54,170 --> 01:14:02,130


797
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:17,390
♫  The round moonlight has suddenly  ♫

798
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,580
 Let us open the door. 

799
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,470
 Congratulations on your reinstatement, Hong Deok Su, the true man! 

800
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:26,030
 I was after Prince Mu Yeong for immature Jun Hwa, 

801
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:29,320
 but I amazingly caught someone superior. 

802
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,980
 - Hong Deok Su. 
 - Yes? 

803
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,950
 You are so magnanimous, like a true man. 

804
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:36,790
 The more I look at your forehead, the more familiar it seems. 

805
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:41,800
 Cheon is looking for his late business partner's daughter. 

806
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,270
 I looked for you my whole life for Jun Hwa. 

807
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:48,870
 Hong Deok Su, I need to tell you something. Please set some time aside. 

808
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:50,730
 What? Love confession? 

809
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:52,880
 Are you out of your mind? 

810
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,160
 What do you mean you will confess love? 

811
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,050
 I have never felt this way in my life. 

812
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:01,970
 The smile is the loveliest part. 

813
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:05,270
 Wake up, Lee Eun Ho. He is just the golden key. 

814
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,830
 What is the golden key Hong Deok Su has? 

815
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:11,130
 Hong Jae On. Hong Deok Su. 

816
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,620
 A woman you fell for at first sight? 

817
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:17,080
 Please help me figure out how to tell her.
