1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,460
   

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,150
   

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,310
   

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:15,960


5
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,090
What do we do now?

6
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,290
Are you all dressed?

7
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,900
I— I am almost done.

8
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,000
I said I would help you put it on. Why are you being so stubborn?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,930
We are in a hurry.

10
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,450
Men and women need to be separated. We cannot do that.

11
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,760
Hurry up.

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,160
The Lord will come out soon.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,630
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,270
Walk across the courtyard and go to the door.

15
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,540
And run without looking back at Jakyakjae immediately.

16
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,340
The stepping stone is shaky. Secure it.

17
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,720
Hong Deok Su...

18
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,910
Where do you think you are going?

19
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,760
Are there any issues?

20
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,250
The Lord is inside. Where are you going?

21
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,950
My apologies.

22
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,450
She is the present we prepared for the Lord.

23
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,000
That is the wrong way. Follow me.

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,430
Yes.

25
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,790
A present for the Lord?

26
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,300
Did she call Hong Deok Su a present just now?

27
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,410
That is what I heard, too.

28
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,340
The Lord hates waiting. I will go in now.

29
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,730
 Strengthen the security here. 

30
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,000
Lee Eun Ho.

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,080
Lee Eun Ho, where are you going?

32
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,680
Hey.

33
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,800
The Master Innkeeper and Master Cheon are here, too.

34
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,420
I scored. I scored big time.

35
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,500
My apologies.

36
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,760
It sounds noisy inside. I will go in and see.

37
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,470
Hong Deok Su...

38
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,970
Where on earth are you?

39
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,110
The Bottom-Tier Room bastards.

40
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,430
I will definitely send you home this time.

41
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,110
Hey, stop.

42
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,930
Are you the apprentices of Gyohwadang?

43
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,910
Bow down.

44
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,420
Someone was dragged in over there.

45
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,190
I need to hurry. Please do not stop me.

46
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,310
Are you bastards trying to go in there?

47
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,300
What did you say?

48
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,670
- Hey, Lee Eun Ho. 
 - What are you doing?

49
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:40,710
Yongcheonru provides anything the guests want. Do you not know?

50
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,370
I know you are a merchant, but how could you sell a person?

51
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,670
Merchant?

52
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,850
My apologies, Master Cheon.

53
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,170
We are taking too much of your time.

54
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,130
Have you already forgotten why you came here?

55
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,990
If you did, ask yourself again...

56
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,630
why you came here.

57
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,090
Master Innkeeper, the Lord is—

58
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,030
I think we should...

59
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,260
greet each other after he sees the present.

60
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,940
All right, then...

61
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,510
Lord, the present from Yongcheonru is here.

62
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,800
Would you like to see it now?

63
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,780
Let us go in.

64
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,630
Just do as you are told.

65
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,650
Once we go over this fence,

66
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,690
no one can save us from what happens next.

67
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,430
But we cannot let the perverted man have Hong Deok Su.

68
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,090
It would be fine, right?

69
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,860
Even Master Cheon came.

70
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,020
That is why I need to come, too.

71
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,250
We are true men of the Bottom-Tier Room, are we not?

72
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,620
Yes.

73
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,910
Let us go.

74
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,820
Right now?

75
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,750
Take the covering off and put it aside.

76
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,820
Hey, hey! Look!

77
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,920
Aigoo...

78
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
True man, my foot.

79
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,900
Gosh. Be careful.

80
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,010
He wants you to lift up the skirt and turn around.

81
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,610
Lift it higher!

82
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,960
Take off the socks you are wearing.

83
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,450
Pardon?

84
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,170
Show him your undershirt next.

85
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,310
Pardon?

86
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,550
Will you make me repeat myself?

87
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,820
Take it off quickly.

88
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,430
 Take it off right now! 

89
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,920
I cannot do this.

90
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
- Even the Lord— 
 - What did you say?

91
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,790
Stop this right now!

92
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,620
Who are you?

93
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,010
Cheon Jun Hwa and Go Su Ra?

94
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,090
What is this now?

95
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,030
Do you think you could get away with this?

96
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,350
How dare you come in here?

97
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,250
Yongcheonru did something terrible to the Lord.

98
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,410
What should I do?

99
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,390
- Should I ask His Excellency back home for forgiveness? 
 - Pardon?

100
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,790
He forbade her to be near men before marriage.

101
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,400
But we could not stop three men from coming in.

102
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,140
You and I will have to put our lives on the line for it.

103
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,120
Master Innkeeper...

104
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,480
Lord?

105
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,950
Get her out of here. These were the clothes I was going to wear.

106
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,070
But you made them dirty and caused a scene.

107
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,550
It has no value anymore.

108
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,150
You cannot come out. Please go in.

109
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,640
You cannot show your face—

110
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,960
It was not a perverted old man?

111
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,830
Everyone, leave!

112
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,270
Do you know what you ruined?

113
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,460
She is the most important guest of Yongcheonru.

114
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,160
You ruined our presentation of clothes for her.

115
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,090
Our apologies, Master Innkeeper.

116
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,190
We heard the perverted old man gets furious at male innkeepers.

117
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,270
So, did you think you could save Hong Deok Su

118
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,200
by climbing this fence and eavesdropping?

119
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,170
Did you not think your actions would put him in greater danger?

120
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,300
Even an important guest should not slap someone like that.

121
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,520
If you want to change Yongcheonru,

122
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,040
become the owner of it.

123
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,460
All of you must have come here to achieve something.

124
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,010
Try to acquire power first.

125
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,700
Anger without power is completely useless.

126
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,260
Hong Deok Su, the Master Innkeeper saved our lives.

127
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,630
Not just us but everyone from the Bottom-Tier Room.

128
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes.

129
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,920
Do not forget the favor and be thankful to her.

130
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,400
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,080
 I heard Do Gyeong went to Yongcheonru again. 

132
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,350
She should be receiving bridal lessons at home.

133
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,600
Is she hiding honey at Yongcheonru or something?

134
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,770
That way, she will be more obedient.

135
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,520
She cannot go outside of Yongcheonru, anyway.

136
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,810
What if she meets a man in Yongcheonru?

137
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,060
Do not worry.

138
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,210
A strict bodyguard is right beside her,

139
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,670
so no men can be near her.

140
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,620
Knowing her, Do Gyeong will definitely cause trouble.

141
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,930
You think she would just listen to us?

142
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,710
You are way too kind.

143
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:43,380
You are too much of a softie.

144
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,800
Do Gyeong inherited a fortune since my brother passed.

145
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,470
I should pretend to be nice to her until I get that money.

146
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,530
She spends money like it is water already.

147
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,610
How will we end up with any money?

148
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,750
I think we should get her married sooner.

149
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,910
We cannot wait until Prince Mu Yeong returns from Onyang.

150
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,930
- Should I tell her to marry now? 
 - What?

151
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,780
That is a good idea.

152
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,840
If we marry Prince Mu Yeong to Do Gyeong,

153
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,550
we will remove a huge obstacle for the proclamation ceremony.

154
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,410
Aigoo! I knew it. You are the best, dear husband!

155
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,840
How come you are so clever?

156
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,490
You do not understand my deep intentions.

157
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,920
I did not come this far for no reason.

158
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,170
   

159
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,800
 He forbade her to be near men before marriage. 

160
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,050
 But we could not stop three men from coming in. 

161
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,580
 You and I will have to put our lives on the line for it. 

162
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,050
 Master Innkeeper saved our lives. 

163
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:38,190
Goodness, I cannot believe I let you see me in a dress.

164
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,970
Aigoo...

165
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,880
Thank you for earlier, Lee Eun Ho.

166
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,970
I told you not to behave so rashly.

167
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,890
You dressed like a woman to cause trouble now.

168
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,650
That is why you got slapped on your ugly face.

169
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,540
What did you say?

170
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,950
What?

171
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,210
Rub it on your face. You will feel better.

172
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,100
If you put ice on a swollen area—

173
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,580
I will go for a night walk.

174
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,340
Where are you going?

175
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,980
Try applying ice where you got slapped...

176
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,260
He needs to use it before it melts.

177
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,360
Is something going on between you and Hong Deok Su?

178
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,520
Nothing is going on.

179
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,800
You grabbed each other by the collars on day one.

180
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,140
You fought like cats and dogs whenever you saw each other.

181
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:27,210
And you climbed over the fence without hesitation when he was in danger?

182
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,860
Yet you still say nothing is going on?

183
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,240
I just tried to protect what I was supposed to.

184
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,960
Right.

185
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,640
What did you try to protect?

186
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,990
The same thing you tried to protect tonight.

187
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,470
How nice!

188
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,970
- Kim Myeong Ho, you did that on purpose, did you not? 
 - What did I do?

189
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,450
We are in this mess because you lied to Deok Su.

190
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,090
What? Did something happen in there?

191
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,650
Something entertaining must have happened.

192
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,900
If you get caught scheming again,

193
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,570
I swear I will not let it slide, then.

194
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,020
My precious book.

195
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,900
Well...

196
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,740
How nice.

197
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,710
Seriously. What a weirdo.

198
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,160
Oh, hello, sir.

199
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,010
Is Apprentice Lee Eun Ho inside?

200
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,580
 Master Cheon wants to see you. 

201
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,570
 Go see him now. 

202
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,090
Welcome, Prince Mu Yeong.

203
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:56,420
No, should I call you Apprentice Number 28?

204
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,400
What is all this?

205
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,730
How dare you...

206
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,510
Who do you think you are?

207
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,200
Even a fox acts like a king in his cave.

208
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,500
Yongcheonru is my house. So, I am the king here.

209
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,840
How dare you?

210
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,440
My apologies!

211
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,790
I had you reside in this humble Yongcheonru, and I have not greeted you properly.

212
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:41,540
So, I prepared the royal meal you used to eat in the palace.

213
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,590
Please have a seat.

214
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,900
You prepared this spread for me.

215
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,820
I will accept it.

216
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,700
So, did you achieve your goal here?

217
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,800
I am not sure.

218
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,970
I achieved half and...

219
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,590
I am sure I will achieve the other half as well.

220
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,260
You already achieved half while at Gyohwadang?

221
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,920
You are truly impressive.

222
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,570
If so, when do you think you will achieve the other half?

223
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,280
For the other half,

224
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,960
I will need to lend your hand.

225
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,580
Of course, Your Highness.

226
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,510
Ask me anything. There are plenty of gold bars.

227
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,980
I am learning a lot since I came to Yongcheonru.

228
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,010
My goodness.

229
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,590
I am so glad I was able to help you.

230
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:08,520
You could easily become an official innkeeper at this rate.

231
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,320
I hear the last test is coming up.

232
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,270
You must not be worried since you will pass easily.

233
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,990
Of course.

234
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,620
I will make sure to pass and achieve my goal.

235
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,400
His Majesty must be so proud.

236
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,320
 There was an accident at Jakyakjae? 

237
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,960
Innkeeper Ji could not have done that.

238
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,890
My apologies, Master Innkeeper.

239
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,060
It is impossible to stop those troublemakers.

240
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,120
Was it the However Quartet again?

241
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,200
Oh my...

242
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,600
They upset the favorite niece of the Minister of Defense.

243
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,030
What do we do, Master Innkeeper?

244
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,980
To comfort an angry cat,

245
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,250
you should give it something to play with.

246
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,910
The Hosting Department is in charge of the last test, right?

247
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,330
Pardon?

248
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,520
 This is finally the last group test. 

249
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,010
Here is the Head Host, Yu Su In, the flower of Yongcheonru.

250
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,600
There is a reason why the Hosting Department's test is the last one.

251
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,710
Ta-da! What do you think?

252
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,880
Is it not splendid? 
    

253
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,870
You will officially become innkeepers if you pass this test.

254
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:24,370
Only one group that provided the best service patiently until the end

255
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,880
will receive the certificate directly from the guest.

256
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,690
You will have to steal the guest's heart, no matter what.

257
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,700
Here are the things you need to remember for the guest:

258
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,490
One. Never look at the guest's face.

259
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,710
Two. Come in one person at a time when serving him.

260
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,290
- Three... 
 - Who is it, anyway?

261
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,240
He said it was an important guest. Are you deaf?

262
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,070
Shut up.

263
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:04,740
Four. Never say the word "no."

264
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,420
Five...

265
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,040
Thank you for agreeing to assess the test despite the inconvenience.

266
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,950
Perhaps you could use this opportunity to teach them a lesson.

267
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,500
Teach them a lesson?

268
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,190
Things are getting fun, thanks to you.

269
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,990
The apprentices are male.

270
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,560
What if His Excellency finds out—

271
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,810
It is a request from the Master Innkeeper of Yongcheonru.

272
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,910
It is your request. Of course, I will do it properly.

273
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,910
You said the apprentices are arriving soon, right?

274
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,290
I am screwed...

275
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,260
It had to be the guest from yesterday.

276
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,750
As for the face-washing water, boil it for half an hour,

277
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,640
cool it for 15 minutes, and bring it.

278
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,810
This is our last test. We cannot give up.

279
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,680
Of course not. We are from the Bottom-Tier Room.

280
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,940
You are spitting. Come on.

281
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,040
We boiled it for half an hour and cooled it for 15 minutes.

282
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,220
This must be the right temperature, right?

283
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,500
Good job, Go Su Ra.

284
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,960
By the way, who is going to carry it?

285
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,480
- I will try first. 
  - No. 

286
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,510
- Why not? 
 - The way you speak is no good.

287
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,370
What is wrong with the way I speak?

288
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,310
Do I not talk the same way... as you?

289
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,750
And not to mention what happened yesterday.

290
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,550
No, let me—

291
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,240
I will bring it.

292
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,420
The Bottom-Tier Room needs to pass.

293
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,140
Stand tall, Go Su Ra.

294
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,660
- Let us go! 
 - Stand tall!

295
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,110
The water is too cold.

296
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,710
Do you want me to freeze to death?

297
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,750
The water is too hot.

298
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,470
Do you want me to get burned?

299
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,080
How dare you put sesame seeds on it?

300
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,190
 My parrot is a picky eater. 

301
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,900
 He should only be fed freshly picked fruits. 

302
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,660
Parrot?

303
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,800
- That is it! 
 - We did it.

304
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,110
Great.

305
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,560
The Top-Tier Room passes.

306
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,710
What is with this bedding?

307
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,230
I said the pillow's height cannot exceed four chon and two pun. 
  (T/N: 5 inches or 12.7 cm) 

308
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,290
What would it take for her to let us pass?

309
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,270
It is not going to happen.

310
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,980
Eat.

311
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,110
Yes, let us eat first.

312
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,670
Let us eat and try it again.

313
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,360
Yes. Well...

314
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,060
Let us eat.

315
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:38,890
What happened when you went to pick up the snacks yesterday?

316
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,030
Leave while I am giving you a pass.

317
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,270
Hong Deok Su...

318
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,300
are we not all suffering because of you?

319
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,050
Kim Myeong Ho, you really are trash, are you not?

320
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,510
You are the one who lied.

321
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,070
No, you are a fool for falling for it.

322
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,180
What is the problem? What?

323
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,230
What?

324
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,520
Hold on.

325
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,490
You came back late from Jakyakjae yesterday because...

326
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,150
Tell me.

327
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,900
What? Tell me!

328
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,440
What—

329
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,440
What are you so curious about?

330
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,660
Let me tell you everything.

331
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,800
Never mind.

332
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,770
Let go of me.

333
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,240
All right.

334
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,350
Let me hear the details later.

335
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,640
Go Su Ra,

336
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,910
you must be happy because you have friends for once.

337
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,470
You look very happy these days.

338
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,400
Hey, Kim Myeong Ho!

339
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,790
You must be plotting something again.

340
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,560
Just leave our Bottom-Tier Room alone.

341
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,930
"Our Bottom-Tier Room"?

342
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,980
It is strange that you climbed Jakyakjae's fence yesterday,

343
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,120
yet you came back safely.

344
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,340
Are you admitting that you lied now, Kim Myeong Ho?

345
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,380
It is suspicious.

346
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,000
You must have a secret, do you not?

347
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,860
Why?

348
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,530
Are you curious?

349
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,890
You will never know because you have no friends.

350
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,920
By chance, is the secret...

351
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,390
regarding Hong Deok Su?

352
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,190
What about him?

353
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,990
It is nothing. There are just too many suspicious things.

354
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,840
Go Su Ra...

355
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,510
think carefully.

356
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:16,720
Parrot, I hope your owner forgives me.

357
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,780
Our Bottom-Tier Room really needs to pass.

358
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,410
Please take pity on me.

359
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,760
You are a bird, but you will never fly.

360
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,200
I feel sorry for you, too.

361
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,260
Stay away.

362
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,720
What is wrong, My Lady?

363
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,980
There is nothing I like about you.

364
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,570
This fruit is no good.

365
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,550
Go get something fresher.

366
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,280
Yes.

367
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,030
I told the wife of the Minister of Defense that you were here,

368
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,280
and she was not happy about it.

369
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,790
I will manage.

370
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,260
Where did the parrot go?

371
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,820
He flew very well.

372
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,350
Pardon?

373
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,120
By chance, did you...

374
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,060
No, right?

375
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,640
You go find him.

376
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,470
My Lady!

377
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,880
Why are you doing this?

378
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,050
If you cannot find him, Yongcheonru will pay for it.

379
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,630
- However— 
 - Leave.

380
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,160
Parrot! Parrot!

381
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,390
Parrot!

382
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,910
Parrot!

383
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,680
- Parrot! 
 - Shit...

384
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,170
How does this make sense?

385
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,410
She let the bird go. How are we supposed to find him?

386
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,830
- Parrot! 
 - Parrot!

387
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,180
Parrot!

388
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,450
Gosh, where is he? How can we find him?

389
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,340
Are you already tired, Hong Deok Su?

390
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,470
What do you mean, tired?

391
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,530
Let us hang in there until we find him!

392
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,350
If you think about it, this is good for the parrot.

393
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,510
He gets to make new friends, too.

394
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,040
He has been trapped in the cage all this time.

395
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,760
He must be happy being free outside.

396
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,100
 It has a dragon carved on it. 

397
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:26,400
 I am sure these swords were only given to the princes. 

398
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,680
Are you recovering from the cold?

399
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,210
What brings you all the way here, Minister?

400
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,600
Discard the medicine given by Cheon.

401
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,470
This is ginseng all the way from Taebaek.

402
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:11,010
This will help you recover.

403
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,520
I did not expect you to care for me.

404
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,470
Thank you.

405
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,230
Who will do it if not me?

406
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,660
Are you looking for something?

407
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,320
I am not.

408
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:39,200
Do you practice swordcraft these days?

409
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,570
I have not because no one would sharpen the sword for me.

410
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,120
Pardon?

411
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,910
I can help with that.

412
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,860
Then...

413
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,110
I will leave it in your care.

414
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,250
Could you teach me swordcraft when you get a chance?

415
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,740
Yes.

416
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,840
Of course!

417
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:46,100
The Minister of Defense is behaving worse and worse.

418
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:51,540
If his niece and Prince Mu Yeong get married,

419
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:55,310
Prince Seon Yang will be chosen as the crown prince, right?

420
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,000
Yes.

421
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:02,590
Is that why you sent the gold bars to the Minister of Defense?

422
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,960
I should act ahead of time

423
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,340
as the Master Innkeeper without detailed instructions.

424
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,530
It is better to be safe than sorry.

425
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,000
Not having enemies on any side

426
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,970
is the secret of tightrope walking.

427
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,600
The Minister of Defense will not just wait.

428
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,010
He will find Prince Mu Yeong somehow.

429
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,780
Everyone is acting unruly, but they are

430
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,630
all my pawns, after all.

431
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,010
Is this supposed to be my parrot?

432
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:16,530
I will look for him even if I have to stay up all night.

433
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,510
I want this to comfort you in the meantime.

434
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:44,120
I thought the parrot would feel less lonely if he had a friend.

435
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,570
My Lady, would you like to see something interesting?

436
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,040
All right.

437
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,120
This is a game called Ssangpae.

438
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:18,670
My Lady, would you like to play a bet against me?

439
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:20,980
A bet?

440
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,400
The loser grants the winner's wish.

441
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,170
Are you trying to get a passing grade from me?

442
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,600
We would love to pass, of course.

443
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,930
However... that is not the reason this time.

444
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:41,760
How about you go for a night outing with me if I win?

445
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,480
Why would I go for an outing with you?

446
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,350
You might run into the parrot, who might be enjoying the world.

447
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,650
You can win if you do not want to go out.

448
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,220
Two nyang.

449
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,370
Take two nyang and bet four more nyang.

450
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,410
Forget this.

451
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,080
Hey, hey, hey!

452
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,410
- Yes, Hyeongnim. 
 - Yes, Hyeongnim.

453
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,820
Have you seen Hong Deok Su taking a bath?

454
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,250
We take baths here. We would not know.

455
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,360
Sang Wu, how about you?

456
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,080
I guess I have never seen it.

457
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:52,300
He refused to take his top off when we told him to, right?

458
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,250
I guess so.

459
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,920
Was that woman really...

460
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,990
 Gosh... 

461
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:19,950
Yes, it was definitely Hong Deok Su.

462
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:27,660
We will know once we see him, right?

463
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,990
Well...

464
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,000
All right, that was just a practice.

465
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,890
How fascinating! Who taught you these skills?

466
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,590
 My Lady, this is Seol Mae Hwa. 

467
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,260
What are you doing here at this hour, Master Innkeeper?

468
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,780
I heard your rare laughter outside.

469
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,150
You must be playing a fun game.

470
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,910
Would you like to try it, too?

471
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:28,720
He plays unbelievable tricks.

472
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,850
Were you entertaining our guest?

473
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,040
Yes, Master Innkeeper.

474
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,160
It is all right. Go ahead and toss.

475
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,490
It is Ssangpae, is it not?

476
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,730
Do you know this game, too, Mae Hwa?

477
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:01,660
Of course. A long time ago—

478
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,540
Go ahead and toss again.

479
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,640
Yes.

480
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,570
Brace yourself, My Lady.

481
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:33,610
I will make sure to win.

482
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,950
 I will make sure to win. 

483
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:57,670
You have to grant my wish since I won.

484
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,690
You must be having fun.

485
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,330
I will keep this a secret since this is your last day.

486
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,750
Last day?

487
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,110
The minister sent someone.

488
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,280
They will take you to Onyang early tomorrow morning.

489
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,830
Onyang? Why would I go there?

490
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,890
Prince Mu Yeong is in Onyang.

491
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:25,070
His Excellency wanted you to see him in person.

492
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:33,690
All right. You may leave now.

493
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,180
 I will make sure to win. 

494
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,230
 Now, if you want to win a bet, 

495
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,320
 just switch to a game you are better at. 

496
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,230
 Like this? 

497
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,180
It cannot be.

498
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,140
Hong Deok Su!

499
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:39,240
I will grant your wish tonight since you won.

500
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,160
So, you are all ready, right?

501
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,440
My Lady?

502
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,480
First of all, we will split into three groups.

503
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:36,740
My Lady, please stop!

504
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,850
Stop!

505
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,580
 Go Su Ra, you will be the decoy. 

506
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,280
Do I have to dress as a woman?

507
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,630
My apologies. I thought this was a different palanquin.

508
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,630
 While the bodyguard is chasing Su Ra's palanquin, 

509
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:19,170
 we will climb the fence and go to the lake. 

510
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,300
 Before the Lady arrives, Lee Eun Ho, you need to 

511
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,100
 finish preparing for the perfect outing. 

512
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,370
Everything is clear, right?

513
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,600
Move, move, move! Move, I said!

514
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,750
They are finally causing trouble.

515
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:06,070
It was worth keeping an eye on them.

516
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,810
Should we tell the Head Manager right now?

517
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:14,170
Yes, and I will tell Seong Jin seonbaenim myself.

518
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:20,690
Bottom-Tier Room, you are done for now.

519
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,170
Who goes there?

520
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,480
I will distract them. Go without me.

521
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,070
No, it will be easy to trick them because I have a similar build.

522
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:41,340
Make sure she gets to the lake safely, Jun Hwa.

523
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,730
That way!

524
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,380
Over here!

525
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,020
Let us go.

526
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,090
Why are they taking so long?

527
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,260
Lee Eun Ho!

528
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,810
What?

529
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,720
Are they not here yet?

530
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,350
What are you talking about?

531
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:13,590
You said you and Jun Hwa would bring her.

532
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:17,530
The thing is, I got caught while climbing the fence.

533
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:20,520
We split up there so we would not get caught.

534
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,010
Gosh, I am tired.

535
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,040
I barely managed to lose them.

536
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,750
But why are they not here? It is about time.

537
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:48,930
I suppose that was a good workout. I am hungry.

538
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,010
Pumpkin yeot.

539
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,350
Gosh, Lee Eun Ho!

540
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,220
How did you know I like pumpkin yeot?

541
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,100
I must be too hungry.

542
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,050
My hands are shaking. My gosh.

543
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,770
No problem, there is more.

544
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,360
Thank you.

545
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,200
Hey!

546
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,470
This place is amazing.

547
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,270
The stars are pretty, and the fireflies are pretty, too.

548
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,770
Wait quietly, please.

549
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:13,700
♫  A trembling feeling for the first time  ♫

550
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,270
Should we catch fireflies and put them in the lantern?

551
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,220
I think she would like that.

552
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,430
Why would you bother?

553
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:29,130
♫  The noisy world becomes completely silent  ♫

554
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,360
Why the fireflies...

555
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:38,090
♫  And like warm sunlight, you come to me  ♫

556
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:45,280
♫  I started to wonder since when it began  ♫

557
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:52,230
♫  How do you think of me?  ♫

558
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,990
Look!

559
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:06,760
♫  Is your heart pounding like mine right now?  ♫

560
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:13,840
♫  The blooming flowers sing  ♫

561
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:20,180
♫  The blowing wind whispers  ♫

562
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,100
We got it.

563
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,450
Yes.

564
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:29,590
♫  You look at me  ♫

565
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:39,900
♫  And I bloom again as the person I used to be  ♫

566
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:46,710
♫  I bloom  ♫

567
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,720
 Master Innkeeper, this is Seong Jin. 

568
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,670
Come in.

569
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,310
Master Innkeeper, we have a situation.

570
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,690
You might want to go to Jakyakjae right now.

571
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,660
What a beautiful place.

572
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,160
Will I be able to see it again?

573
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:54,100
It is a whole new world if you take a step outside.

574
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,780
The door is open now.

575
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,770
You should take a new path, too, My Lady.

576
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:08,550
Which path will you take, then?

577
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:17,640
I hope you reach the world you want.

578
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,260
Thank you.

579
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:32,600
And do not look for Parrot anymore.

580
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,000
I got rid of the birdcage, too.

581
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,790
How about you, My Lady?

582
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,020
Let us go back now.

583
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:01,820
I will care for you from now on, My Lady.

584
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,010
What is going on?

585
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:21,660
If the Minister of Defense finds out about this,

586
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,510
I am as good as dead.

587
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,290
Do not worry.

588
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:28,870
Yongcheonru's head manager found her.

589
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,070
He will bring her here soon.

590
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:35,140
She can leave for Onyang tomorrow morning.

591
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,550
My Lady!

592
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,430
What is going on?

593
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:53,670
You scared me!

594
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,700
- And what are you wearing? 
 - Step aside.

595
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,190
Go inside now.

596
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:14,060
Just wait. I can go on my own.

597
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,870
My apologies, Head Manager.

598
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:20,090
My apprentices gave you such a hard time.

599
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,740
Gosh, I am so sick of you, the However Quartet.

600
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:27,040
Do you even know what you have done?

601
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,340
What should I do now, Master Innkeeper?

602
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,600
Hong Deok Su, it is you again.

603
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,480
Tell me. Why did you do such a thing?

604
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,360
It is...

605
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,470
all my fault.

606
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,020
I gave them the order.

607
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:04,950
I was told to give the certificate to the innkeepers who satisfied me.

608
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:07,460
So, I tested them.

609
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:12,760
I will make the final decision now.

610
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,490
Before you make the decision,

611
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:20,840
you should punish the Bottom-Tier Room for breaking the rule.

612
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,260
All they did was carry out my order.

613
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:27,750
Do not punish them, Master Innkeeper.

614
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:34,550
I will follow your order, My Lady.

615
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,560
I have been a bit too harsh.

616
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,110
You work hard all day and night. You are great innkeepers.

617
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:46,630
The Top-Tier Room passes for hosting well.

618
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:52,290
And the Bottom-Tier Room also passes for understanding me.

619
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:58,690
I decided to let both the Top-Tier Room and Bottom-Tier Room pass.

620
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:12,130
The Bottom-Tier Room cannot pass!

621
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:23,120
They do not even have the right to take the test.

622
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,020
So, they do not get to pass, either.

623
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,360
Kim Myeong Ho! W-What are you doing right now?

624
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,380
Hong Deok Su is...

625
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:37,540
a girl.

626
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:57,700
This girl dared to deceive Yongcheonru...

627
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,650
and took the Gyohwadang test.

628
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,680
She will have to be punished harshly.

629
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,850
Kim Myeong Ho, shut your mouth.

630
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,680
Hong Deok Su...

631
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,820
come clean in front of everyone!

632
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:11,080
♫  The round moonlight has suddenly  ♫

633
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,280
 Wow, petals! 

634
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:25,950
♫  But your heart won't change  ♫ 
 ♫  like the moon, will it?  ♫

635
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:29,600
 From now on, you must live as a boy. 

636
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,600
 No one can find out you are Hong Jae On and a girl. 

637
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,570
 Do you understand? 

638
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:44,630
♫  If you cannot come, then please call me instead  ♫

639
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:49,780
♫  And if you tell me your wish  ♫

640
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:55,610
♫  I'll fly, fluttering  ♫

641
01:09:55,610 --> 01:10:00,660
♫  Following this longing to where you sleep  ♫

642
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:06,500
♫  Under the same sky, no matter where  ♫

643
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:12,580
♫  I'll go  ♫ 
 ♫  Like the wind, I'll soar  ♫

644
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:21,990


645
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:27,440
   

646
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:36,300
♫  When a gentle breeze blows through the clear sky  ♫

647
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:42,620
♫  Like our beautiful, transparent light  ♫

648
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,830
♫  Leaning on each other's shoulders  ♫

649
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:51,740
♫  With excitement-filled dreams  ♫

650
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:54,690
 We need to find evidence that he is a girl. 

651
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:56,660
 The evidence no one can deny! 

652
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:59,780
 Kim Myeong Ho. I need to take revenge on them, too. 

653
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,720
 Did things not go as you planned? 

654
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,280
 You need to catch him red-handed so he cannot escape. 

655
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,350
 It is not over yet. 

656
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,830
 Trip. 

657
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:12,030
 Trip. Trip. 

658
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:13,310
 Oh my... 

659
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,650
 I guess he is not taking a bath. 

660
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:17,830
 Gross bastard. 

661
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:20,780
 Take a bath. You are dirty, all right?

01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,420
 I am going to the bathhouse. Will you come with me? 

663
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:27,740
 There is something I did not get to say. 

664
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,410
 What exactly is wrong with you? 

665
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:33,840
 You were worked up, unlike your usual self. 

666
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:39,230
 Hong Deok Su... 

667
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:43,800
 I said a scar is not a big deal for a man.

01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,970
 You do not have to try to hide it.
