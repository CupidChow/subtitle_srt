1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
   

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,110
   

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:14,050


4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,620
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, you'll feel it  ♫

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,210
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, this overwhelming feeling  ♫

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,350
♫  Shall we match our free steps?  ♫

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,220
Hold it tightly so the sheet does not get washed away.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,800
All right.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,340
What do you think? It goes quickly, does it not?

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,630
Gosh, this is really—

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,990
Hey!

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,620
Hey, hey!

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,690
Hong Deok Su!

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,210
Hong Deok Su!

15
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,480
 Hong Deok Su! 

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,380
 Hong Deok Su! Hong Deok Su! 

17
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,290
 Hong Deok Su. 

18
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,030
Hong Deok Su, wake up!

19
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,050
He opened his eyes.

20
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,980
Are you all right?

21
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,540
He is all right now.

22
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,120
Thank goodness.

23
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,100
We need to move him quickly before he gets colder.

24
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,530
Put him on my back.

25
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,670
Are you not hurt?

26
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,060
I am all right.

27
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,470
I will grab the sheets. Take Hong Deok Su with you.

28
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,950
Be careful.

29
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,510
Su Ra, give me a hand.

30
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,720
Be careful.

31
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,470
Should we change his clothes first?

32
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,630
Bring more dry cloth. I need to dry him.

33
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,420
I will be quick.

34
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,440
H-Hong Deok Su.

35
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,420
No, no, no...

36
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,510
There is no way.

37
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,100
I am mistaken. I am.

38
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,150
Why are you out here? What about Hong Deok Su?

39
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,060
What? No, no!

40
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,740
You can never.

41
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,550
Why?

42
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,300
I need that now.

43
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,160
Need what?

44
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,020
A furnace. Get me a furnace to...

45
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,290
warm him up. It is right there.

46
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,530
Give this to him, then.

47
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,660
The bedsheets...

48
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,490
Our bedsheets.

49
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,470
Where did it go?

50
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,770
Hong Deok Su.

51
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,500
- Where are you going? 
 - The stream. The stream.

52
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,990
- I need to go to the stream. 
 - What?

53
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,550
- Hong Deok Su. 
 - What? I am in a hurry.

54
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,840
You almost drowned to death.

55
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,220
The Gyohwadang test is not important now.

56
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,130
It is as important as my life.

57
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,320
Where are you going in that condition?

58
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,940
Cheon Jun Hwa, I am all right.

59
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,700
I am Hong Deok Su, the true man.

60
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,510
No.

61
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,100
Look, Hong Deok Su!

62
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,150
Is he a man?

63
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,420
What? Did he wake up?

64
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,050
Yongcheonru is worth risking his life for?

65
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,710
What do you mean by that?

66
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,750
He went back to the stream to get the bedsheets in his condition.

67
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,500
Does he care about the Gyohwadang test that much?

68
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,090
Because our families' future depends on it.

69
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,410
I have worked hard my whole life to be successful at Yongcheonru.

70
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,790
I am sure it is the same with Hong Deok Su.

71
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,090
He is trying his hardest even by drowning.

72
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,730
So desperately.

73
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,620
Did you not have a goal you needed to achieve, Jun Hwa?

74
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,540
 The golden key. 

75
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,490
 This is the only key that can open the safe with the ledger. 

76
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,970
 There are two halves that form a set, 

77
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,850
so you cannot unlock it with just one.

78
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,080
 That Cheon hid one-half of the golden key somewhere in Yongcheonru, 

79
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,920
 and he is searching for the other half. 

80
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,940
Hong Deok Su is a woman?

81
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,260
Hong Deok Su.

82
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,120
Hey, Lee Eun Ho.

83
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,330
You seem fine, thankfully.

84
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,430
I just finished putting it away. What are you doing?

85
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,900
No, it is not that...

86
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,630
I told you not to behave so rashly.

87
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,770
You fell in the water and ruined the bedsheets.

88
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,750
Lee Eun Ho, by chance, did you—

89
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,360
What?

90
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,400
Did you lose something important?

91
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,860
You found it, did you not?

92
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,330
What is this?

93
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,080
What is it that you ran over here for as soon as you woke up?

94
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,570
Give it to me, Lee Eun Ho.

95
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,840
What is this, anyway?

96
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,080
It is not an accessory.

97
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,270
What is it for?

98
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,940
My late father willed it to me.

99
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,430
Your father willed it to you?

100
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,880
Yes.

101
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,750
It is the only thing he left behind in this world.

102
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,890
It is also the reason I have to be successful at Yongcheonru.

103
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,710
So, give it back.

104
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,010
Hong Deok Su,

105
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,720
I found that and gave it back to you.

106
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,670
Do not forget that you owe me for this.

107
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,160
Do not try to go anywhere...

108
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,640
until you return the favor.

109
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,970
What?

110
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,800
 Hong Deok Su! 

111
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,230
Is it not past bedtime at Gyohwadang?

112
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,340
Am I not allowed to be here or something?

113
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,500
I mean, I am grateful for last time, too.

114
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,470
By the way, are you still working at this late hour?

115
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,800
It is something you have to learn soon.

116
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,060
Master Cheon has high hopes for you.

117
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,730
I have no worries because I have a capable master innkeeper.

118
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,080
Tell me what you want.

119
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,460
Would you like to make a deal with me?

120
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,400
A merchant never says no to a good deal.

121
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,210
Let me hear how I can benefit from it.

122
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,930
The future inn owner owes you.

123
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,150
Is it not beneficial enough for you?

124
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,370
Continue.

125
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,280
I need 20 bedsheets from Geumuigak.

126
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,960
Got it.

127
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,830
I will send 20 bedsheets to your room immediately.

128
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,650
Right.

129
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,220
Keep this a secret just between us.

130
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,960
You know, right?

131
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,000
Cheon Jun Hwa, did you stay up all night waiting for us?

132
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,290
They were even heavier because they were wet.

133
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,190
We almost died.

134
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,150
Wait...

135
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,750
You washed all these all night? The three of you?

136
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,510
Yes. Thankfully, we found all 20 of them.

137
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,240
- Is that not great? 
 - Yes.

138
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,460
All right, let us go now.

139
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,630
We just need to dry them.

140
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,120
Let us go. What are you doing?

141
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,940
- Let us take a break. 
 - Come on, hurry.

142
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,910
Yes, let us go.

143
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,490
Give it to me. Let me carry it.

144
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,180
It is all right.

145
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,470
 Hey, wait for me! 

146
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,530
The Bottom-Tier Room bastards.

147
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,020
They will go home today.

148
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,940
We have not heard from them yet.

149
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,540
They must be digging the ground now.

150
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,240
What is up with them?

151
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,060
Attention!

152
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:34,530
I will assess the task given by the Head Manager.

153
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,550
Let me see.

154
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,190
- Hey, why do you have your mouth open like that? 
 - Pardon?

155
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,480
Did you lose your mind laundering and ironing all night?

156
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,430
- No, sir. 
 - Well, the Top-Tier Room.

157
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,300
Let me see.

158
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,200
They are clean...

159
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,000
and neatly folded.

160
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,590
- Pass. 
  - Yes! 

161
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,820
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim!

162
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,670
Fail!

163
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,250
Clean and well...

164
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,720
It is not well folded!

165
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,050
Fail!

166
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,740
Next.

167
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,180
Let me see, Bottom-Tier Room.

168
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,260
They are clean.

169
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,940
What is this?

170
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,600
It is not dry enough.

171
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,040
However, the clothesline we used broke.

172
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Of course. You start by saying, "However" today, too.

173
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,770
However...

174
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,830
We had to launder them again all night.

175
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,830
That is why we ran out of time to dry them.

176
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,350
How about you? You speak up, too.

177
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,640
What is your excuse?

178
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,420
We do keep saying "However," however—

179
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,720
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

180
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,120
You are the However Quartet.

181
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,180
You pass today.

182
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,370
- Pardon? 
 - Pardon?

183
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,530
How are they passing when they did not finish the task?

184
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,460
Last night,

185
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,110
someone came to the Yongcheonru Management Department and bought 20 bedsheets.

186
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,010
I was wondering if it was you.

187
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,910
I would have expelled you immediately if you brought new bedsheets.

188
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,900
Some bastards always tried to buy their way in every year.

189
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,980
I am giving you a pass because you worked hard all night.

190
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,430
Do you understand?

191
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,160
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

192
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,740
Yes.

193
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,250
We passed! We passed!

194
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,040
   

195
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,300
   

196
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,640
How could the Bottom-Tier Room pass?

197
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,200
- Quiet. Leave. 
 - This cannot be.

198
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
Apprentice Number 1...

199
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,930
Do you want a piece of advice?

200
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:12,380
If someone cut your clothesline and ruined your bedsheets last night,

201
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,520
what would you have done?

202
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,680
That is—

203
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,300
I am from Ulju, too.

204
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,220
Play fairly if you are from Ulju.

205
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,740
What are you thinking so intently about?

206
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,830
Are you feeling guilty about not helping last night?

207
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,330
We are in the same boat, anyway.

208
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,050
Hong Deok Su!

209
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,500
What? Come here.

210
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,030
Let me massage you with my manly hands.

211
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,240
Manly? You are not massaging me.

212
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,170
Come here.

213
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,100
You must be tired from saving me yesterday.

214
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,970
What do you think? Does it feel good?

215
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,590
Gosh, you—

216
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,580
Gosh, my stomach! My stomach is suddenly upset.

217
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,680
I will get going now.

218
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,460
Wait...

219
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,330
He should not run if his stomach is upset.

220
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,320
What?

221
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,280
What does that mean?

222
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,200
Give me a good massage with your manly hands.

223
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,310
I see.

224
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,400
Shame on you! How dare you?

225
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,990
I told you not to behave rashly.

226
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,230
When did I behave rashly?

227
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,920
You! Y-Yesterday, you—

228
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,450
You will be sorry if you cause trouble again like yesterday.

229
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,800
Gosh, my stomach is upset.

230
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,000
My stomach is upset! My stomach is upset!

231
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,150
My stomach is upset!

232
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,990
He does not have manly hands.

233
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,140
Put it up properly.

234
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,590
   

235
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,810
It looks good now.

236
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,980
Yes, you worked hard coming all the way here. 
    

237
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,710
You can relax and rest today.

238
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,330
What is all this food?

239
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,090
It is Yongcheonru's signature meal.

240
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,090
It is Dragon's Feast, a meal for special guests.

241
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,530
Applause!

242
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,250
You are allowed to drink just today.

243
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,820
Drink moderately and enjoy your time with your classmates.

244
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,120
No!

245
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,580
Let us just have fun today!

246
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,750
Yes, thank you!

247
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,260
Okay, where should we start?

248
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,050
Yes, this one.

249
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,740
Jun Hwa, your stomach is upset.

250
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,250
- Do not overdo it. 
 - What are you talking about?

251
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,590
Oh, you are right.

252
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,380
Hong Deok Su, you should be careful, too.

253
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,730
Your stomach is very upset.

254
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,640
Sit further apart! There is plenty of room.

255
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,790
Until you return the favor fully,

256
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,860
you will not be free from me.

257
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,430
The rice is good.

258
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,430
Yes, drink up! Eat.

259
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,070
- Thank you for the meal! 
 - Sure.

260
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,530
- Shall we start? 
 - Yes.

261
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Something seems off.

262
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,500
You always need to beware of a favor without a reason.

263
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,990
Drink! Drink up.

264
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
Upper-Tier Room!

265
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,930
Yes. We can drink that, right?

266
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,790
Give me. Give that to me.

267
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,400
Hand me a cup.

268
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,570
Hold on.

269
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,800
Is this not suspicious?

270
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,250
Maybe you get a penalty if you do not finish the food.

271
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,570
Eat quickly. Eat quickly.

272
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,920
Bottom-Tier Room.

273
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,250
Why are you not drinking?

274
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,780
Do you not know what this wine is?

275
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,740
This is 100... No, 200 years old.

276
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,190
It is a precious wine you can only have at Yongcheonru.

277
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,690
Let me pour you some.

278
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,290
All right.

279
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,030
There.

280
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,990
What?

281
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,170
Hong Deok Su, you cannot get drunk.

282
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,900
What are you doing? I am Hong Deok Su, the true man.

283
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,580
- Yes, Hong Deok Su, the true man. Have another cup. 
 - All right.

284
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,970
Yes, drink up!

285
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,520
Give me that, Hong Deok Su.

286
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,070
What are you all doing?

287
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,340
The However Quartet seems very tight.

288
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,100
Yes. Today is a happy day. Drink all you want.

289
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,850
 Yes, sir. 

290
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,450
What...

291
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,340
I really feel like drinking today.

292
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,290
What are you doing? Come on.

293
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,000
Did you two like drinking that much?

294
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,500
Give me more. Give me more. Give me more.

295
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,330
- Let us do this. 
 - Give me that.

296
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,630
Gosh, what are you guys doing?

297
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,190
Hey, are you drunk?

298
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,590
- Give me more. 
 - Give me more.

299
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,990
We are out of wine.

300
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,910
Here is more.

301
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,690
L-Let me...

302
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,730
- Cheers! 
 - Yes!

303
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,330
Drink!

304
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,360
What?

305
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,950
- Are you all right, Jun Hwa? 
 - Give it to me.

306
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,820
Get it together.

307
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,910
Lee Eun Ho looks less drunk. It is a relief.

308
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,610
I beat Cheon Jun Hwa.

309
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,940
Hey, are you all right?

310
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,550
Lee Eun Ho!

311
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,900
Aigoo! Hey, Cheon Jun Hwa.

312
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,130
Hong Deok Su...

313
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,330
Red rice cake and water...

314
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,350
- What is he saying? 
 - Round and red...

315
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,180
How can you laugh now?

316
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,810
- Me? 
 - Yes, you, Kim Myeong Ho.

317
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,560
Myeong Ho,

318
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,580
to be honest, I am three years older than you.

319
00:29:52,580 --> 00:30:00,010
I had at least 3,285 more meals than you. You little—

320
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,550
Gosh, so cute.

321
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,590
Hey, are you out of your mind?

322
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,460
Du Shik, Seok Sam, you should talk, too.

323
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,650
Do not suck up to him and talk behind his back.

324
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,200
- Do you not agree, Myeong Ho? 
 - When did I?

325
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,410
When did I?

326
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,820
Slap him.

327
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,230
Why are you slapping so hard?

328
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,470
Attention!

329
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,890
All right. Did you all enjoy the food?

330
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,430
 - Yes.  
 - Good.

331
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,710
- The test starts now since you enjoyed your meal. 
 - Pardon?

332
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,530
Pardon?

333
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,460
- However— 
 - Be quiet.

334
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,610
Jang Suk Su, the head chef, will quiz you himself.

335
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,210
Applause.

336
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,680
- Hey, wake up the one who passed out. 
 - Oh, yes.

337
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,470
Yongcheonru's innkeepers need to drink moderately.

338
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,780
You little...

339
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,060
The Culinary Department's quiz is...

340
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,380
about the table spread.

341
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,750
You can recreate the spread you had just now.

342
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,160
You cannot get a plate or a garnish wrong.

343
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,140
Ji Yeon Hui, the chief innkeeper, will be evaluating.

344
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,340
I am looking for the perfect spread for the guests.

345
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,350
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - Be quiet.

346
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,700
- Wake up! 
 - Get it together.

347
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,060
Start!

348
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,260
Hey, take this with you.

349
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,450
Let me see...

350
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,910
To the left.

351
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,060
Hey, wait for me.

352
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,710
Two more.

353
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,510
Move, move!

354
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,830
- Hong Deok Su. 
 - Put it here. Put it here.

355
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,090
The abalone is...

356
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,840
The second round!

357
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,590
- Are we not friends? 
 - We are.

358
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,370
One more round.

359
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,450
Tteokgalbi and... 
  (T/N: Rice cake and short ribs) 

360
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,680
The gujeolpan was in the middle. 
  (T/N: Nine delicacies) 

361
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,060
I have not had a single meal.

362
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,690
Make it quick, please.

363
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,210
- Galbijjim? 
 - In the back. 
  (T/N: Braised short ribs) 

364
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,180
- How about this? 
 - On the outside.

365
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,270
 That one. That one. That one. 

366
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,940
I remember only seven dishes.

367
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,020
I think this is right.

368
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,070
The steamed abalone!

369
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,750
The steamed abalone goes on the right.

370
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,830
- H-Here? 
 - Not there.

371
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,360
On the right of the sinseollo. 
  (T/N: Royal hot pot) 

372
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,840
H-Here?

373
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,550
Tteokgalbi.

374
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,760
This?

375
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,030
Below the sinseollo.

376
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,890
- Below? 
 - N-No.

377
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,250
Here? Like here?

378
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,320
What?

379
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,720
Lee Eun Ho, are you sobering up?

380
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,580
I miss you, Father.

381
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,310
Who is this?

382
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,120
I think this is pretty much done.

383
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,370
We can trust him, right?

384
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,430
Hey, hold on.

385
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,910
- Where are you going? 
 - Wait a moment.

386
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,340
Where are you going?

387
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,250
Where is Hong Deok Su? Wake up.

388
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,810
When is he coming back?

389
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,290
Where do you think one of them went?

390
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,660
It is almost time. They are done for.

391
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,710
Move, move, move.

392
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,810
Hong Deok Su.

393
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,280
I will start the evaluation now.

394
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,340
I cannot even call this a spread.

395
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,070
Fail!

396
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,100
Where are the sesame seeds? You are missing the garnishes.

397
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,990
Where are the sauce lids?

398
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,670
Fail!

399
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,890
It is perfect. You are the first team to pass.

400
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,290
- Thank you. 
 - Hyeongnim!

401
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,880
You really are the best, Myeong Ho.

402
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,310
Bring out the pork. The pork.

403
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,570
Who put this soup bowl here?

404
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,640
I-I did.

405
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,020
Number 30, Hong Deok Su.

406
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,610
Is there a reason you did this?

407
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,360
I wanted to serve warm soup to the guest.

408
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,270
The soup we were served earlier was warm.

409
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,410
Pass!

410
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,170
Pass?

411
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,630
We passed!

412
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,230
The Top-Tier Room only got the answer right,

413
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,090
but the Bottom-Tier Room treated the guests too.

414
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,960
Treating the guests by paying attention to the bowls' temperature

415
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,240
is what the Yongcheonru innkeepers need to do.

416
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,740
You told us to do this—

417
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,710
Shut up.

418
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,120
Welcome, guests.

419
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,830
   

420
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,370
Gosh, wake up.

421
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,430
Why are you so heavy?

422
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,840
How heavy.

423
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,650
I almost died.

424
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,950
It hurts.

425
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,970
I will drink it. I will.

426
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,280
No, I will.

427
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,170
 I will drink it. 

428
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,580
Gyohwadang is awaiting its last test.

429
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,590
Did Jun Hwa get his act together?

430
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,380
He gets along with his roommates.

431
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,150
I saw a lot of unexpected sides of him.

432
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,140
He will become more like a successor

433
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,180
once he gets a taste of power.

434
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,670
How about Prince Mu Yeong?

435
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,340
Nothing notable has happened.

436
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,960
Are you thinking of supporting him?

437
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,840
I will see how he and Jun Hwa get along.

438
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,270
If they do get along well,

439
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,040
we will abandon the Minister of Defense, then.

440
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,770
Pardon?

441
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,590
You returned the golden key?

442
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,090
Did you drink?

443
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,940
I heard Master Cheon's golden key comes in two halves.

444
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,000
But what I saw yesterday was just one half.

445
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,500
But why did you give it back?

446
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,600
He should stop being suspicious of me to find out

447
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,800
where he got half of the golden key.

448
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,230
Beom Ho, there is something you need to do.

449
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,350
Ask me anything.

450
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,700
Look into this man, Hong Deok Su.

451
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,450
Find out who his father was,

452
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,630
where he grew up, and how.

453
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,220
Look into him closely.

454
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,620
Yes.

455
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,030
Eun Ho, did you sober up a bit?

456
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,500
This is nothing to me.

457
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,370
Did you see where Hong Deok Su went, by chance?

458
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,550
Oh, Hong Deok Su?

459
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,700
What about him?

460
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,650
Well, he went to wash himself but has not returned even though it has been a while.

461
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,150
I will go look for him.

462
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,110
No, no. It is all right.

463
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,650
I will look for him. You do not have to go.

464
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,970
- No, I will go— 
 - It is all right.

465
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,300
You should rest a bit.

466
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,180
Why are you suddenly doing this, Jun Hwa?

467
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,890
Do you, by chance...

468
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,580
N-No, I do not.

469
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,820
I was just—

470
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,670
I respect it.

471
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,560
Respect what?

472
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,460
Have you not sobered up yet?

473
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,030
Aigoo, so tired.

474
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,710
I am so tired.

475
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,250
My whole body is achy...

476
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,020
because I worked harder on this one.

477
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,960
But we passed the test, and I am in a good mood.

478
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,350
So, I will give you a pass.

479
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,710
Gosh, I am so tired.

480
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,430
Do not spread out too much, Hong Deok Su.

481
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,080
Gosh. Go Su Ra and I...

482
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,310
got so tired carrying you two.

483
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,130
Lee Eun Ho,

484
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,650
I returned the favor for saving me, all right?

485
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,430
Let me rest a bit, too.

486
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,850
How nice.

487
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,880
You must be happy about something, Your Excellency.

488
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,070
I have not seen you in a while.

489
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,180
What brings you here?

490
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,460
Did your knee heal completely

491
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,750
since you visited Prince Eun Seong?

492
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,740
The Master Innkeeper cared for you well instead of me.

493
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,170
What?

494
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,480
Yes,

495
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,070
she did.

496
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:45,770
Thanks to the gold bars you sent through Seol Mae Hwa,

497
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:49,350
the crown prince proclamation ceremony preparation is all set.

498
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,720
Thank you.

499
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,820
 What about the gold bars for the Minister of Defense? 

500
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,560
 It is not time yet. 

501
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,410
 Wait a bit. 

502
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,940
I am glad it was helpful.

503
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,430
Prince Seon Yang will soon be the crown prince.

504
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,130
I am looking forward to the ceremony.

505
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,110
I am not sure.

506
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,490
Will His Majesty start the ceremony order

507
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,200
before Prince Mu Yeong returns from Onyang?

508
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,430
He will.

509
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,140
I already made a plan for it.

510
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:50,230
 But a belonging of the royal family was found at the scene. 

511
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,820
You must have a different idea.

512
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,870
You really know nothing.

513
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,330
Everything will go the way I want.

514
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,910
Stop testing both Princes Mu Yeong and Eun Seong

515
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:21,440
and devote yourself to one now.

516
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,640
Coming! Coming! Here you go.

517
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,120
What took you so long?

518
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,020
I am sorry. I am busy, you know.

519
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,300
You are not busy.

520
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,120
Gosh, welcome! You came.

521
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,430
Did you say this is Hong Deok Su's residence?

522
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,060
He lived here since he was born, apparently.

523
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,880
His late father was a gambler, and he died when he was little.

524
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,500
His mother must have raised him while paying off his debt.

525
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,170
All right. Here is the beef.

526
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,700
What is this? This is all of it?

527
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,250
All right, I will give you a lot.

528
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,640
Eat slowly. Eat slowly.

529
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,000
Thank you for the food.

530
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,060
- Come again. Did you enjoy it? 
 - It was delicious.

531
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,410
- Gosh, thank you. 
 - I will come again.

532
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,740
- Yes, come again. 
  - Over here! 

533
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,610
 What is it? 

534
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,550
Ma'am, I will have a plate of beef.

535
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,590
Yes, sir.

536
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,360
Eat plenty.

537
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,170
Here you go.

538
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,600
You are so busy. Do you work alone?

539
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,460
My son used to help me,

540
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,230
but he went far away to work to support me.

541
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,640
You must be proud.

542
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,270
Of course.

543
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,300
Enjoy your meal.

544
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,200
Just him and his mother lived here?

545
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:29,360
This is our first day off. Are you not going out?

546
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,050
You have fun outside, Cheon Jun Hwa.

547
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,580
It means Chief Innkeeper Ji Yeon Hui is closest to the Master Innkeeper.

548
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,560
Right?

549
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,480
Is it your dream to become the Master Innkeeper?

550
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,190
Gosh, the fruit flies.

551
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,430
I will get going, then.

552
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,620
Yes, have fun.

553
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,210
See you.

554
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,560
Right!

555
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,480
Bring pumpkin yeot on the way back. 
  (T/N: Korean toffee) 

556
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,270
Are you not going out, Su Ra?

557
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,670
I have nowhere to go.

558
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,580
I have no money, either.

559
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,610
Gosh. Me, too.

560
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,730
I became the head of the family since my father passed away.

561
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,390
Well...

562
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,540
my father passed early, too.

563
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,110
We really need to become successful.

564
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,470
Do we not, Su Ra?

565
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,100
Yes, let us promise.

566
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,600
Promise.

567
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,050
Anyway, the thing is...

568
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,300
Is it just the two of you?

569
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,790
Yes, we are the only ones left in the Bottom-Tier Room.

570
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:02,290
This is great. Would you two like to work?

571
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,890
 Pardon? 

572
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,030
- Gosh, come on. 
 - I am not so sure.

573
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:09,480
- You will get a point. 
  - We will do it. 

574
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,260
   

575
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,780
Who are these guests that they even called us to help?

576
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,370
Who cares?

577
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,910
The guys will be happy if we get points, right?

578
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,680
What?

579
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,390
Who cares?

580
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,380
We work so hard. We can be in the first place, right?

581
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:41,510
Of course. We have to.

582
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,170
Are you angry?

583
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,240
Buy yeot! I have yeot!

584
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,360
 Right! Bring pumpkin yeot on the way back. 

585
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,410
Gosh, why would I do this for Hong Deok Su?

586
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,710
Did you come out empty-handed?

587
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:25,000
Aigoo. I cannot walk because I am starving.

588
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,010
I will take one geun of the pumpkin yeot.

589
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,550
One geun? 
  (T/N: 600 g or 21,16 oz) 

590
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,030
Yes, sir! One geun.

591
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,220
I will give you extra.

592
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:50,560
You noticed the five-colored jeonggwa, the bestseller among the women of Hanyang.

593
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,220
Would you like some?

594
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,890
What did you say?

595
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,280
When a lover gifts a woman these,

596
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,250
the ladies just melt away.

597
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,740
No. What lover?

598
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,970
I have none.

599
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,430
You are so handsome.

600
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,610
Why is that?

601
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,610
Gosh, should I...

602
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,050
tell your fortune using yeot?

603
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,000
Just pack up the pumpkin yeot for me.

604
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,110
Yes.

605
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,510
All right. Here, here, here.

606
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:51,800
Gosh, you definitely are meant to be,

607
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,140
but things are all tangled up.

608
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,690
Gosh, I said I did not want to do this.

609
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,980
What? Lee Eun Ho.

610
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:10,000
Who is this...

611
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,170
He is my friend.

612
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,370
A very close hyeongnim of mine.

613
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:20,930
Hyeongnim.

614
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,820
Little brother? Yes.

615
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,910
Would you like to eat some yeot, little brother? 
  (T/N: "Eat yeot" is a slang for "F*ck you") 

616
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,800
He does not want it because he had a lot of soup.

617
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,850
I will enjoy these, then.

618
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,750
Would you like to check the yeot, too, sir?

619
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,300
Do not do it. He is a hack.

620
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,820
You have the best of luck!

621
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:06,170
What you are looking for is very close to you.

622
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:09,350
But a lot of people want it, too.

623
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:11,930
You need to hurry.

624
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,230
You are a total hack.

625
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,820
You said I was all tangled up.

626
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:23,640
You just need to untangle things, sir.

627
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,980
Relationships take work, you know.

628
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:39,670
You have the best of luck. You must be happy.

629
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,070
Do I go back to where things got tangled up?

630
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,100
Nothing is tangled up, though.

631
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,940
Do you believe what the yeot seller said?

632
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,600
How stuck up you are.

633
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,330
Listening to him cannot hurt us.

634
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,920
Why did you buy so much of that?

635
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,610
This?

636
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:00,660
Hong Deok Su wanted me to bring pumpkin yeot.

637
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:09,860
Are you very close to Hong Deok Su?

638
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,180
Listen.

639
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,290
Speaking of Hong Deok Su...

640
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,110
What about him?

641
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,830
I mean...

642
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,000
I was wondering what he and Go Su Ra are doing.

643
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,500
It feels awkward to walk with you alone for once.

644
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,400
Wait for me.

645
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,220
Hey, Hong Deok Su and Go Su Ra!

646
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:03,120
- What? 
 - Instructor Bang asked us to bring snacks.

647
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,220
You bring them, then. Why are you telling us?

648
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,470
I do not know.

649
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:11,080
Ask Instructor Bang yourself.

650
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,670
Right. Let us make it quick.

651
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,340
He asked one of you to peel onions.

652
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,840
Onions?

653
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,680
Will we get a point for that, too?

654
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,560
I am sure.

655
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,500
Hong Deok Su, get moving.

656
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,450
- I will go. 
 - Okay.

657
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,110
See you.

658
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,220
   

659
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,150
Put the candle here.

660
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,310
Bo Bae.

661
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,530
Yes.

662
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:28,870
You put the clothes and accessories for the guest in the closet, right?

663
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:29,870
Yes.

664
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,960
No male innkeepers are allowed near Jakyakjae.

665
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,230
The Master Innkeeper cares a lot about this guest.

666
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,230
I will keep that in mind.

667
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:42,450
He told you to bring snacks from Jakyakjae kitchen.

668
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,400
He said to take a deep bow and greet loudly if you see a guest.

669
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:52,550
Where are you going?

670
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,750
I am on my way to get the snacks.

671
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,780
Why should both of you do that?

672
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,110
You go get the snacks.

673
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,940
You go ahead and peel the onions.

674
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,310
Okay, got it.

675
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,800
Who are you?

676
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,470
I am an apprentice from Gyohwadang.

677
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,470
I am here for the snacks—

678
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,520
 The guest is coming! 

679
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,980
W-Why...

680
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,450
Why are you doing this?

681
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,280
- Go in! 
 - What?

682
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:17,680
Will Myeong Ho forgive us if we get a point by peeling them?

683
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:23,680
And who eats so much of this spicy stuff that we are peeling all these?

684
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,780
Sang Wu, did you not hear?

685
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,050
A guest is coming to Jakyakjae today.

686
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:37,850
That old man apparently only wants the female innkeepers

687
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:40,700
to care for him.

688
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,290
He screams whenever he sees a man. He is all about women.

689
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,050
He is the worst of womanizers.

690
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,610
- You scared me. 
 - What?

691
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:54,350
The womanizer screams at men?

692
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,870
Jakyakjae?

693
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:01,340
What did you say? A man entered Jakyakjae?

694
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,000
A man? Who let a man into Jakyakjae?

695
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,500
I hid him in the closet room for now.

696
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,240
He is very observant.

697
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,840
If he gets caught, all of us will be dead.

698
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,840
My apologies.

699
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,940
Where are you going in a hurry?

700
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,390
Where is the Lord?

701
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,910
I helped him inside.

702
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:30,100
Did you prepare the bedroom and bathroom properly?

703
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,450
Of course, ma'am.

704
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:37,190
I should check beforehand so he does not get upset.

705
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,720
Lead the way.

706
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,190
Pardon?

707
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:52,490
Who is coming that they are hiding me like this?

708
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,720
It is slippery here.

709
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,130
Wipe it more vigorously.

710
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:13,710
 Yes, ma'am. 

711
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,770
How about here?

712
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,310
Hong Deok Su is in trouble.

713
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:39,600
 Hong Deok Su? 

714
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,220
Jakyakjae... The perverted old man and Hong Deok Su...

715
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,670
Speak clearly.

716
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:45,850
Hong Deok Su went where?

717
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:49,430
So, he apparently gets furious at male innkeepers.

718
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:52,040
But Hong Deok Su went there.

719
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:58,460
A perverted old man...

720
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,790
Shit.

721
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:06,250
 This is a closet room. 

722
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,810
You do not have to check this room—

723
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:27,130
A light pink skirt and top are his favorite.

724
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:30,860
Yes. We know about his preference.

725
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,830
What about his preference?

726
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:36,070
Is there a problem with it?

727
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:37,390
Of course not.

728
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:40,520
Nothing is impossible at Yongcheonru.

729
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,690
Here is...

730
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,850
the only one of the sets that was imported from Hanyang.

731
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:03,660
Even the Queen has not been able to get it yet.

732
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,240
The artisan created the gold stitch one by one—

733
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,570
All right, fine. Bring that to me later.

734
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,490
Are they gone...

735
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,200
or not?

736
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,640
Why am I hiding?

737
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,150
Are they gone or not?

738
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,740
What do we do now?

739
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,570
   

740
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,450
What is Hong Min Shik's deed for?

741
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,990
I am thinking of handing it to a land agent.

742
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,020
You took it by killing Hong Min Shik. Why?

743
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,030
It has been over a decade. It is time to let go.

744
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,030
Do you know of his daughter's whereabouts?

745
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:15,490
Hong Jae On, that child...

746
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,660
must have died then.

747
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:25,360
The child they found floating down at Mapo Dock must have been her.

748
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:30,510
But we should not stop looking for her.

749
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,920
That is that.

750
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,800
Did you say the Lord is arriving today?

751
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,200
I am about to greet him at Jakyakjae.

752
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,240
I will be back.

753
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,770
Hold on.

754
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:54,490
I will join you this time.

755
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,770
He apparently dislikes men.

756
01:05:57,770 --> 01:06:00,870
You never accompanied me to greet him.

757
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,000
He cannot refuse to see Yongcheonru's owner, could he?

758
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,680
I will get the palanquin ready.

759
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,880
 Hong Deok Su? 

760
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:26,690
How dare you come in here?

761
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,200
I was told to get the snacks—

762
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,950
Shut your mouth!

763
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:33,200
If he finds out a man came in here,

764
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,360
both of us will be dead.

765
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,560
What?

766
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,360
I need to find a solution. A solution.

767
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:59,380
The stepping stone is shaky. Secure it.

768
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:39,300
♫  The passing years say nothing at all  ♫

769
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:49,500
♫  Like sorrowful words of a song, scattered in the wind  ♫

770
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:54,390
♫  On nights when the dark comes calling  ♫

771
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:58,820
♫  Oh moonlight, silently weeping  ♫

772
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:02,230
♫  If the shadow of fate casts over me  ♫

773
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,370
Hong Deok Su?

774
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:06,360
♫  Light up this endless road for me  ♫

775
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:12,260
♫  Rise again  ♫

776
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:16,160
♫  Even if I crumble and fall  ♫

777
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,990
♫  Embracing the bitter scars in my heart  ♫

778
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:27,030
♫  Oh, flowing tears, remember for me  ♫

779
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,780
They looked for her five years ago and gave up.

780
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,740
Someone posted it again.

781
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:44,010
The government has never offered this much looking for anyone.

782
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:46,120
It is 100 nyang. One hundred nyang.

783
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,520
Who is she that they are offering that much reward?

784
01:08:52,650 --> 01:09:01,890


785
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:07,630
   

786
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,460
♫  I walk alone on this thorny path  ♫

787
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:20,630
♫  Questions etched deeply into my shattered heart  ♫

788
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:25,070
♫  Rekindling the flame of my frozen soul  ♫

789
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:29,830
♫  Facing the dark night that crashes upon me  ♫

790
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:32,430
♫  When the world keeps, keeps, keeps  ♫

791
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:33,790
 Where are you going? 

792
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:35,670
 This is a present we prepared for you. 

793
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,100
 Just do as I say. 

794
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,190
 Is Hong Deok Su supposed to be the present? 

795
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:42,890
 None of us is responsible for what happens once we go over this fence. 

796
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:47,110
 But we cannot let the perverted man have Hong Deok Su. 

797
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:49,490
 Where are you going, Lee Eun Ho? 

798
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:51,940
 Did you think you could save Hong Deok Su 

799
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,820
 by climbing this fence and eavesdropping? 

800
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:57,130
 Did you not think your actions would put him in greater danger? 

801
01:09:57,130 --> 01:10:00,670
 If you want to change Yongcheonru, become the owner of it. 

802
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:02,840
 You will have to help, Master Cheon. 

803
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,450
 Of course, Your Highness. 

804
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,090
 If the Defense Minister's niece and Prince Mu Yeong get married, 

805
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:10,480
 Prince Seon Yang will be selected as the crown prince. 

806
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,320
 Is something going on between you and Hong Deok Su? 

807
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,250
 I just tried to protect what I was supposed to. 

808
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,230
 What did you try to protect? 

809
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:19,730
 The same thing you tried to protect tonight. 

810
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:22,800
 Has anyone seen Hong Deok Su bathing? 

811
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,620
 He also refused to take his top off, then. 

812
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:30,250
 - Could he be... 
 - Lord, here is the present from Yongcheonru. 

813
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,650
 - Take your clothes off now. 
 - Pardon? 

814
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:35,270
 Take off your clothes right now! 

815
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:40,910
♫  When the world keeps, keeps, keeps  ♫ 
 ♫  Pushing endlessly against me  ♫
