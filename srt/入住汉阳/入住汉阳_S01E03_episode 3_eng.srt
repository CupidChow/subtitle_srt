1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,710
   

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,640
   

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,680
We win if you get a double now!

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,900
There is no way he will get a double.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,080
There is no way.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,980
Hold on!

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,150
What? Are you losing confidence?

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,160
There is no going back in gambling.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,690
Go ahead and take your top off.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,080
It is too suspicious.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,960
You are hiding something in there, are you not?

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:51,000


13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,350
Come on!

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,430
Do you have to do that, Lee Eun Ho?

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,890
Look at him.

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,390
Hey, how satisfying!

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,050
Let us strip and toss.

18
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,080
What do you mean by strip?

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,370
Let us just keep going, all right?

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,050
You are nitpicking because you were being pushed into a corner.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,530
Okay, let us strip.

22
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,490
Take everything off.

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,830
It is a true game of Ssangpae only when you strip.

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,770
- Let us strip! 
 - No, it is all right.

25
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,350
- Let us strip. 
 - No, no...

26
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,640
- Take it off! 
 - Do not.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,350
No!

28
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,250
Let us take it all off.

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,240
No, no, no.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Let us strip.

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,290
All right!

32
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,750
Well, well, well.

33
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,850
Here we go.

34
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:01,260
 Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! 

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,550
It is a double!

36
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,880
We did it! We did it!

37
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,410
All right. It is your turn now.

38
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,020
Will you not get undressed?

39
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,250
Take it off and toss.

40
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,820
You need to toss now.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,920
You...

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,330
 I found the culprit! 

43
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,690
   

44
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,180
I have never seen a finer work in my life.

45
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,740
I want to capture this bastard immediately,

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,550
put him in my studio, and make him work for me.

47
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,370
Number thirty?

48
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,790
   

49
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,440
Catch him!

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,580
What is he doing? You!

51
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,310
Catch him!

52
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,620
What are you doing?

53
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,510
   

54
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,460
This is all my fault!

55
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,480
You bastards. You should have played quietly, at least.

56
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,210
The noise could have reached Yongcheonru's main building.

57
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,930
Who is it? Which one of you started this?

58
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,270
It was not us.

59
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,140
The bastards from the Bottom-tier Room first—

60
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,070
It was me.

61
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,400
He said there are rankings in the red card numbers,

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,200
and only the ones from Ulju have the privilege of entering the Top-Tier Room.

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,810
So, I suggested we check if they were qualified.

64
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,560
That is correct. Number 28 suggested it first.

65
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,690
So, are you saying you are solely responsible for all this?

66
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,510
I am responsible because I agreed to it.

67
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,870
I will also be responsible since I tossed the die.

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,200
Bottom-Tier Room, did you think I would praise your loyalty if you protested as a group?

69
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,300
- You are all receiving penalties. 
 - However...

70
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,900
However, it was a fair game.

71
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,420
Fair game? F-Fair?

72
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,860
Yes.

73
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,580
We played Ssangpae, but it was not merely to gamble—

74
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,210
It was a fair deal between...

75
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,780
...the Top-Tier Room and the Bottom-Tier Room.

76
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,610
Yes.

77
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,710
It was a consensual game.

78
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,610
Hey, keep your mouth shut!

79
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,020
I apologize for the disturbance.

80
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,510
The Top-Tier Room was unfairly tricked.

81
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,900
The Bottom-Tier Room insists it was a fair deal.

82
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,640
Apprentice Number 30.

83
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,480
Yes.

84
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,040
I am Number 30, Hong Deok Su.

85
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,010
Did you say it was a fair game, not merely gambling?

86
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,970
- Yes. 
 - How can you prove that you are right?

87
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,640
Firstly,

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,160
the deal was not forced.

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,330
Secondly,

90
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,080
the participants agreed to the conditions.

91
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,670
Thirdly, the transaction items were fair.

92
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,820
Is this not how you make a deal as well, Master Innkeeper?

93
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,100
Hong Deok Su, how dare you challenge her?

94
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,560
The apprentices gambled in the Gyohwadang dormitory and insist they were in the right?

95
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,890
Are you out of your minds? Do you all want to die?

96
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,810
How crass!

97
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,570
Master Innkeeper, just expel them.

98
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,770
It is a bit of a shame to let them go like this.

99
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,610
You should forgive them just this once.

100
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,530
No, there is no need to listen anymore.

101
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,670
- Expel them immediately. 
 - Hey...

102
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,050
 Hold on, Master Innkeeper. 

103
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,750
We cannot be expelled. We are from the Ulju Merchant.

104
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,150
Does the Ulju Merchant own the Top-Tier Room?

105
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,550
The Ulju Merchant has been using the Top-Tier Room for generations.

106
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,820
Yongcheonru decides who belongs in the Top-Tier Room.

107
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,310
Number 30,

108
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,590
do you have anything else to say?

109
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,030
We all are...

110
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,800
apprentices who came to Gyohwadang to learn.

111
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,360
Please...

112
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,300
do not expel us.

113
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,030
Master Innkeeper,

114
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,540
please be generous to us.

115
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,240
Fine.

116
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,030
Everyone learned a necessary lesson today.

117
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,310
Therefore, I will forgive you.

118
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:57,720
Remember today's lesson and grow into someone worthy of being Yongcheonru's attendant.

119
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,460
Master Innkeeper, is there a reason you are not arresting the forger of the red card?

120
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,350
Wait for now. I have a plan.

121
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,940
I have not liked an apprentice this much in a while.

122
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,520
These days, children are too clever and smart.

123
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,970
He allows the apprentices to talk back to us.

124
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,260
Bang Sa Seon, that man is a fool.

125
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,050
Number 30.

126
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,370
Hong Deok Su.

127
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,360
   

128
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,680
We would have won if you had tossed the die at the end.

129
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,610
It truly is a shame.

130
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,880
I know.

131
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,130
It truly is a shame.

132
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,080
Shame, my foot.

133
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,290
We almost got expelled.

134
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,690
Hong Deok Su, cheer up.

135
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,370
Nothing bad happened. It is all right.

136
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,160
Thank you.

137
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,680
Deok Su... you did not play Ssangpae because you wanted the Top-Tier Room.

138
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,550
Eun Ho, because they looked down on my family,

139
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,740
you volunteered to provoke the Ulju kids. Thank you.

140
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,790
That was not exactly the only reason.

141
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,700
How about me?

142
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,570
You also stepped forward and said you were responsible.

143
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,790
Someday, I will have your back, too.

144
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,520
Go Su Ra, you said you would never be in the same boat as us.

145
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,350
What a sweet love confession.

146
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,130
What a fellow.

147
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,410
A true man is supposed to return favors.

148
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,710
Go Su Ra!

149
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,110
Let go of me.

150
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,570
Be careful.

151
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,060
We belong in the Bottom-Tier Room together.

152
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,580
Do not come. Do not come.

153
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,960
We are roommates.

154
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,910
Stop that.

155
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,910
What are you plotting?

156
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,420
You fooled Go Su Ra, but not me.

157
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,300
You instigated the Top-Tier Room apprentices to play Ssangpae, did you not?

158
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,940
How dare you?

159
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,600
Are you saying I provoked them?

160
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,850
Did you not? To get me to take off—

161
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,220
Are you... hiding something, by chance?

162
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,790
What do you mean, hiding?

163
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,860
I am not.

164
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,560
- You are the suspicious one, Lee Eun Ho. 
 - How so?

165
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,920
The way you speak. "How dare you?"

166
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,860
You say that whenever I do something.

167
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,420
What are you, a prince or something?

168
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,930
Should we not be memorizing the Annals of Yongcheonru—

169
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,530
Should we?

170
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,810
We found out who forged the red card.

171
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,570
It was Number 30, a boy named Hong Deok Su.

172
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,480
Is that so?

173
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,460
But Hong Deok Su and Young Master Jun Hwa share a room.

174
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,970
Hong Deok Su?

175
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,280
Prince Mu Yeong is in that room, is he not?

176
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,000
Should I send him to the Investigation Bureau immediately?

177
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,520
Just leave him.

178
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,730
The torn red card is not the only thing found at the murder scene.

179
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,690
They say a sword with a dragon carving was found there.

180
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,660
A sword with a dragon carving must... belong to the royal family.

181
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:00,140
If the Minister of Defense gets the sword, he will do whatever it takes.

182
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,710
Where was this... sword found, did you say?

183
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,310
It was found with the dead gambler who had his red card stolen.

184
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,090
Are you saying...

185
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,620
he was murdered because of the red card?

186
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,160
Yes.

187
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,840
I brought this because you told me to report anything relevant.

188
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,850
Yongcheonru?

189
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,350
   

190
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:30,310
Prince Seon Yang's 10th birthday is coming up soon.

191
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,210
Even if we start preparing now,

192
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,670
not much time is left until the crown prince proclamation ceremony.

193
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,960
Her Highness the Queen is worried sick.

194
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:04,430
Your Majesty, the crown prince position cannot be left empty.

195
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,680
Prince Mu Yeong went to Onyang to recuperate. 
  (T/N: Hot springs complex) 

196
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,340
Yet you want me to prepare for the proclamation ceremony?

197
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,460
Do you not care about Prince Mu Yeong because he is not the Queen's son?

198
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,150
The country is suffering from famine and plague.

199
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,070
At times like this,

200
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:28,810
you need to strengthen the country and have a strong crown prince.

201
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,040
Please give me your royal command now.

202
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,670
I am not sure if I should tell you this or not.

203
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,480
What is it you wish to say?

204
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:00,210
Recently, there was a brutal murder in Seochon.

205
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,220
It has not been confirmed yet,

206
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,320
but a belonging of the royal family was found at the scene.

207
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,540
Prince Mu Yeong was in Onyang on the day of the murder,

208
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,390
so it could not have been him.

209
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:31,380
Someone must have done this to frame the royal family.

210
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,540
I will investigate thoroughly so it does not harm you.

211
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,940
A rat is using the front gate in broad daylight instead of a hole in the back.

212
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,200
This country must be failing.

213
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,140
How dare you enter here using a palanquin?

214
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,970
My apologies.

215
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,270
I cannot get off because my leg is injured.

216
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,210
Please forgive me, Your Excellency.

217
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,450
His Majesty is not in a good mood. Choose another day.

218
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,640
No, it is not that.

219
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
I am here for something else today.

220
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,030
Something else?

221
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,570
Why do you need to see Prince Eun Seong?

222
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,330
I heard he caught a bad cold recently.

223
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,110
I brought a few bags of medicine.

224
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,560
You should gift good medicine to Prince Seon Yang instead.

225
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,690
This is all because you lost the ledger 12 years ago.

226
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,340
Until when will you fear Prince Eun Seong?

227
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,120
Get off!

228
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,790
I am standing here. How dare you?

229
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,010
Will His Majesty

230
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,820
have the crown prince proclamation ceremony on Prince Seon Yang's birthday?

231
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,500
Ask me if you need anything.

232
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,050
I will get it for you.

233
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,270
What are you, an octopus?

234
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,560
How far will you reach out for connections?

235
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,440
You had better be clear about whom you are serving.

236
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,680
You and I are the ones who placed the current king on the throne.

237
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,650
Of course, we should do the same for the next king, too.

238
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,210
I suppose so.

239
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,790
You are certainly clever, as you deal with gold bars.

240
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,090
Make sure to walk next time.

241
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,740
Of course, Your Excellency.

242
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,380
Let us go.

243
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,160
   

244
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,290
Gyohwadang has always been assessing individuals.

245
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,000
- But the Master Innkeeper gave us a new direction. 
 - The Master Innkeeper?

246
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,240
According to the Master Innkeeper,

247
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,330
the apprentices will now be assessed as groups based on their rooms.

248
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,170
All the individual penalties you have received so far—

249
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,710
Will they be invalid?

250
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,270
Wrong. They will be combined into a group score.

251
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,120
From now on, with your roommates,

252
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,490
you will receive reward points and penalties together.

253
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,480
- However, Instructor— 
 - A penalty for saying, "However."

254
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,150
However—

255
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,380
   

256
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,070
Bottom-Tier Room, you have collected this much already.

257
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,980
Bottom-Tier Room, you are so close. So close.

258
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,030
Is this what they call a community of destiny?

259
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,290
That is right.

260
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,340
First of all,

261
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,450
the Annals of Yongcheonru memorization exam will be graded in groups.

262
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,920
You worms will live together and die together from now on.

263
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,060
Your mistake will cause your roommates to be expelled.

264
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,710
Understand?

265
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,860
 Yes. 

266
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,970
Aigoo, how fun! How fun!

267
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,240
- Move, move, move! 
  - Gosh, what do we do? 

268
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,940
Get out of the way.

269
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,110
Let us just...

270
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,580
This is bleak. So bleak. 
    

271
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,740
How many penalties do we have in total?

272
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,670
Come on. Do not worry, Hong Deok Su.

273
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,040
We can earn more reward points.

274
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,250
Seriously...

275
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,510
I said...

276
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,820
I would be helpful to you someday.

277
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,750
I will ensure you all pass.

278
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,810
Just trust me. I guarantee all of us will pass.

279
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,130
I, Go Su Ra, guarantee it.

280
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,000
Go Su Ra...

281
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,540
Go Su Ra, do you think you could?

282
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,020
If everyone got into Yongcheonru just because they wanted to,

283
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,440
it would no longer be the same Yongcheonru.

284
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,660
I know, Hyeongnim.

285
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,410
They need to dream realistically, too.

286
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,540
Just leave them, Du Shik.

287
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,390
Their days in Gyohwadang are numbered.

288
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,570
They are desperate right now. All they can do is dream.

289
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,150
Let us go.

290
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,400
Hey, Hong Deok Su...

291
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,400
do not behave hastily and memorize one more word.

292
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,690
You behave yourself.

293
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,440
Lee Eun Ho,

294
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,980
our fates are bound now.

295
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,210
Wait for me!

296
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,160
Hey, hey. Come here.

297
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,060
If it was not for the golden key...

298
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:10,100
   

299
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,460
 Wow! Petals! 

300
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,770
 Father! 

301
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,700
 Yes, Jae On. 

302
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,980
 The petals. The petals are falling. 

303
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,210
 Welcome. 

304
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,510
 Hurry up and come here. 

305
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,200
♫  Oh moonlight, silently weeping  ♫

306
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,700
♫  If the shadow of fate casts over me  ♫

307
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,710
♫  Light up this endless road for me  ♫

308
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,140
Aigoo. You came without notice.

309
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,980
It has already been 12 years.

310
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,440
Has it been that long already?

311
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:17,660
Did anyone come by in the meantime?

312
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,350
Dozens of people died here.

313
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,800
Who would want to come here?

314
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,000
I have stayed here because of your order,

315
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,010
but sometimes at night...

316
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:33,930
Gosh! I fear I will see ghosts.

317
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,650
It was the warmest place in the world.

318
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,060
Ghosts are not scary.

319
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,630
It is time that is scary.

320
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,660
Well...

321
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,240
I think I will return to my hometown this fall.

322
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,980
I must marry off my daughter, too.

323
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,280
Yes, 12 years was long enough.

324
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,630
I will pay you five times more for your last paycheck.

325
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,660
P-Please do not!

326
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,550
I must calculate everything properly.

327
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,430
Well...

328
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,400
how about you stop waiting now?

329
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,580
Here is a new notice. 
    

330
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,640
Does that face look familiar?

331
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,070
I have seen this face around.

332
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,050
It is a new notice. Someday, we will—

333
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,550
Go away!

334
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,930
Do not do this in front of my business.

335
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,350
Go away! Go away!

336
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,250
How vicious! Let us go.

337
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,920
Gosh, seriously...

338
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,830
Mother! Gosh, Mother!

339
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,900
Aigoo, you are out of breath.

340
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,380
I was feeling upset already. Why are you doing this now, Gu Shil?

341
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,600
Did you hear it, too, Mother?

342
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,780
There was a murder in Seochon!

343
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,500
Murder? Who died?

344
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,900
A gambler who had been gambling in Seochon.

345
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,150
His name was Kim Man Dol.

346
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:32,340
The Investigation Bureau is arresting everyone who used to gamble with him.

347
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,960
Aigoo, a person died while gambling.

348
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,850
What is happening to this world?

349
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,570
But Kim Man Dol gambled, had private loan debts,

350
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,320
and threatened people with a knife.

351
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,000
Something was bound to happen at some point.

352
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,660
He played Ssangpae with Deok Su last time—

353
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,860
- Ssangpae? 
 - No.

354
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,150
No, not Ssangpae... Ssang... Ssanghwatang! 
  (T/N: traditional Korean herbal decoction) 

355
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,170
They drank a lot of it, I heard.

356
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,710
Gu Shil, you...

357
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,140
Tell me the truth!

358
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,740
Deok Su played Ssangpae with that bastard?

359
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,180
Mother! Mother, I know nothing. I know nothing!

360
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,720
I swear I know nothing!

361
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,290
This does not feel right.

362
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,660
It does not feel right.

363
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,280
   

364
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,780
You are all studying so hard.

365
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,810
Gosh, how hot.

366
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,500
Ask me, Cheon Jun Hwa, if you have any questions.

367
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:53,430
What are you looking at so intently, Hong Deok Su?

368
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,270
What? Are you after Master Cheon's position?

369
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,920
No.

370
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,260
The Master Innkeeper.

371
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,770
I plan to get there, at least.

372
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,270
You will be working for me.

373
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,040
You are ill. I am telling you.

374
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,460
Hey, Lee Eun Ho, we learned that before already.

375
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,910
And you all... Did you memorize the Yongcheonru greetings?

376
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,540
I am counting on you, Go Su Ra.

377
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,040
Me, too.

378
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,740
Let us go.

379
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,230
It is game time.

380
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,890
The Annals of Yongcheonru, Chapter 1.

381
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:53,040
Say greetings to the customers at Chinyeongrae word for word.

382
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,180
Go.

383
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,800
- H-How are you? 
 - Wrong. Next.

384
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,540
- I am glad you came to Yongcheonru. 
 - Wrong.

385
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,740
- G-Good day... 
 - Wrong.

386
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,300
- How are— 
 - Wrong, wrong!

387
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,010
Next group.

388
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,530
The Top-Tier Room. I have high hopes.

389
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,220
- Go. 
 - Are...

390
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,240
Are you well?

391
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,010
Wrong. I am not well at all.

392
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,400
Bend your waist. Next.

393
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,700
Hello.

394
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,570
Welcome to Yongcheonru.

395
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,690
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

396
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,290
Your voice is not welcoming at all.

397
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,030
Next.

398
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,270
Hello, welcome to Yongcheonru, sir.

399
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,570
Could you show me your ID badge?

400
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,220
I will guide you to your room.

401
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,660
Would you follow me? Let me carry your bag.

402
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,100
- Breakfasts are served at Yeonhwajeon over there— 
 - Wrong!

403
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,460
Raise the left hand. Next.

404
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,280
- Hello. 
 - Wrong, wrong.

405
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,850
Go back to your seats.

406
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,610
Next.

407
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,320
The Bottom-Tier Room. Are you ready?

408
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,030
Yes.

409
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,240
Go.

410
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,690
- Hello. 
 - Wrong.

411
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,820
- Hello? 
 - Wrong.

412
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,150
- Hello. Hello. 
 - Wrong.

413
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,420
- Hi? Hey. 
 - You bastard!

414
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,440
That is enough.

415
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,620
Next.

416
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,050
Hello.

417
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,210
You bent your waist too much. Next.

418
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,410
- However— 
 - Wrong, wrong.

419
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,500
The Bottom-Tier Room's rising star, Go Su Ra.

420
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,150
Go.

421
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,960
He...

422
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,490
He...

423
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,400
- Hell— 
 - What are you doing?

424
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,550
Time out. Wrong.

425
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,500
Next.

426
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,590
Hello.

427
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,150
Welcome to Yongcheonru, sir.

428
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,420
Could you show me your ID badge?

429
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,160
I will guide you to your room.

430
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,840
Would you follow me?

431
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,620
Let me carry your bag.

432
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,320
Breakfasts are served at Yeonhwajeon over there.

433
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,190
Dinners are served at Yehwajeon over there.

434
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,890
They are there to serve you.

435
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,260
Which meal would you like me to schedule, sir?

436
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,060
Bottom-Tier Room passed.

437
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,550
You get 10 points.

438
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,090
We passed!

439
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,930
He is natural. He really is.

440
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:16,340
Lee Eun Ho, you saved us!

441
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,450
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

442
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,460
You saved us.

443
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,140
You saved us.

444
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,580
Next is the Annals, Chapter 2.

445
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,880
   

446
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,600
   

447
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,270
This makes no sense, Hyeongnim.

448
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,100
The Bottom-Tier Room bastards survived.

449
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,900
We were close to being in danger, too.

450
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,920
For those who are afraid of being expelled,

451
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,200
I will give you a chance to reduce your penalties,

452
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,030
by three points, even.

453
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,660
It is first-come, first-serve.

454
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,520
Me.

455
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,530
Bottom-Tier Room, you win.

456
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,950
Yes, sir.

457
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,870
Look at this. It must be from Xiyu.

458
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:42,390
This is so white and round. So pretty.

459
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,950
This is called an onion.

460
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,680
I heard it is very tasty.

461
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,570
Onion?

462
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,230
- Onion. 
 - Onion.

463
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,280
Try it.

464
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,670
Take a bite.

465
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,350
This is a very expensive product.

466
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,260
But I will make an exception and let you try it.

467
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,060
Take a bite.

468
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,980
   

469
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,300
When are they coming?

470
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,780
Hey, I cannot believe we are in the

471
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,510
Orchid Room of Geumuigak, thanks to our junior, Myeong Ho.

472
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,490
It smells different already.

473
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,560
You must have come here often, Seong Jin.

474
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,410
Stop making a fuss.

475
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,840
He has not been hired yet. He is not our junior.

476
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,810
It must be here.

477
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,220
Oh my, the Orchid Room.

478
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,420
Aigoo, Junior Myeong Ho!

479
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,870
Nice to meet you.

480
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,720
Welcome.

481
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,440
Your lowly junior waited for so long

482
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,390
to pour a drink for my great senior of Ulju Merchants.

483
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,880
No. Sit at the head of the table.

484
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:16,760
All right. Seong Jin seonbaenim, let me pour you some first.

485
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,650
No one in Yongcheonru wanted to meet you as much as I did.

486
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,020
You are Gyohwadang's apprentice. Why would you need to meet me?

487
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,350
Goodness. Please speak casually to your junior, Seonbaenim.

488
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,500
Seonbaenim?

489
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,560
I will be your direct junior if I get hired.

490
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,380
So, I tried calling you that in advance.

491
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,510
Seong Jin seonbaenim.

492
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,380
I did not come here to drink.

493
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,090
You will become the owner of Ulju Merchant someday.

494
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,750
I am just being polite.

495
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,650
I know, right?

496
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,790
I am the future owner, but I am trying to be polite to you.

497
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:06,180
So, I brought this 30-year-old premium wine all the way from Ulju.

498
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,750
Try some.

499
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,500
I am all right.

500
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,150
W-What do I do?

501
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,660
I opened it.

502
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,550
Should I throw it away?

503
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,140
You should drink some, then, Dong Gyu seonbaenim.

504
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,630
We cannot waste it.

505
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,980
This is...

506
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,480
Myeong Ho hubae, let me pour you some, too.

507
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,490
Give me your cup.

508
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,370
What a lovely color.

509
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:48,110
Oh! How sweet! So sweet.

510
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,420
Try some. Try some. Gosh!

511
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,270
This is...

512
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,570
Hey, Hong Deok Su.

513
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,430
The tears are coming down.

514
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,150
Having a scallion in my mouth does not help. Are you sure about that?

515
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,310
Endure it and peel them quickly.

516
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:31,890
We need to peel all of them to reduce the penalties.

517
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,960
There are not many left.

518
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,070
Let us hang in there.

519
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,840
Here. Get more points.

520
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,840
You must become official employees

521
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,240
and work under me.

522
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,540
I will bring more onions.

523
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,680
   

524
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,560
Hey, this wine is...

525
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,060
I keep drinking it, but I am not getting drunk.

526
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,300
Drink up some more.

527
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,520
It must be so tiring to care for the Master Innkeeper.

528
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,980
True.

529
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,240
Not only the Master Innkeeper,

530
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,350
the three department heads always need me.

531
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:46,720
Having ten bodies would not be enough.

532
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,350
All right. The Ulju Merchant should come together now.

533
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,080
That is right.

534
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,850
- Ul! 
  - Be loyal! 

535
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:01,490
- Ju! 
  - Drink! 

536
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,680
Gosh, Hyeongnim.

537
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,540
Hyeongnim, did it go well?

538
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:28,210
Du Shik, working life is so tough.

539
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,750
Myeong Ho, seeing you struggle breaks my heart.

540
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,570
We will pass tomorrow's exam easily, right? 
    

541
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,460
Of course!

542
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:50,940
I am Kim Myeong Ho of the Ulju Merchant.

543
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,370
Tomorrow, the Bottom-Tier Room bastards

544
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,740
will be completely gone.

545
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,870
Are you doing well?

546
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,740
I am doing very well.

547
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,330
I peeled this thing called onion from Xiyu.

548
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,960
Are you sure you are doing well?

549
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,740
I smell something spicy.

550
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,700
Thanks to me, we, the Bottom-Tier Room, avoided getting expelled.

551
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,260
"We"?

552
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,330
Report the situation.

553
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,890
His Majesty wants you to have your guard up and stay alert.

554
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,120
Did something happen in the palace?

555
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,730
Why did Father say such a thing?

556
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,320
The thing is, after the Minister of Defense stopped by,

557
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,640
he called me and told me to relay this message to you.

558
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,900
I need to hurry.

559
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,080
I will see the head manager tomorrow.

560
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,030
I will find some kind of clue.

561
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,020
I hate everyone. Everyone!

562
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:33,850
Prince Seon Yang needs to become the crown prince for his birthday.

563
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:39,130
However, the King will not have the ceremony since Prince Mu Yeong is in Onyang.

564
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,930
He uses all sorts of things as excuses!

565
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,670
Prince Mu Yeong went to Onyang?

566
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,460
Listen to you...

567
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,160
Seol Mae Hwa, you should know better than I do.

568
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,540
Prince Mu Yeong is recuperating in Onyang.

569
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,390
We do not know when he will return!

570
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,160
This is why I am so frustrated.

571
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,830
Do not worry so much.

572
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,040
His Majesty will set the date for the ceremony once Prince Mu Yeong returns.

573
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,020
Why would Cheon see Prince Eun Seong at a time like this?

574
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,830
What is he thinking, exactly?

575
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,230
Seol Mae Hwa, you must know.

576
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,970
I am not sure what you mean.

577
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:28,640
Do not play ignorant, and just tell me.

578
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,160
You are the only one who knows

579
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,460
what he is thinking in Joseon.

580
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:39,180
How could I know what he is thinking?

581
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,020
By the way, why are you not sending the gold bars?

582
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,970
I sent them to your house already.

583
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,420
Of course.

584
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,040
You understand me too well, Mae Hwa.

585
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,300
I would love for you to work for me.

586
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:19,540
Let us go. Let us go.

587
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,450
It is taking forever.

588
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,640
   

589
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,730
What are you looking at so intently now, Hong Deok Su?

590
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,240
What?

591
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,500
Are you still looking at that?

592
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,610
I suppose you really want to become the Master Innkeeper.

593
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:57,160
What? Do you not think I could?

594
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,150
I have no choice, then.

595
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,740
Since you want to become the Master Innkeeper,

596
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,430
I will have to become the owner of this place.

597
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:11,810
We need to become the employees first.

598
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,590
Cheon Jun Hwa, you had better do well.

599
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,360
Of course, I will.

600
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,640
Let us stay in the same boat together until the end, then.

601
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,220
Sounds good.

602
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,110
Gosh, it hurts. Gosh.

603
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,710
Lee Eun Ho.

604
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,220
Hong Deok Su, are you... not going to bathe today, either?

605
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,070
We reek of the spicy onion smell.

606
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,060
Do you not find it disgusting?

607
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,780
The Bottom-Tier Room should bathe together, too.

608
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,360
Yes, we cannot go to bed like this.

609
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,420
Join us, Hong Deok Su.

610
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,120
Aigoo, you go first. I will rest leisurely...

611
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,140
and go when the bathroom becomes empty.

612
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,700
How nice.

613
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,140
Take your shirt off, at least.

614
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,570
I can smell it all the way here.

615
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,640
You smell, too.

616
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,760
Your smell is the same as mine.

617
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,870
He smells and rolls on the floor.

618
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:45,470
He makes me feel so uncomfortable.

619
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,030
Get up and get washed with us.

620
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,470
I can manage myself.

621
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,000
Go bathe, wash your clothes, or whatever.

622
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,670
Just let me rest.

623
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,960
 You are not hiding something under your shirt, are you? 

624
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,240
 Seriously... 

625
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,170
Hey, Lee Eun Ho,

626
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,510
help me get up, too.

627
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,620
Why do you keep doing that, by the way?

628
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,480
Me? What did I do?

629
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,460
You keep peeping at that Hong Deok Su fellow.

630
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,990
I noticed that many times.

631
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,930
By chance, do you...

632
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,850
Never mind.

633
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,660
No, no. What am I thinking?

634
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,110
It is not true, is it?

635
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,840
What are you talking about?

636
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,440
I mean, that could happen.

637
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,360
There is... It is wrong!

638
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,300
It is. No, right?

639
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,350
You cannot.

640
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,030
What is wrong? What can I not do?

641
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:45,160
How dare you? You!

642
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,830
I-It is not like that!

643
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,320
   

644
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:03,610
Starting today, the hosting, managing, and culinary departments will have exams.

645
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:07,690
Each department head will come up with the exam questions.

646
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:12,210
The first one is Jo Seung Ryang, the Head Manager.

647
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,820
Applause.

648
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:23,550
The Management Department is in charge of Yongcheonru's facilities and security.

649
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,050
If I join the management department,

650
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:30,430
will I be able to enter all the facilities in Yongcheonru?

651
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,950
You little...

652
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,170
The Management Department...

653
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:51,010
 is also in charge of everything the guests need while staying. 

654
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,600
 One of the most important things is 

655
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,970
 the bedding. 

656
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,760
 Yongcheonru uses the highest quality cotton. 

657
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,890
It is so popular that the guests purchase it.

658
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:10,460
 Chun Hui, the greatest beauty of Joseon, 

659
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:21,120
 fell in love with its softness and feather-like lightness, 

660
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,510
 she could not leave Yongcheonru. 

661
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,480
 They say beauties love sleeping. 

662
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,110
 That saying was created in Yongcheonru. 

663
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:34,580
 It is so popular that it is the bestseller at Yongcheonru. 

664
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,360
 The people who purchased Yongcheonru bedding 

665
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:42,110
 could circle the Hanyang Fortress 12 times. 

666
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:50,170
So, today's exam will be on...

667
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,530
laundering.

668
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,670
By tomorrow morning,

669
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:01,060
each group will launder 20 sheets of bedding,

670
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,130
dry them nicely,

671
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:06,050
iron them so there is no wrinkle at all,

672
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,620
fold them sharply, and submit them.

673
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,800
Start.

674
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,800
Start!

675
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,660
Twenty sheets?

676
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,680
Here. Take these.

677
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,510
Go ahead.

678
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,300
Hyeongnim, the Bottom-Tier Room is incredibly fast.

679
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,910
What do we do?

680
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,020
Do not worry.

681
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,590
Here are salt and buckwheat powder.

682
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:31,500
We could wash them way quicker than them.

683
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
You are the best, Hyeongnim.

684
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,640
I have faith in you.

685
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,650
Do our sheets seem dirtier?

686
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,580
Do they?

687
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,320
This is no good. Bring them over.

688
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,690
Okay.

689
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,150
- Pour more? 
 - Pour more.

690
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,620
Gosh, how satisfying.

691
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:28,150
Join him if you want to so badly.

692
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,990
What did you say?

693
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,020
No.

694
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,780
Might as well, we all step on them.

695
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,970
Su Ra, you join us, too.

696
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,090
Yes, come in.

697
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,840
What are you doing?

698
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,720
Okay.

699
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,720
Vigorously.

700
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,140
- Come on and join us. 
 - I do not care.

701
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,170
What are you doing?

702
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,760
- Do it slowly. 
 - Get out of the way.

703
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,640
Yes, yes.

704
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,860
- What are you doing? 
 - You little...

705
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,470
What are you doing?

706
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,650
How nice!

707
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,780
Nice, Hong Deok Su!

708
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,530
You guys are too tall!

709
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,750
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, the sparkling you  ♫

710
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:24,370
♫  Raise your head and come closer  ♫

711
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:33,320
♫  But look at me blooming beautifully, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  ♫

712
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,790
 One, two, three. 

713
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,650
Who are you, exactly?

714
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:54,060
You speak unusually, too.

715
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:58,460
Do you like Hong Deok Su?

716
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,730
Enough is enough.

717
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,830
Come on. You cannot make it so obvious.

718
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:11,140
Anyone can see your eyes following Deok Su all day.

719
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,160
If he goes that way, you look that way.

720
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,470
If he goes that way, you look that way.

721
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,100
Goodness...

722
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:24,890
I have never seen anyone looking at anything so persistently.

723
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,500
Your feelings are very deep.

724
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,810
I acknowledge it. I do.

725
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,540
But...

726
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,130
we are still apprentices.

727
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,270
So, you should try hiding it now.

728
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,220
Things would get tricky if someone else found out.

729
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,430
The world is not as generous as me.

730
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,130
How many times have I said that it is not like that?

731
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:49,300
My lips are sealed. You do not have to worry.

732
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,920
- We are friends, are we not? 
 - Please, listen! It is not like that!

733
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,770
You guys. Stop talking and hurry up.

734
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,800
We are the last ones here!

735
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,380
Finish quickly and come.

736
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:02,080
He is looking at him now, too. He is looking at him now, too.

737
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,460
Carry these... Carry these.

738
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,950
Are we too late?

739
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,950
There is an empty spot there.

740
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,030
Where are you going?

741
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:21,360
I am sorry, but we will put our sheets here.

742
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:28,190
If you dry them the long way with two lines,

743
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:31,460
they dry much quicker.

744
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,170
You bastards.

745
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:38,370
What will other people use if you use both lines?

746
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,690
That is none of my concern.

747
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,550
Lee Eun Ho, do not be angry.

748
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,060
These bastards are provoking us intentionally.

749
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,980
- Let it pass. 
 - Why let it pass?

750
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,540
Why do we not just fight?

751
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,770
Go ahead. Go ahead. Gosh, it is too hot.

752
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,690
What is going on?

753
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,150
They came late, but they are being unreasonable.

754
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:10,220
Innkeeper Dong Gyu, this place is for all apprentices.

755
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,250
It is not fair to hog a spot like this.

756
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,680
Nothing can be done since you came late.

757
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,070
Pardon?

758
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,870
- But— 
 - Let me show you another place to dry laundry.

759
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,360
Another place?

760
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,420
Follow me.

761
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,940
Yes.

762
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,050
Do not get involved. Do not.

763
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,280
Take care, Bottom-Tier Room.

764
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:48,260
Here you go.

765
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,790
Make it straight. Make it straight.

766
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:56,920
All right.

767
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,360
Gosh, all done.

768
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:04,450
Aigoo, it's windy. They will dry in no time.

769
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,440
It is finally over.

770
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,300
What a relief.

771
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,550
I am sure they will dry before dinnertime.

772
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:29,040
There is plenty of time to iron them in the evening. Aigoo!

773
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,560
The management department does laundry?

774
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,810
We will pass today, right?

775
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,490
Of course, we will.

776
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,130
This is what youth is.

777
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:44,470
This is youth.

778
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,130
Blue sky and white sheets.

779
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,530
I have not felt this peaceful in a while.

780
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,360
What? What is going on?

781
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,450
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim!

782
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,780
Yes, Sang Wu. Did you check?

783
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,690
Yes. They are totally screwed.

784
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:54,740
Everything ended up on the ground.

785
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,550
What did I tell you, Myeong Ho?

786
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,540
You are good. You are good.

787
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,530
My mother uses this trick to wash bedding sometimes.

788
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,460
If you wash them in rapids,

789
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,450
you do not have to step on or beat them.

790
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:31,300
Things get clean quickly because of the rough stream current.

791
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,370
It looks too dangerous.

792
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:42,020
Do we have to do this just to launder?

793
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,430
We need to succeed and pass no matter what.

794
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,380
Let us do it quickly before we get caught.

795
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:52,310
Yes, I need to become an employee of Yongcheonru, too.

796
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:56,450
We all promised to pass together.

797
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,380
I feel the same.

798
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:01,720
Me, too?

799
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,210
Okay. Hurry.

800
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:10,140
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

801
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,510
I did not fall!

802
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,470
Let me join you, Hong Deok Su.

803
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:22,010
All right.

804
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,640
Well...

805
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,840
Are you not coming, Jun Hwa?

806
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:43,600
Well, why are they trying so hard?

807
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:14,980
- Hold it tightly so the sheet does not get washed away. 
 - All right.

808
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,120
Wet it a bit and rinse...

809
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,930
like this. Then, it is done. It goes quickly, right?

810
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:23,160
Gosh, this is really—

811
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,490
Hey!

812
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,240
Hey, hey!

813
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,510
Hong Deok Su!

814
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,210
Hong Deok Su!

815
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,720
Hong Deok Su!

816
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,090
 Hong Deok Su! 

817
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,590
 Hong Deok Su! Hong Deok Su! 

818
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:01,830
 What do we do? Hong Deok Su! 

819
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,840
♫  When your eyes look at me  ♫

820
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:18,820
♫  I can't hide this trembling heart  ♫

821
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:24,250
♫  Like a child I find myself chasing after you  ♫

822
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:28,950
♫  Like a child I find myself chasing after you  ♫

823
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:36,290
♫  When your hand comes close to mine  ♫

824
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:40,400
♫  Without realizing it I want to  ♫

825
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:50,200
♫  Hold you completely in my arms right now  ♫

826
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:55,540
♫  Walk with me  ♫

827
01:06:55,540 --> 01:07:00,060
♫  Listen to my story slowly  ♫

828
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:05,700
♫  The more I hope to reach you  ♫

829
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:11,750
♫  The smaller I become unable to see you  ♫

830
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:17,040
♫  The more I try to hide it 

831
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:21,500
♫  The bigger this heart grows  ♫

832
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:29,750
♫  I want to tell you looking into your eyes right now  ♫

833
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:41,190


834
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:49,490
   

835
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:57,340
♫  When a gentle breeze blows through the clear sky  ♫

836
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:03,670
♫  Like our beautiful, transparent light  ♫

837
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,960
♫  Leaning on each other's shoulders  ♫

838
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,770
♫  With excitement-filled dreams  ♫

839
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:15,450
♫  You can climb higher  ♫

840
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:18,780
 Do not try to go anywhere until you return the favor. 

841
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:20,200
 Yesterday, you... 

842
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,290
 You cannot get away from me until you return the favor. 

843
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:26,260
 What is so great about that Hong Deok Su? 

844
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:29,090
 Jun Hwa, why are you suddenly doing this? 

845
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:30,580
 By chance, do you... 

846
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,060
 Is Jun Hwa back to his senses now? 

847
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,700
 He is getting along with his roommates. 

848
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,520
 He surprises me. 

849
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,820
 He will become more like a successor once he enjoys power. 

850
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,630
 Do you want to make a deal with me? 

851
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:47,900
 How about the daughter's whereabouts? 

852
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,260
 We have to look for her until the end. 

853
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,590
 - I will be back. 
 - I will join you this time. 

854
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:55,350
 When is Hong Deok Su coming? 

855
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:59,660
 It is almost time. They are over. 

856
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,120
 - Hong Deok Su is in trouble. 
 - Hong Deok Su? 

857
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,020
 Is he gone or not? 

858
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,240
 What do I do now? 

859
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,850
 Is he gone or not?
