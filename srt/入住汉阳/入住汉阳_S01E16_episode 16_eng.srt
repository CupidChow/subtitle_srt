1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,250
   

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,370
   

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,650
   

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:17,000


5
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,680
Hong Deok Su!

6
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,360
Is anyone out there?

7
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,040
Where is the ledger?

8
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,320
This is all your fault.

9
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,190
If you had relinquished the ledger sooner,

10
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,390
Prince Mu Yeong would not have betrayed his father.

11
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,600
Tell me now... where is the ledger?

12
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,040
Do you insist on maintaining your silence?

13
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,110
Royal Guard, begin.

14
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,280
Stop!

15
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,590
No, Father.

16
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,230
- Is this about the ledger? 
 - Lee Eun Ho.

17
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,630
Father, you cannot fix one mistake with another.

18
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,860
Prince Mu Yeong!

19
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,190
Please...

20
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,290
I beg you, you must cease.

21
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,380
Step down from the throne, ask for forgiveness,

22
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,350
and reflect on your wrongdoing.

23
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,890
Ask for forgiveness?

24
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,230
Are you commanding your father to kneel at this moment?

25
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,850
Step aside.

26
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,670
Will you defy my order?

27
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,680
I...

28
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,850
I cannot step aside.

29
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,290
What are you doing?

30
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,950
- Remove my foolish son! 
  - Yes. 

31
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,150
You cannot, Father.

32
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,310
Father, please! You cannot!

33
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,630
Father, you cannot! Father!

34
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,850
Please! Father!

35
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,870
- Lee Eun Ho! 
 - You cannot, Father!

36
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,310
- Interrogate her. 
 - Father!

37
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,890
Tell me where the ledger is.

38
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,410
No!

39
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,440
She belongs with me.

40
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,950
I will... leave with her.

41
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,560
Please grant...

42
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,810
my final... request, Father.

43
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,040
You are like family to Hong Deok Su.

44
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,660
Allow me to request a favor.

45
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,520
When she wakes up, hurry up and leave the capital and hide somewhere

46
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,910
as distant as you can.

47
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,050
I had intended to accept her as family and bestow upon her the world,

48
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,450
yet she betrayed me.

49
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,410
You are asking to be killed like your father, Hong Deok Su.

50
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,730
 Your father, Cheon Mak Dong, killed Hong Jae On's father. 

51
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,210
 Will you slay another precious someone with that sword? 

52
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,060
Do you think Hong Deok Su did it?

53
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,690
I nearly perished after being bitten by a venomous centipede.

54
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,050
Tell me... what do you know?

55
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,400
Seol Mae Hwa has returned.

56
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,480
Seol Mae Hwa has returned?

57
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,020
How come you are back?

58
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,570
Even my father now endeavors to harm Hong Deok Su.

59
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,970
This is the sole means by which I may protect her.

60
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,120
Then, did you tell Deok Su to hide alone?

61
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,880
You are no longer safe in Yongcheonru, either.

62
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,800
There is a matter I must attend to.

63
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,070
There will be an uprising soon.

64
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,020
Is your plan to...

65
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,410
crown Prince Eun Seong as king?

66
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,680
I have been preparing for this for a long time.

67
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,750
The Ulju Merchant has agreed to assist.

68
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,090
- In just a few days— 
 - I...

69
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,380
shall be the cause of that uprising.

70
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,860
It is to... dethrone His Majesty.

71
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:52,110
Father and Cheon... must be stopped forthwith.

72
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,220
I must act.

73
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,620
This is the final recourse I have to protect Hong Deok Su.

74
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,560
Prince Mu Yeong, I did not know you would be present.

75
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,100
It is good to see you, Seol Mae Hwa.

76
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,090
You should have informed me of your return.

77
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,120
Cheon Jun Hwa.

78
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,330
My father...

79
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,290
achieved his purpose by killing his friend with this sword.

80
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,760
What?

81
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,560
What are you saying?

82
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,280
Is that...

83
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,500
the only way I can win Hong Deok Su?

84
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,970
Come to your senses!

85
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,380
You should not even mention such matters.

86
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,970
Why not?

87
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,260
I am, in truth, like my father.

88
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,390
Why should I not do what my father did?

89
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:46,590
Do you mean it? You shall kill your friend with a sword?

90
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,610
Go Su Ra...

91
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,350
do you... hate me, too?

92
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,020
Prince Mu Yeong and Master Innkeeper Seol Mae Hwa together...

93
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,030
How truly unexpected.

94
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,560
Did you need to discuss something secretly?

95
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,530
Where is Hong Deok Su?

96
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,950
I believed you had her with you.

97
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:43,660
Head Manager Jo was slain by the venomous centipede that Hong Deok Su released.

98
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,910
Did you think I was unaware of the actions you and Hong Deok Su

99
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,430
have been undertaking within my own house?

100
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,250
Seol Mae Hwa was following my command.

101
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,450
She was assembling the court ministers to recommend me as crown prince.

102
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,480
Crown prince?

103
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,730
I, Prince Mu Yeong,

104
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,820
shall be king in the future.

105
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,140
Matters shall be expedited now that you are here.

106
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,120
I see you were not jesting when you proclaimed that the crown prince ceremony

107
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,260
would be held at Yongcheonru.

108
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,290
Joking?

109
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,340
That position was mine from the very beginning.

110
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,260
Are you implying that, because...

111
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,620
you need assistance from the Cheon family?

112
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,080
I now command you.

113
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,650
I shall summon the court ministers and declare

114
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,640
that I, Prince Mu Yeong...

115
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,780
will become crown prince and restore order to the country.

116
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,390
Absolutely, Your Highness.

117
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:14,450
The Cheon family shall prepare diligently and serve you.

118
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,000
Find Hong Deok Su. She is outside Yongcheonru.

119
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,290
Seize her before she escapes further.

120
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,660
Yes, sir.

121
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,360
Here.

122
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,110
Take larger bites.

123
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,840
I am still recovering, Mother.

124
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,200
How will you assume control of Yongcheonru when you are so feeble?

125
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,090
Assume control of Yongcheonru?

126
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,080
Me?

127
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,250
What of Cheon Jun Hwa?

128
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:19,560
I journeyed all the way to Hanyang to present you with Yongcheonru.

129
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,480
How so?

130
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,360
The owner of this world will change soon.

131
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,960
I invested Ulju's power and wealth.

132
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,530
We deserve at least Yongcheonru.

133
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,940
Although that is not enough punishment for hurting you.

134
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,250
You are the finest, Mother!

135
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,740
- You should simply eat plenty of meat. 
  - Merchant Leader! 

136
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,430
Merchant Leader!

137
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,750
My goodness, my goodness.

138
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,480
Chief Manager Jo Seung Ryang is dead.

139
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,050
What did you say?

140
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,940
He apparently was bitten by a venomous centipede.

141
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,640
My goodness. He should not have perished so easily.

142
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,200
Why before the uprising?

143
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,860
Where is Seol Mae Hwa?

144
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,460
Let us go.

145
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,160
Deok Su, open your eyes.

146
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,110
Lee Eun Ho.

147
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,230
I thought something terrible happened to you!

148
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,370
Gu Shil,

149
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,520
where is Lee Eun Ho?

150
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,600
He left.

151
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,290
Left? Where to?

152
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,410
He told us to leave the capital when you wake up as soon as tonight.

153
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,390
Can you get up?

154
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,090
By chance,

155
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,550
is he at Yongcheonru?

156
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,530
Let us go.

157
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,590
I have already packed my belongings.

158
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,600
We must hasten before the wicked Cheon finds you.

159
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,550
No.

160
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,880
Lee Eun Ho cannot go there alone.

161
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,650
He begged me to hide you, Deok Su.

162
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,060
He said we must only protect you.

163
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,190
So, you had better listen.

164
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,980
Gu Shil...

165
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,110
I must take my leave.

166
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,640
You are not going anywhere.

167
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,150
I must protect him.

168
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,210
Deok Su, you must return safely.

169
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,610
What?

170
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,530
Did you not hear that this place is possessed?

171
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,080
Good heavens! Good heavens!

172
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,140
Good heavens...

173
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,410
you must be seeking someone.

174
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,650
Step aside, Cheon Jun Hwa.

175
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,490
Did you say you shall become the crown prince?

176
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,450
You said that it is dangerous for Hong Deok Su to remain by my side.

177
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,170
This is the only way to protect her.

178
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,680
What authority do you possess?

179
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,090
Even if you yell that you will become the crown prince now,

180
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,390
you will be powerless if the ministers oppose you.

181
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,480
I am aware.

182
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,030
I cannot become the crown prince...

183
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,290
and I should not become the King, either.

184
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,790
What?

185
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,340
Why then do you act thus?

186
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,130
Because I desire to save someone.

187
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,740
That is how desperately I want to atone.

188
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,750
Cheon Jun Hwa, I do not know how we ended up in this situation,

189
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,250
but we share one common purpose.

190
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,060
We both wish to save one person and atone.

191
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,690
I have risked everything solely for that aim.

192
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,560
If I fail, I must forfeit my life.

193
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,110
However...

194
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,990
even if I end up failing,

195
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,390
I trust that you will not harm Hong Deok Su.

196
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,880
Cheon Jun Hwa, will you do that for me?

197
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,140
I...

198
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,190
cannot do that.

199
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,470
I...

200
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,360
Never mind.

201
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,190
Prince Mu Yeong is having a banquet?

202
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,570
Yes.

203
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,970
Are you plotting behind my back?

204
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,070
How could I, Merchant Leader?

205
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,990
We risked our lives to come from Ulju.

206
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,610
We cannot permit the uprising to fail.

207
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,780
Prince Mu Yeong will aid the uprising.

208
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,420
Do not trouble yourself.

209
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:59,090
I shall eliminate anyone who stands in our way beforehand.

210
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,950
Do not worry.

211
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,950
I have assembled the noblemen opposed to Cheon.

212
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,840
I have also secured the Capital Garrison guards and the Royal Guard Command.

213
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,370
Yes, you had best hasten.

214
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,320
We require every loyal soul on our side.

215
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,390
Prince Mu Yeong...

216
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,550
Never mind.

217
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,440
You can leave.

218
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,190
Go Su Ra.

219
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,740
A guest from Guemuigak's annex is looking for you.

220
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,750
You should head over.

221
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,320
You wanted to see me, madam.

222
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,670
Master Innkeeper.

223
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:29,220
I called you to make a very important request.

224
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,860
Go ahead.

225
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,910
It is for your friends, but it is dangerous.

226
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,680
You may well have to risk your life.

227
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,790
Would you allow my request?

228
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:03,550
Head Chef Jang, what are you hiding?

229
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,850
You got the wrong person...

230
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,970
Where am I?

231
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,170
Master Cheon.

232
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,680
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim!

233
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,540
What happened to you, Hyeongnim?

234
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,970
Spare me.

235
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,440
I know nothing, Master Cheon.

236
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,100
Please, spare my life...

237
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:43,450
What is Seol Mae Hwa plotting by working with Ulju?

238
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,980
How dare you, Ulju bastards, try to take Yongcheonru?

239
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,190
Uprising!

240
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,520
They are preparing an uprising.

241
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,430
Uprising?

242
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,710
She is plotting an uprising?

243
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,120
Seol Mae Hwa?

244
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,700
I merely acted in accordance with orders.

245
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,010
When shall the uprising commence?

246
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,260
I have no idea when.

247
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,910
Please spare me, Master Cheon!

248
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Uprising?

249
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,420
The six ministers are firmly under my control.

250
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,020
What uprising?

251
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,210
I should have killed her and gotten rid of her.

252
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,870
Will murdering her...

253
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,390
solve the matter?

254
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,900
Head Manager Jo is dead.

255
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,270
If you also kill Head Host Yu and me in this manner,

256
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:13,950
what will be your recourse?

257
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,070
Master Cheon,

258
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:27,330
do you suppose... that you alone govern Yongcheonru?

259
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,990
The three department heads are its pillars,

260
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:37,560
and each innkeeper is but a roof shingle.

261
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,010
If you dispatch us all,

262
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:47,550
who shall manage Yongcheonru?

263
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,690
 Cheon even survived the venomous centipede. 

264
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,630
 Keep an eye on him closely. 

265
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,100
 Yes, ma'am. 

266
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,520
 - Where is Prince Mu Yeong? 
 - They just left to get rid of him. 

267
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,610
What are you doing?

268
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,970
 You want me to spare Prince Mu Yeong? 

269
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,740
Yes.

270
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,100
He has nothing to do with what you are planning.

271
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,090
How does he not?

272
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,800
We are trying to change the king. There cannot be two princes.

273
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,300
- One of them must perish. 
 - No.

274
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,520
- Prince Mu Yeong does not want the throne. 
 - Be quiet!

275
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,530
I gave you the chance to depart with Prince Mu Yeong.

276
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,610
Then why have you returned?

277
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,660
You have come because you desire Yongcheonru, is that correct?

278
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,660
What did you say just now?

279
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,170
I can grant it to you.

280
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,960
How will you give me Yongcheonru?

281
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,600
Because the rightful owner of Yongcheonru is none other than I, Hong Jae On.

282
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,290
You are Hong's daughter who disappeared?

283
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,580
Yes.

284
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:03,950
I have long harbored a desire for revenge while living as a man.

285
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,830
I will get Yongcheonru back and happily give it to you.

286
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,910
- Instead... 
 - You want me to spare Prince Mu Yeong?

287
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,480
How will you prove that you are Hong's daughter?

288
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,430
Merchant Leader.

289
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,030
Hold on.

290
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,730
Move.

291
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,520
It is the Merchant Leader's order!

292
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,630
Are you okay?

293
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,640
 She belongs with me. 

294
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,880
 I will leave with her. 

295
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,770
 Please grant... 

296
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:49,430
 my final... request, Father. 

297
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,470
 Inn Owner Cheon is here, Your Majesty! 

298
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,950
There will be an uprising.

299
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,910
An uprising?

300
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,270
Were you not aware that there is a traitor in the palace?

301
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,930
In the palace?

302
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,110
Who might that be?

303
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,660
Prince Eun Seong is orchestrating an uprising.

304
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,190
Prince Eun Seong?

305
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,020
You should have disposed of him twelve years ago.

306
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:49,000
I, Cheon Mak Dong, shall do so on your behalf.

307
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,840
Come to Yongcheonru with the Royal Guard tomorrow.

308
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,340
You... what do you intend?

309
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,320
Please vacate the palace.

310
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,510
Thus, no one shall suspect you.

311
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,200
You do not wish to live as the king...

312
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,640
who slew your brother and his son, do you?

313
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,880
I, Cheon Mak Dong, will bathe in the stains of my misdeeds.

314
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,400
Take my hand while I offer you this chance.

315
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,560
Cheon,

316
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,140
we should... stop now.

317
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,800
Will you renounce the throne?

318
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,780
I worked so hard to put you up there.

319
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,460
You cannot do that.

320
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,860
No, of course not.

321
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,040
Why have you returned?

322
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,660
And you, Lee Eun Ho?

323
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,270
You cannot surrender Yongcheonru.

324
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,570
Your father decreed it for you.

325
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,340
I was resolved to seize it from Cheon and restore it to you.

326
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,100
- But because of me... 
 - You also...

327
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,080
You too relinquished the palace for me.

328
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,190
I...

329
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,270
promised to protect you.

330
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,900
I also...

331
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,380
promised to protect you.

332
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,500
Having but one half...

333
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,480
is utterly futile.

334
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,310
Being united... multiplies our joy.

335
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,460
Lee Eun Ho,

336
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,730
as long as I am with you,

337
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,690
I can endure anything.

338
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,410
Let us do that.

339
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,700
No matter what peril we face,

340
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:19,760
the two of us... shall overcome it together.

341
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,910
Are you getting used to using the sword?

342
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,280
Will you just keep carrying it around?

343
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,780
You need to make up your mind now.

344
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:05,140
Hong Deok Su was once your destined partner.

345
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,420
But... you have to be willing to kill your destiny

346
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,690
to acquire the world.

347
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:18,310
She was once my destined partner?

348
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,470
She tried to kill me, your father.

349
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,680
She will slay us both if you do not dispatch her first.

350
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,050
At times... you should be able to abandon what you want

351
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,740
to protect the most

352
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,770
to acquire something greater.

353
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,070
Abandon what I want to...

354
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,180
protect the most?

355
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,630
Yes, I shall do so.

356
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,330
All right.

357
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,150
I am happy you have decided.

358
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,070
Tomorrow, the entire world will find out...

359
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:36,100
that I, Cheon Mak Dong, was right.

360
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,040
 I can see everything! 

361
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:26,310
Is it true Prince Mu Yeong requested this declaration?

362
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:31,510
If so, did Cheon designate Prince Mu Yeong as crown prince?

363
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:36,960
More importantly, what brought them to Yongcheonru?

364
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,380
I know.

365
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,860
They used to act superior and said they would not deal with Cheon.

366
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:46,180
It somehow feels a bit...

367
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,920
I hope nothing bad happens at this rate.

368
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,240
It is Master Innkeeper Seol.

369
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,790
 His Majesty is here! 

370
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,470
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

371
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,120
Today...

372
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:54,610
I invited you here to request a crown prince proclamation.

373
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,440
 The rumor was well founded. 

374
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,130
 Crown prince proclamation? 

375
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:12,200
Prince Mu Yeong, have you finally decided?

376
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,030
Prince Mu Yeong,

377
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,610
before this momentous declaration,

378
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:28,120
I wish to present you

379
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,390
with the most precious gift, for you shall inherit the throne.

380
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:40,390
It is my humble only son, Cheon Jun Hwa.

381
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,460
He shall be the owner of Yongcheonru in time.

382
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,340
Did you say, "The owner of Yongcheonru"?

383
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,800
For reasons unknown, I have also found one

384
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,090
who is purported to be the true owner of Yongcheonru.

385
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,560
I think Father and the ministers should see this person yourselves

386
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,090
and render judgment.

387
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,120
Decide who is...

388
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,890
the true owner of Yongcheonru.

389
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:23,580
Prince Mu Yeong, you should stop.

390
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,740
Come on in.

391
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,280
Hong Deok Su.

392
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,820
No.

393
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,440
My name is...

394
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,790
Hong Jae On.

395
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,280
Cheon Mak Dong,

396
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,990
you who brutally murdered your friend twelve years ago,

397
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,560
Hong Min Shik.

398
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,730
I am his only daughter.

399
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,320
 It cannot be. 

400
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,560
 Hong Min Shik's daughter? 

401
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:13,670
Today, I am... about to...

402
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,300
betray you, Father.

403
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:28,230
Twelve years ago,

404
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:33,260
certain individuals assassinated the former king to usurp the throne.

405
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,660
- Prince Mu Yeong! 
 - I am...

406
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,050
the son of that traitor.

407
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,030
 What is happening? 

408
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,130
The man who poisoned the former king to place my father upon the throne,

409
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,840
the man who exterminated an entire family,

410
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,060
murdered an innocent mother, and now...

411
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,310
seeks to eliminate the daughter as well...

412
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,390
Prince Mu Yeong.

413
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,880
Before the Heavens...

414
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,600
and in the presence of all ministers assembled here,

415
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,960
I call upon the traitors.

416
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,970
I granted you so many chances,

417
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,330
yet you persist to the bitter end?

418
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,350
Cheon Mak Dong,

419
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:51,920
your avarice cost your friend his life and deprived him of Yongcheonru.

420
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:55,470
Return it to Hong Jae On.

421
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,910
I have no alternative.

422
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,900
Your Majesty,

423
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,490
please issue an order.

424
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,980
Your Majesty.

425
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,940
Royal Guard.

426
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:36,570
Royal Guard, arrest Prince Mu Yeong for defaming His Majesty as a traitor!

427
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,820
Seize him!

428
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,240
That is enough.

429
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,800
Prince Mu Yeong,

430
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,360
I cannot lose you as well.

431
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,820
Father, I implore you to undo this.

432
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,160
Even if you were to slay every witness in the realm,

433
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,310
you know the truth.

434
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,350
Did you endeavor to alter the world by merely placing your trust in Prince Eun Seong?

435
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:57,160
The world you sought to change no longer exists.

436
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,380
Stop!

437
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,620
 You may well have to risk your life. 

438
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:35,220
 Will I be fighting against Master Cheon? 

439
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,940
 That is correct. 

440
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,350
 If I have to risk my life, 

441
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:45,130
 please help Namhae Merchant whether the operation succeeds or not. 

442
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,570
 I give you my word. 

443
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,240
 And... 

444
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:00,150
 protect Cheon Jun Hwa and my friends. 

445
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,640
Arrest all of those arrogant bastards!

446
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,200
 Yes, sir! 

447
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,700
The assassination of Prince Eun Seong has failed.

448
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,780
What did you say?

449
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:28,820
What did you do, you wench?

450
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:34,510
Twelve years ago, after my master suffered an unjust death,

451
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:37,170
I have not forgotten. Not for a moment.

452
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,970
I should have gotten rid of you much sooner.

453
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,990
Cheon Mak Dong.

454
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,020
Twelve years ago,

455
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:51,560
you killed my father... and you murdered my mother as well.

456
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,100
Pay for it with your life now.

457
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,250
Capital Garrison guards, arrest every traitor present!

458
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,750
Ministers, what is to be done?

459
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,950
Royal Guard!

460
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,860
Halt!

461
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,960
Father,

462
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:51,740
please... understand that I am loyal to you.

463
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,810
Your Majesty!

464
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:19,910
What...

465
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:28,560
What are you doing?

466
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,100
Fight! At this very moment!

467
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,830
Father.

468
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,920
Please stop now.

469
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,730
Jun Hwa.

470
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,760
 How will you prove that you are Hong's daughter? 

471
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,610
 Merchant Leader. 

472
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,230
 I can vouch for her. 

473
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,450
 Cheon Jun Hwa. 

474
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,890
 Cheon's son is vouching for her? 

475
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,530
 There is a ledger. 

476
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,130
 That ledger... 

477
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:24,590
 details the corruption of my father, who seized Yongcheonru from her. 

478
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,590
 Hong Min Shik's only daughter... 

479
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:32,390
 I am not the true successor of Yongcheonru. 

480
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,790
 It is her, Hong Jae On, indeed. 

481
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:43,860
 Hong Jae On, 

482
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,600
 I must ask you something. 

483
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,940
Did my father...

484
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:55,980
kill your mother?

485
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,610
He killed your father twelve years ago as well?

486
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:22,490
I am sorry.

487
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:26,890
I am truly...

488
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,720
sorry.

489
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,170
Your sins.

490
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,650
Apologize and beg forgiveness.

491
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:05,300
- How dare you— 
 - I know everything now.

492
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,980
Stop, Father.

493
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:24,550
Did you declare that fate depended on my grasp of this sword?

494
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,310
I shall lay the sword aside.

495
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:35,430
I will live in a manner different from you.

496
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:38,060
You shall abandon me?

497
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:46,670
Do you suppose you could survive without my wealth and the glory of Yongcheonru?

498
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:50,150
- Father. 
 - You wretched bastard!

499
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,100
Cheon Jun Hwa!

500
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:13,040
 I beg you, you must cease. 

501
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,180
 Step down from the throne, ask for forgiveness, 

502
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,160
 and reflect on your wrongdoing. 

503
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:41,270
Your Majesty.

504
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:14,190
Fire!

505
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,840
 Fire! Fire! 

506
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,240
 Fire! Fire! Over there. 

507
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:31,840
 Chief Eunuch, protect His Majesty! 

508
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,040
 Protect His Majesty! Your Majesty! 

509
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,540
Your Majesty!

510
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,840
 Your Majesty! 

511
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:28,580
 Look, Cheon Mak Dong. 

512
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:32,020
 Cheon Mak Dong. 

513
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,170
 Are you Cheon Mak Dong? 

514
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,840
 Yes, I am Cheon Mak Dong. 

515
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,630
 Everyone speaks of your keen eye for merchandise. 

516
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:54,130
 How would you like to form a partnership with me? 

517
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,530
 Pardon? 

518
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:59,600
 Well, you are a nobleman. 

519
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,400
 You wish to collaborate with one of low birth such as myself? 

520
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,550
 Listen, money does not discriminate. 

521
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:11,020
 Success is attainable regardless of one's station. 

522
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,680
 Here. 

523
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:16,210
 Let us endeavor to amass great wealth. 

524
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:28,090
Look, Hong Min Shik.

525
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:30,560
I was not wrong.

526
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,320
 No! 

527
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,670
You were wrong from the beginning.

528
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:46,180
Then, implore my late father... and my late mother for forgiveness.

529
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,390
Ask for forgiveness?

530
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:56,480
You have come this far. Is that all you desire?

531
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,210
How much is it?

532
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,820
What is the price of the apology you demand?

533
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,170
Shut up!

534
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:11,340
I changed the king of this country with money.

535
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:15,860
I betrayed my friend and seized Yongcheonru.

536
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,700
The power of money is both sweet and formidable.

537
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,810
Who would not succumb to it?

538
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:24,860
Hong Jae On, you are no different.

539
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:31,050
No, you resemble me more than anyone else in this world.

540
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,810
Not at all.

541
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,680
You...

542
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,000
are mistaken.

543
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,190
I shall finish you now.

544
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,560
I have long dreamed of this day.

545
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,660
My father and our household...

546
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:18,520
You deprived the ten-year-old Hong Jae On of everything.

547
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,360
"I will stab him to death.

548
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,670
I will rip him apart."

549
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,510
Every day, I vowed this to myself.

550
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:32,570
Stab me.

551
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:39,060
Kill me... and claim Yongcheonru.

552
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,360
You are the only one capable of supplanting me.

553
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,860
Then, proceed. Stab me.

554
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,830
Do so!

555
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,810
No.

556
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:22,080
You are not even worth killing.

557
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,370
Because you and I...

558
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:38,090
are different.

559
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:47,230
How are you different?

560
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:50,340
Everyone in this realm is the same.

561
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:53,700
Who does not yearn to be at the pinnacle of the world?

562
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,060
Tell me. How are you different?

563
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,650
Tell me!

564
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:57,020
This is the palace that I have forged.

565
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:05,900
I... Is this Cheon Mak Dong mistaken?

566
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:24,060
Let us go.

567
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:26,540
Cheon Jun Hwa!

568
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:30,290
Jun Hwa...

569
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,120
Cheon Jun Hwa!

570
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,690
Father!

571
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,050
Father!

572
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:38,050
Father...

573
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,980
Father...

574
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,710
Father...

575
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:47,270
Father...

576
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:18,700
I... attempted to betray you.

577
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,400
Hyeongnim.

578
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,130
But I shall not offer an apology.

579
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,500
There was no alternative.

580
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,210
You should not pardon me, either.

581
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,930
The throne is a cruel mistress.

582
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:42,270
I will ensure that Uncle remains safe in the palace.

583
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:45,810
He could have expelled me long ago,

584
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:48,580
yet he spared me, the young one.

585
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,900
I am repaying that mercy.

586
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,220
Thank you.

587
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,220
What are your intentions?

588
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,750
I do not believe I belong in this palace.

589
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:06,820
I shall depart in search of a world that suits me.

590
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:12,200
After you leave,

591
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:17,060
I will remove everything from history.

592
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:21,220
No wealth shall ever rival the authority of the King.

593
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:25,660
Yongcheonru, Inn Owner Cheon,

594
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:30,400
and even your name, Prince Mu Yeong.

595
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,980
None of these shall be found anywhere in this land.

596
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:11,390
My Yongcheonru shall be utterly destroyed.

597
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:14,510
Mother, what am I to do?

598
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:16,720
I am aflame within, you bastard.

599
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,270
You vowed to bestow Yongcheonru upon me! What shall become of me now?

600
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:27,560
I have heard that Cheon's body could not be located.

601
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:32,680
That man was indeed formidable, whether dead or alive.

602
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,810
I apologize for what happened to Yongcheonru.

603
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:43,730
This is the first loss I have endured since I began as a merchant.

604
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:47,090
Hong Min Shik's daughter promised to grant me Yongcheonru.

605
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,360
So I struck a deal forthwith.

606
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,080
But behold what has occurred.

607
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:56,460
Yet the uprising was a success.

608
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,940
There is nothing that can now be altered.

609
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,120
Hong Jae On.

610
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,720
She shall grow in stature.

611
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,900
She will one day repay me for this.

612
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,340
I shall see to it that she does.

613
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:14,780
Of course, you should.

614
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:36,310
How would you like if I escorted the innkeepers from here to Ulju?

615
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:41,830
Yongcheonru is defined by its people, not by its edifice.

616
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:44,700
I maintain that it is the people who constitute the business.

617
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:49,680
I can build an inn as grand as Yongcheonru in Ulju.

618
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:53,640
You certainly never tolerate any loss at Ulju Merchant.

619
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,260
That is correct. That is correct. That is correct.

620
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:01,570
Let us go.

621
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,250
   

622
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,950
Are you declaring that you shall not join the palace?

623
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:51,480
A merchant belongs in the marketplace.

624
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,240
Pray, become a sage king...

625
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:59,750
and inaugurate a new world.

626
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:06,010
A new world...

627
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:46,590
   

628
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:54,200
We should have a drink today.

629
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,600
Of course. 
    

630
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,570
This is it. "Namhae Inn."

631
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:00,130
Yes, yes.

632
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:02,270
What is inscribed there?

633
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:04,470
"Every customer is a king..."

634
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:07,280
King? That is...

635
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,320
Treasonous.

636
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:14,740
Welcome, gentlemen.

637
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,620
Every customer is a king.

638
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:20,450
Welcome to the Namhae Inn.

639
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:23,310
Enter. Enter.

640
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,030
Yes, yes.

641
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,070
The customers are arriving!

642
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:41,620
   

643
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:49,490
   

644
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:53,470
Are you the master innkeeper of Namhae Inn?

645
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,920
You appear to be of my age.

646
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,740
Yes.

647
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,280
Tell me, why did you apply to our inn?

648
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:06,500
Well, I have never worked at an inn,

649
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,480
but serving as an innkeeper appears enjoyable.

650
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,700
Right.

651
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:18,090
I cannot work late because my parents are strict.

652
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:20,420
All right. You need not.

653
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,600
Leave.

654
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,550
L-Leave?

655
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:26,120
Next. Next group.

656
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:31,100
 I instructed him to perform well.  
    

657
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,280
Goodness, simply continue dismissing them.

658
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:37,610
Keep dismissing them.

659
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:45,300
Who shall you employ if you reject every applicant?

660
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:52,210
The youth these days... are not of sound mind.

661
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,810
In my day,

662
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:58,340
men were properly disciplined.

663
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,670
Yes, yes. We were formidable.

664
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:03,280
We fought on the first day and gambled.

665
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,850
"However, however, however."

666
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:08,910
How many penalties did we incur for uttering that?

667
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:15,310
Yet we passed the final test with high marks.

668
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:18,480
Yes, yes, Master Innkeeper Go Su Ra.

669
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:25,800
Why must I suffer so willingly?

670
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:30,660
Look. My hands got scuffed up.

671
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,370
Goodness...

672
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:47,820
Who inflicted this upon the true man, Hong Deok Su's hands?

673
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:50,080
Where were you, Lee Eun Ho?

674
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:57,730
This is why I procured this while shopping.

675
01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:00,850
I told you to allow me to do the laundry.

676
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:04,870
I warned you not to let even a drop of water touch your hands.

677
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:07,730
I believe I am the sole one laboring.

678
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:11,410
I shall be watching you.

679
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:13,380
How dreadful.

680
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:22,600
- Does it hurt? 
 - No, it does not.

681
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,140
What?

682
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,920
What are you doing in this sacred workplace?

683
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,210
No workplace romance is permitted.

684
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:08,600
That is the foremost rule at our inn.

685
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,070
Romance? Nonsense.

686
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:13,810
What is it, if not romance?

687
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:16,070
You guys...

688
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:18,860
I think they should be punished, Master Innkeeper.

689
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,960
Hong Deok Su and Lee Eun Ho.

690
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,370
Your wage this month has been reduced.

691
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:27,890
- Reduced. 
 - Why?

692
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,370
See, I worked this hard.

693
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:31,540
- Reduced. 
 - How dare you?

694
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,430
I will demonstrate the power of the former prince.

695
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:35,130
- How dare you? 
 - Put that down.

696
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:36,770
- Put that down. 
 - Hold on!

697
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:38,420
- No, no. 
 - Put it down.

698
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:39,990
Come here!

699
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:42,350
Come here.

700
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:43,990
Come here!

701
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:46,870
Come here! Come here!

702
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:54,220
♫  Leaning on each other's shoulders  ♫

703
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:58,000
   

704
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,630
♫  You can climb higher, take a deep breath  ♫

705
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:08,830
   

706
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:14,000
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, the sparkling you  ♫

707
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,610
♫  Raise your head and come closer  ♫

708
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:25,900
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, you'll feel it  ♫

709
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,420
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, this overwhelming feeling  ♫

710
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:35,230
♫  Shall we match our free steps? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  ♫

711
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,940
   

712
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:50,150


713
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,000
Welcome.

714
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,680
Namhae Inn treats customers like kings.

715
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,420
A room, please.

716
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:15,040

717
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:20,020

718
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,570
Yes, sir.

719
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:30,090

720
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:35,090

721
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:40,090

722
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:45,090

723
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:50,370
 ~ THE END ~
