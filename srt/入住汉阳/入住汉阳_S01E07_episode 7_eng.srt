1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
   

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,500
   

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,090
   

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,980
Cheon Jun Hwa.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,910
Lee Eun Ho.

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,020
Go Su Ra.

7
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,440
Hong Deok Su.

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,820
Yes.

9
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,610
 Move! 

10
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,870
Move, move!

11
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,560
Move!

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,340
Move!

13
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,900
Move!

14
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,530
Move!

15
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,440
Who is Hong Deok Su?

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,410
Yes, I am Hong Deok Su.

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,170
You are under arrest for the murder of Kim Man Dol, known as the Seochon murder.

18
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,600
Pardon?

19
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,170
I-I am what?

20
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,500
- Tie him up. 
 - Yes.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,200
No, I am not a murderer.

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,470
- Follow us! 
 - I am not.

23
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,370
- He said he is not. 
 - Step aside immediately.

24
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,240
There must be a misunderstanding.

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,210
What is going on?

26
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,730
What is this fuss about?

27
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,240
You are interrupting the Yongcheonru appointment ceremony.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,110
It must be something very important, is it not?

29
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,690
We have been reported that a murder suspect is hiding in here.

30
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,430
Reported?

31
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,140
Take him away.

32
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,620
I am innocent.

33
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,750
Hong Deok Su, stay alert.

34
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,860
Nothing will happen.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,010
I did not do it.

36
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,210
I did not do it!

37
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,760
 All you are giving me is a red card thief? 

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,180
 If you catch the red card thief, 

39
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,250
 someone will run after him immediately. 

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,030
 The louder we shake the bait, the bigger fish we will catch. 

41
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,490
 You want me to catch the big fish that chases the bait? 

42
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,820
 Are you sure it will help Prince Seon Yang's proclamation? 

43
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,810
 I assure you, you will not be disappointed. 

44
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,130
How dare they barge into my Yongcheonru?

45
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,560
It looks like the Investigation Bureau found the forger of the red card and evidence of the murder.

46
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,030
The Investigation Bureau?

47
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,540
It had to be the Minister of Defense.

48
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,690
The appointment ceremony was ruined because of Hong Deok Su.

49
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,180
How pathetic is this?

50
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,330
Aigoo, Hyeongnim. A murderer, they say.

51
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,030
He committed such a scary crime pretending to be perfectly normal?

52
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,340
I told you I found him suspicious from the beginning.

53
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,370
I do not know how such an evil man joined Yongcheonru.

54
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,980
Where is Lee Eun Ho?

55
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,050
Du Shik, do you know how many beatings a person can take before he dies?

56
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,210
Come on. It is not even a sword.

57
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,060
He will not die from being beaten with a club.

58
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,240
You stupid bastard.

59
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,380
If you pour water on the butt

60
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,720
and hit it just 30 times,

61
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,760
the flesh splits, and you die.

62
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,310
A club can do that to you.

63
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,030
You know that?

64
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,590
Aigoo, Hong Deok Su is a small man, too.

65
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,300
He will die like a frog if he is beaten only ten times.

66
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,090
What are you doing?

67
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,760
Well?

68
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,410
I was curious how many times a person needs to fall off a chair to die.

69
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,750
What?

70
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,370
What?

71
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,150
That was the first one.

72
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,520
Lee Eun Ho.

73
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,860
Lee Eun Ho, are you coming, too?

74
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,800
Where are you going?

75
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,120
You mean the Investigation Bureau?

76
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,640
I need to see Hong Deok Su in person.

77
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,200
Go Su Ra, are you coming, too?

78
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,900
I am from the Bottom-tier Room, too. I cannot be excluded.

79
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,170
Mother! Mother!

80
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,080
Mother!

81
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,350
Something terrible happened!

82
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,960
Gosh, what happened?

83
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,570
The Investigation Bureau took Deok Su!

84
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,770
What?

85
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,280
W-What happened to our Deok Su?

86
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,090
Aigoo, aigoo, Deok Su!

87
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,840
Deok Su!

88
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,450
Mother!

89
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,920
 - Move!  
 - Move!

90
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,550
Deok Su! Deok Su!

91
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,450
Mother! Mother!

92
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,450
- Deok Su! 
 - Mother!

93
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,760
Deok Su! Deok Su!

94
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,120
- Deok Su! 
 - Mother!

95
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,540
What is going on?

96
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,050
Step aside!

97
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,020
Sir, he could never hurt anyone!

98
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,030
Mother, I did not kill him. It was not me!

99
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,450
What is going on, Deok Su?

100
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,740
Move!

101
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,260
Mother!

102
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,510
Mother! Mother!

103
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,210
Stay away from the culprit. Now!

104
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,760
You are mistaken. You got the wrong person!

105
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,160
What are you doing? Drag her out immediately!

106
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,700
 Yes, sir! 

107
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,720
Deok Su!

108
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,200
Mother! Mother!

109
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,250
Mother, are you all right?

110
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,110
Take the culprit away! Now!

111
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,230
 If you catch the red card thief, 

112
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,220
 someone will run after him immediately. 

113
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,940
 The louder we shake the bait, the bigger fish we will catch. 

114
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,050
I cannot believe this!

115
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,790
People really love to watch.

116
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,290
How vulgar.

117
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,830
What are you doing? Kick all of them out!

118
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,200
 Yes. 

119
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,720
Just leave them.

120
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,250
We need to interrogate him louder,

121
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,520
so people learn a lesson from him.

122
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,970
Are they interrogating him there?

123
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,020
They cannot ignore the procedure like this.

124
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,960
Something is strange.

125
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,410
Bring the evidence we found at the murder scene.

126
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,810
Yes, sir.

127
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,630
This is unjust.

128
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,760
I did not murder Kim Man Dol.

129
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,710
Shut up!

130
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,840
Did you not take this red card from him?

131
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,920
A witness saw you and Kim Man Dol fighting in Seochon.

132
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,920
The red card...

133
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,460
 I will split it in half since you are all about fairness. 

134
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,960
 What do you think? Share it nicely and... 

135
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,940
 make sure to join Yongcheonru. 

136
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,670
 What are you doing? 

137
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,100
 Once it is ripped, the red card becomes invalid! 

138
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,120
 I am ruined... 

139
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
That man was Kim Man Dol?

140
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,860
Did you not kill him with this sword?

141
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,260
I know nothing about it. It is not my sword.

142
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,100
You had better be honest.

143
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,720
 He asked if I was practicing swordcraft these days. 

144
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,160
 He inquired about the dragon sword given to the princes, 

145
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,620
 so I showed him mine. 

146
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,920
 The Minister of Defense is attempting to slander you. 

147
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,950
 If it becomes known that you did not travel to Onyang, 

148
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,940
 he will seize the opportunity to use it against you. 

149
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
The Minister of Defense. How dare you.

150
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,530
If this is not yours, who could this sword belong to?

151
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,270
How would I know that?

152
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,400
Is that so?

153
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,410
Let me see if you can endure being tortured and still insist.

154
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,910
Look here.

155
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,340
Yes.

156
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,540
There will be a hearing tomorrow.

157
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,300
Keep him imprisoned.

158
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,800
I will interrogate him harshly until he confesses.

159
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,220
I will carry out your order.

160
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,690
I really did not do it.

161
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,280
 I did not do it! 

162
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,240
Hold on.

163
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,630
I really did not do it.

164
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,140
I really did not do it!

165
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,320
When will the bait be taken?

166
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,560
I did not do it.

167
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,050
I did not kill anyone.

168
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,320
Please listen to me! Hello!

169
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,840
I did not kill him!

170
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,890
Look over here!

171
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,820
Hold on.

172
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,930
Let us talk about what we will do now.

173
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,780
Could Hong Deok Su have... really stolen the red card?

174
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,350
We need to rescue our friend first.

175
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,910
Hong Deok Su is not the culprit.

176
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,170
I need to go somewhere. Go back without me.

177
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,450
Lee Eun Ho!

178
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,840
Go Su Ra, I need to stop by somewhere, too.

179
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,440
Where are you going now?

180
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,830
We left without telling Gyohwadang.

181
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,950
Do not worry about me.

182
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,850
Hey, come on.

183
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,580
You bastards!

184
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,850
Who told you to loaf around like this?

185
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,520
This is all Hong Deok Su's fault.

186
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,930
 - That is right.  
 - Be quiet.

187
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,140
By the way, where did the Bottom-Tier Room bastards go?

188
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,760
Did you not know?

189
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,580
They went out without permission. They should be dismissed immediately.

190
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,780
 That is right. 

191
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,490
Be quiet, you bastards. You bastards.

192
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,650
Go ahead and clean the bathhouse right now.

193
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,140
 Why is it always us? 

194
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,860
Shut your mouth!

195
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,590
Do you mean Hong Deok Su was imprisoned?

196
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,210
Yes.

197
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,250
The Minister of Defense was interrogating him personally.

198
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,970
How did the search of Master Cheon's residence go?

199
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,030
Here is the other half I found in his residence.

200
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,810
You found it.

201
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,560
Hand me the scroll.

202
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,070
Is something wrong?

203
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,620
No.

204
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,600
I can try to put the two pieces together now.

205
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,090
What is wrong?

206
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:48,830
By chance, are you worried about Hong Deok Su?

207
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,600
Why would I not be? He is my golden key.

208
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,130
I worked so hard to find it.

209
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,950
He always behaves rashly and causes trouble.

210
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,980
It is impossible to keep my eyes off of him.

211
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,750
He will be released soon if he is innocent.

212
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,510
There is no way he is the culprit.

213
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,080
There are too many suspicious things.

214
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,110
Let us go to the palace.

215
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,190
I need to look into something.

216
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,130
He caught the bait.

217
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,690
 I am here. 

218
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,820
You came.

219
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,510
Wow, is this the new safe you got?

220
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,490
Would you like to see it?

221
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,630
It is a golden key.

222
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,840
Are there two keys?

223
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,910
You need to put those two together to open this safe.

224
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,450
It is a fascinating object.

225
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,890
I am planning to give the other half to Jae On when she grows up.

226
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,070
You cannot fit much into the safe.

227
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,860
I am more than satisfied with its size.

228
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,300
Satisfied?

229
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,560
I am not.

230
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,910
Look, Min Shik—

231
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,940
Come on, are you talking about that again?

232
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,300
This is our chance to create a king with our money.

233
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,170
We can have power, too.

234
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,580
Power is just like a sword.

235
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,480
The closer you get to it, the more likely you will get hurt.

236
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,870
There is a way to fly further and higher.

237
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,710
Why do you insist on walking with your hands behind your back?

238
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,390
Listen, friend. Think of Jun Hwa and Jae On.

239
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:50,110
We need to leave behind a world worth living in for our children.

240
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,350
Keep looking everywhere.

241
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,560
I see right through what you do inside my house.

242
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,740
Please rescue Hong Deok Su.

243
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,680
There is no way he is the culprit.

244
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,710
They will torture him tomorrow. You need to save him before then.

245
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,540
Have you already been to the Investigation Bureau?

246
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,090
Hong Deok Su belongs to Yongcheonru now.

247
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,140
You even gave him a certificate.

248
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,730
You had no interest in Yongcheonru, yet you worry about its employee.

249
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,920
How interesting.

250
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,520
Yes, I will start being interested from now on.

251
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,630
So, please lend me some money.

252
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,300
I will visit the Minister of Defense and explain things or persuade him.

253
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,340
The Minister of Defense?

254
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,860
Did you think what he wanted was money?

255
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,390
I asked if the reason he imprisoned a lowly employee of Yongcheonru is

256
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,220
because of money.

257
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,060
What is more effective at persuading someone than money?

258
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,660
All right.

259
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,380
Do what you want to do.

260
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:35,090
However... why do I have to give you a loan to do that?

261
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,950
- That is because— 
 - If Hong Deok Su is that worthy for you,

262
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,980
you should resolve this yourself.

263
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,370
My apologies.

264
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,130
Master Cheon gave a strict order about it.

265
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,060
Goodness. He must be trying to train me.

266
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,440
How far are you...

267
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:16,570
willing to go for Hong Deok Su?

268
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,370
I will try anything until I save him.

269
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,690
I am willing to sell everything I own to save him.

270
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,850
Could you be on my side, Master Innkeeper?

271
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,780
I work for Master Cheon now.

272
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,130
I cannot go against his will.

273
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,650
I understand.

274
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,750
I will look for another way.

275
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,860
You probably cannot get a private loan, either.

276
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:58,050
Master Cheon banned you from getting any loans using your name badge.

277
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,580
That sword was indeed mine.

278
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,340
If so, the murderer's sword they found as evidence is...

279
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,700
Who dared to enter the palace and steal the sword?

280
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,480
I will summon the Royal Guards and the Chief Gatekeeper immediately.

281
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,560
There is no need.

282
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,860
The culprit intentionally left the sword at the murder scene, so they would go after me.

283
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,650
Who could have done that?

284
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:01,120
The Minister of Defense... visited Prince Eun Seong and checked his sword.

285
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,010
Those swords were only given to the princes.

286
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,710
Princes Eun Seong, Seon Yang,

287
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,540
and I have one.

288
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:16,130
The Minister of Defense must have set the trap aiming at me.

289
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,030
Why are you so startled?

290
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,230
This was not stolen, was it?

291
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,080
Look at me carefully.

292
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,830
I might have been robbed,

293
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,360
but I have never robbed anyone.

294
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,990
Do not even bother.

295
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,340
You cannot get a loan anywhere in the market today.

296
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,870
I swear it is not stolen.

297
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,230
Do not worry about it.

298
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,510
I did not want to say this, but...

299
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,540
I am Yongcheonru's—

300
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,110
I have no idea why,

301
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,790
but Yongcheonru ordered all the private loan businesses

302
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,630
and pawn shops to suspend any transactions today.

303
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,530
Gosh.

304
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,390
It is such a shame, but...

305
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,900
Take it back.

306
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,260
So, you do not want it?

307
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,530
You probably will not see this anywhere else.

308
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,550
This is expensive stuff.

309
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,670
Well, forget it if you do not want it.

310
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:08,820
Gosh, I wonder if there is a pawn shop owner who is not scared.

311
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,160
Is that it?

312
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,680
How could you not understand the value of this at all?

313
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,270
Do you think all of this is worth one silver nugget?

314
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,770
Look,

315
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,570
no one will pay you that much.

316
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,070
No one would make a transaction with you behind Yongcheonru.

317
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,760
No one but me.

318
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,260
Take it back if you do not want it.

319
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,710
I am afraid, too.

320
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,040
Gosh, seriously...

321
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,540
Go Su Ra,

322
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,760
why are you the only one working?

323
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,710
- My apologies. 
 - Aigoo...

324
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,020
Three are missing from the Bottom-Tier Room.

325
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,740
Are they not going too far?

326
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,270
I will clean four people's worth. Just leave it.

327
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,840
They always say you are their friend, but they make you clean alone.

328
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,600
What kind of friend is that? Right, Hyeongnim?

329
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,000
You bastards. Are you cleaning with your mouth?

330
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,180
Gosh... Finish it quickly and leave.

331
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,230
Gosh, what do I do?

332
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,510
Do not splash water.

333
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,570
Hey, Go Su Ra,

334
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,360
do they bully you by chance?

335
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,420
Damn.

336
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,820
Move so I can clean.

337
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,980
One was arrested by the Investigation Bureau for murder.

338
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,440
Two of them make you do all the work for them.

339
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,370
Who says Hong Deok Su killed someone?

340
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,200
The entire Yongcheonru knows about it. Are you the only one in the dark?

341
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,660
I do not believe in what other people say.

342
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,980
I believe what my friend said.

343
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,030
"I believe what my friend said."

344
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,850
Go Su Ra!

345
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,220
Namhae Merchant went out of business because you are this naive.

346
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,710
Come to your senses!

347
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,540
Find Hong Min Shik's daughter, Hong Jae On!

348
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,150
 Yes, sir! 

349
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,350
Plague!

350
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,670
You cannot enter.

351
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,450
They have the plague.

352
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,460
Mother!

353
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,040
What kind of nightmare are you having?

354
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,700
Gu Shil, let us go.

355
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,230
We need to see if Deok Su is doing okay.

356
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,440
Wait, Mother.

357
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,380
You cannot leave in your condition.

358
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,990
Who are you?

359
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,840
What is everyone doing?

360
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,810
You are...

361
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,180
the son of Yongcheonru's owner?

362
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,380
My name is Cheon Jun Hwa, Your Excellency.

363
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,340
You look nothing like your father.

364
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,080
Cheon sure has a nice-looking son.

365
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,140
I returned from the Qing dynasty recently.

366
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,800
I wanted to greet the well-regarded Minister of Defense.

367
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:28,000
Am I well-known in the Qing dynasty?

368
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:35,080
No wonder. I am His Majesty's father-in-law

369
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,990
and the maternal grandfather of Prince Seon Yang,

370
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,410
who will become the crown prince soon.

371
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,320
It is not polite to visit someone empty-handed.

372
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,930
You are young, but you understand the fundamentals.

373
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,260
It is everything I own.

374
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,240
Everything?

375
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,670
Yes, that is right.

376
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,330
Not all treasures come in big boxes.

377
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,460
The smaller, the finer it is.

378
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,840
So, what did you want to talk about?

379
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,030
A friend of mine was framed and imprisoned.

380
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,280
He was framed?

381
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,430
As long as I am the Minister of Defense,

382
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,920
I cannot allow such injustice.

383
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,820
You truly are as generous as I expected.

384
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,920
You are a rare, virtuous young fellow.

385
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,950
A silver nugget?

386
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,550
A silver nugget, not a gold bar?

387
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,690
Is this box a treasure from the Qing dynasty?

388
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,120
I do not have much now,

389
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,640
but I will give you anything you want from Yongcheonru.

390
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,370
Not much?

391
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,510
The arrested man is an innocent innkeeper.

392
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:34,760
Are you saying I persecuted an innocent citizen?

393
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,330
Go back. I will pretend this never happened.

394
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,280
I could imprison you for bribery,

395
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,860
but since I am an old friend of your father,

396
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,810
I will give you a pass this once.

397
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,040
Your Excellency.

398
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,820
What a fool.

399
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,600
Learn and come back when you are more mature.

400
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,870
No one uses everything they own to negotiate.

401
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,580
You still have a long way to go.

402
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,450
You need to use it sparingly.

403
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,980
How many times do you have to tell me?

404
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,800
I understand.

405
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,700
I said I will get you a new one.

406
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,660
It is a difficult ointment to get.

407
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,080
It is a cure-all.

408
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:30,350
Where did you get injured that you need the whole thing?

409
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,680
Let me apply it for you.

410
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,880
Seriously.

411
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,400
- Here he is. 
 - Deok Su. Deok Su.

412
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,760
Mother.

413
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,630
- You should not have come! 
 - Deok Su.

414
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:51,620
I brought her because she insisted on feeding you warm soup.

415
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,250
- Are you okay? 
 - How about you? Are you okay?

416
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,670
Sir, you probably could use this.

417
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,790
I will only give you a moment.

418
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,320
- Hurry, hurry. 
 - Thank you.

419
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,730
Aigoo, my baby.

420
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,220
Say ah. Ah!

421
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,480
Eat this and feel better.

422
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,640
I am sorry, Mother.

423
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,700
Did you do anything you owe me an apology for?

424
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,410
Tell me.

425
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,580
I...

426
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,360
played Ssangpae with Kim Man Dol.

427
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,980
That is how I won the red card.

428
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,690
Gosh, you bastard!

429
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,180
Do you not know how I raised you?

430
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,030
That was the only way to join Yongcheonru.

431
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,520
What is so great about Yongcheonru?

432
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:29,460
So, did he really die because of you?

433
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,970
It is not like that, Mother.

434
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,430
I did not kill him.

435
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,670
Aigoo. Gosh, how will you pay for this sin?

436
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,360
I will correct things, Mother.

437
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,680
I can straighten it out.

438
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,550
Someone from Yongcheonru paid me money today,

439
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,430
saying it was compensation for you.

440
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,830
What?

441
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,010
Someone paid you? Who?

442
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,690
Are you Hong Deok Su's mother?

443
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,190
Yes.

444
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,710
This is compensation for Hong Deok Su.

445
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,250
That person...

446
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,770
gave this to me.

447
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,520
I pretended not to know,

448
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,230
but I have been having nightmares.

449
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,370
I feel so anxious, Deok Su.

450
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,950
What does that person look like? Do you remember?

451
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,260
She did look like a noblewoman.

452
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,970
Noblewoman?

453
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,520
Was that person...

454
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,810
a woman?

455
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,100
Why? Is it someone you know?

456
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,380
Per your order, I blocked all the sources of funds in the capital,

457
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,970
but I suppose he ended up visiting the Minister of Defense.

458
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,560
Have you seen Jun Hwa doing this before, Mae Hwa?

459
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,260
He would not flinch even if I were dying.

460
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,500
I will tell him to be more careful.

461
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,330
Just leave him.

462
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,330
This is just the beginning.

463
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,340
When he gets tired of being unruly,

464
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,420
he will come back and surrender.

465
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,970
But...

466
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,960
the more important thing is...

467
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,480
that Hong Deok Su bastard.

468
00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:00,570
The one who is making Jun Hwa do this.

469
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,130
There is definitely something about him.

470
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:16,190
He might be able to become wings for Jun Hwa, who has been asleep.

471
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,600
Seol Mae Hwa.

472
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,270
Did she pay for my life or something?

473
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,960
 You should rest fully today. 

474
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,650
 Tomorrow will be a busy day. 

475
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,780
I will repay you for what you did.

476
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,370
Gosh.

477
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,720
What is this?

478
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,650
Sir, please help me.

479
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,080
The soup I had earlier...

480
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,290
Come on, bastard!

481
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,640
Please spare me, sir. I am dying.

482
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,090
Please, sir. Please.

483
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,700
Let go of me, you bastard!

484
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,870
You dirty bastard.

485
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,320
A prisoner escaped! That way!

486
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,890
 - Catch him! 
 - Catch him! 

487
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,950
Do not let him go!

488
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,200
Catch him!

489
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,380
Hong Deok Su escaped from jail.

490
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,890
I knew he was not easy, but...

491
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,720
What should we do?

492
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,950
I should go myself.

493
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,880
Stop!

494
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,650
You bastard!

495
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,460
Kneel immediately if you do not want to die.

496
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,060
Let go!

497
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,990
Take him away right now!

498
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:14,150
No, let go! Let go!

499
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,410
Let go!

500
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,200
Damn it.

501
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,350
 What a fool. 

502
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,050
 Learn and come back when you are more mature. 

503
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,830
 No one uses everything they own to negotiate. 

504
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,430
 You still have a long way to go. 

505
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,340
Do you still have anything left to sell?

506
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,980
Buy me, Master Cheon.

507
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,500
You do not know the worth of what you have.

508
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,590
You sold things for cheap at random places.

509
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:07,970
If you sell yourself now, will you not regret it?

510
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,630
I must be worth as much as Yongcheonru.

511
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,220
Are you doing this just to save Hong Deok Su?

512
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,520
Hong Deok Su is my friend, Father.

513
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,640
Friend?

514
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,820
Friend.

515
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,500
I had an invaluable friend once, too.

516
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:50,890
You are kneeling as you promise me to follow my path.

517
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,960
So, I will tell you.

518
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:02,050
You cannot spend on someone weak and useless.

519
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:07,340
That is the first thing you need to learn to follow my path.

520
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,610
Two.

521
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:14,400
In negotiations, what the other person wants

522
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,510
is more important than what you have.

523
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,990
But you did not even know what the Minister of Defense wanted.

524
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:24,690
You messed up from the beginning.

525
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,990
Do you understand?

526
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,800
I will keep that in mind.

527
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,270
But Hong Deok Su will be like Seol Mae Hwa to me.

528
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:38,030
He is necessary for me to follow your path.

529
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,410
The Master Innkeeper is not your friend.

530
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,590
She is someone below you whom you manage.

531
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,910
Yes.

532
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,370
Then, save the person who will work under me.

533
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,020
Fine.

534
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,200
You sold yourself for Hong Deok Su.

535
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,890
I will let you have that much.

536
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,160
Hong Deok Su...

537
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,530
Hong Deok Su!

538
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,550
 You are suddenly torturing the prisoner? 

539
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,600
Why would you bother doing that?

540
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,410
That bastard got caught trying to escape last night.

541
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,470
I have to bring out the club myself.

542
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,630
Just make an officer do it.

543
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,110
Why would you do something so rough?

544
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,890
This is all a part of a game.

545
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:41,960
You should relax and prepare for Prince Seon Yang's proclamation.

546
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:48,460
Why would you dirty your hands before the happy occasion?

547
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:55,100
Last night, the only son of Yongcheonru's Cheon

548
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,420
caught the bait.

549
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,750
Pardon? Master Cheon's son?

550
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,020
If I find out Cheon's weakness,

551
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:10,550
it would help Prince Seon Yang's proclamation ceremony.

552
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:11,960
But, still!

553
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,470
Only one silver nugget in the box? That makes no sense.

554
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,390
Gosh, I am angry.

555
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,160
Gosh, why do you not just relax today?

556
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,800
No, I need to shake the bait harder to catch a big fish.

557
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,810
 Your Excellency, Yongcheonru sent a present! 

558
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,970
Is that so?

559
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:36,100
Come on in.

560
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:55,150
Gosh, why is the present so tiny?

561
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,380
What is this?

562
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,210
It is the box the son brought the silver nugget in.

563
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,950
Cheon, this fellow knows something.

564
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,990
This is like rhyme in poetry.

565
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:16,020
He apologizes for his son's mistake in the same way.

566
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:21,680
I will happily accept it.

567
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:29,710
Yongcheonru's Master Cheon must have finally decided to submit to you.

568
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,290
It is hefty.

569
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:34,500
It is different. Very different.

570
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:45,700
Why are you shaking that?

571
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,640
What if it is fragile?

572
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,440
What?

573
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,570
What is this?

574
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,880
   

575
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,670
What is this?

576
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:22,640
 Your Excellency, someone from the Investigation Bureau is looking for you. 

577
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,220
 It is a peach tree branch. 

578
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,930
 It protects you from ghosts and nightmares. 

579
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,600
Lee Eun Ho.

580
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,420
Who is here, anyway? What?

581
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,320
Long time no see, Minister.

582
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,670
P-Prince Mu Yeong.

583
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,910
I heard you have been looking for me.

584
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:24,650
I came in a hurry because I had to talk to you in person.

585
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:34,830
Gosh, I heard you were recuperating in Onyang.

586
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,720
Are you feeling better now?

587
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,220
I was waiting for you and thought I would not get to see you before I died.

588
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:53,380
Release the innocent man you arrested because of me.

589
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,430
Am I not the one you are after?

590
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:08,390
I know it is your order, but...

591
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:14,260
I cannot get involved in the Investigation Bureau's officers' business.

592
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,490
The 10th birthday of Prince Seon Yang is coming up soon.

593
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:25,430
With his upcoming crown prince proclamation ceremony, which is an important event,

594
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:28,980
an innocent citizen should not shed blood.

595
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,010
That is...

596
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,760
true.

597
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,130
If so, can the...

598
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:47,500
proclamation ceremony happen soon without a hitch?

599
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:53,680
I will help with that.

600
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,390
Whoever takes the throne

601
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:00,240
should look after the people with virtue and justice.

602
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,160
I have no reason not to help my younger brother as long as he becomes a sage king.

603
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:09,940
That sounds great.

604
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:16,260
I will release Yongcheonru's innkeeper since you vouch for him.

605
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,590
However...

606
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:26,210
I will keep investigating the murder and catch the culprit.

607
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:32,520
The man who was slain with a sword was a citizen of Joseon.

608
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,320
 Prisoner Hong Deok Su! 

609
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:45,390
Yes.

610
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:46,650
Come out.

611
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,200
Pardon?

612
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,240
Get out of here.

613
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,280
What is going on?

614
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,120
Why are you suddenly letting me go?

615
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,050
How would I know? Get lost.

616
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,730
I made this clear, but I am against it.

617
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:29,000
Hong Deok Su is an innocent man.

618
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,690
He just got caught in the trap the Minister of Defense set for me.

619
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:36,310
I am against it because you are jumping in, knowing it is a trap.

620
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,180
Would you do the same if I were imprisoned, too?

621
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,970
You should be punished if you commit a crime.

622
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,130
And he is not the same as you.

623
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,560
How am I different from him?

624
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,940
I am disappointed.

625
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,790
You worried about Hong Deok Su all night.

626
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:57,750
Me? About Hong Deok Su?

627
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,370
You were worried about him.

628
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,160
That is why you took my ointment, too.

629
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,550
Do you not pity the man?

630
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,570
How could a person not have empathy?

631
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:11,100
I did not know you were so cold-hearted, Beom Ho.

632
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,760
Me?

633
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,470
A sage ruler must pity someone who has been wronged.

634
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:21,190
You act strangely whenever we talk about Hong Deok Su.

635
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,970
The golden key!

636
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:25,710
Hong Deok Su is my golden key.

637
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,180
I did not forget my goal.

638
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,190
I found the other half.

639
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:32,990
Once I put them together, it would all be over.

640
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:37,570
You did not compliment me at all when I found the other half.

641
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:39,370
Let us go.

642
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,450
How could you be like this?

643
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,850
Why are you so cold to me?

644
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,290
- Why? 
 - Gosh.

645
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,570
Cheon, are you out of your mind?

646
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:04,370
You ask me to release a murderer by sending me this?

647
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:09,870
Are you and your son mocking me together?

648
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,530
   

649
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,440
Goodness.

650
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:23,490
Was this not enough?

651
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,350
What is that?

652
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,990
If you do not know, it is probably better not to know.

653
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:38,030
I will take it back since you do not want it.

654
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,270
I mean...

655
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,770
you should have told me what the present was first.

656
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:53,820
Will you release Yongcheonru's innkeeper?

657
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,850
The thing is...

658
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,990
- He is gone. 
 - Pardon?

659
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,460
It is too late.

660
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:11,800
Someone came before you and had me release Hong Deok Su.

661
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,970
Who was that?

662
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:21,330
I will tell you if you give me this present back.

663
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,100
No need for that.

664
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:32,450
I will find out eventually if I am meant to know.

665
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,830
Well, then...

666
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,970
The Investigation Bureau suddenly released him.

667
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,680
Find him.

668
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,100
Yes, madam.

669
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,020
Move.

670
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:50,320
   

671
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,750
What brings you here so late, Master Innkeeper?

672
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,990
A lot has happened at Gyohwadang this year.

673
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:06,160
Yes. They were unusually strange kids.

674
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,890
You did a lot, Instructor Bang.

675
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:12,800
But we should clean things up now.

676
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:20,070
I want you to expel Hong Deok Su.

677
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,090
Pardon?

678
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,660
- Master Innkeeper, there is— 
 - Come back tomorrow.

679
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,400
You can report to me tomorrow.

680
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:36,190
Where have you been all day?

681
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:38,900
I waited for you for a long time.

682
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:06,110
What brings you here?

683
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,460
Hong Deok Su,

684
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:13,150
you show up here after causing a scene at the Investigation Bureau?

685
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:16,060
I am sorry for disturbing you.

686
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:20,480
He wanted to see you so badly. So, I brought him here.

687
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:29,510
What reason would I have to see him?

688
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:32,000
I had to let you know I was back.

689
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,980
Hong Deok Su has been expelled already.

690
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:38,810
He was arrested for a murder charge.

691
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:41,150
He might not be the culprit,

692
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,280
but he has no right to be here for forging the red card alone.

693
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,570
I am here to...

694
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:51,040
beg you for a chance to prove myself.

695
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,010
Put the expulsion on hold.

696
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:01,520
Master Cheon, to the other innkeepers...

697
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:05,050
This will set an example.

698
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:10,080
It will prove whether Yongcheonru cares about people or not.

699
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:16,780
Prove yourself as you said you would.

700
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,480
Yes, I will.

701
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:30,930
Once you achieve what you promised, I will reinstate you then.

702
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,960
That should be fine, right?

703
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:47,860
You should not have returned to Yongcheonru.

704
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,610
Why should I not?

705
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,120
I worked so hard to come this far.

706
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:03,050
You must have a lot to say to me.

707
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:05,610
No matter what anyone says,

708
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:08,670
I came this far on my own.

709
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:11,000
There is nothing I cannot do.

710
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,100
I came back alive from jail, too.

711
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,020
Hong Deok Su, you—

712
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:19,630
The person who reported me to the Investigation Bureau and framed me.

713
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:22,030
I know who it was.

714
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,580
I will never...

715
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,630
run away like a coward.

716
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,770
Hong Deok Su...

717
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,010
Hong Deok Su!

718
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,500
Do not go.

719
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,640
Do not go.

720
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,450
♫  I can't hide this trembling heart  ♫

721
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:09,440
♫  Like a child I find myself chasing after you  ♫

722
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:16,840
♫  When your hand comes close to mine  ♫

723
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,890
♫  Without realizing it I want to  ♫

724
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:30,660
♫  Hold you completely in my arms right now  ♫

725
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,080
♫  Walk with me  ♫

726
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:40,660
♫  Listen to my story slowly  ♫

727
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:46,190
♫  The more I hope to reach you  ♫

728
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:52,300
♫  The smaller I become unable to see you  ♫

729
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:57,580
♫  The more I try to hide it  ♫

730
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:02,100
♫  The bigger this heart grows  ♫

731
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:09,790
♫  I want to tell you looking into your eyes right now  ♫

732
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:16,230
   

733
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:27,030


734
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:37,090
♫  The flowing river speaks no words  ♫

735
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:43,260
 Master Cheon will soon realize the golden key is gone. 

736
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:44,850
 You must make your move before that. 

737
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:48,240
 Hong Deok Su finally managed to come back. 

738
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,290
 This is the last chance for me. 

739
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:54,670
 Do you think you can catch me? 

740
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:58,100
 This gambling house needs to become a success. 

741
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,500
 Find another way. 

742
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,450
 I will not ask you all to help me. 

743
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:04,980
 This is something I need to take care of. 

744
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:08,160
 Would you ignore me if I were in your situation? 

745
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,770
 Are we not friends? 

746
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:13,690
 - You like Hong Deok Su, do you not? 
 - What? 

747
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:16,040
 Jun Hwa prepared all this for you, Deok Su. 

748
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,600
 Cheon Jun Hwa. 

749
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:20,010
 Why are you still at Yongcheonru? 

750
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:21,660
 This is not my place, but... 

751
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:27,110
 I know why I came here, hiding my identity. 

752
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:30,830
 You are very interested in the gambling house, considering you were against it. 

753
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,380
 Lee Eun Ho, where are you from? 

754
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:37,060
 Regarding the Bottom-Tier Room kids you call friends. 

755
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:41,120
 You are the one who pushed me this far. 

756
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,670
 How much do you know? 

757
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,320
 I know my friends well. 

758
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,680
 You know nothing at all. 

759
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,620
 Whatever it is, please tell me.
