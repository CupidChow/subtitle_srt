1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
   

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,590
   

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:15,520


4
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,100
 - Spin it! Spin it! 
 - Go! 

5
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,100
­Place your bets.

6
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,090
­- Release them. 
 - Let us go.

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,500
- Go, go! 
 - Hurry!

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,130
You people...

9
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,110
Enjoy.

10
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,170
That bastard is Kim Man Dol.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,140
Do it again, do it again!

12
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,740
 How unbelievable. 

13
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,830
 Man Dol is lucky today. 

14
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,700
How about playing a game...

15
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,380
- with Hong Deok Su? 
 - Hong Deok Su?

16
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,790
- Who? 
 - Who is that?

17
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,230
- Hong Deok Su? 
 - I have never seen him before.

18
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,850
Did you bring betting money?

19
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,140
Make the first move.

20
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,880
   

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,150
Let us go.

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,960
 ­  

23
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,920
Halt!

24
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,640
Who are you?

25
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,530
P-Prince Mu Yeong.

26
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,890
Everyone, bow down and show your respect.

27
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,850
It is Prince Mu Yeong.

28
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,180
Let them go.

29
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,450
- Double, double! 
 - It's double!

30
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,530
 He won again! 

31
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,750
Goodness, I lost everything!

32
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,990
Did you run out of betting money?

33
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,070
You can bet with your house or land deed instead.

34
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,800
- I will get going now. 
 - Hold on!

35
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,570
The red card for Yongcheonru.

36
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,620
Hey! The red card! The red card!

37
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,170
Is that the rare red card?

38
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,170
Hey, you cannot use that!

39
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,690
The application card for the Yongcheonru employment exam.

40
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,640
Will that do?

41
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,390
Are you sure this is authentic?

42
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,580
Seriously.

43
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,110
Are your eyes broken?

44
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,860
Take a look at this.

45
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,690
This is what you see at the Yongcheonru front gate.

46
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,160
Without this, even the prime minister

47
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,550
cannot take the Yongcheonru employment exam.

48
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,660
It is that red card.

49
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,120
Open it!

50
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,770
   

51
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,880
Yongcheonru.

52
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,390
This will be my bet,

53
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,020
but you have to bet all of this, Hong Deok Su!

54
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,060
Hey, come on...

55
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,560
Just one second.

56
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,400
I still need to check to see if it is authentic.

57
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,350
This is authentic, indeed.

58
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,820
Fine. You cannot get it back, no matter how much you cry.

59
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,550
Come on. You had better not be the one crying!

60
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,640
One round?

61
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,220
Sounds good.

62
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,560
Let us go to the West Gate.

63
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,370
   

64
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,970
Who are you?

65
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,050
Sir, I need to report something urgently.

66
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,920
Two fives!

67
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,350
Two sixes!

68
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,120
T-Two sixes? How could that be?

69
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,640
I won.

70
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,500
Right, take the change.

71
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,360
That was fun!

72
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,580
Deok Su hyeongnim! Deok Su hyeongnim!

73
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,030
Forgive me just this once. It belongs to my boss.

74
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,590
The manager will beat me to death if he finds out!

75
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,460
I said you cannot take it back!

76
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,060
No!

77
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,280
Deok Su hyeongnim, please help me out just this once.

78
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,480
Please! Please, help me!

79
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,020
Take all this!

80
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,060
Stop!

81
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,080
Arrest every single one of them!

82
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,490
Here they are.

83
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,430
Gu Shil.

84
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,160
Did you win the red card?

85
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,790
Of course, I did.

86
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,250
You finally did it!

87
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,960
Stop!

88
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,740
Let us go.

89
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,910
Hurry.

90
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,860
   

91
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,300
   

92
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,150
 The other palace, built in front of the original King's palace. 

93
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,900
 Yongcheonru. 

94
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,990
 The finest inn in all Joseon, located where the dragon was said to dwell. 

95
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,310
 Its reputation has reached as far as the west, across the ocean. 

96
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,330
  ­ 

97
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,030
 The moment you step into that place, 

98
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:41,830
 they welcome you with the utmost hospitality. 

99
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,410
   

100
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,170
 Not to mention the delicacies from all over the world... 

101
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,990
 Bring me the pear extract! 

102
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,490
 Yes, I will bring them! 

103
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:10,110
 you can even enjoy a king's feast upon request. 

104
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,560
 At Yongcheonru, every customer is treated like royalty. 

105
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,530
 It is a place unlike any other in Joseon. 

106
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,630
 Here, you can have anything you desire, as long as you have the money. 

107
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,200
 You can transform yourself from head to toe. 

108
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,790
 At Yongcheonru, anything is possible if wealth is on your side. 

109
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,980
 It is Yongcheonru's innkeepers who make this possible. 

110
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,810
 Regardless of your class, 

111
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,280
 you can achieve success if you are competent. 

112
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,260
 It is a dream job for the youth of Hanyang. 

113
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,000
 Yongcheonru thrives under their skilled hands. 

114
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,820
 And the person who leads them... 

115
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,320
 the Master Innkeeper. 

116
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,210
 My goal is to become the Master Innkeeper. 

117
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,800
Let go!

118
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,060
Is the queen not ready yet?

119
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,160
Come and pour me a glass!

120
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,510
- That man... 
 - Bring me the concubine if the queen is not available!

121
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,520
Is that man wearing the king's robe?

122
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,060
Your Majesty!

123
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,280
You cannot do this here!

124
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,200
How dare that bastard—

125
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,280
Please calm down.

126
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,100
- Now is not the time. 
 - Bring her!

127
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,800
Let go!

128
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,060
   

129
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,200
We have an uninvited guest.

130
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,950
Should I summon security to remove him?

131
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,050
Leave him be.

132
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:14,010
I will not act just because a cat jumped over the fence.

133
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,920
Give me my red card!

134
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,300
Hold on. Hold on.

135
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,800
Nothing will happen if you return the red card to me.

136
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,440
Deok Su!

137
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,930
Here.

138
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,770
I will put all the money I won here. Take it.

139
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:00,460
No, not this! Give me the red card!

140
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,200
Are you sure?

141
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,790
Will you truly stop as long as I give the red card back?

142
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,010
Yes, that is all I want.

143
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,540
Fine.

144
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,190
Here.

145
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,150
Take it.

146
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,140
You little...

147
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,370
Gu Shil, run! Get up!

148
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,960
- Deok Su! 
 - Go, Gu Shil!

149
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,700
Go without me!

150
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,790
Give me the red card, you bastard!

151
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,500
Give me my red card!

152
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,840
Stop!

153
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,850
Stop right there!

154
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,360
You!

155
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,830
Give me the red card!

156
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,280
The red card...

157
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,640
Let go! Let go!

158
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,580
Let go!

159
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,290
Where are you going?

160
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,850
My red card! Mine, mine...

161
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,670
Give it to me!

162
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,350
What? Hey!

163
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,570
Hey! Let go!

164
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,150
- Give it to me. 
 - No!

165
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,320
- Hold on! 
 - Let go!

166
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,270
Let go!

167
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,240
Let go, I said!

168
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,170
Are you all right?

169
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,720
Are they from Yongcheonru?

170
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,610
Give it back to me. It is mine.

171
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,920
N-No, i-it is mine.

172
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,800
What are you talking about?

173
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,360
So, it originally belonged to my manager,

174
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,560
but this man, Deok Su, scammed me in a game of Ssangpae and...

175
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,070
You two played Ssangpae?

176
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,690
No, the thing is—

177
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,380
Tell him the truth.

178
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,220
H-Hold on.

179
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,550
We are apprentices preparing to join Yongcheonru.

180
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,320
That card proves we are apprentices. Return it to us now.

181
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,690
You, gentlemen, may leave.

182
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,860
Apprentices who will join Yongcheonru?

183
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,680
Do you even know what kind of place it is?

184
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,000
Do you know what sort of things are done

185
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,210
by the lawless people there?

186
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,200
I do not care what they do. I need to join them.

187
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,980
- It is not your concern. Be on your way. 
 - What?

188
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,190
The guests of Yongcheonru must be fairer than you,

189
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,150
who point a sword at someone at night.

190
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,680
You play Ssangpae at night.

191
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,790
You gamble and fight.

192
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,470
How dare you speak of fairness?

193
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,290
Did you say this card is yours?

194
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,040
Yes, it is mine.

195
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,280
How dare you go back on your word?

196
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,460
You are also...

197
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,030
insisting this is yours.

198
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,880
- Pardon? 
 - There is one card, but two claim it as their own.

199
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,010
I have a good idea.

200
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,380
I will split it in half since you are all about fairness.

201
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,680
What do you think?

202
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,250
Share it nicely, and...

203
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,420
make sure to join Yongcheonru.

204
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,210
Gosh, I am ruined.

205
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,130
I am ruined...

206
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,710
What are you doing?

207
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,550
Once it is ripped, the red card becomes invalid!

208
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,400
You attack me from behind, yet you speak of fairness?

209
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,090
Even a stray dog would laugh at you.

210
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:59,020
I suppose you are shameless since you want to join Yongcheonru.

211
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,130
You ripped my red card. That—

212
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,540
That makes you a scoundrel as well.

213
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,480
I will use the actual sword next time, not just the sleeve.

214
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,600
You will have to pay for this.

215
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,700
You will pay for beating him up too!

216
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,200
I will make sure you pay for everything!

217
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,900
Leave him.

218
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,920
He is an important person to whom I owe.

219
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,550
Damn it!

220
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,160
   

221
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,120
Hey, are you all right?

222
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,140
What about the red card? You kept it safe, did you not?

223
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,700
What happened? It was ripped in half.

224
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,080
What happened?

225
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,400
How dare he rip my red card?

226
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,000
 I will split it in half since you are all about fairness. 

227
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,920
 Share it nicely, and make sure to join Yongcheonru. 

228
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,560
What a despicable bastard.

229
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,150
Who did this?

230
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,650
Was it Kim Man Dol?

231
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,270
No, it was someone else.

232
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,190
You worked so hard to get that red card!

233
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,400
What do we do?

234
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,360
There is nothing we can do.

235
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,590
Since this happened,

236
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,220
I will move on to the next step.

237
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,630
Here are the gold bars for this month.

238
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,210
You should have sent them in a palanquin.

239
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,830
Why did you come here yourself?

240
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,410
I am a merchant to my core.

241
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:59,030
How could I entrust gold to mere servants?

242
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:03,120
Besides, this way I can visit the palace, which pleases me greatly.

243
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,100
Do you know how many eyes are watching in the palace?

244
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,660
The Minister of Defense will hear of this immediately.

245
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:17,150
Showing up at the palace will be no good... to you or to me.

246
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:22,720
How about you visit Yongcheonru, Your Majesty?

247
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,990
Pay a visit to your close friend who lives nearby sometime.

248
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,990
What did you say?

249
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,890
How dare you call yourself my close friend?

250
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,080
You treat my safe as though it is your own.

251
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,160
If that does not make us friends, then what am I to you?

252
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,990
How dare you insult me and the royal family over a few gold bars?

253
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,780
I am deeply ashamed, Your Majesty.

254
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,680
This lowly servant does not understand the laws of virtue.

255
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,710
I deserve to die.

256
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:04,390
Shall I double the gold bars for this crime,

257
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,340
making it twenty chests in total each month?

258
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,470
This lowly servant has committed a grave sin toward Your Majesty.

259
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,770
You need to tell me what you want from me so I may be forgiven.

260
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,730
Please tell me. What can I do for you?

261
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,100
What if he wants Yongcheonru?

262
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,870
I will give it to him.

263
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,560
Just as they say, Master Cheon's tongue is sharper than a sword.

264
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,590
Would you not agree, Father?

265
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,020
What are you doing here this late without notice?

266
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,230
I regrettably have an urgent request,

267
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,930
which is why I dared to come in haste.

268
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,880
An urgent request?

269
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,080
Did you say you would give him anything he wanted?

270
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,320
Yes, just ask me.

271
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,760
I heard Yongcheonru is accepting apprentices now.

272
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,180
I want to learn how to become a brilliant merchant like you.

273
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,060
What do you say?

274
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,310
Mu Yeong, what are you talking about?

275
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,920
The power to feed the people is as valuable as gold.

276
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,680
That is what you have always told me.

277
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,630
Thus, I would like to go in myself to learn about it.

278
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,190
Please allow me, Your Majesty.

279
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,950
However... even if His Majesty allows it,

280
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,750
if you join Yongcheonru,

281
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:23,400
you must learn as just another apprentice.

282
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,210
What did you say?

283
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,730
That is the rule at Gyohwadang of Yongcheonru.

284
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,210
No matter your status or background,

285
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,510
you start from the bottom and must endure to the end.

286
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:44,730
That is how we teach at Yongcheonru.

287
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,430
Are you sure you can accept that?

288
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,500
Of course.

289
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,930
He will become the crown prince soon,

290
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,850
yet he displays such humility.

291
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,290
You must feel very secure, Your Majesty.

292
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,380
It is not your place to flatter me.

293
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,250
I will respond to Prince Mu Yeong's request later.

294
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,270
You may leave now.

295
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,000
You want to join Yongcheonru?

296
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,150
How dare you come forward like this?

297
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,120
I know the object you are looking for is at Yongcheonru.

298
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,800
What is it? Please tell me.

299
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,210
It is the ledger.

300
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:05,160
The single weakness of those who treat me as a mere puppet.

301
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,750
I must find it and eradicate anyone who dares insult the royal family.

302
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,080
I will bring it to you immediately.

303
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,260
The golden key.

304
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,010
This is the only key that can open the safe with the ledger.

305
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,770
There are two halves that form a set, so you cannot unlock it with just one.

306
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:13,260
That Cheon hid one-half of the golden key somewhere in Yongcheonru,

307
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,290
and he is searching for the other half.

308
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,420
Mu Yeong, you must find it first.

309
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,590
For the sake of their benefits,

310
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,120
they placed someone powerless like me on the throne.

311
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:37,910
The only way to protect this fragile seat and the royal family

312
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,900
is to secure that ledger.

313
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:57,550
For the royal family, the nation, and for you, who are suffering,

314
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,850
I will enter that place and bring it to you.

315
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,120
   

316
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,230
 Give it to me! 

317
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,020
Jae On.

318
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,250
- Jae On. 
 - Father!

319
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,120
Let us go.

320
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,470
Father.

321
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,880
I am afraid, Father.

322
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,830
Yes, I know.

323
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,250
Yes...

324
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,690
Keep this thing with you.

325
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,200
You must never lose it.

326
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,930
Do you understand?

327
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,670
From now on, you must live as a boy.

328
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,940
Go far away. Far away.

329
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,170
You must never, ever go to Yongcheonru.

330
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,870
Do you understand?

331
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,930
Find Hong Min Shik's daughter!

332
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,390
Search everywhere!

333
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,500
She cannot be too far off!

334
00:36:51,770 --> 00:37:00,030
♫  Like sorrowful words of a song, scattered in the wind  ♫

335
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,740
♫  On nights when the dark comes calling  ♫

336
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,330
♫  Oh moonlight, silently weeping  ♫

337
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,780
♫  If the shadow of fate casts over me  ♫

338
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,750
♫  Light up this endless road for me  ♫

339
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,730
♫  Rise again  ♫

340
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,680
♫  Even if I crumble and fall  ♫

341
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,520
♫  Embracing the bitter scars in my heart  ♫

342
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,620
♫  Oh, flowing tears, remember for me  ♫

343
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,400
A stray cat roamed around all night as well.

344
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,120
How dare you touch my meat?

345
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,330
You should have left for good. Why did you come back?

346
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,660
Come on!

347
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,890
I will spoil you properly from now on.

348
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,000
You will regret it later if you treat me like this.

349
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,690
You will be sorry.

350
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,490
Spoil, my foot! Spoil, my foot!

351
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,760
Welcome.

352
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,860
Gosh, welcome.

353
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,070
Aigoo, aigoo! Have a seat.

354
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,380
Welcome.

355
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,580
- What would you like? 
 - We would like two bowls of rice and soup, please.

356
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,810
All right.

357
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,900
   

358
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,470
You have not looked into this for a while. It seems you started again.

359
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,210
I do not know whose precious daughter she is,

360
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,510
but they will pay 100 nyang just to hear about her.

361
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,260
I guess they are looking for her again.

362
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,830
It has been over a decade. She is probably dead by now.

363
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,920
Gosh, of course. She must have died.

364
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,550
All right.

365
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,180
- Make it quick. 
 - Yes.

366
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,400
Be generous. Be generous.

367
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,100
Buy some next time.

368
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,310
Yes, take care.

369
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,600
Aigoo, come this way.

370
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,110
- Is this all? 
 - It is top quality stuff.

371
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,690
- I will take this. 
 - Aigoo, thank you.

372
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,800
Hey, Hong Ddeok!

373
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,430
Will you buy more?

374
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,640
Be patient.

375
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,640
Hand me that one.

376
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,660
- This? 
 - Yes.

377
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,120
Here you go.

378
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,990
Yes.

379
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,890
I will have one ma of this. 
  (T/N: 35.8 centimeters or 14 inches) 

380
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,890
Got it. You have good taste.

381
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,950
Coming right up.

382
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,780
Nice.

383
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,530
Hong Deok Su, check this out.

384
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,710
This is from the Qing dynasty.

385
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,660
Wow.

386
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,120
Wow, what is that?

387
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,960
I thought you were wearing a mask.

388
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,510
What do you know about style, Hong Deok Su?

389
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,210
What do you know?

390
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,560
Seriously. Stop it.

391
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,690
I need to focus. Go.

392
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:56,150
It really does look identical.

393
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,610
You could forge the king's seals as well.

394
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:02,590
Of course. I am Hong Deok Su.

395
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:07,700
By the way, do you want to enter Yongcheonru this badly?

396
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,560
Yes.

397
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,360
There is someone I need to meet.

398
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,420
What? Who is it?

399
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,290
Lady Gyeongseodang tends to cough.

400
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,230
Keep powdery flowers away from her.

401
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,660
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:36,090
I set aside some agarwood from Seoyeok for our distinguished guests.

403
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,560
Shall we send some to the palace as well?

404
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,640
The palace?

405
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,720
That will not be necessary.

406
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,370
What will you do about Prince Mu Yeong?

407
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:54,300
He must be sending Prince Mu Yeong to look for the golden key.

408
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,580
I have everything under control.

409
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,740
Let them do what they want to do.

410
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,420
 Uncle! 

411
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,950
 Do not run, Eun. 

412
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,160
 - Uncle! 
 - Eun! 

413
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,950
 Gosh, it is Prince Mu Yeong. 

414
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,410
 Hyeongnim! 

415
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,090
 You are with the Crown Prince. 

416
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,340
 I told you to speak politely in front of His Majesty. 

417
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,810
 Just let him be. 

418
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,630
 He is my adorable nephew. 

419
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,800
 Hyeongnim, did you catch a cold? 

420
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:14,430
 Are you worried that he is sick? 

421
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,950
 I will protect you when you are unwell. 

422
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,050
 How dependable. 

423
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,200
 Yes, Prince Mu Yeong. 

424
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,990
 Will you promise me to protect him in the future? 

425
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,220
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

426
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,740
 Your Majesty! 

427
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,100
 Your Majesty! 

428
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,090
 Hyeongnim! 

429
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,660
 Father... 

430
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,670
 Father! 

431
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,820
 Father! 

432
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,610
 Father... 

433
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,480
Why are you standing here so late?

434
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,240
Did the physician visit you?

435
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,290
Of course. He brings medicine every morning and evening.

436
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:29,840
It is a hassle seeing him all the time.

437
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:35,880
Please take care of yourself and endure, Hyeongnim.

438
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,480
The royal family must remain strong.

439
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,470
Uncle...

440
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:47,120
I mean, His Majesty is well, is he not?

441
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,880
Your well-being and His Majesty's well-being matter more.

442
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,810
Please promise me.

443
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,580
Twenty-eight...

444
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,190
Are you sure you can go there on your own?

445
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,740
There is only one red card. I must go alone.

446
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,020
There is no other way.

447
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,220
I will always be near you.

448
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,920
Beom Ho?

449
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,230
What are you doing right now?

450
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,100
   

451
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,310
Yongcheonru.

452
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,960
What is that? Aigoo...

453
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,680
What is all this?

454
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,900
So meaty.

455
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,600
Are you truly leaving?

456
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,800
I told Gu Shil to help you prepare soup and rice.

457
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,320
Do not make it alone at dawn.

458
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,230
You never listen to your mother.

459
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:58,300
Do not bother coming back once you leave.

460
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,680
Eat. Keep your belly full.

461
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,230
You must eat while it is hot. It is no good cold.

462
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,740
Do not starve wherever you are, understood?

463
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,230
Yes.

464
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,460
Geez! What is the point of going there, anyway?

465
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,670
I will try not to make you worry, Mother.

466
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:31,760
How long will you be there? A month?

467
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,300
I will come back sooner if I get fired.

468
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,290
Even if you do not,

469
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,890
just come back without getting caught.

470
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,090
I will not get caught.

471
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,400
- You eat some, too. 
 - I am fine.

472
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,980
Come on. Say, ah. Ah!

473
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,370
- Aigoo. 
 - Say, ah.

474
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,390
So tasty. So tasty.

475
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,570
- Eat more. 
 - I am fine.

476
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,600
Let us eat together. Come here.

477
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,310
- You eat it. 
 - I do not want to. Let us eat together.

478
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,850
- You are traveling far. 
 - I do not want it, then.

479
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,760
Okay, okay. Let us eat together.

480
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,780
 This is so much chicken. 

481
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,020
 Aigoo. 

482
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,420
   

483
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,020
When will you let me in?

484
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,770
I will keel over from frustration before I even get to try this Geumbing or whatever it is.

485
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:16,350
How precious it must be if they only sell five bowls a day.

486
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:20,250
This is all a marketing scheme.

487
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,090
Do not worry. We are the fifth on the list.

488
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,140
You will eat it today.

489
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,230
 Get out of the way! Get out of the way! 

490
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:31,170
Who are those people? Why are they passing us?

491
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:34,500
Stop right there.

492
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,330
Who are you? Why are you cutting in line?

493
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,960
What is this about?

494
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,490
Geumbing is sold out today.

495
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,220
I am the fifth customer. The last one.

496
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,640
Do you know who I am?

497
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,260
- Go in. 
 - How dare you cut in line—

498
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,510
Move!

499
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,200
Aigoo!

500
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,970
My Lady!

501
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,250
Welcome. We were waiting for you.

502
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,650
I told you so.

503
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,290
It is only right to follow the order.

504
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,210
Order? What order?

505
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:16,370
- You made people line up. You must follow that order. 
 - I agree.

506
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,800
Tell the Investigation Bureau what is right and wrong.

507
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,530
This is Yongcheonru.

508
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:25,580
Yongcheonru decides the rules and order.

509
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,190
Let us go.

510
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,900
Thank you for speaking up for me.

511
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,060
No need to compensate. Travel safely.

512
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,540
Well...

513
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,840
I have an idea. Would you like to hear it?

514
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,740
Excuse me...

515
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,610
A shallow scheme might look useful now,

516
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:50,870
but it always ends up being dirty.

517
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,950
What a cool line. Thank you.

518
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:58,870
So, what is the shallow scheme that might look useful?

519
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:03,150
My schemes tend to be dirty in the end, but...

520
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,090
What should we do?

521
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,640
Let us see them walking away.

522
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,500
All right.

523
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,660
    
  (T/N: Yongcheonru's food court) 

524
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,890
Long time no see, Lord Yu.

525
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:31,450
Yeonhwajeon is busy this morning.

526
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:35,720
Everyone has heard about how delicious Geumbing is.

527
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,630
I am here to try the famous Geumbing, too.

528
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:42,970
 - Oh my!  
 - That must be Geumbing.

529
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,360
 Gosh, I finally get to see it. 

530
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,500
 It looks so delicious. 

531
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,590
 Oh my, look at that! 

532
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,280
You work hard as usual.

533
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,070
Yes, My Lady.

534
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:12,760
This is the Geumbing. Only five bowls are made per day.

535
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:18,180
That is why I, unfortunately, did not get to eat it.

536
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:22,520
Enjoy, then.

537
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,880
What do you think you are doing?

538
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,810
Pardon?

539
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,980
This is not Geumbing.

540
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,170
W-What?

541
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,760
Pardon? That is not true.

542
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,950
It is Geumbing that came straight from Yeonhwajeon.

543
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,940
Just because this is her first time trying Geumbing,

544
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,650
you are trying to trick her like this?

545
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:45,720
Geumbing needs to have plenty of condensed milk on it.

546
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,340
Is there even a drop of condensed milk on this?

547
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,240
The thing is... That is not right—

548
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,610
Tell me the truth!

549
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:58,080
The thing is, you might get a stomachache if you never had condensed milk before.

550
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,140
Did you not skip it because it is expensive?

551
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,700
I will pay for it if you cannot afford it.

552
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,690
Bring her the proper Geumbing immediately.

553
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,590
Do not treat a customer like a fool.

554
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,430
Forget it!

555
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,390
Bring plenty of condensed milk right now!

556
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,120
I do not care how much it costs.

557
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,730
Bring everything you have!

558
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,220
Yes, My Lady.

559
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:43,230
Geumbing is a summer dessert made with finely shaved ice,

560
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:47,250
- sweetened red beans, fruit, and condensed milk. 
 - So?

561
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:52,310
The lady who just went in has a narrow face and slender features.

562
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,840
She must be the Soeum type. 
  (T/N: reflects the dominance of yin energy, but in a moderate form) 

563
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,380
What does face reading have to do with Geumbing?

564
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,930
Because the Soeum type and condensed milk do not mix well.

565
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,250
You cannot eat that much, My Lady!

566
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,190
Please stop eating.

567
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,350
What? What is it?

568
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,850
My gosh, my gosh, my gosh. Aigoo!

569
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,810
Her stomach is upset.

570
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,670
- She got sick from being greedy. 
 - My Lady, are you all right?

571
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,970
 She was sick in the restroom for a long time. 

572
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,920
She just returned home.

573
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,290
Lord Yu tried to stop her,

574
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,810
but she apparently ate an entire bowl of condensed milk.

575
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:46,470
A customer at Yeonhwajeon recommended condensed milk?

576
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,880
Yes.

577
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,870
That sly man must have told her earlier.

578
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:02,450
I do not know who he is, but he is certainly clever.

579
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:07,690
I hope the new apprentices at Gyohwadang are just as clever.

580
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,390
No.

581
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:14,890
Maybe he is just a troublemaker rather than clever.

582
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,220
Welcome. Go up there.

583
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:46,020
Pick up the goods once you are registered.

584
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,700
- Excuse me. 
 - Oh, you startled me!

585
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,300
Why are you so startled?

586
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,260
Are you jumpy because you are short?

587
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,020
My name is Cheon Jun Hwa.

588
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,010
I am Hong Deok Su.

589
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,690
I did not suggest holding hands.

590
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,170
Carry this for me.

591
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:27,630
Men should not hold hands. It is embarrassing.

592
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,890
What?

593
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:36,720
I just learned one person can only bring two bags

594
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,930
after bringing this many.

595
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:42,130
Gosh, I am so sorry to hear that.

596
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,680
I am sorry, too.

597
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,590
What am I supposed to do? I cannot throw these away.

598
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,790
You did not bring any bags.

599
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,930
It would be perfect if you carried mine.

600
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,690
I do not want to.

601
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:02,090
Right. Merchants make deals.

602
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,910
This is filled with jerky and snacks.

603
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,540
I heard the training is so harsh that it makes you hungry all the time.

604
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,190
This way.

605
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,810
I will give you a tenth of it.

606
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:24,220
- Five tenths. 
 - F-Five tenths?

607
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,870
What merchant demands half the goods after carrying them once?

608
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,760
Throw it away if you do not want to.

609
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,660
Two tenths.

610
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,190
Two tenths. Not more.

611
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,410
This is Damyang jerky. Have you not heard of it?

612
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,550
The king eats it, too. It is premium stuff.

613
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,400
Five tenths.

614
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:47,180
I ran into a thief as soon as I came to Yongcheonru.

615
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,730
Okay. Five tenths.

616
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:58,400
So, half of what is in this bag is mine, correct?

617
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,160
That was the deal, after all.

618
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,420
Thank you for your service.

619
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,310
   

620
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,260
Well...

621
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,900
   

622
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,420
   

623
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,130
Attention, everyone.

624
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,650
My name is Bang Sa Seon.

625
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:31,320
I am your instructor.

626
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,960
Since you entered Gyohwadang,

627
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,790
you are pupas now.

628
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:38,660
What are pupas? They are insects.

629
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,290
You are past the larval stage,

630
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:42,170
but you have not yet become butterflies.

631
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,690
You are pupas.

632
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:46,120
You are insects. Understand?

633
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,090
 - Yes.  
 - Yes.

634
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:51,700
Yongcheonru is all about results.

635
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:55,900
You either move up by earning points,

636
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,250
or you move down by receiving penalties.

637
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,710
What happens when you reach the bottom?

638
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:04,050
You get kicked out immediately.

639
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:09,330
Now, you pupas will change into your uniforms

640
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,110
and assemble in the courtyard.

641
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,390
It is first come, first serve. What happens if you are late?

642
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:16,100
You die.

643
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,340
What are you doing? Move quickly!

644
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,760
W-Where?

645
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,660
R-Right here?

646
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,720
Excuse me.

647
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:10,950
Excuse me. Excuse me. Have you seen my uniform?

648
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:13,350
Let go of me.

649
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,760
Y-You. You ripped my red card.

650
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,460
Were you a Yongcheonru apprentice as well?

651
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,160
That is why you ripped my red card.

652
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,380
You bastard!

653
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,420
W-What are you doing? Are you crazy?

654
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,200
Just one moment. It will take just a moment.

655
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,920
A moment, my foot.

656
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,430
Move.

657
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,170
Hey, excuse me.

658
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:06,830
- Just talk instead, all right? 
 - Damn it!

659
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:10,230
Crazy bastard, how dare you rip my top? Should I rip yours, too?

660
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,420
You just need to show it to me once. One second.

661
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,720
Hey, hey, hey!

662
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,600
You are fighting so hard, even on the first day.

663
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,500
You sure are young. How energetic.

664
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,610
I just need to check under his inner shirt!

665
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:25,250
What the...

666
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,500
Why do you want to see a man's bare chest?

667
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,870
What is this nonsense?

668
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:31,800
Who do you think you are?

669
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,490
Bare chest? How vulgar...

670
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,190
Disgusting bastard.

671
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,720
How dare you? Who are you calling disgusting?

672
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,530
- You bastard. 
 - Gosh, why...

673
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,660
Excuse me. Let go of him.

674
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,660
I just need to check once. Just once.

675
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,270
What is there to check between men? Let go!

676
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,230
You get kicked out if you cause trouble on the first day.

677
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:54,740
- Let go of him. 
 - Excuse me.

678
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,920
I think our uniforms swapped.

679
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,960
What is this now?

680
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:03,210
Our uniforms were swapped!

681
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:04,430
It will just take a moment.

682
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:07,980
   

683
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:12,840
Move quickly!

684
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,600
First come, first serve. Do you not know?

685
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,190
What brings you here, Master Innkeeper?

686
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:23,220
I had to come to see the Yongcheonru's newcomers.

687
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,840
Oh, yes.

688
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:31,020
Move quickly!

689
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,890
Move faster!

690
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:36,640
First come, first serve!

691
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,210
I told you not to do this here!

692
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,850
This is my uniform, I said.

693
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,790
Take a look if you have eyes, too.

694
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:52,220
They are obviously different sizes.

695
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,870
Size?

696
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:56,000
What size? What?

697
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,630
This is my uniform, I said.

698
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,340
- Let go! 
 - What are you bastards doing?

699
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:11,590
You are all getting penalties.

700
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,370
    
  Find Hong Min Shik! 

701
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:45,790
 Find him! 

702
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,790
Find Hong Min Shik!

703
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,570
Give us the key!

704
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,500
Where is the key?

705
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:57,740
Where is the golden key?

706
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:00,660
Keep this thing with you.

707
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,110
You must never lose it.

708
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,860
Do you understand?

709
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:09,620
From now on, you must live as a boy.

710
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,610
Once you go over this fence,

711
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:19,390
you are no longer Hong Jae On.

712
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:23,930
But I am Hong Jae On.

713
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:26,370
I am Jae On, your daughter.

714
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:27,650
No, you are not!

715
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,400
You are no longer my daughter!

716
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,670
No one can find out you are Hong Jae On and a girl.

717
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,760
Do you understand?

718
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,890
Yes.

719
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,780
All right.

720
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,350
You have to go.

721
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,910
- Go now. 
  - Find Hong Min Shik! 

722
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,040
Go now! I said, go!

723
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,500
Go now.

724
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:33,940


725
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:42,070
   

726
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,030
♫  I walk alone on this thorny path  ♫

727
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:55,180
♫  Questions etched deeply into my shattered heart  ♫

728
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:59,580
♫  Rekindling the flame of my frozen soul  ♫

729
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:04,320
♫  Facing the dark night that crashes upon me  ♫

730
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,330
♫  When the world keeps, keeps, keeps  ♫

731
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:07,740
 I saw the gold key. 

732
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,510
 It was not Master Cheon. Someone else had it. 

733
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:14,320
 Who is he, exactly? 

734
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,270
 Are you hiding something? 

735
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:19,650
 What a strange bastard. I will not get tricked. 

736
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,190
 Your hands are small and beautiful. 

737
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,700
 This is how a true man studies. 

738
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,620
 He is far too suspicious. 

739
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:28,060
 Lee Eun Ho? I have to share a room with him? 

740
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,010
 - You are hiding something in your shirt. 
 - Come on! 

741
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:35,090
 - Be careful, Hong Deok Su. 
 - Hey, Lee Eun Ho. You little... 

742
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:36,610
 What are you looking at? 

743
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,390
 Hong Deok Su, you cannot get expelled just yet. 

744
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:41,040
 I am saying you need to behave. 

745
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,790
 Where does the Master Innkeeper live? 

746
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:45,720
 Someone killed a person to steal a red card. 

747
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:50,210
 He wanted to go to Yongcheonru badly enough to kill a person? 

748
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:52,990
 - How about the other half? 
 - Who is over there? 

749
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:56,880
 Someone must have forged a stolen red card and entered Gyohwadang. 

750
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,120
 Master Innkeeper, I have been wanting to meet you.
