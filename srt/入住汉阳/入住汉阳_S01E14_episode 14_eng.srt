1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
   

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,720
   

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,630
You made sure to silence the physician, correct? 
    

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,980
If this is revealed, we shall both be ruined.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,880
There is no one that gold cannot silence.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,930
That is impossible.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,430
By chance, did you also record the bribery for the physician?

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,600
Of course not.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,580
Your obsession with the ledger is like an illness.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,350
Matters like that will harm you later.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,030
You worry too much.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,740
Do you think this is a joke right now?

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,870
This is about changing the ruler of the country.

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,190
I have already gotten rid of all of it.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,660
Do not worry.

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:10,220


17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,620
Aigoo, you have arrived, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,090
Once today is over, you will be the king.

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,740
Did you receive approval for the transfer of power?

20
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,330
Everything is proceeding according to the plan.

21
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,720
Please do not worry.

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,570
Where will my older brother live once he leaves the palace?

23
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,780
You said you would find him a place, Cheon.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,270
Yes.

25
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,670
I have prepared a comfortable place for him.

26
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,870
Everything was decided by the Heavens.

27
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,000
There is no turning back now.

28
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,610
For the country and Prince Eun Seong,

29
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,850
you must make up your mind.

30
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,950
Prolonging it will not benefit either of us.

31
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,410
How about Prince Eun Seong—

32
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,500
I will take good care of him.

33
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,940
Here, His Majesty has fainted!

34
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,680
Is anyone out there?

35
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,170
Your Majesty!

36
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,320
   

37
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,290
You said you would gain approval for the transfer of power from him.

38
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,210
But you used poison.

39
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,460
We have arrived at the same result.

40
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,120
Your Majesty,

41
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,820
it is now time to think of the country.

42
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,710
Have you not heard from the Royal Guard yet?

43
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,580
No, Your Majesty.

44
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,100
 Conduct yourselves properly. 

45
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,090
Raise your head.

46
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,310
Cheon Jun Hwa,

47
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,700
take Hong Deok Su with you.

48
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,940
Lee Eun Ho,

49
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,960
you are... Prince Mu Yeong?

50
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,490
We shall return to the palace.

51
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,750
Guard him.

52
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,410
 Do you not know that she might be in danger by remaining at your side? 

53
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,200
 You should... leave now. 

54
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,000
He told you to kill everyone here?

55
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,210
You taught me one must not wield the sword against those

56
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,740
who do not know how to use it, Master.

57
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,740
I only carry out the King's order.

58
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,460
Let us go back, Hong Deok Su.

59
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,710
Hong Deok Su.

60
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,050
Hong Deok Su.

61
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
Yes?

62
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,970
It is nothing.

63
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,080
Let us go in.

64
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,930
You should receive treatment.

65
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,870
Does it hurt greatly?

66
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,130
I am fine as long as you are safe.

67
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,800
You are not fine.

68
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,140
How did you know I was there?

69
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,710
How about you?

70
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,740
What were you doing there with Prince Mu Yeong?

71
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,950
Did you know...

72
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,100
Lee Eun Ho was Prince Mu Yeong?

73
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,750
Yes.

74
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,100
How...

75
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,220
How could that be?

76
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,050
We live in a different world than he does, Hong Deok Su.

77
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:46,130
You will be hurt if you stay with one you should not be with.

78
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,920
It is not too late to walk away.

79
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,710
That is the right thing to do.

80
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,360
I heard their families were enemies.

81
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,570
Just as my father died unjustly,

82
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,590
Lee Eun Ho's family was also...

83
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,990
wronged by Master Cheon.

84
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,620
And he needed to take revenge.

85
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,650
What did Master Cheon do?

86
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,810
That is why the two of us...

87
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,670
No, let us stop.

88
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,030
It has nothing to do with you.

89
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,070
A soldier came from the palace?

90
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,620
Yes. Although he did not wear a uniform,

91
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,600
he was highly skilled in martial arts.

92
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,530
He must be the Royal Guard.

93
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,420
He has dispatched his secret weapon, the precious Royal Guard.

94
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,480
The King must feel desperately cornered.

95
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,420
All right.

96
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,320
It is more exciting to strike back when they resist.

97
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,710
How about the ledger?

98
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,610
The fight was already in progress when I arrived.

99
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,940
I could not acquire it.

100
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,670
Where is Hong Deok Su at present?

101
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,980
I heard you were injured.

102
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,250
It is nothing.

103
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,440
Hong Deok Su...

104
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,230
I mean, Hong Jae On's father. I heard he was once your friend.

105
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,820
He was my only friend.

106
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,830
How... did he pass away?

107
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,660
Why do you ask me that?

108
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,950
You said Hong Jae On and I were meant to be.

109
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,260
Of course, I wish to know about her father.

110
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,000
Hong Jae On’s father, Hong Min Shik...

111
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,250
By chance,

112
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,940
did you really...

113
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,380
was killed by Seol Mae Hwa.

114
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,030
Pardon?

115
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,270
Master Innkeeper Seol Mae Hwa?

116
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,220
Twelve years ago on that day,

117
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,640
after the incident,

118
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,070
many complicated things followed.

119
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,950
Hong Jae On knows it well, too.

120
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:41,100
She witnessed Seol Mae Hwa stabbing her father.

121
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,980
By the time I ran to aid him,

122
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,060
it was already over.

123
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,350
I was too late.

124
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,460
You knew Seol Mae Hwa was the culprit.

125
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,580
So, why did you keep her at Yongcheonru?

126
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,820
I did not know until Jae On told me.

127
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,110
However, once I found out,

128
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,020
I could not simply let it go.

129
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,820
That is why... you got rid of Seol Mae Hwa.

130
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,250
I require your support.

131
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,970
I will take responsibility for Hong Jae On from now on.

132
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,630
All right.

133
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,540
What do you want?

134
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,320
   

135
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,040
 Your Majesty. 

136
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,560
You are late.

137
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,300
How about the ledger? Did you find it?

138
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,780
Come and speak.

139
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,180
What did you...

140
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,010
hide from me?

141
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,600
Why...

142
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,100
is your name in the ledger?

143
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,540
Hand me the ledger.

144
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,060
I must verify something first.

145
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,930
What are you trying to verify?

146
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,700
Twelve years ago,

147
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,340
the former king did not die of illness.

148
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,580
He was poisoned. Is that what you are confirming?

149
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,290
The names of the former king's physician and attendant court lady were in the ledger.

150
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,190
Even the receipt for the poison was there.

151
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,920
I shall explain in time.

152
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,500
Hand me the ledger now.

153
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,450
I know you are aware of how wicked the Minister of Defense and Cheon are.

154
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,860
By chance,

155
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,280
were you and the Minister of Defense...

156
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,370
involved in the former king's death?

157
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,720
No, correct?

158
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,510
Father, please...

159
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,970
No.

160
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,020
That is not true.

161
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:27,620
I intended to persuade my brother and gain his approval to transfer power.

162
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,440
I did not know they would poison him either.

163
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,240
That is precisely when...

164
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,440
That is when you should have stopped them.

165
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,080
I wanted the approval first, to be on the throne,

166
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,820
and then prevent them from disgracing the royal family again.

167
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,620
Thus,

168
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,380
you collaborated with those vile people?

169
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,330
You do not understand the plight of a powerless king.

170
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,980
You are not permitted to do anything at your own will.

171
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,010
Father.

172
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,900
But that will change now.

173
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,560
I have the ledger.

174
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,950
It is my chance to remove the Minister of Defense.

175
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,500
A family was ruined because of that ledger.

176
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,050
A family?

177
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,610
Do you mean Hong Min Shik's?

178
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:46,100
Are you aware of how his daughter has lived?

179
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:52,100
She has lived in torment every day, waiting to avenge her father.

180
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:13,140
Do you only see her suffering,

181
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,620
and not your father's?

182
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,450
- Father. 
 - Hand me the ledger now.

183
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,640
I will handle the rest.

184
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,010
The ledger...

185
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,900
is not with me.

186
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,730
What?

187
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:40,310
Countless innocent people died because of that ledger.

188
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,570
How could I bring it here knowing that?

189
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,130
- Prince Mu Yeong! 
 - Father!

190
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,740
Father,

191
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,290
you cannot fix one mistake with another.

192
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,930
I heard you were doing pointless things,

193
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,980
but I never imagined you would jeopardize such a critical matter over a woman.

194
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,100
How...

195
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,540
How could you have left the ledger behind?

196
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,640
An critical matter?

197
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,200
Perhaps you merely told yourself it was important.

198
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,750
What do you know?

199
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,030
Do you believe I only do this to save myself?

200
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,160
Insolent bastard.

201
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Father, Prince Eun Seong, the royal family, everything.

202
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,230
I will restore it all to its rightful place.

203
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,380
I will make a different choice than you

204
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,030
and prove myself.

205
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,370
Royal Guard!

206
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,550
Confine him to his residence at once.

207
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,600
Ensure he cannot leave.

208
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,550
- Father. 
 - Imprison him... and go to Yongcheonru.

209
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,010
Go and bring me the ledger.

210
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,360
I do not care who has it.

211
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,010
If anyone tries to stop you, kill them.

212
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,670
I will carry out the order.

213
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,720
You cannot, Father.

214
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,130
- Let us go. 
 - You cannot.

215
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,940
- Father. 
 - Take him!

216
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,480
You must stop, Father!

217
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,060
Father!

218
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,140
You must stop, Father!

219
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,120
 Father! 

220
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,280
 I promise. 

221
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,690
 No matter what transpires, 

222
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,290
 I shall endeavour to protect you. 

223
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:15,160
 Whether you are Hong Deok Su or Hong Jae On, 

224
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,310
 I have resolved to keep only you... 

225
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,490
 in my heart... 

226
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,390
 regardless of which one you are. 

227
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,780
 You are right, Hong Deok Su. 

228
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,840
 It is far better to rely on one another. 

229
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,710
 I have never lived as a woman. 

230
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:47,490
 Although matters would be awkward and difficult, 

231
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,500
 I shall still endeavour, Lee Eun Ho. 

232
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,690
   

233
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,750
Open the door.

234
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,150
Tell them Master Innkeeper Seol Mae Hwa of Yongcheonru is here.

235
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,840
I am

236
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:54,080
Seol Mae Hwa of Yongcheonru in Hanyang.

237
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,210
I know.

238
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:16,390
And this is where you will meet your end tonight.

239
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,260
Allow me to see the merchant leader.

240
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,020
What is this injury? Were you harmed?

241
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,630
I am all right.

242
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,330
What happened?

243
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,330
You were bringing Deok Su back. Why were you hurt?

244
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,000
Go Su Ra,

245
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,570
I must learn what Hong Deok Su does, where she goes,

246
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,840
whom she meets, and what she considers.

247
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,850
That is the only way for me to protect her.

248
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,260
- What? 
 - You said...

249
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,190
you would help me, correct?

250
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,990
From this moment forward, you shall inform me about Hong Deok Su every day.

251
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,360
Cheon Jun Hwa,

252
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,230
you truly resemble your father.

253
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,980
- What? 
 - What exactly took place?

254
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,380
Where is Lee Eun Ho now?

255
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,240
That man returned to where he belongs. That is all.

256
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,790
"That man"?

257
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,400
- Do you not care about your friend anymore? 
 - Lee Eun Ho is actually...

258
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,230
Prince Mu Yeong.

259
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,870
We were never truly friends.

260
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,120
He is royalty.

261
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,770
He returned to his rightful place,

262
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,140
so it will all resolve in time.

263
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,130
- But Cheon Jun Hwa— 
 - Please do as I ask.

264
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,680
I beg you.

265
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,520
Please go to the northern back gate.

266
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,400
Hyeongnim.

267
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,290
- Leave through here. 
 - How...

268
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,280
I have removed the guards outside for now.

269
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,420
You must follow your chosen path.

270
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,630
Hyeongnim.

271
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,140
There is no time. We can speak later.

272
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,640
Hurry.

273
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,490
   

274
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,690
 Go and bring me the ledger. 

275
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,250
 I do not care who has it. 

276
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,260
 If someone tries to stop you, kill them. 

277
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,590
Was that the only reason?

278
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,890
It was...

279
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,990
all for the ledger?

280
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,700
No.

281
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,710
- This is— 
 - You should have merely asked for it.

282
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,320
How...

283
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,930
My father dispatched an assassin.

284
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,970
Possessing this ledger puts you in danger.

285
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,900
Do not involve yourself.

286
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,150
It is my concern.

287
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,310
Do not appear before me again,

288
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,290
Prince Mu Yeong.

289
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,270
Leave now.

290
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,160
If that is the case, let me accompany you, Hong Deok Su.

291
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,390
It is too perilous for you alone.

292
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,520
Whatever you plan, I will assist you, no matter what it is.

293
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,590
- Lee Eun Ho— 
 - I will never...

294
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,090
I shall never leave you behind.

295
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:38,010
I will not give up or withdraw.

296
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,090
Do you know what that implies?

297
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,730
I might end up raising a sword against your father.

298
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,240
Will you still help me?

299
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,400
So that I could stop him.

300
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,680
Assisting you...

301
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:08,100
is the only way for me to stop my father from committing further wrongdoings..

302
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,050
Is that so?

303
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,910
Then would you serve as bait in my trap?

304
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,460
Gosh, they are appointing a new master innkeeper.

305
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,120
Why are you so pleased?

306
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,400
The master innkeeper position is open. It is about time.

307
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,790
Head Host, by chance...

308
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:02,020
Of course, I will be appointed. My abilities are outstanding.

309
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,010
What should I tackle first when I am appointed?

310
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,940
Should I assemble some people from Ulju?

311
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,260
What do you think, Head Manager?

312
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,380
- Head Manager. 
 - W-What?

313
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,060
What has you so preoccupied?

314
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,210
You have been sneaking out at night.

315
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,600
You seem quite busy these days.

316
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,700
What do you mean busy? Goodness.

317
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,880
Well, I am occupied indeed.

318
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,110
Pardon me.

319
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,420
My gosh. My gosh. My gosh.

320
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,000
How suspicious.

321
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,930
By chance, is the Head Manager also trying to become the master innkeeper?

322
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,000
Aigoo...

323
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,310
We have had no word from Seol Mae Hwa.

324
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,730
I fear something unpleasant may have happened to her.

325
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,270
Aigoo.

326
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:08,900
So, did you have a pleasant visit to your father's house?

327
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,550
Did you locate the safe?

328
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,670
Why do you appear so startled?

329
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,430
My apologies.

330
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:30,500
I intended to get the ledger for you last night,

331
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,840
but I was forced to abandon it.

332
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,070
Lead the way.

333
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,650
I must finally go and claim it.

334
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,890
So this was the place.

335
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,180
It was right here, and I never knew.

336
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,000
- Move aside. 
 - Yes.

337
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,060
It was definitely here.

338
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:30,110
Did you open this with Prince Mu Yeong last night?

339
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,430
Yes.

340
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,740
Jo Seung Ryang, find Prince Mu Yeong.

341
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,100
That bastard took the ledger.

342
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,530
Yes, sir.

343
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,630
Let us go.

344
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:19,420
 Those three who killed my father twelve years ago all seek this ledger. 

345
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,840
 I will ensure they destroy one another while fighting for it. 

346
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,300
 Lee Eun Ho, you must be the bait 

347
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,610
 and reveal that the Minister of Defense has the ledger. 

348
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:33,980
 Whether the King's assassin or Cheon, 

349
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,160
 I will lead them to suspect the Minister of Defense. 

350
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:12,360
We are not close enough to stand face to face like this.

351
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,130
I have brought you a present today.

352
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,440
Would you not be pleased?

353
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
A present?

354
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,990
For me, do you mean?

355
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,860
What is this?

356
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,950
This... This ledger.

357
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,760
   

358
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,830
Where did you get this?

359
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,070
Why... Why... Why...

360
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:30,730
Why did you... bring this to me?

361
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,710
I must...

362
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,810
remove Cheon.

363
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,140
Pardon?

364
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,300
I must safeguard my father and the royal family.

365
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,200
Your grandson, Prince Seon Yang, is also a royal descendant.

366
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,520
So,

367
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:02,120
you will... use me as a weapon to eliminate Cheon?

368
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,460
Those of noble blood should unite at times like this.

369
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,420
You should not have conspired with someone of low birth like Cheon to accomplish a great deed.

370
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,440
He created this ledger in the end.

371
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,960
I suppose that is true.

372
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:25,600
If you vow to get rid of Cheon,

373
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,780
I shall give you this ledger.

374
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,430
That is quite satisfactory.

375
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,580
We have evidence now.

376
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:58,140
We must arrest the traitor and restore order to the nation.

377
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,860
Many seek the ledger.

378
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,700
You had best keep it secure.

379
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:15,330
Your father and I were friends even before you were born.

380
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,610
Once,

381
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:24,150
we believed we could conquer the world together.

382
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,690
Jae On,

383
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,780
Hong Jae On,

384
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,350
you cannot be thinking of doing something else.

385
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:50,050
You are my friend Hong Min Shik's only child.

386
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,670
That ledger is perilous.

387
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:03,410
Anyone who tries to own it will certainly die.

388
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,360
That is why I sent Jun Hwa last night.

389
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,160
To protect you, Jae On.

390
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,920
Cheon Jun Hwa?

391
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,980
Yes.

392
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,080
Cheon Jun Hwa is my son.

393
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,930
Jun Hwa...

394
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,020
Jun Hwa is your son, Master Cheon?

395
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:51,090
Your father shared your name with Jun Hwa.

396
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,250
Jun Hwa and Jae On.

397
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:58,930
I believe you two share one destiny.

398
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:03,730
Although your father and I failed to fulfill our dream together,

399
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:07,340
I trust you two will differ.

400
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,890
Jae On,

401
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,140
could you realize that dream?

402
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,920
Hong Deok Su.

403
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,770
We are told to go to Chinyeongrae now. Come with us.

404
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,930
All right. Let us go.

405
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,560
Where have you been this time?

406
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,470
Do not wander as you please anymore.

407
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:51,120
Much remains to be done.

408
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,850
Was that an order just now?

409
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,320
Can you not see that I do this for you?

410
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,890
Do as I say. It will be in your favor.

411
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,630
Hey, what are you doing at this hour?

412
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:14,410
Let us go. Hurry.

413
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,450
They are about to post the notice!

414
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,520
It is finally revealed, Master Innkeeper Yu Su In.

415
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,150
Welcome. Congratulations!

416
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,910
Why is everyone assembled?

417
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,690
Seong Jin seonbaenim,

418
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,480
we Ulju family should gather sometime.

419
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,070
Since we have Head Host Yu being named the master innkeeper,

420
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,950
let us hold a big celebration!

421
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,970
Come now.

422
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,730
Shall we?

423
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,890
I can hardly bear to watch this.

424
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,460
Head Host Yu, I will take my leave.

425
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,960
Please enjoy.

426
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,840
Hyeongnim, where are you going?

427
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,740
Once Head Host Yu is appointed master innkeeper,

428
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,670
I will wipe out those Bottom-Tier bastards first.

429
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,820
We must annihilate them, Hyeongnim.

430
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,880
Who says you can do that?

431
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,190
Gosh...

432
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,060
You would be thrown out first if you speak carelessly, Kim Myeong Ho.

433
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,370
Aigoo, those Bottom-Tier bastards...

434
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:33,300
You still have not learned your lesson and run your mouths.

435
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,220
Just wait and see, you bastards.

436
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,960
All right, all right! Here it comes!

437
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,000
The new master innkeeper, Yu Su In...

438
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,510
No. 
    

439
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,840
Cheon Jun Hwa?

440
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,800
   

441
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:59,070
The master innkeeper's assistants are...

442
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,710
Hong Deok Su and G-Go Su Ra?

443
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,320
What?

444
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,170
Everyone, greet him.

445
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:33,840
This is Master Cheon's only son and our new master innkeeper.

446
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:39,390
He studied in the Qing dynasty and took the innkeeper exam alongside you for practical training,

447
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:43,650
yet from now on, he is the master innkeeper.

448
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,350
My gosh. My gosh.

449
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,990
Goodness!

450
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,800
Damn it.

451
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,240
I wanted to tell you sooner.

452
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,100
Are you shocked?

453
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,150
From now on, as master innkeeper,

454
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:42,150
I will make the best decisions for you.

455
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,150
You, Cheon Jun Hwa?

456
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,180
Master Cheon's son, Cheon Jun Hwa?

457
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:06,110
You... are wrong about my father, Hong Deok Su.

458
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,430
Go Su Ra,

459
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,930
you knew everything, did you not?

460
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,990
You clung to Cheon Jun Hwa because you knew all along.

461
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,610
What a sly bastard.

462
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:33,970
Move aside.

463
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,370
What?

464
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,190
Did you prefer crawling between Cheon Jun Hwa's legs rather than mine?

465
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,890
Kim Myeong Ho!

466
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,280
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! Are you all right?

467
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,960
Go Su Ra, you bastard!

468
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,570
Move!

469
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:03,160
How dare an innkeeper strike the master innkeeper?

470
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,000
Have you lost your mind?

471
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,580
W-Well... Go Su Ra punched first.

472
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,280
Yes!

473
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,910
Yes, he did, sir.

474
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,970
Crawl.

475
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:33,560
If you crawl between Go Su Ra's legs,

476
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,630
I will let you keep your position.

477
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,590
W-What did you say?

478
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,080
- Gosh, Master Innkeeper. 
 - Master Innkeeper.

479
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,660
Do you refuse?

480
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,590
Then, Du Shik, you crawl instead.

481
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,860
Pardon?

482
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,450
Are you telling me to crawl, then?

483
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,290
Stop, Cheon Jun Hwa.

484
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,790
You bastard!

485
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,860
How dare you address the master innkeeper as "Cheon Jun Hwa"?

486
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:19,140
I-I know. How dare you call the new master innkeeper by his name?

487
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,520
You should simply depart.

488
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:31,410
I will not forgive you if you mistreat my assistant further.

489
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,510
Leave my sight.

490
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,960
- Let us go, Hyeongnim. 
 - Let us go.

491
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,750
Let go.

492
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,080
I wanted to see them crawl between your legs.

493
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:06,960
I will be fair and make them pay for their misdeeds.

494
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,710
Fair?

495
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:12,610
Was what you did just now fair?

496
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,330
Why are you upset? I did that for you—

497
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,610
Oh, so that was for me?

498
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,270
What distinguishes you from Kim Myeong Ho?

499
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,280
You are no different.

500
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,220
You think I am the same as Kim Myeong Ho?

501
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,670
Does forcing them to submit prove justice?

502
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,570
You told me to watch over Hong Deok Su and report to you daily.

503
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,390
Very well.

504
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:47,570
I will do it. However, you must pay me well.

505
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,700
I need money.

506
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:54,390
You try to justify yourself and struggle with love and friendship.

507
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,180
Is that not what the powerful do for amusement?

508
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,430
I do not have that luxury.

509
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,150
That is what makes you master innkeeper...

510
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,620
and me, your assistant.

511
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,250
Go Su Ra.

512
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,060
Those Bottom-Tier fools.

513
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:32,080
I am not Kim Myeong Ho of Ulju if I let them be.

514
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,710
I will crush all of you.

515
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,200
Hyeongnim!

516
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,920
   

517
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,730
Prince Mu Yeong gave the ledger to the Minister of Defense?

518
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,250
I followed three soldiers leaving the minister's residence,

519
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,160
but all they carried were blank ledgers. Forgive me.

520
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,010
What is he plotting?

521
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:02,830
 Your Majesty, the Minister of Defense has arrived. 

522
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,650
I did not grant you entry.

523
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,660
How dare you barge in here?

524
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:19,350
It was so urgent that

525
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:23,140
I could not wait, Your Majesty.

526
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,160
Minister.

527
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,040
You have a remarkably dutiful son, Your Majesty.

528
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:39,020
Prince Mu Yeong presented Cheon's ledger to me himself.

529
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,350
Can you believe it?

530
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:49,230
The ledger that proves the former king was poisoned.

531
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:55,730
Cheon recorded every detail.

532
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,460
So?

533
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:02,070
So, what are you proposing now?

534
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:07,100
As we possess the evidence of Cheon's treason,

535
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,790
I shall arrest and execute him.

536
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,350
In return,

537
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:19,200
declare the transfer of power to Prince Seon Yang immediately.

538
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,290
How dare you!

539
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,530
Transfer of power?

540
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,220
Royal Guard!

541
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,820
Your Majesty.

542
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,390
If you kill me now,

543
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,500
the ledger that I have kept safe

544
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,740
will spread throughout the capital.

545
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:04,070
If you fail to declare the transfer of power tomorrow,

546
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:07,260
instead of Cheon, Your Majesty will...

547
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:14,950
be condemned for treason for murdering the former king.

548
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:10,910
What brings you to the royal bedchamber at this hour, Minister?

549
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:17,990
Likely urgent business with His Majesty, do you not agree?

550
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,040
Tomorrow, the entire world will be turned upside down.

551
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,660
Do not be too alarmed.

552
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,420
I am...

553
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:37,480
merely informing you in advance lest it overwhelms

554
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,230
your frail health and mind.

555
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,430
Remain healthy.

556
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,070
If you live long,

557
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:55,930
you may yet behold a better day.

558
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,190
   

559
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:06,300
Lee Eun Ho.

560
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,840
You truly came.

561
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,020
What shall we do?

562
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,410
What are you doing?

563
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,460
Where is Lee Eun Ho?

564
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:22,860
Look how swiftly you rushed here for Lee Eun Ho.

565
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,990
What is your relationship?

566
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,890
You appear as close as lovers.

567
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,540
You two...

568
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,700
indulge in forbidden relations, do you not?

569
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,640
Kim Myeong Ho,

570
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:45,230
do not utter something you will regret.

571
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,550
Or, Hong Deok Su,

572
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:57,300
are you a woman?

573
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,720
Seriously...

574
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,140
Speak!

575
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,000
No.

576
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:10,060
I can determine it myself.

577
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,710
There is no need to complicate things.

578
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:19,180
How did you conceal it so thoroughly at Jakyakjae?

579
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:22,830
I will expose your identity, Hong Deok Su!

580
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:24,370
Get away!

581
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,890
You were attached to Lee Eun Ho.

582
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:32,760
Have you already switched sides because Cheon Jun Hwa became master innkeeper?

583
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,340
Kim Myeong Ho!

584
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,870
Cheon Jun Hwa. Cheon Jun Hwa.

585
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:42,170
Let go.

586
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:46,020
I will kill him.

587
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,520
Cheon Jun Hwa, that is enough.

588
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,700
How dare you do that to him?

589
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,430
You are being deceived by Hong Deok Su!

590
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:07,810
Cheon Jun Hwa,

591
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:10,840
you are being fooled at this very moment.

592
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,790
Do you know with whom Hong Deok Su is involved?

593
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,830
Silence, Kim Myeong Ho!

594
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,610
Lee Eun Ho!

595
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:19,100
She already has feelings for Lee Eun Ho.

596
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,370
I witnessed it!

597
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,430
Quiet!

598
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:30,350
Die! Die! Die!

599
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:56,400
You said we must not mingle with those of lowly status.

600
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,100
It would have been difficult to reject Yongcheonru's invitation.

601
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,690
You are the same, are you not?

602
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:06,560
You said we should abandon Cheon Mak Dong.

603
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,280
Did you reverse your decision overnight?

604
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:14,210
By the way, is the Minister of Defense absent?

605
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,620
I am not certain...

606
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,600
Who are you?

607
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:55,170
I am the new master innkeeper, Cheon Jun Hwa.

608
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,590
Cheon Jun Hwa?

609
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,690
Your Excellency, if he is Cheon...

610
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:08,780
We have acquired high-quality beef.

611
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:11,640
I wished to greet you and introduce myself.

612
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:17,610
Help yourselves, and take the gifts I have prepared.

613
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:46,900
What is all this?

614
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:49,910
What is the problem?

615
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:52,490
Do you dislike cow tongue?

616
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,370
Cow tongue?

617
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:58,690
You expect us to eat this cow tongue right now?

618
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,470
Why is that an issue?

619
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:03,950
Obtaining this was quite challenging.

620
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:05,730
Come, now!

621
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:09,620
You are still young and ignorant of decorum.

622
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,850
Cheon...

623
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:19,490
Mak...

624
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:22,540
Dong.

625
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:27,930
Those insolent tongues of yours.

626
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:34,980
Shall I place them on this platter instead?

627
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:39,220
It is a very costly dish. Will you not eat it?

628
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,710
Right.

629
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,660
I almost forgot to mention the gifts.

630
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,760
Go on, open them.

631
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,820
They are most delicious.

632
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,370
Indeed.

633
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,300
Very fine!

634
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:33,680
Mind your tongues, my lords.

635
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:41,700
I am begging you right now.

636
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:31,670
I am nearly at my goal.

637
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:34,210
Tomorrow,

638
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:40,230
Oh Yeong Rak's progeny will ascend the throne!

639
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:27,820
Where is the ledger?

640
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,110
Oh Yeong Rak!

641
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:33,200
   

642
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:41,260
Welcome to Yongcheonru, Ulju Merchant Leader.

643
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:53,740
Is this that high and mighty Yongcheonru?

644
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:58,660
It glitters, but it is nothing special.

645
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,390
Where is my baby, Myeong Ho?

646
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:09,840
I wish to see his handsome face.

647
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,400
Let us go.

648
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:29,100


649
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:33,980
   

650
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:38,300
♫  Questions etched deeply into my shattered heart  ♫

651
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:42,680
♫  Rekindling the flame of my frozen soul  ♫

652
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:47,270
♫  Facing the dark night that crashes upon me  ♫

653
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:51,080
♫  When the world keeps, keeps, keeps  ♫ 
 ♫  Pushing endlessly against me  ♫

654
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,770
♫  I rise fiercely  ♫

655
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:59,450
♫  The crimson flame within me blooms  ♫

656
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:03,700
 Everything fell into Cheon's hands. 

657
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,210
 After the Minister of Defense, now it is Cheon's turn. 

658
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:09,170
 Hong Deok Su, do not stain your hands with more blood. 

659
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:10,150
 I have made my decision. 

660
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:12,720
 Marry my son. 

661
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:16,940
 Use me, Hong Deok Su. Marry me. 

662
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:20,640
 Stop luring Hong Deok Su. 

663
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:25,500
 I am prepared to surrender all I possess. 

664
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,760
 Do you love Jae On? 

665
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,100
 I love Hong Deok Su. 

666
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:33,250
 There shall be an uprising soon. 

667
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,090
 An uprising? 

668
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:39,080
 We will replace the king. 

669
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,310
 Let us sweep everything aside and begin anew. 

670
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,010
 We must prevent a war. 

671
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,640
