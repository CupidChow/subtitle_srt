1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
   

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,730
   

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,640
   

4
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,120
I have created all of my memories...

5
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,450
with my father here.

6
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,660
Likewise, my memory...

7
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,130
of that day, twelve years ago.

8
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,060
Have you lived...

9
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,920
as a man since then?

10
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,940
I had to... survive somehow.

11
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,510
Do you want to play cups and balls?

12
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,710
All right.

13
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,710
 A jade ring does not guarantee happiness. 

14
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,380
 One of the cups has a flower in it. 

15
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,550
 And one of them has a jade ring in it. 

16
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,080
 Simply live happily, no matter what you find. 

17
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,010
All right.

18
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,100
Happiness.

19
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,640
No matter which cup you choose,

20
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,180
your happiness will be contained therein.

21
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,600
Happiness?

22
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,180
Yes.

23
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,070
My father used to tell me that.

24
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,560
I believed that coming here...

25
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,450
would be very arduous.

26
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,270
Thus, I was fearful.

27
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,350
I have good memories,

28
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,340
but also painful ones.

29
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,670
I am relieved to have come here with you.

30
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,800
It shall be over once we find the safe.

31
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,540
Yes.

32
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,130
Everything will be over soon.

33
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,570
Yes.

34
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,820
Should we check the annex first?

35
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,510
It does not seem to be here.

36
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,970
Perhaps I was mistaken.

37
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,710
Here.

38
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,280
Take your time and deliberate.

39
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,630
Your father must have had a reason for hiding it.

40
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,220
Should I ask the Master Innkeeper?

41
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,770
Master Innkeeper Seol Mae Hwa?

42
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,470
Yes.

43
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,180
She was my father's only student.

44
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,190
 I have someone precious I need to protect. 

45
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,700
 Investigate the case involving the golden key twelve years ago. 

46
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,730
What are you contemplating?

47
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,090
Let us return tonight.

48
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,500
Are you drinking without any food?

49
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,980
Go Su Ra, my friend.

50
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,190
Friend?

51
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,160
 Cheon Jun Hwa. He is my son. 

52
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,530
 Could you assist him by his side? 

53
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,560
 Do you not require money? Desperately? 

54
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,920
Cheon Jun Hwa...

55
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,670
Is this because of Hong Deok Su?

56
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,290
I said that you have to be prepared for rejection.

57
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,290
Rejection?

58
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,870
I can ensure that she does not reject me.

59
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,500
Cheon Jun Hwa.

60
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,160
I knew first.

61
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,940
I...

62
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,940
saw her first.

63
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,400
I will not lose her to him.

64
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,960
 I am standing guard securely. Relax and bathe. 

65
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,920
All right. Thank you, Lee Eun Ho.

66
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,100
I shall make it quick.

67
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,040
My goodness, I appear to have done all the work.

68
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,350
Did I emit an unpleasant odor?

69
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,180
Wake up, Hong Deok Su.

70
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,210
Confucius said, "Biryemulshi. Biryemulcheong.

71
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,730
Biryemuleon. Biryemuldong."

72
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,130
If it is not proper, do not look or listen.

73
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,600
Confucius said, "Jijabulhok. Injabulwu."

74
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,480
A wise man is not tempted.

75
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,180
Confucius said, "Jijabulhok. Injabulwu..."

76
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,700
I shall also bathe.

77
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,100
I will make the bed. You may rest.

78
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,420
I will do it.

79
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,820
- No, I said that I will. 
 - No.

80
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,400
You are quite strong, Hong Deok Su.

81
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,080
Y-Yes.

82
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,280
I am a true man, Hong Deok Su.

83
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,550
You are not.

84
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,560
It was my first time.

85
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,890
Is it because I have only lived as a man?

86
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,180
I am not accustomed to...

87
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,820
feelings such as these.

88
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,440
Having but one person in my heart

89
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,720
and experiencing butterflies in my stomach.

90
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,630
I feel the same.

91
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,920
Lee Eun Ho,

92
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,390
my friend Gu Shil said...

93
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:14,010
that love makes the heart race and tingle.

94
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,780
Did you feel that way as well?

95
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,550
Did it race... and become ticklish?

96
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,000
It was painful.

97
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,980
It did not race...

98
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,880
or feel ticklish.

99
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,470
Whenever I saw you,

100
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,090
 I experienced anguish 

101
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,210
 and hurt, 

102
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,650
because I believed you to be a man.

103
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,430
I had to halt my heart,

104
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,900
but I could not.

105
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,770
I am sorry. That is—

106
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,710
It is all right.

107
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,710
Whether you are Hong Deok Su or Hong Jae On,

108
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,880
I have resolved to keep only you...

109
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,090
in my heart...

110
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,180
regardless of which one you are.

111
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,340
♫  A trembling feeling for the first time  ♫

112
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,970
♫  A distant gaze  ♫

113
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,210
Me, too.

114
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,130
I have never lived as a woman.

115
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,870
Although matters would be awkward and difficult,

116
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,780
I shall still endeavour, Lee Eun Ho.

117
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,220
I, too.

118
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,450
I promise.

119
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,170
No matter what transpires,

120
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,090
I shall endeavour to protect you.

121
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,640
Rest now, Hong Deok Su.

122
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,650
I shall protect you throughout the night.

123
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,380
Sleep soundly.

124
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,280
I do not desire to sleep.

125
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,960
I do not want today to be over.

126
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:22,940
♫  And I bloom again as the person I used to be  ♫

127
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,850
H-Hong Deok Su.

128
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,760
What are you doing?

129
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,990
You must desist while I request so courteously.

130
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,660
Hong Deok Su.

131
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,550
I am not... yet entirely prepared.

132
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,310
She sleeps so soundly...

133
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,340
unaware of my feelings.

134
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,830
When all of this is over,

135
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,560
I shall be able to tell her everything.

136
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,520
 I, Prince Mu Yeong... 

137
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,220
 - will become the crown prince. 
 - Pardon? 

138
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,090
 I shall bring order to the country and royal family as my father did. 

139
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:50,020
 You had better accept that as my loyal servant. 

140
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:16,080
The pumpkin jeon is the finest side dish today. Here.

141
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,410
What? Pumpkin jeon is my favorite.

142
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,180
For you...

143
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,340
then, have this. The beef.

144
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,250
- Is it tasty? 
 - You gave it to me. Of course.

145
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,080
Really? Eat it all.

146
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,710
What? Are you choking?

147
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,590
Water.

148
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,390
Water, water, water.

149
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,360
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes.

150
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,900
Eat.

151
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,880
Where did the two of you go last night?

152
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,800
L-Last night?

153
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,190
Neither of you were in your room until late.

154
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,990
We went for a walk because the room was rather warm.

155
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,310
Well, yes.

156
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,610
I have no appetite.

157
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,540
Cheon Jun Hwa, you should still eat.

158
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,510
I shall check on him.

159
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,970
This is shikhye. Drink some. 
  (T/N: traditional sweet rice beverage) 

160
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,120
Are you all right?

161
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,860
Why did you drink so much?

162
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,410
I met with Master Cheon yesterday.

163
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,880
I was not aware, but you bear a great resemblance to your father.

164
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,810
I heard that you are his only son and the successor of Yongcheonru.

165
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,750
Go Su Ra.

166
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,480
I cannot believe that the future owner of Yongcheonru is my friend.

167
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,520
I consider myself fortunate.

168
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,180
I am sorry.

169
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,820
I wished to tell you sooner, but—

170
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,200
I understand. You were preoccupied with Hong Deok Su.

171
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,010
Why did my father wish to see you?

172
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,690
We are on the verge of losing our merchant to an usurer.

173
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,990
Instead, he promised to pay off my debt.

174
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,450
You should have informed me about it first.

175
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:18,320
I shall assist you until you become the inn owner.

176
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,230
But I will still speak my mind.

177
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,880
I would be grateful for that.

178
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,760
There will be much to do henceforth.

179
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,550
Lee Eun Ho.

180
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,140
Let us maintain a certain distance.

181
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,380
What do you mean by that?

182
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,280
We cannot inform our friends yet.

183
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,360
Let us proceed with caution.

184
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,590
Is it because of Jun Hwa?

185
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,290
Well...

186
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,840
Did you know?

187
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,320
Cheon Jun Hwa is...

188
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:37,080
Never mind. We are friends.

189
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,580
Once we locate the safe and ledger, we shall...

190
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,150
Well, I suppose there will be much to do.

191
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,500
We shall labor diligently during the day

192
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,770
and search for the safe at night together.

193
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,340
Right?

194
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,260
Permit me to undertake dangerous tasks such as this.

195
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,160
Right?

196
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,970
Come now.

197
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,720
Oh, no, Lee Eun Ho!

198
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,550
What are you doing?

199
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,430
What are the two of you doing here?

200
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,560
By my word, I cannot bear their sight.

201
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,710
Well, the bedsheet. I must hang the bedsheet.

202
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,700
- I-I shall go. 
 - M-Me...

203
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,420
The bedsheet.

204
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,300
I said that I can do it alone.

205
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,340
Hand it to me. I shall do everything.

206
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,310
You should rest in the shade.

207
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,780
Let us do it together, then.

208
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,210
All right.

209
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,350
One, two, three!

210
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,990
Was it since that time?

211
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,790
I started noticing you then.

212
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,960
You have liked me since then?

213
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,460
It was my second kiss.

214
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,250
Second?

215
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,980
Who was it the first time?

216
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,710
Someone.

217
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,400
She was exceedingly beautiful, even whilst drowning, too.

218
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,610
Who was it?

219
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,030
I inquired of you: who was it?

220
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,940
Do you not remember who saved your life?

221
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:12,840
♫  When your eyes look at me  ♫

222
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,910
♫  I can't hide this trembling heart  ♫

223
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:24,310
♫  Like a child I find myself chasing after you  ♫

224
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,990
♫  Like a child I find myself chasing after you  ♫

225
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,130
♫  When your hand  ♫

226
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,370
Look at me.

227
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,840
♫  Without realizing it I want to  ♫

228
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,950
I no longer owe you, do I not?

229
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,630
Let us go.

230
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,290
♫  Right now  ♫

231
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:55,640
♫  Walk with me  ♫

232
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,190
♫  Listen to my story slowly  ♫

233
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,740
♫  The more I hope to reach you  ♫

234
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,780
♫  The smaller I become unable to see you  ♫

235
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:17,050
♫  The more I try to hide it  ♫

236
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,590
♫  The bigger this heart grows  ♫

237
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:29,810
♫  I want to tell you looking into your eyes right now  ♫

238
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:39,900
Master Innkeeper Seol Mae Hwa did not appear near Muak Pass on the way to Ulju.

239
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,030
I believe she discerned our intentions and altered her course.

240
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,040
Yes.

241
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,430
I expected as much from her.

242
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,750
Should we search further?

243
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,300
Leave her.

244
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,540
She will not return alive, even if she reaches Ulju.

245
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,110
 You should live. 

246
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:56,370
 Live and see the world we have dreamed of. 

247
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,280
 Teacher, why... 

248
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,040
 Someday, 

249
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,790
 if my Jae On comes to see you, 

250
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:08,340
 you should care for her. 

251
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,110
 My Jae On is in your care. 

252
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,790
 I have wanted to meet you very much, Master Innkeeper. 

253
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:25,510
How is the prolonged drought my fault?

254
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,910
This tea is for Yongcheonru, to welcome you.

255
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,700
This indeed is Yongcheonru.

256
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,150
Things are expensive in Hanyang these days.

257
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,240
I suppose there is no means to endure the three years of drought.

258
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,690
I fear there may be a riot.

259
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,380
This is all because the King committed a sin.

260
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,150
You should not utter such a thing!

261
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,880
Do not speak rashly.

262
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,760
What do you mean by that? The King's sin?

263
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,400
Well...

264
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,890
The current king poisoned his brother and usurped the throne.

265
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,850
The Heavens will not permit rain out of indignation.

266
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,560
How can you utter such nonsense?

267
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,530
My apologies.

268
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,850
The entirety of Hanyang is aware of it.

269
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,670
I suppose the rumor has not reached Yongcheonru.

270
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,290
It is all a terrible lie.

271
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,150
- My apologies. 
 - Seriously...

272
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,260
We have endured a three-year drought. Naturally, people would say so.

273
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,500
We require a new king.

274
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,430
How could he commit such a grave sin and seize the throne? Truly.

275
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,880
Lee Eun Ho...

276
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,840
are you all right?

277
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,320
I must depart early and return home.

278
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,570
I shall visit your old house later. Could you wait for me there?

279
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,050
- What is this about? 
 - I shall not be late.

280
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,570
Remain there without departing.

281
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,700
Do not be injured again.

282
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,500
Be cautious. Understand?

283
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,930
I heard that you aided Go Su Ra's merchant.

284
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,510
He is a shrewd and ambitious fellow.

285
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,880
Retaining him would be very beneficial to you.

286
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,600
Why did you dispatch the Master Innkeeper to Ulju?

287
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,070
I had to vacate that position in order to bestow it upon you.

288
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,580
If so, will she not return to Yongcheonru?

289
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,020
I suppose she will not.

290
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,240
Jun Hwa, you are my successor.

291
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,310
You must return to your rightful place.

292
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:36,010
Alcohol does not resolve your problems.

293
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:42,310
You know everything about me, Father.

294
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:50,440
I know you are eager to have Hong Deok Su as well.

295
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,170
Cheon Jun Hwa.

296
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,660
Do you know the fate of your name?

297
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,160
Long ago,

298
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,120
a friend and I divided the characters of our children's names.

299
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,090
He had a daughter...

300
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:22,320
and I had you, Jun Hwa.

301
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:29,000
We divided the name that is believed to attract all the wealth in the world.

302
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,530
Jae, signifying fortune...

303
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,060
and Hwa, signifying wealth.

304
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,830
 Jae Hwa. 

305
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,520
 My friend’s daughter received the character "Jae." 

306
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,780
 And you were given the character "Hwa." 

307
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:00,370
Her name is Hong Jae On.

308
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,830
She is the one who is presently by your side.

309
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,200
Do you mean...

310
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,690
Hong Deok Su?

311
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:23,380
Hong Jae On has been yours from the beginning, Jun Hwa.

312
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:30,860
Is Hong Deok Su my fated partner who shares a name with me?

313
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,420
You must not lose what is rightfully yours.

314
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,110
You possess the power to prevent that, Jun Hwa.

315
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,040
Are you...

316
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,070
once again, meeting Hong Deok Su outside tonight?

317
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,310
"Again"?

318
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,020
What did you observe, Cheon Jun Hwa?

319
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,970
I cannot allow Hong Deok Su to be hurt.

320
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:27,940
Do you not know that she might be in danger by remaining at your side?

321
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,160
You should...

322
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,480
leave now.

323
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,890
I shall protect those who are dear to me.

324
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,670
Decide, Your Majesty.

325
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,430
You intrude in this manner...

326
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,410
merely to request...

327
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:04,650
that I issue a royal decree for the proclamation of the crown prince?

328
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,900
It is not a trivial matter.

329
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,310
Are you aware of what the people are saying?

330
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:15,450
They say that the drought was caused by your sin.

331
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,050
Are you suggesting that I have sinned?

332
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,790
Choose the crown prince

333
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:29,310
and perform a rainmaking ritual, as well as the proclamation ceremony.

334
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,940
Do you truly believe it would rain if I did so?

335
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,970
There is no means for me to ascertain.

336
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,540
However, I shall ensure

337
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,780
that the people are consoled.

338
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,100
We cannot impose undue pressure upon the young crown prince.

339
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,160
All right.

340
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:10,830
I shall prepare meticulously and announce the decree.

341
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,800
You may depart.

342
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,820
You must...

343
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,910
grant the request now, Your Majesty.

344
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:43,690
Grant... the request!

345
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,180
Minister of Defense, kneel immediately.

346
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,050
Kneel.

347
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,240
Prince Mu Yeong, refrain from involvement.

348
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,530
Must I behead you for treason in order to atone for your wickedness?

349
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:37,740
Even if you behead me,

350
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:45,470
you must issue the decree for the proclamation of the crown prince.

351
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:54,880
Please restore order to the royal family and the country, Your Majesty.

352
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,990
To do so,

353
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,860
we must first select a date.

354
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,490
We cannot select just any day for the proclamation of the crown prince.

355
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:15,970
His Majesty shall consult the Royal Astrologers to choose an auspicious date.

356
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,350
Yes, that is agreeable.

357
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,930
You should depart now, Minister.

358
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,430
Very well. I shall do so.

359
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:52,840
There are three auspicious days by the end of this month.

360
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,500
You had better not delay beyond this month.

361
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:28,110
I kicked the dog, who is infatuated with the proclamation.

362
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,940
I am doomed to be bitten now.

363
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,290
What am I to do now?

364
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:40,760
I shall bring Cheon's ledger.

365
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,090
I shall find the evidence that the Minister of Defense murdered the former king.

366
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,770
I acquired both halves of the golden key.

367
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:52,660
I shall ensure that I locate the safe

368
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,310
before the Minister of Defense returns.

369
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,070
Mu Yeong, I am counting on you.

370
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,790
Hyeongnim.

371
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,560
I heard that the Minister of Defense barged in.

372
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,640
Is His Majesty safe?

373
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,630
He has departed. Do not worry.

374
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,040
What is transpiring, anyway?

375
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,610
I heard that you broke off the engagement as well.

376
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,230
I shall no longer submit to the Minister's threats.

377
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,080
I shall rectify their wrongdoings.

378
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,780
But what power do you possess?

379
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,840
I shall... soon acquire the power.

380
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,820
Congratulations.

381
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,020
Allow me to pour you a glass, Minister of Defense.

382
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,770
No, no.

383
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,380
You are the crown prince's grandfather.

384
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,680
Come now. The royal decree has not been announced.

385
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,680
The only matter remaining is to set the date.

386
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,280
It is essentially done.

387
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,180
Absolutely. Simply sit back and enjoy the fruits of your labor.

388
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,450
Like this?

389
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:07,290
 Your Excellency, once the proclamation ceremony occurs, 

390
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,160
you should abandon Cheon.

391
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,550
 I agree. 

392
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,660
We cannot associate with those of impure blood.

393
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,600
 Even his name is "Mak Dong." 

394
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,280
 It means he was raised as a lowlife, Cheon Mak Dong. 

395
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,750
 Come now, you two. 

396
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:30,030
Nevertheless, you must not mock someone's given name.

397
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,290
 He boasts that he is the inn owner, 

398
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,980
 yet he cannot overcome his lowly name. 

399
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,930
 Cheon Mak Dong! Cheon Mak Dong! 

400
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:52,530
 It means he poops relentlessly. 

401
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:02,330
By the way, why did Prince Mu Yeong act thus?

402
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,350
 He even broke off the engagement. 

403
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,100
What grants him the confidence to do so?

404
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,160
It is suspicious.

405
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,730
Is he attempting to buy time by employing the setting of the date as an excuse?

406
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,910
 Your Excellency, nevertheless, 

407
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,470
it must be set for this month.

408
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,680
What could possibly go wrong?

409
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,460
I have an ominous feeling.

410
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,440
It appears as if he is secretly planning a critical assault.

411
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,060
 Do not worry about it. You have us. 

412
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:04,190
I know where Prince Mu Yeong shall be tonight.

413
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,100
You told me not to lose what is mine.

414
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,530
Hong Jae On.

415
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:15,480
The woman who shares a name with me.

416
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:19,120
I shall reclaim her.

417
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,610
Would you be able to restrain Prince Mu Yeong?

418
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,200
I shall.

419
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,840
You finally appear as my son now.

420
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,580
I shall bestow upon you Jo Seung Ryang.

421
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,390
Proceed and do as you wish.

422
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,060
   

423
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:13,370
 There are three lucky days by the end of this month. 

424
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:18,030
 You had better not go past this month. 

425
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:24,640
 I will make sure to find the safe before the Minister of Defense returns. 

426
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,300
Royal Guard, are you outside?

427
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,700
Did you wish to see me?

428
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:48,200
Assemble your men and follow Prince Mu Yeong.

429
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,290
If he finds Cheon's ledger,

430
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,050
secure both him and the ledger,

431
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,980
and execute all the witnesses.

432
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:04,040
I shall follow your order.

433
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,630
Hong Deok Su.

434
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,150
Lee Eun Ho.

435
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,480
What caused your delay?

436
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,940
Was it not perilous to be alone?

437
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,670
It is all right.

438
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:50,140
I endeavoured to search for it alone, but found nothing.

439
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,980
You must have searched diligently.

440
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,800
Is something amiss?

441
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,300
There is nothing amiss. Let us search again.

442
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,250
No.

443
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,390
There is indeed something amiss.

444
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:21,490
I can discern that you are holding back tears at this moment.

445
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,220
Do you possess the ability to read minds now?

446
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,010
Come here.

447
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,440
It concerns your family, does it not?

448
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,350
Is it something grievous?

449
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,550
When my mother passed away,

450
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:09,420
I could not have... recovered had it not been for you.

451
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:20,370
I wish to be that for you as well.

452
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:28,020
Here, lean on me.

453
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,510
I am small, yet useful.

454
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,380
Two is better than one.

455
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,980
Yes, let us do that.

456
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,250
You are right, Hong Deok Su.

457
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,310
It is far better to rely on one another.

458
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:17,900
See? I was correct, was I not?

459
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:23,150
There is something else I have prepared.

460
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,770
What is it?

461
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,730
Ta-da.

462
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,580
All right.

463
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,460
Ta-da.

464
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,920
When did you prepare all this?

465
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,820
Here, try some first.

466
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,060
Ah!

467
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,700
- What? 
 - Ah!

468
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,490
Here.

469
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,130
Say "ah"!

470
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,180
Will you eat my hand as well?

471
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,550
I am sorry. I must have been famished.

472
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,000
Here, you should eat as well.

473
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,250
I can eat it.

474
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,740
No, no, no.

475
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,940
Allow me to feed you.

476
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,660
Say "ah."

477
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,330
Say "ah."

478
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,580
Open it wider. "Ah."

479
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,210
Ah!

480
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:25,970
By my word, seriously.

481
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:28,320
Let us share them equally.

482
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,220
You take one.

483
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,900
And I take one.

484
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,710
Sharing renders them twice as delectable, does it not?

485
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,260
Yes.

486
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,020
My father used to say so.

487
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,900
Your father?

488
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,370
Yes.

489
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:08,210
 Jae On, where are you hurrying off to? 

490
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:11,810
 It is a secret. Do not ask. 

491
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:22,920
♫  The passing years say nothing at all  ♫

492
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:33,580
♫  Like sorrowful words of a song, scattered in the wind  ♫

493
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:38,400
♫  On nights when the dark comes calling  ♫

494
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,920
♫  Oh moonlight, silently weeping  ♫

495
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,290
♫  If the shadow of fate casts over me  ♫

496
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,490
♫  Light up this endless road for me  ♫

497
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:56,220
♫  Rise again  ♫

498
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,090
♫  Even if I crumble and fall  ♫

499
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:05,070
♫  Embracing the bitter scars in my heart  ♫

500
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:10,710
♫  Oh, flowing tears, remember for me  ♫

501
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:33,240
The golden key. Could you hand me the golden key?

502
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,100
T-The golden key.

503
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:46,130
"Yeo hee hyang wi bae."

504
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,440
   

505
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,340
It means that joy is doubled when shared.

506
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,410
This is it.

507
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,220
I have found the meaning.

508
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,440
Are you ready?

509
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,750
Yes, Young Master.

510
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,380
- Let us go. 
 - Yes.

511
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:53,720
It is the safe.

512
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:47,000
Those who killed my innocent father...

513
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:51,130
I shall take revenge on them now.

514
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,900
   

515
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,410
Minister of Defense, Oh Yeong Rak.

516
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:13,320
Cheon Mak Dong.

517
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,610
   

518
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:24,500
Prince Lee Hyeon Wi.

519
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,760
His Majesty?

520
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:31,760
   

521
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,230
Who are you?

522
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,820
Get them!

523
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,400
They are after you, not me.

524
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,020
Ensure that you remain behind me.

525
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,440
All right.

526
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,130
Hong Deok Su!

527
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,960
Who are you?

528
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,040
Attack!

529
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:40,610
Come with me, Hong Deok Su.

530
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:43,010
Cheon Jun Hwa, what are you doing here?

531
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,350
Kill everyone.

532
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,990
Stop them!

533
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,160
Let us go.

534
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,040
Lee Eun Ho! Let her go.

535
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,400
Hong Deok Su is safer with me.

536
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,400
- What? We should all go together. 
 - Hong Deok Su.

537
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:10,910
- No, Lee Eun Ho! 
 - Hong Deok Su!

538
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,500
No!

539
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,720
Master?

540
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,130
No!

541
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:46,900
Are you all right?

542
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,760
Hong Deok Su, take Cheon Jun Hwa with you.

543
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,060
How can I leave you unaccompanied?

544
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:52,970
Depart while I stop them. Hurry.

545
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,170
Lee Eun Ho!

546
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:56,610
Let us go, Hong Deok Su.

547
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,390
Let us go, Hong Deok Su.

548
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,160
Catch them!

549
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,770
Hurry up!

550
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,450
No. I cannot!

551
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,870
You cannot allow them to go! Kill everyone!

552
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,240
Stop.

553
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:34,190
Prince Mu Yeong is here.

554
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,000
Lower your swords and bow.

555
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,800
Conduct yourselves properly.

556
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:34,240
Raise your head.

557
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,350
Lee Eun Ho.

558
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:11,740
Cheon Jun Hwa,

559
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:15,260
take Hong Deok Su with you.

560
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,270
Lee Eun Ho,

561
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:38,320
you are... Prince Mu Yeong?

562
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:53,520
I was ordered to kill everyone present.

563
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,250
Royal Guard!

564
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:01,250
You must carry out my order.

565
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,670
We shall return to the palace.

566
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,040
Guard him.

567
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:19,190
Lee Eun Ho.

568
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:55,630


569
01:10:55,630 --> 01:11:00,130
   

570
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:08,860
♫  I walk alone on this thorny path  ♫

571
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:13,220
♫  Questions etched deeply into my shattered heart  ♫

572
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:17,710
♫  Rekindling the flame of my frozen soul  ♫

573
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:22,240
♫  Facing the dark night that crashes upon me  ♫

574
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,550
♫  When the world keeps, keeps, keeps  ♫

575
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:29,360
 Was that the only reason? The ledger? 

576
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,760
 Do not appear before me again, 

577
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,590
 Prince Mu Yeong. 

578
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:36,550
 We exist in a world apart from him, Hong Deok Su. 

579
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:41,540
 You will be hurt if you remain with someone with whom you ought not to be. 

580
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,780
 Why have you brought this to me? 

581
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:46,960
 I must eliminate Cheon. 

582
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,960
 I must protect Father and the royal family. 

583
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,280
 We must restore order to the country. 

584
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,740
 Where have you been this time? 

585
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,210
 You cannot go out freely. 

586
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,550
 Is that an order? 

587
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:00,390
 Do as I say. 

588
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:02,420
 That is the best course of action. 

589
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,320
 Master Cheon's son, Cheon Jun Hwa? 

590
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:09,030
 This is the sole way for me to protect Hong Deok Su. 

591
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,430
 Die! 

592
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:13,910
 I am the new Master Innkeeper, Cheon Jun Hwa. 

593
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:17,690
 The three individuals who killed my father twelve years ago 

594
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:21,070
 will ultimately perish while fighting one another. 

595
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:25,320
 I shall never give up or cease.
