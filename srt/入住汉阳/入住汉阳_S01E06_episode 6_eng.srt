1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,770
   

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,740
   

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,870
The Bottom-Tier Room cannot pass!

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,240
They do not even have the right to take the test.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,750
So, they do not get to pass, either.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,440
- Kim Myeong Ho! 
 - Hong Deok Su is...

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,670
a girl.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:36,030


9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,060
This girl dared to deceive Yongcheonru...

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,940
and took the Gyohwadang test.

11
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,910
She will have to be punished harshly.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,060
Kim Myeong Ho, shut your mouth.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,070
Hong Deok Su... come clean in front of everyone!

14
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,640
Are you prepared to take responsibility for what you just said?

15
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,410
If you are accusing an innocent person,

16
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,320
you had better stake your life on it, Kim Myeong Ho.

17
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,650
Why should I?

18
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,890
She is the one who lied!

19
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,550
My apologies, My Lady.

20
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,500
They lack discipline as they are still apprentices.

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,570
I will scold them firmly later.

22
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,810
You may go inside now.

23
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,080
Will you let this slide, Master Innkeeper?

24
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,700
What is all this commotion in a place where we host an important guest?

25
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,310
I came to bid you farewell since you are leaving for Onyang early tomorrow.

26
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,120
I was about to say goodbye to her.

27
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,680
That is untrue, Master Cheon.

28
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,540
Kim Myeong Ho...

29
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,670
that is enough.

30
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,800
Master Innkeeper, I will remove the apprentices now.

31
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,760
Go back so My Lady can rest.

32
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,540
Follow me.

33
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,510
So, did you enjoy your outing?

34
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,830
I know everything that happens in Yongcheonru.

35
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,600
I ordered them to act,

36
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,530
so do not punish anyone, Master Cheon.

37
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,880
Punish?

38
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,840
I should praise them for bringing you so much joy.

39
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,120
And...

40
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,790
I will explain this to the Minister of Defense.

41
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,460
Thank you.

42
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,670
My apologies.

43
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,720
I intended to handle this and report to you, but I was in a hurry.

44
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,570
Was the Bottom-Tier Room behind this, too?

45
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,410
Including Jun Hwa?

46
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,740
Yes, they seem to cause trouble, but the guest favors them.

47
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,280
It is as though the heavens are on their side.

48
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,370
The heavens are not on their side.

49
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,060
That is Jun Hwa's fortune.

50
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,240
Gathering all the luck and people of the world.

51
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,900
You should also read the Bottom-Tier Room apprentices' fortune.

52
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,210
Move quickly!

53
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,990
I am greatly disappointed in you.

54
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,010
I understand you are competing against one another, but you constantly sabotage one another and—

55
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,440
However, the Master Innkeeper wanted to let this go—

56
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,570
Aigoo, aigoo! That "However! However, however!"

57
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,280
You always say, "However, however, however..."

58
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,990
Stop saying that, you bastards.

59
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,760
This is no good. To make you good classmates,

60
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,020
I will lend you a hand.

61
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,670
Understand?

62
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,380
 - Yes.  
 - Louder!

63
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,920
 Yes! 

64
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,830
Do jumping jacks ten times.

65
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,920
Do not count the last number.

66
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,460
Start!

67
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,280
- Start. 
 - Start.

68
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,350
- One, two, three. 
  - One. 

69
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,110
 Two. 

70
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,760
 Three. 

71
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,550
 Four. 

72
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,260
 Five. 

73
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,050
 Six. 

74
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,710
 Seven. 

75
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,470
 Eight. 

76
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,210
 Nine. 

77
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,520
Ten.

78
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,910
Gosh.

79
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,060
You bastards! Get it together!

80
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,350
Lie face down.

81
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,690
Move quickly!

82
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,400
Lie face down!

83
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,220
Lie face up.

84
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,550
Lie face down.

85
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,920
Lie face up!

86
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,370
- Lie face down. 
 - Shit.

87
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,690
Who said, "Shit"?

88
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,890
- Let us stop. 
 - Number 28.

89
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,810
Can you hang in there?

90
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,320
Lie face up.

91
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,580
Bastards! Do it properly!

92
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,790
Lie face down.

93
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,040
 I will make sure to win. 

94
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,650
 I will make sure to win. 

95
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,010
 Hong Deok Su is... 

96
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,170
 a girl. 

97
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,180
 I have wanted to meet you very much, Master Innkeeper. 

98
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,260
Hong Jae On...

99
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,500
is it truly you?

100
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,260
To be honest,

101
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,370
there is something I did not have the chance to tell you.

102
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,830
- The matter is— 
 - Was it the scar on his shoulder?

103
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,210
What?

104
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,770
That foolish bastard.

105
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,870
Has he been hiding his body because of the scar?

106
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,730
What is the matter with a scar?

107
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,180
Does not every man have a scar?

108
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,790
I suppose. Any man would. Any man would.

109
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,540
By the way, how could Kim Myeong Ho tear his shirt and not apologize?

110
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,490
I will ensure that he pays for his rudeness.

111
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,190
Should I catch him and interrogate him?

112
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,060
By the way, Lee Eun Ho...

113
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,680
why are you behaving this way?

114
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,280
- What? 
 - Unlike your usual self,

115
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,250
you are extremely agitated.

116
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,370
So, I...

117
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,010
I mean, we...

118
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,740
we should be enraged by injustice as noblemen.

119
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,920
 You must have a secret, do you not? 

120
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,100
 By chance, is the secret... 

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,310
 regarding Hong Deok Su? 

122
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,410
 Well...my father passed early, too. 

123
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,300
 We really need to become successful. 

124
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,820
Hong Deok Su,

125
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,520
are you all right?

126
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,860
Yes.

127
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,200
You know, by the way...

128
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,360
Gosh, I am exhausted.

129
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,760
Sang Wu kept counting the last number.

130
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,440
We rolled ten times more because of that.

131
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,110
Gosh...

132
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:45,250
Myeong Ho, by the way, what if Hong Deok Su truly is a man?

133
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,800
I know. He was better at jumping than Sang Wu.

134
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,290
Shut up!

135
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,210
Are you saying I was wrong?

136
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,970
N-No, but Master Cheon suddenly appeared, so it became difficult to resolve matters.

137
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,080
We need to find evidence that he is a girl.

138
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,310
Pardon? What kind of evidence?

139
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,420
The kind no one can deny!

140
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,200
Pardon? How shall we do that?

141
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,020
Hey, look at yourselves.

142
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,760
I am certain he will go to the bathhouse today.

143
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,500
We need to catch him red-handed so he cannot escape.

144
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,770
I am going to the bathhouse. Will you join me?

145
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,040
I will bathe a bit later. You go first.

146
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,390
Yes, you go first.

147
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,370
- Hong Deok Su. 
 - I said I will bathe a bit later.

148
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,680
The scar on your shoulder.

149
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,730
It is not a great matter.

150
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,780
A person is injured in life, and scars occur as a result.

151
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,930
I am saying you do not need to conceal it.

152
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,770
You will become an important person one day.

153
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,330
You should have informed me if you needed a room.

154
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,980
Gosh, my goodness.

155
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,020
Was this reported to you already?

156
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,890
I wanted to take a peaceful bath for once.

157
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,950
I suppose it has been difficult bathing with others.

158
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,580
Yes, well...

159
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,900
I wanted a full rest by myself for the first time in a while.

160
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,310
- Did you wish to see me? 
 - Beom Ho,

161
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,970
I have an important task for you.

162
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,050
Master Cheon will attend Yongcheonru's hiring ceremony this year.

163
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,920
I want you to...

164
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,360
search his residence then.

165
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,300
Did you finally discover where he resides?

166
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,710
He invited me to his home.

167
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,140
He became overconfident and revealed its location.

168
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,700
We cannot miss this opportunity.

169
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,410
   

170
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,750
Why is he not coming out?

171
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,900
- He came out. 
 - Shut up!

172
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,420
You were precisely correct, Hyeongnim.

173
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,390
He is leaving late at night alone.

174
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,530
Shall we follow him now?

175
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,040
Not yet.

176
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,740
- He stopped. 
 - Why did he stop?

177
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,210
He left.

178
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,000
Let us follow him.

179
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,070
Looks like he is not going to bathe.

180
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,730
Filthy bastard.

181
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,690
So he refuses to bathe?

182
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,960
It is not over yet, Hong Deok Su.

183
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,150
You will trip on something. You will trip.

184
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,140
 You will trip. You will trip. 

185
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,150
 You will trip. You will trip. 

186
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,890
I need to take a bath.

187
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,430
The Heavens must be favoring you, Myeong Ho.

188
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,170
Shut up.

189
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,800
This is why we must catch him red-handed.

190
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,460
We should ensure the entire Bottom-Tier Room is expelled.

191
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,000
Yes, there he goes. There he goes. Let us follow.

192
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,860
Hey, Hong Deok Su!

193
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,940
Where has he disappeared to?

194
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,840
   

195
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,810
He would like this, would he not?

196
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,980
I found it on the way.

197
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,910
I am not trying to help you.

198
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,150
Take a bath. You are filthy, all right?

199
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,310
No, no, no, no!

200
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,560
T-That scar... It is Hong Deok Su!

201
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,810
Let us enter and catch him.

202
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,290
Those losers are done, for now, Hyeongnim.

203
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,450
What is...

204
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,450
W-What is that, exactly?

205
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,470
He is a man.

206
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,730
W-What? What are you staring at?

207
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,930
N-Never mind.

208
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,960
 Who is over there? 

209
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,650
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim!

210
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,690
Shut your mouth.

211
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,150
You did this alone.

212
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,720
Hyeongnim! We must go!

213
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,530
You must die for me to live.

214
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:35,060
If you care for your family, do as you are told.

215
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,470
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim!

216
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,180
- You bastard. 
 - W-Well...

217
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,650
Hold on.

218
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,340
What is with you?

219
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,020
No, I...

220
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,530
Why did you do that?

221
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,440
Why did you do that, you bastard? How could you do this?

222
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,100
Why did you do that, you bastard?

223
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,460
 Why did you do that? 

224
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,680
Thank you for helping me, Go Su Ra.

225
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,400
I apologize for keeping it hidden.

226
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,120
You must have your reasons for living as a man.

227
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,480
Both of us bear responsibilities for our families.

228
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Do not worry. I will not tell anyone.

229
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,890
All right.

230
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,320
Hey, that bastard last night was Hong Deok Su, correct?

231
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,810
It must have been him.

232
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,070
I saw the scar on his shoulder as well.

233
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,500
It was not just the scar.

234
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,700
I saw it clearly.

235
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,100
He was definitely a man.

236
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,080
I am relieved only Sang Wu was caught.

237
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,870
Everyone, shut your mouths.

238
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,270
One person is missing today.

239
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,460
Shut up, Namhae merchant.

240
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,750
Did something not go as planned?

241
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,210
Things do not always go as planned.

242
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,220
I have experienced that myself.

243
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:51,760
Apprentice Byeon Sang Wu, who misbehaved last night, has been expelled.

244
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,660
 This is unfair. What do you mean I am homosexual? 

245
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,490
 Aigoo... 

246
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,810
Anyone who disgraces Yongcheonru cannot be allowed to remain.

247
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,060
Keep that in mind.

248
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,180
I will now announce the results of the final test.

249
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,250
So...

250
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,960
The Top-Tier Room and Bottom-Tier Room received identical scores.

251
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,470
You have passed the final test this year.

252
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,720
Be quiet. Be quiet.

253
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,910
The appointment ceremony will take place tomorrow. Keep that in mind.

254
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,200
And lastly, there is a task you must complete today.

255
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,800
   

256
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,030
 It is... to become guests. 
   

257
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,500
 You must experience Yongcheonru as guests 

258
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,120
 to properly understand how to host them. 

259
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,650
 Use the bedding, equipment, and services 

260
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:05,220
 as guests and write a report. 
   

261
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,990
Let us go.

262
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,870
Look here.

263
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,870
Oh my...

264
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,950
Gosh, how soft.

265
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,170
It feels like I am sitting on feathers.

266
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,740
Compose yourself.

267
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,020
Who lies on the bed before bathing?

268
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,320
How soft.

269
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,340
This must be Yongcheonru's bestselling bedsheet.

270
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,910
The one we nearly died trying to wash at the stream.

271
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,650
Yes, and I nearly died fishing you out of the water.

272
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:04,610
The bed feels as soft as feathers.

273
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,030
Nice. So nice.

274
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,460
Stop lounging around and write the report.

275
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,650
This is all part of our duties.

276
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:21,140
I had to be paired with you, Hong Deok Su.

277
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,090
What about me? Why?

278
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,520
Hey,

279
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,400
if you dislike it so much, switch rooms now.

280
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,200
I feel more at ease with Go Su Ra as well.

281
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,070
If we receive compliments due to my excellent report,

282
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,790
do not cry from joy.

283
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:51,210
All right. I will kneel and call you "Hyeongnim" if we are praised.

284
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,710
Hyeongnim. Lee Eun Ho Hyeongnim.

285
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,180
Stop goofing around and get up.

286
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,190
You are dirtying the bed for later.

287
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,990
I will sleep here alone.

288
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,550
Then,

289
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,550
where am I supposed to sleep?

290
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,740
Sleep there if you truly wish to sleep alone.

291
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,280
The Bottom-Tier Room felt cramped, too.

292
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,320
Cheon Jun Hwa, look at this.

293
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,390
What a spacious room this is.

294
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,050
Have you been here before, Jun Hwa?

295
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,650
This is...

296
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,430
Lee Eun Ho and Hong Deok Su had to share a room.

297
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,180
Look at this delicate embroidery.

298
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,860
They have put so much care into the tablecloth.

299
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,400
This is undoubtedly Yongcheonru's finest room.

300
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,970
Is that so? Is it not standard?

301
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,420
It is the flower tea.

302
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,630
They must have prepared various types.

303
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,870
Flower teas are nice.

304
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,850
What? Flower teas?

305
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,210
You cannot drink—

306
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,450
that...

307
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,730
It does not taste particularly good.

308
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,810
This room is...

309
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,920
It is a room for newlyweds.

310
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,310
Are we to use all of this, then?

311
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,170
Well, why not?

312
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,010
"How to use the yulmu powder." 
  (T/N: yulmu is a plant named adlay) 

313
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,010
"Pour the yulmu powder into a bowl.

314
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:01,150
Apply the dissolved yulmu powder to your face?"

315
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,570
You apply it to your face instead of drinking it?

316
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,100
"How to use the foot bath."

317
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,900
"Dip in your hand and check to see if the water temperature is adequate.

318
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,320
If you massage each other's feet,

319
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,770
it will help you feel rejuvenated."

320
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,090
W-What are you doing?

321
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,590
I am bigger than you, Hong Deok Su,

322
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,330
so I wanted to change into the larger one.

323
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,970
Why? Did you wish to wear this?

324
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,580
No! W-Why would you ask that now?

325
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,650
They instructed us to use everything in the room

326
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,440
and write a report, did they not?

327
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,760
You put this on, too.

328
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,330
Well, fine. I will.

329
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,600
You change here. I will change outside.

330
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,470
D-Do not follow me. I mean, do not come out.

331
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,600
Hong Deok Su...

332
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,240
I said a scar is not a big deal for a man.

333
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,690
Look.

334
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,310
- I was using a spear and— 
 - Do not come out.

335
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,590
Here is today's special.

336
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,450
You can order items, and they bring them directly to the room?

337
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,390
Do you need to compensate them?

338
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,910
You have to compensate them a little.

339
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,360
The annals did not mention anything about payment.

340
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,860
- I will note it down. 
 - Look, Su Ra,

341
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,790
we are here as guests now. Let us enjoy ourselves.

342
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,940
Here, try this.

343
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,000
This tastes even better.

344
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,560
I have never had anything like this before.

345
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,670
Do they only have fish in Namhae?

346
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,760
"Check to see if the water temperature is adequate.

347
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,680
If you massage each other's feet..."

348
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,010
Go ahead and massage me.

349
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,850
Why should I?

350
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,390
I am writing a report.

351
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,640
Hong Deok Su, do not just sit idly by and benefit from my efforts.

352
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,510
At the very least, you should massage my feet.

353
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,790
Go ahead and massage.

354
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,160
Yes, I will.

355
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,370
Seriously! You are splashing water.

356
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,160
Hey! Are you all right?

357
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,210
I told you not to act so recklessly!

358
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,910
How imprudent!

359
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,730
"The foot bath can...

360
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,620
start a fight.

361
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,710
It is not appropriate."

362
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,480
The portions are generous, and the food tastes excellent as well.

363
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,060
Should we take this to Hong Deok Su's room, then?

364
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,450
It has always been the four of us. Do you not find it dull this way?

365
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,360
Come on.

366
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,850
We need to complete this task and write the report.

367
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,440
Come on. Listen,

368
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,130
we should write it from the perspective of a group of customers,

369
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,970
as guests visiting another guest's room.

370
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,400
Are you certain you read the manual correctly?

371
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,010
You apply this to your face?

372
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,750
Yes, yes, sir.

373
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,440
Park Chun Hui, the greatest beauty of Joseon, also used yulmu powder on her face.

374
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,920
But we are men.

375
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,450
We are also innkeepers who must write a thorough report.

376
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,690
Come on. Well...

377
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,680
Are you sure you are applying it correctly?

378
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,290
Do not forget it is your turn next.

379
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,040
Keep your mouth shut, sir.

380
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,470
The yulmu powder will get in there.

381
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,110
♫  A trembling feeling for the first time  ♫

382
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,570
♫  A distant gaze  ♫

383
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,970
It is my turn now.

384
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:42,060
♫  The noisy world becomes completely silent  ♫

385
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:49,140
♫  And like warm sunlight, you come to me  ♫

386
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:56,320
♫  I started to wonder since when it began  ♫

387
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,310
♫  How do you think of me?  ♫

388
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,230
Breathe.

389
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,770
Close your eyes.

390
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:17,830
♫  Is your heart pounding like mine right now?  ♫

391
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:24,980
♫  The blooming flowers sing  ♫

392
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:32,200
♫  The blowing wind whispers  ♫

393
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:40,700
♫  Like the warm sunlight  ♫ 
 ♫  You look at me  ♫

394
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:51,100
♫  And I bloom again as the person I used to be  ♫

395
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,860
♫  I bloom  ♫

396
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,790
I think we are out of yulmu. I will go get more.

397
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,390
Hey, Lee Eun Ho.

398
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,110
Where are you going?

399
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,000
You startled me!

400
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,300
W-What are you guys doing here?

401
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,610
We were coming to visit your room.

402
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,540
Y-Yes, go and relax in there.

403
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,230
Where are you going?

404
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,500
I am going out for some fresh air!

405
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,880
It must be...

406
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,830
a side effect of yulmu.

407
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,590
Or was it the honey?

408
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,400
Well, why is he leaving first?

409
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,330
Do you think I want to remain in the same room as you?

410
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:08,650
Have you finally decided to work for me?

411
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,700
I belong to Yongcheonru.

412
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,620
Why are you making a secretive request, then?

413
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,010
I am merely trying to assist you.

414
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,370
Come now, do not pretend to be so virtuous.

415
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,350
You switched sides once.

416
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:30,350
You betrayed your teacher, Hong Min Shik, did you not?

417
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:38,040
A wise individual knows how to read the flow.

418
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,530
Is that not so? It makes you prudent.

419
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:48,530
Prince Seon Yang requires prudent people to secure the throne.

420
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,070
If this succeeds, it will deal a devastating blow to Master Cheon's reputation.

421
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,170
So, what is your request?

422
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,950
Prince Eun Seong is unwell?

423
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,410
The Minister of Defense recently gifted him medicine,

424
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,000
and it seems to have worsened his condition.

425
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,210
Does he not know what kind of man the Minister is?

426
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,060
Why would he take it so recklessly?

427
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,700
Prince Eun Seong instructed me not to tell you,

428
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,170
but I believed you ought to know.

429
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,970
My apologies.

430
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,740
No, I am glad you told me.

431
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,190
   

432
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,920
Hyeongnim.

433
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,500
What brings you here?

434
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,070
I came because I heard you were unwell.

435
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,190
I am all right.

436
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,950
You know I have always had a cough.

437
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,350
Come.

438
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,610
When did you return from Onyang?

439
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:27,910
I heard you were recuperating, and I became worried.

440
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,190
Are you feeling better?

441
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,050
You have to be healthy.

442
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:38,440
As long as you and Father are in good health, I will have no concerns.

443
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,170
His Majesty sent a physician to care for me. He is very attentive,

444
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,330
so I am doing well.

445
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,990
You will stay in the palace now that you have returned, will you not?

446
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,970
No.

447
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,110
I must remain away longer to handle certain matters.

448
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,160
Hyeongnim, until I complete my work and return, please—

449
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,310
So, you were not staying in Onyang.

450
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,070
The Minister of Defense was here recently.

451
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,350
Does your task have something to do with him?

452
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,740
I cannot reveal anything now, but I promise to return.

453
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,820
He asked if I was practicing swordcraft these days.

454
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:25,420
He inquired about the dragon sword given to the princes,

455
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,900
so I showed him mine.

456
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,210
Why would he ask you about that?

457
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:33,490
Are you facing some sort of trouble?

458
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,070
No.

459
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,350
Everything is all right. You should not worry.

460
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,390
Let me assist you.

461
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,780
If you are in danger, I will take that sword in your stead.

462
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,880
I will not let that happen.

463
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,900
You should...

464
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,470
focus on your health first.

465
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,290
Have you made any progress regarding your stay at Yongcheonru?

466
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,790
The appointment ceremony will take place soon.

467
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,350
When Master Cheon leaves his residence,

468
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,080
I will search quickly.

469
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,200
You must act swiftly.

470
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,710
Prince Seon Yang's 10th birthday is approaching.

471
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,770
The Minister of Defense is making more aggressive demands.

472
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,840
I cannot delay the proclamation ceremony any longer.

473
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:52,280
Prince Mu Yeong, you must become the crown prince.

474
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:59,260
I heard the Minister of Defense visited Prince Eun Seong.

475
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,300
Is there something I do not yet know?

476
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,170
The Minister of Defense is attempting to slander you.

477
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,800
If it becomes known that you did not travel to Onyang,

478
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,300
he will seize the opportunity to use it against you.

479
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,100
Please, remain vigilant.

480
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,990
Be cautious.

481
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:23,220
Yes, Father.

482
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,520
Hong Jae On.

483
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,910
I have found her.

484
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,170
It took a very long time,

485
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,210
but I suppose I will finally finish what must be done.

486
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,950
 Find Hong Min Shik's daughter! 

487
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,170
 Search everywhere! 

488
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:44,470
 She cannot be too far off! 

489
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,400
 This way! 

490
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,870
What?

491
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,450
- What are you doing? 
 - Hong Deok Su.

492
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,450
It is me, Lee Eun Ho.

493
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:08,200
What are you doing at this hour, Lee Eun Ho?

494
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,250
What?

495
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,240
Does it hurt much?

496
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,380
You are pretending, are you not?

497
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,650
Pretending, my foot.

498
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,290
Did you have a nightmare?

499
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,830
What?

500
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,730
I could hear you groaning outside.

501
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,980
Did you dream of ghosts, like a child?

502
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,420
It was nothing like that.

503
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,520
How about you?

504
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Where have you been wandering all this time?

505
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,070
Follow me.

506
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,680
What?

507
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,720
Where are we going at this late hour?

508
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,220
What is this?

509
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,430
It is a peach tree branch.

510
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:28,160
It protects against ghosts and nightmares.

511
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,690
Lee Eun Ho, are you truly superstitious?

512
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,040
Give it back if you do not want it.

513
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,220
I do not care if you groan over nightmares or not.

514
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,710
No, no. I am sorry.

515
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,960
There are fewer stars than there were at the lake.

516
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,030
The fireflies were pretty.

517
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:25,190
You could not catch even one and lost all of them.

518
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:28,550
What? It was because you suddenly grabbed my hand—

519
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,700
How did you learn of this?

520
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,000
A branch that repels ghosts?

521
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,130
I have a cousin.

522
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,180
 When we were little, 

523
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,220
 we saw something terrifying. 

524
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,590
Did you two see a ghost or something?

525
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,860
We saw...

526
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,780
something far more frightening than a ghost.

527
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,200
I often had nightmares back then.

528
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:34,380
One day, Hyeongnim brought me a peach tree branch from the garden.

529
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,290
Since then, I have been fine.

530
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,600
What a kind cousin.

531
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:50,130
Thank you, Lee Eun Ho.

532
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,290
So, do you no longer have nightmares?

533
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,530
So, is he all right?

534
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,000
I will ensure that he is.

535
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,960
Oh my... you are quite the dependable younger brother.

536
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,110
Far more dependable than the branch.

537
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,700
What?

538
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,000
Hey, Hong Deok Su.

539
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,310
Hong Deok Su.

540
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:15,550
Jun Hwa, would you like to try it too?

541
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,530
Kim Myeong Ho, we need to avenge ourselves against those bastards.

542
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,440
Yes, let us go, Hong Deok Su.

543
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,950
♫  Leaning on each other's shoulders  ♫

544
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,510
Who was it?

545
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,950
You scared me!

546
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,090
Who did this?

547
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,800
Catch him!

548
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:46,330
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, the dazzling sun  ♫

549
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,960
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, the sparkling you  ♫

550
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,720
♫  Raise your head and come closer  ♫

551
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,010
Hong Deok Su!

552
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,430
Hey! How dare you?

553
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,420
- It was Cheon Jun Hwa— 
 - My handsome face...

554
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,670
It was Cheon Jun Hwa.

555
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,260
Calm down.

556
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,770
Guys, we must prepare.

557
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,150
Look at his whiskers.

558
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,800
 Growl! 

559
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,030
- Is he a cat? 
 - He is a cat.

560
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,990
Meow.

561
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,890
- It was Hong Deok Su. 
 - No, it was Cheon Jun Hwa.

562
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,070
- Hong Deok Su! 
 - It was Cheon Jun Hwa!

563
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:29,460
- Come here. 
 - I did not do it! I did not do it!

564
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,730
- What? 
 - Cheon Jun Hwa...

565
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,620
I cannot believe you came to my chambers at such an early hour.

566
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,630
I must have come too soon.

567
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:50,920
My apologies.

568
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:56,940
What is this?

569
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:01,440
We received premium pork, which is rare at Yongcheonru.

570
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,450
I came to gift it to you.

571
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:08,990
You entrusted me with Prince Mu Yeong's stay at Yongcheonru.

572
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:12,570
I thought I should repay your favor somehow.

573
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:17,000
So, you brought me premium pork?

574
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,650
Yes.

575
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,620
Prince Mu Yeong is officially becoming Yongcheonru's innkeeper today.

576
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,970
He lasted longer than I expected.

577
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,920
I am telling you because I am concerned for his safety.

578
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,150
If the Minister of Defense encounters Prince Mu Yeong at Yongcheonru,

579
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,980
it would place me in a difficult position as well.

580
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,420
That is why you must prevent it.

581
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,160
All the ministers support the Minister of Defense

582
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,890
and begging me to proclaim Prince Seon Yang as the crown prince.

583
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:07,360
We have not collected taxes either.

584
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,910
So...

585
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,330
Are you asking me a favor,

586
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,070
Your Majesty?

587
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:26,020
Yes, I understand.

588
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:36,350
The business partner of yours who died 12 years ago...

589
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,410
Are you still looking for Hong Min Shik's safe?

590
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:46,330
Why are you curious about that?

591
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:50,600
I heard he possessed a fortune.

592
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,730
You could resolve many things with that wealth.

593
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,670
 Did you visit the palace? 

594
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,410
Yes. 
    

595
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,810
Have you not heard anything about the daughter?

596
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:22,500
If she were alive, we would have heard of her by now.

597
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,770
Hong Jae On.

598
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,950
She and Jun Hwa share the same character in their names.

599
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:32,100
She was not destined to die easily.

600
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,830
Right, what about the fortune readings for those fellows?

601
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,140
Would you like to see them?

602
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,680
Go Su Ra.

603
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,930
Prince Mu Yeong.

604
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:00,370
He was destined to be the king.

605
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,510
Will I make him the king...

606
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,760
or discard him?

607
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,890
Prince Mu Yeong's fate depends on Young Master Jun Hwa.

608
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,280
How interesting.

609
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,620
   

610
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,560
This fellow named Hong Deok Su.

611
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:29,370
Are you sure you checked his fortune yourself?

612
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,040
Of course.

613
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,360
I used the date and time of birth he provided.

614
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:41,390
His fortune does not suit his face reading.

615
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,250
I should take a close look at him in person.

616
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:14,850
   

617
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,860
True man, Hong Deok Su. Whom are you dressing up for?

618
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:48,120
You are so slow.

619
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,320
Let us go.

620
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,690
That Jun Hwa.

621
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:55,940
I thought he would detest this and flee quickly.

622
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,870
But somehow, he persevered to this point.

623
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:02,050
Of course, he did. He is your successor.

624
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,250
I will now commence the appointment ceremony.

625
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,190
Yongcheonru's appointment ceremony starts now.

626
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,620
Master Cheon, who allowed this glorious event,

627
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,590
will deliver his welcome speech now.

628
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:01,320
 Master Cheon's residence is in the far back side of Yongcheonru's garden. 

629
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:21,770
Why did you...

630
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,360
join Yongcheonru?

631
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,300
 He is supposed to be at the appointment ceremony. 

632
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,340
 That is our chance. 

633
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:46,100
 Search thoroughly during that brief time. 

634
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,300
Being appointed is not the end. It is only the beginning.

635
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:59,010
What you must do from now on is create a new world,

636
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:02,490
one different from the outside world.

637
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:07,110
A world where anything is possible with money.

638
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:10,010
Not the class you were born in,

639
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:13,980
but money is ruling this world.

640
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,860
That is...

641
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:20,160
the Yongcheonru I created.

642
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:27,290
I welcome you to Yongcheonru.

643
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:46,090
The certificates and name tags will now be awarded.

644
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:51,950
Master Cheon will personally present them to the new innkeepers.

645
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:06,310
Kim Myeong Ho.

646
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,910
Min Du Shik.

647
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,650
Maeng Seok Sam.

648
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,040
Cheon Jun Hwa.

649
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,820
Lee Eun Ho.

650
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:51,520
Go Su Ra.

651
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,700
 Father, do not worry about me. 

652
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,730
 I will soon repay them for what they did that day. 

653
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,510
Hong Deok Su.

654
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,060
Yes.

655
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,120
 Move, move! 

656
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,780
 Move! 

657
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:38,370
Move!

658
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:50,460
 So, what is your request? 

659
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,860
 Yongcheonru's new innkeepers' appointment ceremony takes place tomorrow. 

660
01:08:54,860 --> 01:09:01,090
 Someone who is involved in the murder case you are investigating will be there. 

661
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,100
Who is Hong Deok Su?

662
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,880
Yes, I am Hong Deok Su.

663
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,650
You are under arrest...

664
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:19,040
for the murder of Kim Man Dol, known as the Seochon murder.

665
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:21,550
Pardon?

666
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,790
 You managed to make it this far. 

667
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,240
 It is thanks to you, Master Innkeeper. 

668
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:58,610
 What is the reason you joined Yongcheonru? 

669
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,970
 It is because of my parents. 

670
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:07,120
 There is something... 

671
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,740
 I need to achieve for them. 

672
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,460
 Yes, I hope you achieve that goal. 

673
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,890
 Yes. 

674
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,700
 I will make sure to achieve it. 

675
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,890
 You should rest fully today. 

676
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,600
 Tomorrow will be a busy day. 

677
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:41,900


678
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:47,050
   

679
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,810
♫  I walk alone on this thorny path  ♫

680
01:10:55,810 --> 01:11:00,050
♫  Questions etched deeply into my shattered heart  ♫

681
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:04,460
♫  Rekindling the flame of my frozen soul  ♫

682
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:09,090
♫  Facing the dark night that crashes upon me  ♫

683
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:11,440
♫  When the world keeps, keeps, keeps  ♫

684
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,030
 Did you not kill him with this sword? 

685
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:15,650
 Hong Deok Su cannot be the culprit. 

686
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:18,130
 There are too many suspicious details about this. 

687
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,550
 Could you be on my side? 

688
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:26,150
 How far are you willing to go for Hong Deok Su? 

689
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:29,270
 I am willing to sell everything I own to clear his name. 

690
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:32,300
 Buy me, Master Cheon. 

691
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,720
 Hong Deok Su. There is something about him. 

692
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,280
 Someone from Yongcheonru paid me money today,  

693
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:39,320
 saying it was a compensation for you. 

694
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,910
 I will correct this, Mother. 

695
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:44,630
 Is it because you are worried about Hong Deok Su? 

696
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:46,090
 Hong Deok Su. 

697
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:47,540
 Remain alert. 

698
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,740
 I can correct this. 

699
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:53,880
 Seol Mae Hwa, I will repay you for what you did. 

700
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,660
 I waited for you for a long time. 

701
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,910
 Long time no see. 

702
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:00,570
 - Prince Mu Yeong. 
 - I heard you have been looking for me. 

703
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:04,480
 You must have much to say about me. 

704
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,800
 I will never flee like a coward.
