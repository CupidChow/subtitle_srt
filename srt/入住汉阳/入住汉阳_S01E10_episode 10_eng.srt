1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
   

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,730
   

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,620
   

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:15,530


5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,160
   

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,230
 If so, what is the golden key Hong Deok Su has? 

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,420
 My late father willed it to me. 

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,160
 It is the only thing he left behind in this world. 

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,700
I could verify and find out.

10
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,020
Hong Deok Su, would you go to the Summer Palace with me this summer?

11
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,270
The Summer Palace?

12
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,990
Later, I mean.

13
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,770
I would like to go to the Summer Palace with you someday.

14
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,360
Hong Deok Su, would you come with me?

15
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,890
Hong Deok Su...

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,090
is a woman?

17
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,240
 Deok Su! 

18
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,290
Gu Shil, come, come.

19
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,010
Who are they?

20
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,250
Well, these are my classmates.

21
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,990
My Yongcheonru classmates.

22
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,460
- Cheon Jun Hwa. 
 - Hello.

23
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,980
Lee Eun Ho.

24
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,840
Please call me Gu Shil.

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,180
My goodness, they are the most handsome men in Joseon.

26
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,730
They are such fine gentlemen.

27
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,510
This is...

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,580
my fiancée.

29
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,390
What?

30
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,090
- What? 
 - What?

31
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,550
My fiancée, I said.

32
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,170
You had a fiancée?

33
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,500
You, Hong Deok Su?

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,480
We promised long ago that

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,800
we would marry if I became Yongcheonru's innkeeper.

36
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,690
Yes, I am...

37
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,100
Hong Deok Su's fiancée. Yes.

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,500
Oh, right! S-So, you are Seobangnim's friends. 
  (T/N: Respectful term for husband or fiancé) 

39
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,300
Did you bring Mother safely?

40
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,070
Yes, Seobangnim.

41
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,490
Mother is at Geumokdang.

42
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,800
Seobangnim! I have missed you so much.

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,480
We are to have a passionate night tonight, correct?

44
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,950
Goodness, keep it to yourself.

45
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,740
Let us proceed now.

46
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,320
All right.

47
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,010
I am sorry. I will depart now.

48
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,600
Excuse us.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,660
Aigoo, all right!

50
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,400
I have been waiting as well.

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,710
 I am dying. I am dying. 

52
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,070
Hong Deok Su, did you get caught by chance?

53
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,510
What do you mean? I did not.

54
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,950
What? What was with those handsome fellows, then?

55
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,560
There is no way I was caught.

56
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,380
Why were they behaving that way?

57
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,100
What if you are expelled from this place?

58
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,040
Goodness, no.

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,680
Anyway, you saved me, my Gu Shil.

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,410
Is it because we have known each other for years?

61
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,920
You are so swift, Jang Gu Shil.

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,850
Hong Deok, why are you changing the subject?

63
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,510
No, I am not. Let us proceed.

64
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,130
What was with the strange atmosphere just now?

65
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,460
Why were the most handsome men in Joseon

66
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,020
becoming agitated with you in the middle?

67
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,150
Not me, but you, Hong Ddeok?

68
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,270
Stop being foolish, and let us proceed. Come.

69
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,660
You have merely transformed a virgin into a married woman.

70
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,390
You owe me an explanation, at least.

71
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,360
I have not seen handsome men in such a long time.

72
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,270
Jang Gu Shil, what is with you?

73
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,540
You used to beseech me to marry you.

74
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,750
Give me a respite.

75
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,870
Wait for me.

76
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,240
Hurry up!

77
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,020
You lock your arm to mine.

78
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,080
Yes, Seobangnim.

79
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,560
I miss Mother.

80
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,510
Let us hurry.

81
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,890
Good to see you again.

82
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,620
 This is compensation for Hong Deok Su. 

83
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,090
Did you invite us?

84
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,800
I have no business with you.

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,480
It is not too late to leave with Hong Deok Su.

86
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,510
Is that why you left the money? Whether I liked it or not?

87
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,050
You need to depart far from Yongcheonru immediately.

88
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,150
What...

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,270
are you speaking about, exactly?

90
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,390
What are you doing right now?

91
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,860
- I will be waiting. 
 - Pardon?

92
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,730
Why would you wait for my mother?

93
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,290
Well, then.

94
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,270
- Deok Su. 
 - Oh, right.

95
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,820
I made an appointment at Dohwajeon.

96
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,180
My goodness, Dohwajeon?

97
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,660
That place where anyone can become Park Chun Hui, the greatest beauty of Joseon?

98
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,920
Yes, that Dohwajeon.

99
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,100
I made an appointment there.

100
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,760
Go with Mother. I will come and get you.

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,600
Yes, Mother. Let us go.

102
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,570
Yes, Mother. Go.

103
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,210
Let us go.

104
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,000
Your hands will get so soft, too.

105
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,660
Eat quickly.

106
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,360
Hong Deok Su had a fiancée.

107
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,620
How shocking.

108
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,630
I know.

109
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,500
I was very shocked.

110
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:20,630
Cheon Jun Hwa, did you not say you were in love with a woman?

111
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,120
Yes. What?

112
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,590
That is correct. Yes.

113
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
- That love confession earlier— 
 - It was a practice.

114
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,300
I wished to verify if the love confession you recommended would be effective.

115
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,690
Thus, I was practicing with Hong Deok Su.

116
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,470
- Practice? 
 - The more I practice, the more likely I will succeed.

117
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,040
I suppose.

118
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,300
Is your family not urging you to marry?

119
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,650
As for me,

120
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,950
matters will be decided by the elders soon.

121
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,570
Goodness... I feel sorry for you.

122
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,470
My father is so inquisitive about everything I do, too.

123
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,330
I wish to have courtships freely, at least.

124
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,320
Are you considering marrying the woman you love, then?

125
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,400
I would like to, if I could.

126
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,090
Cheon Jun Hwa,

127
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,140
let me know if you require my assistance at any time.

128
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,680
I will do my utmost to help you.

129
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,780
Thank you, Lee Eun Ho.

130
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,900
If we had not met like this, you and I

131
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,840
would have become great friends.

132
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,090
Are we not friends already?

133
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,240
Am I the only one who has been sincere?

134
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,030
You are correct.

135
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,090
We are friends.

136
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,740
We are gentlemen. Do not pat me on the shoulder.

137
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,930
 He is an ambassador from the Qing dynasty. 

138
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,180
 The ambassador visited for Prince Seon Yang's birthday celebration. 

139
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,870
He invited him for Prince Seon Yang without informing me?

140
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,100
Drink up.

141
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,710
Dear wife,

142
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,760
prepare this medicine for me.

143
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,690
To whom are you giving this expensive item?

144
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,590
An ambassador has arrived from the Qing dynasty.

145
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,320
Did he come for the crown prince proclamation?

146
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,580
Something is amiss.

147
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,680
Prince Mu Yeong disappeared somewhere, too.

148
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,890
I should use the gift as an excuse and go to Yongcheonru.

149
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,540
- To Yongcheonru? 
 - Yes.

150
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,900
Prepare the medicine for me.

151
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,600
You know the white liquor we received recently? Prepare that as well.

152
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,240
Why am I not accompanying you, then?

153
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,610
   

154
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,860
It is falling out like dry leaves these days.

155
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,200
You are the great tree of Yongcheonru.

156
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,180
Of course, you shed many dry leaves.

157
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,040
So what if I am the great tree of Yongcheonru?

158
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,250
I am about to lose all of my hair.

159
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,040
Let me have a look.

160
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,250
Do not worry at all.

161
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:40,120
I will make you appear handsome and beautiful, Head Manager.

162
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,610
Let me see.

163
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,030
Obtain a geun and a half of hair. 
  (T/N: ~ 31,75 oz or 900 g) 

164
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,670
The length will be one ja and five chi. 
  (T/N: ~ 17.9 inches or 45 cm) 

165
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,250
Dark brown, number two for the color.

166
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,450
Please wait a moment.

167
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,040
Only you understand what it is like to lose hair.

168
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,530
It is truly delicious, Mother.

169
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,160
It is honey and yulmu. Yulmu. 
  (T/N: Adlay) 

170
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
Aigoo, what on earth are we doing?

171
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,660
People would kill to eat this, but we apply it to our faces.

172
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,860
It is acceptable since it is free.

173
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,800
Just enjoy it, Mother.

174
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,690
Now I understand why the ladies' faces are so radiant.

175
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,240
- It looks amazing. 
 - Yes.

176
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,850
It truly resembles my hair.

177
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,240
This is me. This is me.

178
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,820
Yongcheonru's great tree. Great tree!

179
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,240
This is fantastic.

180
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,350
Thank you.

181
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,870
Thank you.

182
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,360
Good job. Continue.

183
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,630
My Lady, you arrived without an appointment.

184
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,760
You have a spot for me, correct?

185
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,910
- The thing is— 
 - Goodness...

186
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,040
Dohwajeon is not the same anymore.

187
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,110
All sorts of random people come here now.

188
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,190
It does not feel luxurious anymore.

189
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,840
 Hong Deok Su, would you come with me? 

190
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,490
 Hong Deok Su... is a woman? 

191
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,530
No way.

192
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,310
That cannot be.

193
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,890
There is no way I was caught.

194
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,000
You frightened me!

195
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,650
W-What are you doing here?

196
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,920
I came to ask you something.

197
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,320
Let me proceed first.

198
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,140
W-What is it?

199
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,030
By chance,

200
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,010
do you have...

201
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,410
any female relatives?

202
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,510
No.

203
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,080
I do not.

204
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,990
It is just my mother and me. Why?

205
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,930
I saw a woman who resembles you.

206
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,850
So, the matter is...

207
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,850
Innkeeper Hong Deok Su.

208
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,860
Yes, Master Cheon.

209
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,780
So, has your mother arrived?

210
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,210
Well, yes. She is at Dohwajeon right now.

211
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,740
I wished to greet her in person,

212
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,880
but I arrived too late.

213
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,430
What brings you here?

214
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,430
It is nothing.

215
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,050
I will depart to meet my mother now.

216
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,130
All right. I will return to greet her tomorrow.

217
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,530
Yes.

218
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,380
Who are you seeking?

219
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,070
I heard you were looking for a woman.

220
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,970
Should I investigate her for you?

221
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,170
It is none of your concern.

222
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,390
You are of marrying age.

223
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,560
You must be interested in women now.

224
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,900
You should immediately ascertain where the Qing ambassador is staying.

225
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,100
- Make it quick. 
 - Yes, sir.

226
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,300
- Lee Eun Ho! 
 - Stop that...

227
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,650
Why are you playing hide and seek with the Minister of Defense at this hour?

228
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,480
It is none of your concern.

229
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,560
Goodness, can you not simply thank me for saving you?

230
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,200
Thank you.

231
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,840
But I could have evaded him very easily.

232
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,120
Anyway, it is enjoyable to attempt various things like this.

233
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,640
Stay away from me.

234
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,970
Hey, you might get caught.

235
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,900
Hold on.

236
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,480
Your Excellency.

237
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,440
You...

238
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,830
You are that bastard from then.

239
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,200
Please spare me!

240
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:31,270
I can spare you... if you do as I say.

241
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,800
Lead the way.

242
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,500
Give me that.

243
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,310
Open the door.

244
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,720
- Cheers. 
  - Cheers. 

245
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,690
Good alcohol.

246
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,770
White liquor. White liquor.

247
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,360
Did you inspect?

248
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,720
I need to find another way.

249
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,760
   

250
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,760
This states "Kim Du Pal." Investigate this man.

251
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,630
I need to meet him personally.

252
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,720
Yes, I will follow your command.

253
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,360
  ­ 

254
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,860
My Deok Su.

255
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,750
He is the most intelligent person in Hanyang, but...

256
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,780
Hey, sleep well and quietly if you are drunk, Jang Gu Shil.

257
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,020
Hong Deok Su,

258
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,690
what do you know about love? What?

259
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,680
Your heart goes pitter-patter.

260
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:37,150
What do you know about a heart-tickling love?

261
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,110
You should live as a woman now.

262
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,010
Life is short.

263
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,890
Gu Shil,

264
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,060
the pitter-patter...

265
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,660
and ticklish feeling.

266
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,280
Is that...

267
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,180
love?

268
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,420
But you know...

269
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,650
I should not be...

270
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,640
loving someone right now.

271
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,760
- Did you chat with Hong Deok Su? 
 - What?

272
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,350
Yes.

273
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,870
You said you were meeting with her.

274
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,200
It was a complete failure.

275
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,710
What?

276
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,030
What was there to fail?

277
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,660
It turns out love confessions are not easy.

278
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,560
Did you tell her you love her by chance?

279
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,920
Yes.

280
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:25,170
Lee Eun Ho taught me a method that worked on countless women.

281
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,640
That is not the correct order.

282
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,490
What? What order?

283
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,670
You should have informed her that you know she is a woman first.

284
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,160
She is living as a man because of circumstances.

285
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,620
She would not reciprocate if you suddenly declared your love.

286
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,460
Was I not rejected yet, then?

287
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,450
That is correct!

288
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,890
Go Su Ra, have you confessed love to someone?

289
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,330
I learned from Lee Eun Ho, but I need a new strategy.

290
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,910
That is what is wrong.

291
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,630
A strategy for love?

292
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,030
What am I supposed to do, then? What?

293
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,370
- What do I do? 
 - The world is becoming chaotic these days.

294
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,560
Tell me how.

295
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,140
Good morning, everyone.

296
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,750
Here comes another strategist.

297
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,680
Good luck, you two.

298
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,190
Did Hong Deok Su sleep at Geumokdang last night?

299
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,680
I would not know that.

300
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,330
You are roommates. Why do you not know?

301
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,550
They must have been happy together since his fiancée arrived.

302
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,030
A passionate night even before they wed?

303
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,700
What is happening to this country?

304
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,150
I am sorry. I said the wrong thing to an innocent fellow.

305
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,280
Innocent?

306
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,980
Roar!

307
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,720
Call me a beast.

308
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,480
A tiger?

309
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,920
Where did you two go wrong, exactly?

310
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,620
Go Su Ra, you need to help me.

311
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,490
 Whatever. 

312
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,330
I was almost tardy.

313
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,720
You arrived.

314
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,820
Yes.

315
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,000
Did you sleep well?

316
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,390
- Yes. 
 - Yes, good.

317
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,720
New innkeepers are late?

318
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,100
What a joke.

319
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,300
They are a disgrace to the Yongcheonru innkeepers.

320
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,300
Did you come from Geumokdang?

321
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,900
Yes, I had a drink with Gu Shil last night.

322
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,370
I see.

323
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,630
The famous fiancée?

324
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,760
What is happening to this country?

325
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,400
How do you have a fiancée, Hong Deok Su?

326
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,560
That is sufficient.

327
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,570
True gentleman, Hong Deok Su.

328
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,120
It is something to celebrate.

329
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,200
Yes, yes. Yes? Yes.

330
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,040
Of course, it should be celebrated.

331
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,150
True man, Hong Deok Su.

332
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,150
I am so tired because I have not performed manly duties in a while.

333
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,850
Oh, is that so?

334
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,820
- You must be very tired. 
 - That is enough, I said.

335
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
   

336
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,600
Kim Myeong Ho, Maeng Seok Sam, and Min Du Shik will go to Chinyeongrae.

337
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,550
Hong Deok Su, Lee Eun Ho, Go Su Ra, and Cheon Jun Hwa will assist with tasks at Jeongjudang.

338
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,980
A guest at Geumokdang has rejected breakfast three times already.

339
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
All right, proceed now.

340
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,050
 Yes. 

341
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,090
This is not it!

342
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,950
We will bring another soup.

343
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,300
Where is Deok Su?

344
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,150
He already went to work.

345
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,330
How much did you drink together last night?

346
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,940
A bowl of your soup would cure me immediately right now.

347
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,700
Yes, I should serve Deok Su a warm bowl of soup before I depart.

348
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,500
Prepare it for us. Please?

349
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,140
Where have I seen him?

350
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,310
He certainly looked familiar.

351
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,230
What are you mumbling?

352
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,000
Hold on.

353
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,630
Let me think.

354
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,480
Who was that?

355
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,320
I need to enter the palace. Bring me my robe.

356
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,910
Why are you going to the palace?

357
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,990
Because of Prince Seon Yang's proclamation ceremony.

358
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,810
Do you think I would play Go with the King?

359
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,550
They entertained the ambassadors from the Qing dynasty.

360
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:57,690
They cannot delay it any longer by using Prince Mu Yeong as an excuse.

361
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,780
Prince Mu Yeong!

362
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,030
It was Prince Mu Yeong!

363
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,020
Goodness, I am so relieved.

364
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,030
I finally remembered.

365
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,080
Goodness, seriously...

366
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,980
What about Prince Mu Yeong?

367
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,180
Guess who I saw at Yongcheonru yesterday.

368
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,980
- Prince Mu Yeong was there. 
 - What?

369
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,520
But... why was he wearing the Yongcheonru uniform?

370
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,770
Goodness, that is why I could not remember.

371
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,260
Of course.

372
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,460
Those little bastards.

373
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,130
Excuse me for a moment.

374
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,720
Goodness! You frightened me.

375
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,490
What on earth...

376
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,570
It smells incredible.

377
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,850
What is your secret?

378
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,060
I merely boil it. What else?

379
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:26,050
I would have served everyone if I had brought enough ingredients.

380
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,490
Gosh, I forgot the dongchimi. 
  (T/N: Water-based radish kimchi) 

381
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,660
Aigoo, aigoo!

382
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,570
Mother, where are you going? You do not know the directions.

383
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,150
Wow, this is...

384
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,490
Goodness, seriously.

385
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,590
He does not want beef soup or clam soup.

386
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,730
I know he is a foreigner, but what am I to do?

387
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,700
I can taste the essence of shiraegi. 
  (T/N: Dried radish greens) 

388
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,910
It has a deep flavor.

389
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,500
- Goodness, you frightened me! 
 - What is with you?

390
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,870
Hyeongnim, what is this?

391
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,000
Well, some woman was just...

392
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,120
What?

393
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,790
What is it?

394
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,360
This reminds me... of my mother in the Qing dynasty.

395
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,380
It is delicious.

396
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,500
Who stole the soup for my child?

397
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,980
Damn it...

398
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,680
Do not look at me like that.

399
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,820
I-I know nothing. I-It was not me.

400
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,120
You should not look at me like that.

401
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,300
 Mother! 

402
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,480
Hey, Deok Su.

403
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,140
This is your mother.

404
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,720
Hello, nice to meet you. I am Cheon Jun Hwa.

405
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,540
- Hello, ma'am. 
 - You must be Deok Su's friends.

406
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,990
By the way, why are you at Jeongjudang?

407
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:35,890
Well, I prepared just one bowl of soup to serve you before I depart.

408
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:39,220
But some scoundrel just stole it.

409
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,780
What is this commotion about?

410
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,220
Hey, it was him.

411
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,580
The one who stole the soup.

412
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,370
They asked for a hundred servings, not just one more?

413
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,260
I cannot do it.

414
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,920
Yes, you are here to rest. You should not work.

415
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,470
Do not do it.

416
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,920
Deok Su.

417
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,530
Deok Su.

418
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,990
Help me just once.

419
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,250
Why do you keep calling my child, anyway?

420
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,850
He is not just anyone. He is the Head Host.

421
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,210
He is an important person.

422
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:40,390
♫  When a gentle breeze blows through the clear sky  ♫

423
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,240
Beef team, take your positions!

424
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,860
Vegetable team, take your positions!

425
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,980
All right, let us go!

426
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,700
♫  With excitement-filled dreams  ♫

427
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,260
♫  You can climb higher  ♫

428
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,240
♫  Take a deep breath  ♫

429
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:07,140
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, the dazzling sun  ♫

430
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,820
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, the sparkling you  ♫

431
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:16,350
♫  Raise your head and come closer  ♫

432
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,680
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, you'll feel it  ♫

433
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,120
♫  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, this overwhelming feeling  ♫

434
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,720
It is a hit.

435
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,810
♫  Shall we match our free steps? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  ♫

436
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,760
Goodness, you should have asked me. Here you go.

437
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Goodness, you are useful because you are tall.

438
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,590
I am strong, too.

439
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,610
Mother, do not do anything, just give me orders.

440
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,920
Thank you for being good friends with Deok Su.

441
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,670
Do not mention it.

442
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,300
I am Hong Deok Su's best friend at Yongcheonru.

443
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,560
It will continue to remain so. You just need to trust me.

444
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,940
Do not be obstinate, Cheon Jun Hwa.

445
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,000
Goodness, damn it.

446
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,840
He practically licked the bowl.

447
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,910
What is she saying?

448
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,370
She said, "Damn it..."

449
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,000
She said it is a very special soup.

450
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,250
Mother.

451
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,630
I feel rejuvenated.

452
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,690
He has not eaten properly since he left home.

453
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,180
He enjoyed the food very much today.

454
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,600
He has good taste.

455
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,840
   

456
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,160
Well done, everyone.

457
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,930
Enjoy your meal.

458
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,770
You worked the hardest.

459
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,920
It feels like eating a home-cooked meal, Mother.

460
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,290
Really?

461
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,240
Come by if you wish to eat it anytime.

462
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,960
You are Deok Su's friends. I can always serve you.

463
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,860
Aigoo, stop poking at it and just eat it.

464
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,620
Goodness, are you all right?

465
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,210
Have some water.

466
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,150
My goodness. Here you go.

467
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,870
Goodness, thank you.

468
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,300
Well, M-Mother.

469
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,520
You should eat, too.

470
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,600
You worked hard all day.

471
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,730
Seeing you eat makes me feel content.

472
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,800
Remain good friends like this from now on.

473
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Do not worry, Mother.

474
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,760
Yes. Once friends, always friends.

475
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,780
My Deok Su...

476
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,820
Please help him when he is in need.

477
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,140
Of course, Mother.

478
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,180
Just trust me.

479
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,750
That is enough. Eat now.

480
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,560
You brat.

481
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,450
Goodness, Seobangnim.

482
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,440
You need to listen to Mother.

483
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,810
"Seobangnim"?

484
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,430
Why is everyone so talkative today?

485
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,270
Proceed and eat.

486
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,010
Eat, eat.

487
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,860
Aigoo, this little brat.

488
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,830
He makes mistakes because of his temper.

489
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,370
Please understand it.

490
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,600
I am aware.

491
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,560
Hey, how do you know my temper?

492
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,830
He appears that way, but he is gentle inside.

493
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,830
I am aware of that, too.

494
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:49,210
I am so glad Deok Su has great friends like you.

495
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,640
You created a cave here...

496
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,270
and have been acting like the King.

497
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,010
It is merely a painting.

498
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,470
Should I send you one, too?

499
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,090
How impudent. So very impudent.

500
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,780
This is treason. Treason.

501
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,950
It is treason.

502
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,000
You did it with me, did you not?

503
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,900
You are behaving totally shamelessly now?

504
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,300
Do you have no fear? Or are you a fool?

505
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,550
So, what brings you here today?

506
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,840
Prince Mu Yeong is at Yongcheonru, is he not?

507
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,450
I already know.

508
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,100
I thought you knew.

509
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,510
- Did you not know, by chance? 
 - What?

510
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,650
Are you saying that after you have been hiding him?

511
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,060
This tea is pleasant.

512
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,190
Please drink some.

513
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,800
Do you think I am here to drink tea?

514
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,470
To enjoy good tea, you need to wait until it brews properly.

515
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,350
Does that not apply to everything?

516
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,120
Do not change the subject!

517
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:44,560
- Prince Mu Yeong and Lady Do Gyeong can have their wedding at Yongcheonru. 
 - What?

518
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,500
Is that not what you desired?

519
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,940
If you bring Prince Mu Yeong into your family,

520
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,600
no one would oppose you anymore.

521
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,520
The royal family will be under your roof.

522
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:12,840
It will be a grand ceremony. Do not worry.

523
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,300
It is a wedding with the royal family. We cannot do that.

524
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,700
There is an order to follow.

525
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,610
I need the King's approval first.

526
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:32,400
You can create the order yourself, Your Excellency.

527
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,000
The sword found at the murder scene.

528
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,440
You still possess that, correct?

529
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,890
Your Majesty,

530
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,870
I have been greatly negligent.

531
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,230
Please forgive me.

532
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,360
Since I was concerned about Prince Seon Yang's birthday and proclamation ceremony,

533
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,530
I did not understand your concerns.

534
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:13,080
Everything is my fault.

535
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:20,370
What is this long preamble for this time?

536
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,570
Prince Mu Yeong is of marrying age.

537
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,220
The royal wedding needs to occur soon

538
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,100
so the royal family will remain steadfast and strong.

539
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,960
I will order the selection when the time is right.

540
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,250
You could, but...

541
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:46,730
young people these days apparently prefer to meet naturally.

542
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,620
I will bring my niece, who went to Onyang.

543
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,300
Why are you initiating matters concerning the Inner Courts?

544
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,960
The royal family has strict rules.

545
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,860
 Bring it in. 

546
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,640
If Prince Mu Yeong is investigated for murder,

547
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:11,970
would that not disrupt the order of the royal family?

548
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,020
Murder?

549
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,220
Watch what you say, Minister.

550
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,130
I do not know what to do, either.

551
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:24,320
But the evidence is so clear.

552
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,550
We will have to find a solution.

553
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,010
We need to distract the people at times like this, Your Majesty.

554
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,520
So, is your solution...

555
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,810
to have Prince Mu Yeong married?

556
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:50,040
If he becomes a part of my family,

557
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,060
how could I not act accordingly?

558
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,590
I will...

559
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:00,010
find... a solution somehow.

560
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:04,790
Minister.

561
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,150
If Your Majesty permits it,

562
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,820
I will arrange...

563
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,910
the engagement first, at least.

564
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:18,810
Yongcheonru will be in charge of the wedding.

565
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,810
You arrived.

566
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,560
Did you plan to meet the person who put up the poster there?

567
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,440
Yes. Let us go.

568
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,870
Master Innkeeper.

569
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,340
Did you find Hong Jae On?

570
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:54,230
- Why do you— 
 - I asked if you know her whereabouts.

571
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,620
Did Cheon make you put up this poster?

572
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,250
Where is Hong Jae On?

573
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:07,550
Do you not wish to know where the golden key is?

574
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,760
What happened twelve years ago?

575
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,830
Please tell me.

576
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,660
Because of the man who sought the golden key,

577
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:28,220
a family has been destroyed.

578
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,250
Do you mean Hong Min Shik's family?

579
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,730
What is the significance of the golden key? Why did it destroy a family?

580
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:43,710
You are searching for it, too.

581
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,750
Answer me.

582
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,830
Will you make the same decision...

583
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,330
to acquire the golden key?

584
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,160
No matter how important it is,

585
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,290
it cannot compare to a person's life.

586
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:10,630
I am searching for it to correct everything.

587
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,530
Correct everything?

588
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:30,960
Do you think His Majesty shares the same idea, too...

589
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,870
Prince Mu Yeong?

590
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,700
When did you discover?

591
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,750
Forgive me.

592
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,340
I dared to test you, Your Highness.

593
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,010
What do you mean? You tested me?

594
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,900
The painting of the golden key.

595
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,730
I am the one who sent it to the palace.

596
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,190
What is your intention?

597
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:16,320
I have someone precious I need to protect.

598
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,350
Did you have a history with that family?

599
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:25,820
Investigate the case involving the golden key twelve years ago.

600
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,220
That needs to take precedence.

601
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,430
I brought you here to treat you,

602
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,800
but you ended up working the entire time.

603
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:06,420
I am happy to do anything as long as I am with you.

604
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,220
Me, too.

605
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,520
By the way...

606
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,780
Mother...

607
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,200
Yes?

608
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,760
Tell me it is all right as you used to.

609
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:34,680
You know, when I woke up crying as a child,

610
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:40,750
you used to say, "It is all right. It is all right."

611
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,120
Mother,

612
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,400
everything will be all right.

613
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,120
Do not worry so much.

614
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:07,220
Your child, Hong Deok Su, will ensure it.

615
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,880
All right.

616
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,790
It is all right.

617
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,240
It is all right.

618
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,850
It is all right.

619
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,060
It is all right.

620
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,260
 Help me. 

621
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,590
 Save me, please. Help... 

622
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,260
 Find Hong Min Shik's daughter, Hong Jae On! 

623
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,190
 Sweetie. Sweetie. 

624
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:00,820
 It is all right. It is all right. 

625
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,960
 I will protect you. 

626
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,980
 It is all right. It is all right. 

627
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,490
 Plague! 

628
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,470
 Something occurred last night. 

629
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,710
 What happened, exactly? 

630
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,070
 I heard the Hong family was slaughtered. 

631
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:29,500
 Slaughtered? 

632
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,090
 - Who was the culprit? 
 - How would I know? 

633
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:36,060
 They wore masks. No one saw their faces. 

634
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,770
 - How frightening. 
 - I know. 

635
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,620
 The living must carry on. 

636
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:11,370
 It is all right. It is all right. 

637
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:16,180
It is all right.

638
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,740
Yes.

639
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,760
It will be all right.

640
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:42,070
It is all right. It is all right.

641
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,220
 It is not too late to leave with Hong Deok Su. 

642
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,810
 You need to depart far from Yongcheonru immediately. 

643
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:02,100
 I will be waiting. 

644
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:09,000
Mother, let us go to Dohwajeon once more later. All right?

645
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,880
Did you not love the yulmu?

646
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,590
Mother, where are you going?

647
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,030
Stop.

648
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,360
Is your mother departing today?

649
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,030
Yes, thank you for inviting her.

650
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:53,810
I heard she worked hard making a hundred servings of soup yesterday.

651
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:58,310
How shall I compensate her for the soup?

652
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,710
Ten nyang per serving, please.

653
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:07,430
I did not know soups were that expensive.

654
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:10,020
The market soup costs five jeon.

655
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,240
But the Yongcheonru soup should be different.

656
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,670
Did you set that price because you will not sell it again?

657
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:24,000
The more expensive it is, the more it is desired.

658
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,790
Especially at Yongcheonru.

659
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,530
What a cheeky bastard.

660
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,370
What you tried to tell me...

661
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:55,330
Could you now inform me who is seeking Deok Su?

662
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:07,430
I prepared a horse by the rear gate.

663
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:10,700
Please bring Hong Deok Su as soon as possible.

664
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:14,040
If you wait, Hong Deok Su...

665
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,540
Jae On will die.

666
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,650
Deok Su!

667
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,770
Deok Su!

668
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:41,880
Deok Su...

669
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,010
Are you Hong Deok Su's mother?

670
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,680
I should have greeted you sooner.

671
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,100
I finally get to meet you.

672
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:06,620
I am the owner of Yongcheonru.

673
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,190
 Plague! 

674
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,200
 You cannot enter. 

675
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,500
 Did you find the girl? 

676
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,320
 Please forgive me. 

677
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:45,750
Wait, are you feeling unwell?

678
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:49,630
N-No.

679
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:52,270
Do not overexert yourself.

680
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:57,170
Yongcheonru owes your cooking skills greatly.

681
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,480
Y-Yes.

682
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,990
It is a shame you are departing today.

683
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,840
I will see you again.

684
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,210
Gu Shil!

685
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:28,280
Gu Shil!

686
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,580
Gu Shil! Gu Shil!

687
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,040
Mother! What is wrong?

688
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,150
What is going on?

689
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:37,750
Go fetch Deok Su now. Hurry!

690
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,210
W-What about Deok Su?

691
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:43,440
It is him. It is him!

692
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,440
Hurry, hurry up and go!

693
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,080
- All right, Mother. 
 - Deok Su...

694
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,430
I told you to go fetch Deok Su. Why are you returning—

695
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,690
Why are you in such a hurry?

696
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:17,730
Is there something urgent occurring?

697
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,600
N-No.

698
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,650
What brings you here?

699
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,210
Why—

700
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:33,760
I did not get to tell you something earlier.

701
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,550
What is it?

702
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:45,550
You have raised... your son very well.

703
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:49,430
The more I see him, the more desirable he is as a talent.

704
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:53,340
You are too generous.

705
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:59,480
You have achieved something great.

706
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:04,090
You saved her from the plague, too.

707
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:09,680
You endured much, did you not?

708
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,400
You raised a girl as a son.

709
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:34,680
The other half of the golden key.

710
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,370
Does Hong Deok Su possess it?

711
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,800
It was you, was it not?

712
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,760
Twelve years ago, that night,

713
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,810
you hid Hong Jae On and saved her.

714
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:06,970
Do not dare lay a finger on my child!

715
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:22,900
Do you know how much blood I have on my hands because of you?

716
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,040
The heavens will punish you!

717
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,880
Punish?

718
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,350
I am the heavens.

719
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,880
Deok Su!

720
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,550
Deok Su! Hong Deok Su!

721
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,510
What?

722
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:13,310
I ran because you said it was urgent.

723
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:17,650
She was seeking you urgently earlier.

724
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,690
Mother, are you sleeping?

725
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,960
Seriously.

726
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,510
Mother.

727
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:44,720
Mother.

728
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,530
Mother, wake up.

729
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,530
Mother.

730
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,560
Mother.

731
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,330
Mother, open your eyes. Mother.

732
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,060
W-What is wrong, Deok Su?

733
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,490
Gu Shil. A physician. Bring a physician now.

734
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:12,720
Mother, Mother, open your eyes.

735
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,290
Mother. My goodness...

736
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,350
Mother, it is Deok Su. Open your eyes.

737
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,570
Mother, what is wrong?

738
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:23,160
Mother...

739
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,860
Mother.

740
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:29,210
Mother, stay awake.

741
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,970
Gu Shil is fetching a physician.

742
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,380
Deok Su...

743
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,900
Yes.

744
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,600
That bastard...

745
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,620
It is that bastard.

746
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:46,130
Which bastard? Who?

747
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:50,790
The one who came to kill you.

748
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:54,850
It is that Master Cheon.

749
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:00,170
- What? 
 - Hurry up... and flee.

750
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,620
Mother.

751
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,030
Wake up, Mother.

752
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:42,330
Mother.

753
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:45,790
Mother!

754
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:47,540
Mother!

755
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,930
Mother! Mother! Mother!

756
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:54,840
 What are you doing? Mother! 

757
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,140
 Open your eyes, Mother. 

758
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,820
 What are you doing, Mother? 

759
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,890
 Mother! 

760
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:30,110
So, did you send your mother off well?

761
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:33,360
You must be tired from the funeral.

762
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,100
You should have rested longer.

763
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,590
No need for that.

764
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,690
It is truly a shame.

765
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:47,900
She was so healthy, and she left so suddenly.

766
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:55,900
I wish to take revenge.

767
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,910
Revenge?

768
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,070
My mother...

769
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:05,510
was murdered.

770
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:07,130
Murdered?

771
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:09,580
By whom?

772
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:17,460
Twelve years ago, someone stabbed my father to death.

773
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,760
And my mother, who raised me, was also...

774
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:28,100
Someone stabbed your father to death?

775
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,000
- What do you— 
 - Seol Mae Hwa.

776
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,080
It was Master Innkeeper Seol Mae Hwa.

777
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,090
If so,

778
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:46,500
was your father—

779
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:49,040
Hong...

780
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,640
Min Shik.

781
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,040
He was my father.

782
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,640
You are his—

783
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,520
Yes, I am...

784
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,680
Hong Jae On.

785
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,900
   

786
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:45,000


787
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:56,060
♫  The flowing river speaks no words  ♫

788
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,720
 I will take revenge for this. 

789
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,320
 I will be your hands and feet, Master Cheon. 

790
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,880
 I heard there will be a royal wedding at Yongcheonru. 

791
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,830
 I will obtain what I desire then. 

792
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:12,180
 This revenge will capture everyone's attention. 

793
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:16,910
 Hong Jae On. The more I see you, the more you resemble me. 

794
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,140
 Master Innkeeper, you have arrived. 

795
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,010
 Will you insist on feigning ignorance? 

796
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:26,470
 Why did you conceal that Hong Deok Su was Hong Min Shik's daughter? 

797
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:29,290
 The Minister of Defense wishes to arrange your wedding. 

798
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:32,190
 Let him arrange my wedding. 

799
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:34,280
 The Minister of Defense is like a hyena. 

800
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,910
 If Prince Mu Yeong and the Minister of Defense were to fight... 

801
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:40,760
 Everything about my wedding must be festive. 

802
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,390
 And they should harm each other fatally. It would be even better. 

803
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:45,940
 - What is wrong with him? 
 - Did you wish to see me? 

804
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,450
 What do you think? 

805
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:49,910
 Stand behind me instead. 

806
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:52,790
 Listen to me carefully. We have much to accomplish. 

807
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,790
 My revenge... 

808
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,040
 will commence from now on.
