1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
   

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,460
   

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,350
 Now, you pupas will change into your uniforms, 
   

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,100
and assemble in the courtyard.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,940
W-Where?

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:18,990


7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,130
   

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,420
Have you started accepting the apprentices?

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,150
We released 30 red cards to hire male apprentices at Gyohwadang this year,

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,280
but two were absent.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760
Therefore, 28 apprentices are joining today.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,020
Jun Hwa and Prince Mu Yeong are joining together.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,700
It is very peculiar.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,920
I had to teach Jun Hwa how to deal with the royal family.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,140
It is a good thing.

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,160
The Young Master has never shown interest in Yongcheonru before,

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,990
but it is time he learned.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,090
I personally put that king on the throne.

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,280
Jun Hwa needs to create the next one.

20
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,560
If so, are you considering...

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,290
Prince Mu Yeong for the vacant crown prince position?

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,750
That is up to Jun Hwa.

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,220
The Young Master will do well, as he is smart and kind.

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,170
Kind?

25
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,700
Do you know how weak being kind makes you?

26
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,500
Money has no eyes.

27
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,300
It has no ears, no mouth,

28
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,160
and no friends, either.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,740
No one is an aristocrat or a slave in front of money.

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,230
Even the king in that mighty palace...

31
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,820
is nothing in front of money.

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,820
You must know that better than anyone.

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,300
I told you not to do this here!

34
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,310
This is my uniform, I said.

35
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,640
This is my uniform, I said.

36
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,430
Let go!

37
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,860
Take my uniform off if you are leaving.

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,390
What are you bastards doing?

39
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,880
You are all getting penalties.

40
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,240
My apologies, Master Innkeeper.

41
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,500
You must be working so hard.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,780
Master Innkeeper...

43
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,890
I have been wanting to meet you.

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,840
I have wanted to meet you very much, Master Innkeeper.

45
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,840
W-What are you doing?

46
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,370
How dare you talk to Master Innkeeper?

47
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,000
My apologies.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,410
They do not know their place yet.

49
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,490
I am very much looking forward to this group.

50
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,460
They are in your care.

51
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,500
Yes, of course.

52
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,940
I will expel all of these immature bastards

53
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,640
and pick the smart ones...

54
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,320
Aigoo, we are ruined.

55
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,690
Assemble!

56
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,860
I can feel it. I can feel it.

57
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,350
I can feel the four of you are doomed.

58
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,510
The four of you will get penalties.

59
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,300
Tell me your numbers, one by one.

60
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,260
However, Instructor, I am a victim.

61
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,870
He picked a fight with me. He did.

62
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,960
I am innocent, too.

63
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,200
I was late because he took my uniform.

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,950
Gosh, that is why it was so uncomfortable.

65
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,630
I am sorry.

66
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,820
You. What is your excuse?

67
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,330
I am...

68
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,170
- number 28. 
 - What? Shipal? 
  (T/N: Korean swear word. Sounds similar to 18.) 

69
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,430
You...

70
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,780
Number 28. All right.

71
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,650
Quiet, you bastards!

72
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,090
Why are you not standing in the back?

73
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,270
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,890
Go on.

75
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,930
Move quickly!

76
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,820
Aigoo... All right!

77
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,160
Congratulations on joining the academy.

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,340
But entering Gyohwadang does not mean you will pass.

79
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:27,130
- I do not know if you can survive until the end, but I wish you good luck, bastards! 
 - Go...

80
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,230
Focus!

81
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,810
The most important thing you should remember from now

82
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,600
is silence!

83
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,550
Once you murmur and chitchat...

84
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,850
make these noises, you will get penalties!

85
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,990
You tripped while walking?

86
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,450
You cannot scream. Just... keep your mouth shut.

87
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,670
You choked while eating?

88
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,910
You cannot cough!

89
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,460
Just press your throat!

90
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,230
Even while plunging on the toilet...

91
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,720
just keep your mouth shut.

92
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,010
Here is a quiz.

93
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,920
"Hey, is anyone there?"

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,260
A guest in the room is calling you.

95
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,890
What do you do?

96
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,720
Pardon?

97
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,770
Say, "Yes?"

98
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,500
Wrong. What is your number?

99
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,820
I am Number 29.

100
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,450
Number 29. Penalties!

101
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,100
- However... 
 - Silent.

102
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,010
   

103
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,270
Why would you look at the guests?

104
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,190
Do not even make eye contact.

105
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,030
Remember. Silence!

106
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,120
Understand?

107
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,610
 - Yes.  
 - Yes!

108
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,550
The ones who spoke will get penalties.

109
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,800
Tell me your numbers.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,820
- I am Number 19. 
 - Number 19.

111
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,140
- I am Number 22. 
 - Number 22.

112
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,520
All right, we will take a tour around the great Yongcheonru.

113
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,250
   

114
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,600
   

115
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,990
Yongcheonru is as big as the palace where His Majesty lives.

116
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,720
Its goal is top hospitality.

117
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,510
And Chinyeongrae is where it all starts.

118
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,820
It means "A warm and welcoming place."

119
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,030
Chinyeongrae is like the face of Yongcheonru.

120
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,640
You must impress the guests with the best service here.

121
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,880
   

122
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,330
   

123
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,490
This is Yeonhwajeon.

124
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,810
What is that?

125
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,780
 At Yeonhwajeon, we provide the best food 

126
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,910
 in Joseon to the dining guests 

127
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,380
 and the guests who are staying at Yongcheonru. 

128
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,230
 The smell... 

129
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,970
 Daebak! 

130
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,330
 Is that pork or beef? 

131
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,000
 How fascinating. 

132
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,920
   

133
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,690
   

134
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,310
 Next is Yehwajeon. 

135
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,420
 The people who come to get married at Yongcheonru 

136
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,520
 from all over the country have their weddings here. 

137
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,840
The bride and groom will take a bow.

138
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,870
   

139
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,430
 This is Dohwajeon. 

140
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,540
 Here, everyone can be like Park Chun Hui, the greatest beauty of Joseon. 

141
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,440
And...

142
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,680
this is Gyohwadang, where you are now.

143
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,310
This is Sedabdang. This is Jeongjudang.

144
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,880
This is the innkeepers' dormitory.

145
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,720
This is the managers' library.

146
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,770
Where does the Master Innkeeper live, then?

147
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,050
Why should a lowly apprentice know about that?

148
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,710
- You get a penalty. 
 - Pardon?

149
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,270
What is your number?

150
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,950
Number!

151
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,270
I am Number 30.

152
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,210
Number 30.

153
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,920
Listen carefully.

154
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,840
You cannot go anywhere without my permission. Understand?

155
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,670
 Yes. 

156
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,930
I will teach you about Yongcheonru's guest rooms.

157
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,330
Yongcheonru's most basic inn is Honguigak.

158
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,310
   

159
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,580
 Guests who are traveling far usually stay here overnight. 

160
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,310
 The inn that is a tier above Honguigak is... 

161
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,100
 Cheonguigak. 

162
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,640
 Merchants usually stay at Cheonguigak 

163
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,030
 to buy and sell goods. 

164
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,550
 The inn a tier above that is Geumuigak. 

165
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,590
 It is the most luxurious inn at Yongcheonru. 

166
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,410
 Not anyone can stay here because of the high cost. 

167
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:32,620
 At Geumuigak, there are no impossible requests the guests can make. 

168
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:38,190
 The guest can even be the king if he wants to. 

169
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,920
Are you speaking of treason right now?

170
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,990
How dare they pretend to be the king? Do you all want to die?

171
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,740
Do you not know three generations get punished for treason?

172
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,190
You will lose your head before the three generations get punished.

173
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,620
Yes, keep going.

174
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,980
I am happy to see you acting that way.

175
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,700
What did you say?

176
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,050
 What is with him? What is he doing? 

177
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,050
 Sit down now. 

178
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,920
 What is with him? 

179
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,530
You bastard!

180
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,070
I said he was the king of Geumuigak, not the palace!

181
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,250
Do not dare mention His Majesty with your mouth...

182
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,830
He really is a weirdo...

183
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,310
I should not associate with him.

184
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,080
I mean... you should not mention him...

185
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,460
Number 28.

186
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,160
You get a penalty.

187
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,900
Did I say something I should not? Why should I...

188
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,320
You cannot...

189
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,310
speak so rashly.

190
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,330
A mere penalty might not be enough for you.

191
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,680
Did you just do that?

192
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,670
Did you? Did you?

193
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,380
Might as well just speak casually, bastard!

194
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,060
Aigoo, Instructor.

195
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,450
Let us take a break.

196
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,770
Yes, where did the time go?

197
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,860
Yes, let us call it a day.

198
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,450
Back to the dormitory.

199
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,050
 Yes. 

200
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,870
Sang Wu.

201
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,900
One, two, three.

202
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,870
   

203
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,210
Go in!

204
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,940
   

205
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,140
 ­  

206
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,790
This makes no sense.

207
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,810
Why do I belong in the Bottom-Tier Room?

208
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,610
   

209
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,260
Oh no, I share the room with him?

210
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,580
I have to share a room with these lowly people?

211
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,800
   

212
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,810
Hyeongnim, we were assigned to the Top-Tier Room.

213
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,710
Bottom-Tier Room?

214
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,750
The loser room.

215
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,340
This must be fate.

216
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,980
Okay, okay. Let us go in first.

217
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,580
We have to wear our numbers, too, do we not?

218
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,790
Let us go in.

219
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,510
Move.

220
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,290
Gosh, seriously...

221
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,700
Let us go.

222
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,920
This makes no sense.

223
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,880
It does make sense.

224
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,720
Come.

225
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,860
   

226
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,510
Yes, yes.

227
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,430
Yes, yes.

228
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,680
My apologies.

229
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,870
I have never been in a room this small.

230
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,120
But we will grow very close as a result.

231
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,390
Since we are bottom-tier roommates,

232
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,690
shall we introduce ourselves?

233
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,460
My name is Cheon Jun Hwa.

234
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,520
This is not easy.

235
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,390
I asked your names.

236
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,480
Done.

237
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,960
Are you already done?

238
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,870
Yes, Number 29. What is your name?

239
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,150
We are in the same boat, anyway.

240
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,900
Let us overcome this storm together.

241
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,880
I am Go Su Ra.

242
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,070
I have no interest in sharing a boat with you.

243
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,090
I am Hong Deok Su.

244
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,070
I have no interest in sharing a boat with you, either.

245
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,030
Fine!

246
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,320
My name is Lee Eun...

247
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,400
Lee Eun Ho.

248
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,080
Lee Eun Ho?

249
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,060
You picked a fight as soon as you arrived.

250
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,850
And you argued with the instructor during class.

251
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,960
I am innocent.

252
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,500
And you took my uniform.

253
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,240
I swear I will leave the Bottom-Tier Room

254
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,700
and get away from you bastards.

255
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,380
I will make sure to survive.

256
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,470
Well... Why are you so angry...

257
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,270
Come on. Look at that fellow.

258
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,710
Well...

259
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,670
Shall we go wash ourselves, then?

260
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,350
No.

261
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,810
What?

262
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,820
No, I am all right.

263
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,620
- Sure? 
 - Yes.

264
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,060
Apparently, the washroom is outdoors, and everyone uses it together.

265
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,650
This should be fun.

266
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,070
- I will go first. 
 - Yes, go ahead.

267
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,600
So... Aigoo!

268
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,230
Lee Eun Ho?

269
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,750
You had better be careful.

270
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,570
I will be watching you.

271
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,960
Come on, what a rude man.

272
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,660
Rude?

273
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,860
What do you mean, rude? Why?

274
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,190
What are you looking at?

275
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,830
What tiny eyes.

276
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,940
   

277
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,120
This is nothing.

278
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,420
How nice!

279
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,550
The water is hot.

280
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,410
So hot!

281
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,880
T-This is a bit...

282
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
One more time.

283
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,670
My goodness.

284
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,240
Here.

285
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,050
I am the Master Innkeeper, Seol Mae Hwa.

286
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,850
Why did you come instead of Master Cheon?

287
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,820
My apologies.

288
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,730
His knee was hurting, so he summoned a physician.

289
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,140
He is not using that as an excuse to avoid meeting us, is he?

290
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,970
I never got to see his precious face once.

291
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,690
He would not do that to the Minister of Defense.

292
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,390
He felt bad for not seeing you in person,

293
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,590
so he told me to visit you on his behalf.

294
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
Bring it in.

295
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,310
It is the Punggi ginseng that was recently gifted to the palace.

296
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,160
This is the Punggi ginseng the King eats?

297
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,090
Listen, someone more worthy than the King is here.

298
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,360
Why should he not have the king's meal?

299
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,400
- Do you not agree? 
  - Of course, he should. 

300
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:10,530
I set aside the top-quality ginseng out of the chosen ones.

301
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,290
I could tell. Look at this beauty.

302
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,510
Look at this.

303
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,710
It is so majestic. It suits you perfectly.

304
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,650
This 30-year-old wild ginseng wine

305
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,450
cures all illnesses and grants a long life.

306
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,130
Yes, yes. Pour him a glass now.

307
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,740
Wild ginseng wine?

308
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,880
All right. Let us have a glass.

309
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,810
Pour me a glass, too, now.

310
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,250
My, look how fair-skinned and delicate you are.

311
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,730
You should have become a hostess, not an innkeeper.

312
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,610
Here, here.

313
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,050
What is wrong?

314
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,070
This is a premium wine.

315
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,140
Only the country's most powerful man gets to have.

316
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,380
Will you challenge that position?

317
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,890
The most powerful man...

318
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,870
One person?

319
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,400
A lowly man can never shake off his lowly traits.

320
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,510
Go tell him that I know where the gold bars that belong to me

321
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,100
are being sent to instead.

322
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,480
It lingers on the tongue.

323
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,130
 Where does the Master Innkeeper live, then? 

324
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,450
   

325
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,520
I saw the golden key.

326
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,970
Pardon?

327
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,630
Have you already searched Master Cheon's house?

328
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,910
That is the strange part.

329
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,590
It was not Master Cheon. Someone else had it.

330
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,680
Someone else?

331
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,340
Did you bring the drawing of the golden key?

332
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,800
Yes.

333
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,100
 W-What are you doing? 

334
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:49,400
I will have to check one more time.

335
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,030
I will disguise myself and enter this place, too.

336
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,610
There is something more important.

337
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,910
Yes, command anything.

338
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,350
   

339
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,080
   

340
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,640
Who is over there?

341
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,820
   

342
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,930
   

343
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,390
I stink.

344
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,770
If I go back without washing, they will be suspicious.

345
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,760
How nice.

346
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,570
 I am so exhausted. 

347
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,220
Me, too. Let us bring it back quickly.

348
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,270
Right. I heard the new apprentices are here.

349
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,100
Will someone sneak into the women's dormitory?

350
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,120
There is no way. You get expelled if you get caught.

351
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,920
 Back in the day... 

352
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,760
Stay put, please!

353
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,860
You stay put.

354
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,540
Seriously...

355
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,370
No, hold it in.

356
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,040
Do not do it.

357
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,270
We will both get kicked out if you sneeze now.

358
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,050
Hold it in.

359
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,000
Hey... what are you doing right now?

360
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,160
 Let us go now. 

361
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,910
They are gone.

362
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,810
You scared me.

363
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,920
He is the noisiest.

364
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,750
How dare he talk to me like that?

365
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,840
I swear I was only there to wash myself.

366
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,850
I did not climb the fence for indecent motives.

367
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,170
I never asked.

368
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,710
How about you?

369
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,820
Why did you climb the women's dormitory fence?

370
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,500
- Because I saw you climbing it. 
 - Darn.

371
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,910
Anyway, it is true both of us climbed the fence.

372
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,640
Let us keep it a secret unless you want us to get expelled.

373
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,740
I will not.

374
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,820
I climbed over to catch you.

375
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,600
Hey, why are you doing this to me?

376
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,080
What is it?

377
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,330
Are you hiding something?

378
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,220
Hong Deok Su,

379
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,430
you cannot get expelled yet.

380
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,570
You are worried about me right now?

381
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,400
Do you think I am?

382
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,710
I mean you need to behave yourself!

383
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,170
Seriously...

384
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,580
   

385
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,440
 It is the ledger. 

386
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,090
 The golden key. 

387
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:59,710
 This is the only key that can open the safe with the ledger. 

388
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,870
 There are two halves that form a set, 

389
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,090
 so you cannot unlock it with just one. 

390
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:10,340
 That Cheon hid one-half of the golden key somewhere in Yongcheonru, 

391
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,280
 and he is searching for the other half. 

392
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,430
 Who is that man exactly? 

393
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,270
 You just need to show it to me once. One second. 

394
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,480
 W-What are you doing? Are you crazy? 

395
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,870
 Just one moment. It will take just a moment. 

396
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,760
 Even if you do not, just come back without getting caught. 

397
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,770
 No one can find out you are Hong Jae On and a girl. 

398
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,920
 Do you understand? 

399
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,700
 Be careful. 

400
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,010
 Be careful, Hong Deok Su. 

401
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,390
W-What is that?

402
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,810
Is he dead?

403
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,740
I think he is.

404
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,130
A man is dead!

405
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,330
 A man is dead! 

406
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,520
 A man is dead! 

407
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,850
 Look at this! 

408
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,620
How refreshing. I feel alive now.

409
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,380
Eun Ho, why are you not eating?

410
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,780
A true man needs to finish a bowl.

411
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,010
Hong Deok Su, you are... a true man.

412
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,450
A true man.

413
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,180
Eat, eat.

414
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,080
Hot.

415
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,770
Maybe it is because it is the Top-Tier Room.

416
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,420
The bedroom and the bathroom are spacious.

417
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,560
I cannot tell if we are here for a vacation or training.

418
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,770
Do you not agree, Myeong Ho?

419
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,730
Hey, Du Shik and Seok Sam.

420
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:08,270
These are the privileges only the Ulju Merchant gets to enjoy.

421
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,980
Do you understand?

422
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,880
How did those lowly men end up in a luxurious place like this?

423
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,210
They are making us look bad.

424
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,320
They sold their houses and lands, but they are still Numbers 27, 28, and 29.

425
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,900
That is the best they could do.

426
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,530
The number?

427
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,220
I just got the number through my family.

428
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,070
That number represents your family's ranking.

429
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:43,640
It means your family is at the bottom.

430
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,390
Did you think all red cards were the same?

431
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,520
They come in different rankings.

432
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,920
Our numbers belong to the Top-Tier Room!

433
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,360
Your numbers belong to the Bottom-Tier Room.

434
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:05,960
It was decided from the beginning, all right?

435
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,910
I thought we were in the Bottom-Tier Room because of the penalties.

436
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,050
Gosh, I got the wrong number.

437
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,930
Stop fussing about numbers.

438
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,970
Why not remove them and fight it out,

439
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,160
as men should?

440
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,210
Myeong Ho hyeongnim!

441
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,340
The three department heads will meet the apprentices today.

442
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,100
Truly?

443
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,070
This is great.

444
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,920
Enjoy your meals.

445
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,410
Let us go.

446
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,130
Sit down.

447
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,360
- Head Manager. 
 - Yes.

448
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,870
- Do you want me to tell you a secret? 
 - A secret?

449
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:05,300
I heard that one of the apprentices we will meet today comes from a special class.

450
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,330
A special class?

451
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,400
The successor of Yongcheonru.

452
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,940
Master Cheon's only son, who was sent to study in the Qing Dynasty at a young age.

453
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,530
Listen.

454
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,790
You had better watch your mouth.

455
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:26,220
I just want the sturdy and strong ones.

456
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,380
I hear he is very elegant and graceful.

457
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,450
I might just tuck him into my jewelry box.

458
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,190
Hurry up!

459
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,210
Head Chef.

460
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,230
You scared me!

461
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,220
Aigoo, Suk Su, you cannot still be doing this.

462
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,300
The apprentices are waiting.

463
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,380
Did he invent something new again?

464
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,540
Hyeongnim, I swear, if you keep drinking that, you will end up exploding.

465
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,990
J-Jo Seung Ryang, try smelling this.

466
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,790
- It is nice. It is nice. Smell it. 
 - It is nice?

467
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,470
- Oh... 
 - Is it not nice?

468
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,870
Stop talking nonsense and come with me.

469
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,560
Is it not nice? Is it not nice?

470
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,150
- Hurry! 
 - Try smelling it!

471
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,780
I hear you, Hyeongnim. Aigoo.

472
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,070
Attention, everyone!

473
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,790
I will teach you about the three departments of Yongcheonru today.

474
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,580
Here are the three department heads.

475
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,190
Applause.

476
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,130
First up, the person who oversees all the food in Yongcheonru:

477
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,380
the Head Chef.

478
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,440
You all know Geumbing, right?

479
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,990
I am the one who created it.

480
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,730
There are all sorts of interesting foods and ingredients at the Culinary Department.

481
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,370
You can see all of them.

482
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,960
Let me see...

483
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,080
I will see you once you survive, all right?

484
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,370
Applause, everyone!

485
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,460
Next is the Head Manager.

486
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,190
My name is Jo Seung Ryang.

487
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:05,950
The Management Department is in charge of security, facilities, and equipment of Yongcheonru.

488
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,520
Muscles are required because of the nature of the tasks.

489
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,920
Sit down, sit down.

490
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,020
This person is a true man.

491
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,940
What are you saying?

492
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,200
A real man can join the Management Department.

493
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,400
Applause, everyone!

494
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,380
The last one is Yu Su In, the Head Host.

495
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:38,200
The Hosting Department is the face of Yongcheonru.

496
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,080
We greet the guests at the hotel rooms and Yeonhwajeon.

497
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,640
To enter the Hosting Department,

498
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:57,500
you will need elegant looks and demeanors.

499
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,070
I have a question.

500
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,340
Does the Hosting Department manage Yeonhwajeon?

501
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,450
We do, but...

502
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:10,550
Number 30, why are you interested in that?

503
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,350
Applause, everyone!

504
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,900
What? A red card thief?

505
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:36,410
Please catch the bastard who killed Man Dol!

506
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:40,220
How did your son have Yongcheonru's red card?

507
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:45,030
He was only keeping it for someone.

508
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:52,010
The one who stole the red card must be the culprit!

509
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,400
My son...

510
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,560
 Master Cheon, this is Seol Mae Hwa. 

511
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,750
   

512
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,820
What is this about?

513
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,730
The Investigation Bureau sent someone.

514
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:36,980
Our red card was apparently involved in a murder in Seochon.

515
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:43,500
They say half of a red card was found next to the dead body.

516
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,800
How about the other half?

517
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,000
Someone must have forged a stolen red card and entered Gyohwadang.

518
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,220
Master Cheon.

519
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,850
Yongcheonru's red card is living up to its fame.

520
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,950
We just have to catch the culprit and hand him over to the Investigation Bureau.

521
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,910
It is worth killing someone to join Yongcheonru, right?

522
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,900
Make a bigger fuss about it.

523
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,920
I will follow your order.

524
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,640
How about the gold bar to be sent to the Minister of Defense?

525
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,320
It is not the time yet. Just wait.

526
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,970
Aigoo, look how beautiful the color of this silk is!

527
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,540
It is truly beautiful, Mother.

528
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:54,460
It is nice to pick out silk together like this.

529
00:44:55,570 --> 00:45:01,170
Aigoo, our Prince Seon Yang is here.

530
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:10,210
I almost got sick because I missed you so much.

531
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,180
Father,

532
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,370
greetings!

533
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:18,190
Oh, my. You are the mother of this country, Your Highness.

534
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,380
Prince Seon Yang will soon become the crown prince.

535
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,630
Why do you bow in front of me?

536
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,900
Please maintain your dignity, Your Highness.

537
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,530
Yes, Father.

538
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,140
When will the Chaekbongrye happen, anyway? 
  (T/N: Crown prince proclamation ceremony) 

539
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,390
I will grow old and die while waiting.

540
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,990
This woman... Do not say that in front of Prince Seon Yang.

541
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,660
Maintain your dignity, too.

542
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,510
What is so wrong about asking that?

543
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,840
Gather the statesmen and make a request to the king or something.

544
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,490
The crown prince position has been vacant for years.

545
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,140
She married the old king and...

546
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,830
gave birth to this precious prince!

547
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:07,160
Why should she be treated so poorly?

548
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,420
Mother, I am all right.

549
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,330
But I am not!

550
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:16,190
Until Prince Seon Yang, my grandson, gets on the throne,

551
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,720
I will never be all right.

552
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,920
Understand?

553
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,490
Train him to be the crown prince in the meantime.

554
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,480
I will do so, Father.

555
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,420
Is everything all right in the palace?

556
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:38,050
I heard Prince Mu Yeong went to a hot spring to recuperate.

557
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,380
Is that true?

558
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,440
Yes, I saw him leaving the palace.

559
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,800
Why do you bother caring about Prince Mu Yeong?

560
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,870
Oh my! I need to keep a close eye on him

561
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:55,950
to make Prince Seon Yang the crown prince, woman.

562
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,530
 Knowing how to greet is the most basic etiquette for Yongcheonru's apprentices. 

563
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,450
One!

564
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,080
Two!

565
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,230
One!

566
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,820
Two!

567
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,560
One!

568
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,620
Two!

569
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,440
One!

570
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,160
Two!

571
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,970
Keep your back straight and...

572
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,460
Raise your chin. Your chin. Your chin.

573
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,750
Bring your hands together in front of your belly button.

574
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:41,120
You there, make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart.

575
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,760
One!

576
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,820
Can you not lower your head further?

577
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,300
I lowered it enough.

578
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,430
"I lowered it enough."

579
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,800
The invisible details make differences.

580
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,200
Do not bend your knees.

581
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,370
You cannot frown, either.

582
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,080
Look peaceful.

583
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,810
Two!

584
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,720
Penalty!

585
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,110
Here is today's last task.

586
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,580
This is the Annals of Yongcheonru.

587
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:29,960
It details, page by page, the grand history of Yongcheonru.

588
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,150
Memorize it.

589
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:35,170
Without missing a letter.

590
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,880
I am dying! I cannot do this. I cannot.

591
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,080
Wow, look at that gorgeous handwriting.

592
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,760
Your handwriting must be beautiful because your hands are small and graceful.

593
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:21,170
This is how a true man studies.

594
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,760
I will chew every single word.

595
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,130
Look how thick this is.

596
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,100
How am I supposed to memorize all this?

597
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:52,320
Which merchant clan are you from?

598
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:55,700
The Namhae Merchants.

599
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,390
That is why your number is...

600
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,670
Did they not go bankrupt?

601
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,510
You have no chance, anyway.

602
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,540
Quit trying and just relax.

603
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,100
Do not listen to his nonsense.

604
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,280
It is his fault for being born into a lowly family.

605
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,580
What? It is my fault for being born?

606
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:18,390
So, which family is considered innocent?

607
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,040
Yongcheonru?

608
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,430
At least, you should not be in the Bottom-Tier Room.

609
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,940
The Top-Tier apprentices,

610
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,400
if you are that superior,

611
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,400
would you bet with the Bottom-Tier apprentices?

612
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,180
You do not have to do this for me.

613
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,660
Let us do that.

614
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,980
That sounds so much fun!

615
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,320
Hong Deok Su, you need to join, too.

616
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,430
Be manly.

617
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,820
Of course.

618
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,770
A real man does not avoid a challenge.

619
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,530
Let us put our rooms at stake and...

620
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,170
- play Ssangpae tonight. 
 - What?

621
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:12,230
The winning team will take the Top-Tier Room.

622
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,850
You must think we are all fools at the Ulju Merchant Clan.

623
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,380
Even if you lose, you will stay in the same room.

624
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,290
What will we get by winning?

625
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,900
- Right. 
 - Right. That is true.

626
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:34,960
The Bottom-Tier apprentices will leave the academy.

627
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,110
- What? 
 - Hey.

628
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,580
You said a real man does not say no.

629
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,750
Hong Deok Su, I will join in, too.

630
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,820
We cannot leave.

631
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,370
I will join in since I am a real man, too.

632
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,000
Do you not have the courage to go against us?

633
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,090
Yes, it is a deal.

634
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,940
I will make sure to...

635
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,960
kick you out of Gyohwadang.

636
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,460
Seriously...

637
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,570
Hong Deok Su,

638
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:15,370
it is tonight. We must win.

639
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:18,940
- Let us go. 
 - All right, Hyeongnim.

640
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,390
How do you win this?

641
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:39,020
Should you get a high number or a low one?

642
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,960
Come on. Is this your first time playing Ssangpae?

643
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,190
- Yes. 
 - Ssangpae?

644
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,060
First of all,

645
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:59,400
just learn how to toss.

646
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,010
I will make sure we win, no matter what.

647
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,360
Does it not mean you will cheat?

648
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,840
Do not worry.

649
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,760
Our Hong Deok Su will defeat everyone.

650
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,760
Is that not right?

651
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,080
Of course!

652
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,480
Trust Hong Deok Su, the real man.

653
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,340
All right. Go ahead and explain it to me.

654
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,650
How do you toss these?

655
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,660
Like this? Like this?

656
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,010
Look.

657
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,110
There are six sides of this.

658
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:45,800
Each side has dots on it.

659
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,140
You toss these two stones,

660
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,850
and whoever gets the highest number wins.

661
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,830
But...

662
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,380
if you get a double,

663
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,240
you win no matter how high the opponent's number is.

664
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,170
What if we both get a double?

665
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,020
Whoever has the higher number wins.

666
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,760
It usually has only one round,

667
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,120
but tonight, we need to win three out of five rounds first.

668
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,620
Is it possible to get a double by tossing?

669
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:21,690
Give me a number, and I will get that number.

670
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,700
- Double fives. 
 - Double fives?

671
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,440
Gosh...

672
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,630
Let us see. Let us see. Double fives.

673
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:41,350
- See? 
 - Where did you learn a strange skill like this?

674
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,930
I have never seen anyone so skillful, even in the Qing Dynasty.

675
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,610
Gosh, come on.

676
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,330
Are you a swindler, by chance?

677
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,100
Come on. Swindler, my foot.

678
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,060
This is just...

679
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,110
This is just a skill I learned from someone when I was young.

680
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,580
Well, fine. Let us try tossing now.

681
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,950
Trying it once is better than hearing about it ten times.

682
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,760
Who wants to try?

683
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,090
- Me, me, me! 
 - Me, me!

684
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,650
- Me! 
 - Me, me, me.

685
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:29,320
Go ahead and try.

686
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,010
Do not be like this. Take turns.

687
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,430
I am better than you.

688
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,770
Try, try. Here we go.

689
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:41,070
Ready? Go.

690
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:44,710
- Whoa! 
 - It is not double fives.

691
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,440
Here we go.

692
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,120
You failed. You failed.

693
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,140
It is my turn.

694
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,590
Try, try.

695
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,650
Do not do it with jerky in your mouth.

696
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:01,260
Be serious.

697
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,830
Try it.

698
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:05,420
How fussy. Seriously.

699
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:10,630
Try it again. Again. Again.

700
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,360
Again!

701
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:30,290
You scared me.

702
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:33,290
It is getting late. Please hurry.

703
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,360
Announce yourself when you are here, Hyeongnim.

704
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,730
Why? Why? You think you would die without anyone knowing?

705
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,070
Why is he so morbid?

706
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:46,270
How will you appraise the red cards this time?

707
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,460
I have done it myself every year, Master Innkeeper.

708
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,240
I could easily do it alone.

709
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,450
I know.

710
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,980
But we have a situation this year.

711
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,580
What situation is it that you came here yourself?

712
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,190
It is a murder.

713
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,530
My gosh, my gosh!

714
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:21,620
Someone committed a murder to steal a red card.

715
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:24,950
The Investigation Bureau ordered us to find the culprit.

716
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,960
The Investigation Bureau?

717
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,140
If one of the red cards is a counterfeit...

718
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,480
That person must be the culprit, then.

719
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,700
   

720
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,040
   

721
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,140
Let us go.

722
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,020
We will remove the numbers,

723
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,430
forget about our backgrounds, and play fair and square.

724
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,860
We will not...

725
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,860
tolerate any tricks.

726
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,650
Do you understand?

727
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:07,500
You are giving an order like you are a higher-up.

728
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,040
How annoying.

729
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:15,750
You will give us the Top-Tier Room without complaints if you lose.

730
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,350
Fine.

731
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:27,820
You will leave the academy immediately if you lose this game.

732
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,380
Right?

733
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,330
One more thing.

734
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:34,480
Apologize to Go Su Ra.

735
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:39,540
You really are a real man, Hong Deok Su.

736
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,780
Win first before acting tough.

737
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,760
You all talk too much.

738
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,380
Once the game starts, we let the dice do the talking.

739
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:57,900
If so,

740
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,870
who will toss first?

741
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:07,310
I used to play Ssangpae quite a bit.

742
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,630
Let us switch.

743
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,930
How dare you try to trick us?

744
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,070
Twenty-nine. Thirty.

745
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,810
I looked at them many times,

746
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:40,770
but I am not detecting a counterfeit, Hyeongnim.

747
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,860
Jang Suk Su, do you really know how to find it?

748
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:50,020
Master Innkeeper, do you not trust me?

749
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:57,810
I made these red cards by hand, one by one.

750
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,370
The secret is not in the paper.

751
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:05,170
 It is in the ink. 

752
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,590
The ink?

753
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,990
 I mixed honey into it. 

754
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,900
Honey?

755
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,890
You put honey in the ink?

756
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,170
So?

757
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:25,810
Are you planning to lick all the red cards?

758
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:27,820
It will not be me.

759
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:30,110
What is that?

760
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:33,290
These little ones will determine it.

761
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,890
Get to work. Get to work.

762
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:48,160
Yes, that is right! That way!

763
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,140
Move! Go, go!

764
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,000
They are eating. They are eating.

765
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,440
He is eating, too. Yes, yes.

766
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,260
Good, good.

767
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,340
Look! Look!

768
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:03,640
Yes, yes!

769
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,800
   

770
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,570
   

771
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,770
I am okay. I am okay. I am still okay.

772
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,590
I am okay. I am still okay.

773
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,140
Do well.

774
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,000
Not bad. Not bad.

775
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,010
You never know. Go ahead.

776
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,750
It is a tie! It is a tie!

777
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,790
Damn.

778
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:23,080
We win if you get a double now!

779
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,370
There is no way he will get a double.

780
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:27,480
There is no way.

781
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,380
Hold on!

782
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,650
What? Are you losing confidence?

783
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:45,690
There is no going back in gambling.

784
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,690
Go ahead and take your top off.

785
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,290
It is too suspicious.

786
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:53,260
You are hiding something in there, are you not?

787
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,050
Do you have to do that, Lee Eun Ho?

788
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,910
Look at him.

789
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:15,010
Hey, how satisfying!

790
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,430
Let us strip and toss.

791
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:20,720
What do you mean by strip?

792
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,700
Let us just keep going, all right?

793
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:30,680
You are nitpicking because you were being pushed into a corner.

794
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,010
Okay, let us strip.

795
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,930
Take everything off.

796
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:39,660
It is a true game of Ssangpae only when you strip.

797
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,330
- Let us strip! 
 - No, it is all right.

798
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,980
- Let us strip. 
 - No, no...

799
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,770
Take it off!

800
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:46,480
- Take it off! 
 - Do not.

801
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,770
No!

802
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,650
Let us take it all off.

803
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:54,920
No, no, no.

804
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,820
Let us strip.

805
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,540
All right!

806
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:07,950
Well, well, well.

807
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:09,390
Here we go.

808
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:18,680
 Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! 

809
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,070
It is a double!

810
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,670
We did it! We did it!

811
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,580
Stop making a fuss.

812
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,470
All right, all right.

813
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,880
It is your turn now.

814
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,010
Will you not get undressed?

815
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:58,810
Why are you not getting undressed?

816
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:00,480
You...

817
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:06,310
 I found the culprit! 

818
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,170
This...

819
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:11,770
person is the culprit!

820
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:16,980
   

821
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:19,780
You need to toss now.

822
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,410
What are you waiting for? You are not acting like a man.

823
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:25,150
Get undressed and toss confidently.

824
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,030
You are not hiding something under your shirt, are you?

825
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:31,010
Seriously...

826
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:52,980
Go ahead and beg if you are scared.

827
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:57,510
Or will you all...

828
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:59,270
leave the academy?

829
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,920
What?

830
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,440
Leave?

831
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,020
Hey, toss.

832
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,520
- Get undressed and toss! 
 - No.

833
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,020
Come on. Calm down.

834
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:13,700
This is getting interesting.

835
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,400
Take your shirt off and toss.

836
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,620
- Damn it! 
 - Catch him!

837
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:30,480
What is he doing? You!

838
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,730
Catch him!

839
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,450
You little...

840
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,390
What are you doing?

841
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,760
   

842
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,980
   

843
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:18,290
Number thirty.

844
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:22,040
Hong Deok Su.

845
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,470
Find it. 
    

846
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:52,510
Go ahead and pick one.

847
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,880
Is this...

848
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,700
No, no.

849
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,950
I...

850
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,350
choose this one.

851
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,840
This?

852
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,550
Here.

853
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,380
I was wrong.

854
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:21,910
Were you looking for the jade ring?

855
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,550
Yes.

856
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,070
A jade ring does not guarantee happiness.

857
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,090
One of the cups...

858
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,890
has a flower in it.

859
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:41,690
And one of them has a jade ring in it.

860
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:44,680
It is all yours, no matter what you choose.

861
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,930
- Really? 
 - Of course.

862
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:50,300
Just live happily no matter what you find.

863
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:58,580
But still, happiness from winning is the best.

864
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,900
Did you lose the bet again?

865
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,810
You lose all the time. Why do you try so hard?

866
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:12,350
I will make sure to win.

867
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:20,850
She is stubborn, just like you, Teacher.

868
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:25,640
Do you want to beat your father so much?

869
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,530
Yes.

870
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,460
Should I let you know how to win?

871
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,600
Do you mean it? Yes, tell me how.

872
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,100
Seol Mae Hwa, will you pass down your talent to Jae On?

873
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:41,560
Now, if you want to win a bet,

874
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:46,310
just switch to a game you are better at.

875
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:57,380


876
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:06,790
♫  The passing years say nothing at all  ♫

877
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:15,300
♫  Like sorrowful words of a song, scattered in the wind  ♫

878
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,260
- Like this? 
 - Yes.

879
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:22,120
♫  On nights when the dark comes calling  ♫

880
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:26,550
♫  Oh moonlight, silently weeping  ♫

881
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,680
♫  If the shadow of fate casts over me  ♫

882
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,350
   

883
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:35,120
♫  Light up this endless road for me  ♫

884
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,950
♫  Rise again  ♫

885
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:44,010
♫  Even if I crumble and fall  ♫

886
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:48,700
♫  Embracing the bitter scars in my heart  ♫

887
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:54,690
♫  Oh, flowing tears, remember for me  ♫

888
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,320
 We found the one who forged his red card. 

889
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,980
 His name is Hong Deok Su. 

890
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,430
 Hong Deok Su? 

891
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:03,210
 Are you after Master Cheon's position? 

892
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,510
 No, the Master Innkeeper's. 

893
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:08,600
 Is this not how you make a deal, too? 

894
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,540
 Number thirty. Hong Deok Su? 

895
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:15,730
 A sword with a dragon carving was found at the murder scene. 

896
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:17,110
 Does it not belong to the royal family? 

897
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:22,550
 If the Minister of Defense gets the sword, he will come up with a scheme. 

898
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:25,120
 Who are you? You speak unusually, too. 

899
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,410
 It will be difficult for us if someone else finds out. 

900
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,650
 You are even more suspicious, Lee Eun Ho. 

901
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:32,680
 What are you, a prince? 

902
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,330
 According to the Master Innkeeper's order, 

903
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:37,810
 the apprentices of each room will be assessed as a group. 

904
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:41,530
 I will destroy the bastards from the Bottom-Tier Room. 

905
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:46,470
 Your mistake will get your roommates expelled. 

906
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:49,240
 Is this what they call a community of destiny? 

907
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:54,000
 That is right. Come on, do not make it so obvious. 

908
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,170
 Do you like Hong Deok Su?
