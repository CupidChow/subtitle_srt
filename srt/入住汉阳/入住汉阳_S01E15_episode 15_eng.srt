1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
   

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,300
 I will not give up or withdraw. 
   

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,470
 Let me accompany you, Hong Deok Su. 

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,740
 Whatever you plan, I will assist you, no matter what it is. 

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,510
 Then would you serve as bait in my trap? 

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,290
 Those three who killed my father twelve years ago all seek this ledger. 

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,470
 I will ensure they destroy one another while fighting for it. 

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,720
 Jo Seung Ryang, find Prince Mu Yeong. 

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,200
 Lee Eun Ho, you must be the bait 

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,730
 and reveal that the Minister of Defense has the ledger. 

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,770
 Where did you get this? 

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,130
 I must remove Cheon. 

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,900
 That is quite satisfactory. 

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,790
 Whether the King's assassin or Cheon, 

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,380
 I will lead them to suspect the Minister of Defense. 

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,150
 Prince Mu Yeong gave the ledger to the Minister of Defense? 

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,580
 I followed three soldiers leaving the minister's residence, 

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,380
 but all they carried were blank ledgers. Forgive me. 

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,120
 Minister. 

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,890
 You have a remarkably dutiful son, Your Majesty. 

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,130
 The ledger that proves the former king was poisoned. 

22
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,080
 If you kill me now, 

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,780
 the ledger that I have kept safe 

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,100
 will spread throughout the capital. 

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,510
 I am nearly at my goal. 

26
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,580
 Tomorrow, Oh Yeong Rak's progeny 

27
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,640
 will ascend the throne! 

28
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:53,000


29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,270
   

30
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,600
Did you secure the footprints?

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,060
Yes.

32
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,490
The Minister of Defense was already dead?

33
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,450
My apologies, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,680
The ledger was also gone?

35
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,510
How about Prince Mu Yeong?

36
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,540
Where is Prince Mu Yeong?

37
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,520
He is at Yongcheonru.

38
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,490
Foolish bastard.

39
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,560
Everything ended up in Cheon's hands.

40
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,780
Did you take care of the Minister of Defense?

41
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,060
I observed the royal guard climbing over the fence.

42
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,320
It will be concluded that it was their doing.

43
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,490
Good work.

44
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,670
You may leave now.

45
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,550
Welcome to Yongcheonru, Ulju Merchant Leader.

46
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,400
Where is my baby, Myeong Ho?

47
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,820
I wish to see his handsome face. It has been a while.

48
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,460
Let us go.

49
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,040
Are all the men of Hanyang so handsome?

50
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,930
Crazy bastard. Handsome, my foot.

51
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,740
So, you did not make a reservation,

52
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,340
but you want the special guest room?

53
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,480
That is right. Give us the best room in Yongcheonru.

54
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:50,600
Do you know how fearsome that lady is?

55
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,220
Why are you just looking at me?

56
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,530
The special guest room requires the master innkeeper's approval.

57
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,610
Is that so?

58
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,660
Let them have it.

59
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,590
I am Cheon Jun Hwa, the new master innkeeper.

60
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,110
You are Yongcheonru's new master innkeeper?

61
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,580
If so, is your father Master Cheon?

62
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,240
Yes.

63
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,840
Escort them to the room.

64
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,220
Come on.

65
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,720
I would like the new master innkeeper to assist me.

66
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,330
Let us go.

67
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,090
Of course.

68
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,140
The private bathroom is here.

69
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,870
There is a small bedroom over there.

70
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,500
Call the private innkeeper if you need additional bedding or anything else.

71
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,350
What is this?

72
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,700
Did you wish to see me?

73
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,630
Whoa...

74
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,200
Hey, hey. Give it to me.

75
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,020
Let me try it, too.

76
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,670
Look, look.

77
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,740
This is fun.

78
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,590
Please call him only when you require his service.

79
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,190
You are so prickly.

80
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,560
Here. Take it.

81
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,740
What? Is it too little?

82
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,530
No.

83
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,000
I cannot refuse the precious money from a guest.

84
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,030
That is right. Do you know what money that is?

85
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,870
I worked hard in Ulju, riding boats and horses,

86
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,640
to earn that money.

87
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,020
You came a long way. You should rest now.

88
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,640
All right, thank you.

89
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,300
Hey there, Master Innkeeper.

90
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,510
To be honest,

91
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,980
my son works at Yongcheonru.

92
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,790
Do you know him? His name is Kim Myeong Ho.

93
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,990
 Master Cheon, this is Hong Deok Su. 

94
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,000
Did you fabricate a counterfeit and send it to the Minister of Defense?

95
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,660
You have eliminated the minister now. Who is next?

96
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:11,050
I have waited my entire life to exact revenge,

97
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:17,560
however, I changed my mind after hearing your words.

98
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,320
Taking revenge with a sword and blood.

99
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,790
I want to end that with the Minister of Defense.

100
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:30,440
I thought becoming successful would be the true revenge.

101
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,310
Right here at Yongcheonru.

102
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,390
You are dreaming grandly without regard for your station.

103
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,890
Was that not your dream twelve years ago?

104
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,480
That dream...

105
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,640
I want to achieve it, too.

106
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,380
How am I supposed to trust you?

107
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,990
This is your ledger, Master Cheon.

108
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,170
You planned this from the beginning.

109
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,270
You have what your father, Hong Min Shik, did not have.

110
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,200
You certainly resemble me more.

111
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,010
Yes.

112
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,770
That is why I thought that placing my fate in your hands would be a good idea.

113
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:03,770
You are impossibly arrogant, much like I am.

114
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,630
But...

115
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,550
that will not be enough.

116
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,780
Prove how determined you are.

117
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,600
Marry my son.

118
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,860
If you marry Jun Hwa and join my family,

119
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,760
I could be persuaded that our destinies are bound together.

120
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,690
There is no need to force an answer.

121
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,110
I will wait until I win your heart.

122
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,030
Wait and see. I shall do whatever you require.

123
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,520
Let us stop.

124
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,390
You said you wished to be successful at Yongcheonru.

125
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,970
I will allow you to do that.

126
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,080
Just tell me. What do you need?

127
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,200
Why should I tell you about that?

128
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,520
I do not need you...

129
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,550
for my success.

130
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,190
No, I am sure you will need me.

131
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,880
Use me, Hong Deok Su.

132
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,900
Use me as much as you desire.

133
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,120
Marry me.

134
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,060
Lee Eun Ho.

135
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,920
Why are you back here again?

136
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,110
You should be in the palace, Prince Mu Yeong.

137
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,600
I am still Yongcheonru's innkeeper.

138
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,200
I have the right to be here.

139
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
By chance,

140
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,730
do you intend to remain at Yongcheonru?

141
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,100
Why should I not?

142
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:56,760
If so, can you serve for me as the new master innkeeper?

143
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,650
If I need to.

144
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,760
- Lee Eun Ho. 
 - If I need to,

145
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:19,840
I am ready to give up everything I have.

146
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,830
Exactly...

147
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,990
what for?

148
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,170
That night,

149
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,100
you left Hong Deok Su with me.

150
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,320
You abandoned her coldly. Why do you do this now?

151
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
- That night— 
 - Do not...

152
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,590
tempt Hong Deok Su any longer.

153
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,520
I do not know why you joined Yongcheonru,

154
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,590
but do not involve her any further.

155
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,780
- Cheon Jun Hwa. 
 - Stop.

156
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,400
That is enough.

157
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,000
Cheon Jun Hwa, I need to speak with Lee Eun Ho privately.

158
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,770
Proceed.

159
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,400
But this shall be the last time.

160
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,670
Leave Yongcheonru, Lee Eun Ho.

161
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,450
I know why Cheon Jun Hwa is doing that.

162
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,920
- However— 
 - The ledger...

163
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,710
I gave it to Cheon.

164
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,840
Cheon comes after the Minister of Defense.

165
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,330
Hong Deok Su,

166
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,850
will you really take this all the way?

167
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,750
You might get hurt.

168
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,700
- Do not do it, Hong Deok Su. 
 - No.

169
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,690
I will.

170
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,080
I must.

171
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,810
I said I would be your bait.

172
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,630
Hong Deok Su,

173
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,040
do not stain your hands with blood any longer.

174
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,180
It is not solely because of my father.

175
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,590
Cheon, that man...

176
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,830
killed my mother, too.

177
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,400
- So, let go. Do not stop me. 
 - Hong Deok Su.

178
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,760
From the moment I entrusted the ledger to Cheon,

179
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,800
my course was determined.

180
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,300
You should return, Lee Eun Ho.

181
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,300
 Trust me, Hong Min Shik's friend Cheon Mak Dong, just once. 

182
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,300
 The world will turn upside down tomorrow. 

183
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,450
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty! 

184
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,000
 Your Majesty! 

185
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,370
 Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim! 

186
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,580
 Min Shik, I was right, was I not? 

187
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,420
 I said the world will turn upside down! 

188
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,890
 He took the ledger? 

189
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,710
 Get him! 

190
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,820
 Get Hong Min Shik! 

191
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,540
 Hong Min Shik hid the safe. 

192
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,560
 We must find him. 

193
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,950
 Yes, sir. 

194
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,350
 Look thoroughly! 

195
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,640
 Where is Hong Min Shik? 

196
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,490
 Find the safe! 

197
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,820
 Father! 

198
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,170
 This way! Go this way! 

199
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,830
 Jae On. Jae On... 

200
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,140
 Hong Min Shik! 

201
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,500
 Seol Mae Hwa, you wench. 

202
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,300
 How could you betray me? 

203
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,820
 Where did you hide the safe? 

204
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,850
 Is that all you can say to your friend? 

205
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,250
 Give me the safe, I said! 

206
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,400
 Look, Cheon Mak Dong, 

207
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,230
 you are doomed. 

208
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,430
 I am not doomed! 

209
00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:00,600
 Cheon Mak Dong will be above the King by using money. 

210
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,490
 Far above him! 

211
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:07,160
 I will be at the top of the world! 

212
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,060
 Watch me from your grave. 

213
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,590
 See if I am wrong. 

214
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,600
 Where is Hong Min Shik's daughter? 

215
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,470
 She must have the other half of this key. 

216
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,380
 Go and find her. 

217
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,520
Hey, Du Shik. Long time no see.

218
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,900
Seok Sam, have you been well?

219
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,650
- M-Myeong Myeong, you came. 
 - Yes.

220
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,820
Is Young Master Myeong Ho inside?

221
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,790
M-Myeong Ho is...

222
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,330
- He has smallpox. 
 - He went to the toilet.

223
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,180
What are you saying?

224
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,510
Move.

225
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,100
Move!

226
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,110
- What is this? 
 - Young Master.

227
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,660
What happened?

228
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,390
- Are you all right? 
 - Gosh, Hyeongnim, forgive us!

229
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,110
We deserve to die!

230
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,460
Kill us.

231
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,890
Who did this?

232
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,170
Tell me!

233
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,850
Well, the thing is...

234
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,970
Forgive me.

235
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,040
What are you doing, madam?

236
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,540
How dare you raise your voice?

237
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,690
Which bastard ruined Young Master Myeong Ho's face? Which one?

238
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,620
The son of a bitch who beat him up. Come out at once.

239
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,800
Hey! Come out!

240
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,460
You bastards are eager for death.

241
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,200
It was me.

242
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,390
I beat up Kim Myeong Ho.

243
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,310
You?

244
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,190
You?

245
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,030
You?

246
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,810
What are you doing? Hey, with this hand?

247
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:22,630
You did not beat him with a soft hand such as this.

248
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,160
Should you not inquire what wrong he did first?

249
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,860
Kim Myeong Ho framed and threatened another innkeeper.

250
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,130
Get up.

251
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,630
Come, come.

252
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,550
Come here.

253
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,480
What are you doing?

254
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,200
Cheon Jun Hwa, just leave.

255
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,690
I should hurt him as much as he hurt Young Master Myeong Ho.

256
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,610
Hey, Baek Baek.

257
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,870
Hold him tightly.

258
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,580
What are you doing? Proceed and walk.

259
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,930
Release him immediately!

260
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,490
Look, Master Innkeeper.

261
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,280
Move.

262
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,780
It was me. I beat up Kim Myeong Ho.

263
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,270
Look, Master Innkeeper,

264
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,620
do not worsen matters needlessly.

265
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,270
Tell your master to confront me directly.

266
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,570
Really?

267
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,920
This means war, you understand.

268
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,410
Do you...

269
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,290
understand what I am saying?

270
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,870
What shall I do...

271
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:56,470
Master, the new master innkeeper did this.

272
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,200
The new master innkeeper? That bastard earlier?

273
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
Yes. It was Cheon's son.

274
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,560
- Hey, Yu Su In, what were you doing? 
 - Master.

275
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,620
I trusted Myeong Ho with you,

276
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,470
yet you failed to become the master innkeeper.

277
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,710
Are you really a man of Ulju?

278
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,430
Myeong Ho,

279
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,270
wake up, please!

280
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,770
Mom?

281
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,360
Yes, it is Mom.

282
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,290
How did my baby get beaten up like this?

283
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,150
Mom, I nearly perished.

284
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,860
What delayed you so long?

285
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,490
Did you fight with Cheon's son?

286
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,460
Fight?

287
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,880
Mom, do you not know me?

288
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,460
Your son, Kim Myeong Ho,

289
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,220
never bothered a bug in his life. You know.

290
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,980
Those bastards...

291
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,970
They kept using us, Ulju Merchant, for all sorts of things.

292
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,020
Is this how they return the favor?

293
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,520
Bring the inn owner or whatever!

294
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,750
I will not forgive them.

295
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,900
Mom...

296
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,230
You should have hit him as well!

297
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,420
- I have never hit a person, Mom! 
 - Yes.

298
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,020
What do we do?

299
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,760
The Ulju Merchant Leader is here?

300
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,260
Yes. She is angry with Young Master Jun Hwa...

301
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,960
I mean, the new master innkeeper for hitting Kim Myeong Ho.

302
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:37,930
The Ulju Merchant Leader had to come at a time like this?

303
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,870
Let us go.

304
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,240
We should stop the war.

305
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,170
 Master Cheon. 

306
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,490
What is this about?

307
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,600
I need to tell you something.

308
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,590
Could I have a moment of your time?

309
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,620
I need to receive a guest urgently right now.

310
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,980
I shall summon you later.

311
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:42,840
 Cheon, that man killed my mother, too. 

312
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,670
 From the moment I entrusted the ledger to Cheon, 

313
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,820
 my course was determined. 

314
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,850
What made you come this far without a notice?

315
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,420
Whatever. Did you see my baby's eye?

316
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,940
I believe there was a misunderstanding.

317
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,100
What did you say? The assailants sleep more soundly.

318
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,150
How shameless you are!

319
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,000
Hey, bring the alcohol!

320
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,210
We cannot conduct this discussion over cold tea.

321
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,230
What happened with Seol Mae Hwa?

322
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,700
You did that to my son's eye.

323
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,070
Now you ask about what you compelled us to do?

324
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,260
I am sure you took good care of it.

325
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,780
 Allow me to see the merchant leader. 

326
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,720
 Tell your master... 

327
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,100
 that it is time to change the owner of this world. 

328
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,500
 - Why bother listening to you? 
 - Stop! 

329
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,590
Go ahead and tell me.

330
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,360
Including taking care of that girl Seol Mae Hwa

331
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,070
and my baby, Myeong Ho, getting beat up,

332
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,620
I will have to charge you a lot for those.

333
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,240
Yes, I should pay you.

334
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,060
One, two, three...

335
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,660
W-Where did they all go?

336
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,500
Lee Eun Ho.

337
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,830
Where are we going?

338
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,350
Master Innkeeper?

339
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,110
Master Innkeeper!

340
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,820
You have returned.

341
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,000
Have you been well?

342
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,460
I was worried since I had not heard from you.

343
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:56,310
I am sorry. It must have been difficult on your own.

344
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:05,830
Master Cheon wants Cheon Jun Hwa and I to get married.

345
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,410
Married?

346
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,820
Of course, that shall not occur.

347
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,100
For Yongcheonru shall soon be thrown into turmoil.

348
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,270
I finished preparing for everything.

349
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,210
I just need to wait now.

350
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,700
Cheon Mak Dong.

351
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,590
I just need to witness his final moment myself.

352
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:44,850
I do not want you to be consumed by revenge.

353
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,180
You cannot endanger yourself.

354
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,040
 You might get hurt. 

355
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,300
 Do not do it, Hong Deok Su. 

356
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,030
You are saying the same thing as him.

357
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,800
Everyone who cares for you and loves you will say the same.

358
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,080
Master Hong and... your late mother...

359
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,010
wanted you to be safe even in their final moments.

360
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,650
But...

361
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,300
my father... and my mother who raised me...

362
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,370
both got perished because of me.

363
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,390
How could I forget that?

364
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,500
It is not your fault, Jae On.

365
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,490
There will be an uprising soon.

366
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,760
An uprising?

367
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,800
We will change the king.

368
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,400
 Take this. 

369
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,770
 This is Prince Mu Yeong's dragon sword. 

370
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,860
 T-Take it. 

371
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,840
 It is torn. I cannot even use it. 

372
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:08,280
 The one who stole the red card must be the culprit! 

373
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,760
 I will leave it in your care. 

374
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,140
 He asked if I was practicing swordcraft these days. 

375
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,640
 He inquired about the dragon sword given to the princes, 

376
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,460
 so I showed him mine. 

377
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,900
 Let me assist you. 

378
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,630
 If you are in danger, I will take that sword in your stead. 

379
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,030
 I shall... soon acquire the power. 

380
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,670
 You must follow your chosen path. 

381
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,670
 Hyeongnim. 

382
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,360
 We can speak later. Hurry. 

383
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,760
Change the king?

384
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,110
Including the inn owner and the current king,

385
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:14,960
we will remove the root of the evil...  that has existed for a long time.

386
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,050
If we do,

387
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,190
Prince Mu Yeong would get hurt, too.

388
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,860
What is it, Hong Deok Su?

389
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,110
Do you love Jae On?

390
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,590
Master Innkeeper.

391
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:03,060
Yes. I love Hong Deok Su.

392
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,200
So, I promised her

393
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,780
that I will protect her at all costs.

394
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,920
I believe you will keep the promise.

395
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,060
You must protect Jae On.

396
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:29,120
There is no time. You must decide swiftly.

397
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,830
Your residence... is very impressive.

398
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:13,260
I did not think you would come this far, Your Majesty.

399
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,690
You told me to visit you like I visit a friend.

400
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,510
The Minister of Defense died.

401
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,130
I have heard.

402
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,670
It is great.

403
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,970
It is a great thing.

404
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,870
His greed ended up cutting his life short.

405
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:51,720
I heard Hong Min Shik's daughter gave him the ledger.

406
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,300
Did you bring the ledger back?

407
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,580
Why are you curious about that?

408
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,090
You need to get rid of it.

409
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,680
Let us burn it together.

410
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,840
It is a secret the world cannot find out about.

411
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:17,900
That would help us sleep better at night, too.

412
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,890
The ledger was not there.

413
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,720
Instead,

414
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,480
this was found.

415
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,280
It is the culprit's footprint found at the scene.

416
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,110
You dispatched the royal guard to slay the Minister of Defense.

417
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,540
Are you asking me where the ledger is?

418
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,490
What is the matter, Lee Eun Ho?

419
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,720
Let us hurry.

420
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,540
Lee Eun Ho.

421
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,260
Lee Eun Ho.

422
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,780
What is the matter?

423
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:15,140
Who were those people just now?

424
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,220
They are from the palace, are they not?

425
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,550
It is my father.

426
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,530
He came all the way to Yongcheonru.

427
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,090
Something must be going on.

428
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:40,030
 There will be an uprising soon. 

429
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,860
 If we do, Prince Mu Yeong would get hurt, too. 

430
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,540
 You need to leave, Jae On. 

431
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,870
I must go.

432
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,070
You are going to the palace now?

433
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,930
Do not worry so much.

434
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,550
Do not go.

435
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,920
You cannot go now.

436
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,100
Are you feeling all right?

437
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,030
I have heard you endured much.

438
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,050
Not at all.

439
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:25,140
I enjoyed a good rest, for Ulju welcomed me.

440
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,930
This is...

441
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,360
the Ulju Merchant Leader, who journeyed from Ulju.

442
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:41,150
I have come to see you, Prince Eun Seong, the true royal.

443
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,650
There is no such thing.

444
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,720
You are a true royal only if you sit upon the throne.

445
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,660
As you can see now,

446
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:56,230
I am just a fallen crown prince who is begging for his life.

447
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:05,900
So, what led the fallen crown prince to covet the throne?

448
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,370
My Lady.

449
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,080
No, I must hear it myself.

450
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,600
I am risking my life on this.

451
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,810
I should at least hear his explanation.

452
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,570
Yes.

453
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:26,200
Did you ask why I desired to return to the throne?

454
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:38,510
So that the royal family is no longer disgraced by a mere merchant such as you.

455
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,450
Do you understand?

456
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,150
Then you have chosen the right person.

457
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,150
I care only for money.

458
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:07,390
I do not care about power or the royal family.

459
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,880
Do you wish to strike a bargain now?

460
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:18,020
What shall you offer if we provide money?

461
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,270
Yonghcheonru.

462
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:30,140
Young Master Myeong Ho should run it in the future.

463
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,490
Let us do it.

464
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,060
Let us clean this place up...

465
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,300
and begin a new world.

466
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,250
Why do you not want me to go?

467
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,610
Let us leave together.

468
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,640
They prepared a boat at the quay at dawn.

469
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,310
Let us...

470
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,870
leave somewhere far away, Lee Eun Ho.

471
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:38,300
What do you mean by that?

472
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,290
Is something going on, Hong Deok Su?

473
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,710
Is the Ulju Merchant Leader trustworthy?

474
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,440
They do not operate on trust.

475
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,390
They just go after gains.

476
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,880
I have awaited this for over a decade.

477
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,560
There can be no slight mistake.

478
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:18,210
I have been working for this for twelve years, too.

479
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,700
I need to see the end now.

480
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,640
One is yours.

481
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,300
Hong Deok Su.

482
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,050
Let us...

483
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,320
stay together.

484
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,530
You said you wanted me to be happy.

485
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,330
I...

486
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,150
do not think I could be happy without you.

487
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,270
Now I will protect you, Lee Eun Ho.

488
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,310
Let us hurry. The boat will be ready soon.

489
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,280
Prince Mu Yeong.

490
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,470
What is going on?

491
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,360
Prince Eun Seong desires to see you.

492
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,200
Hyeongnim does?

493
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,760
I need to go.

494
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,490
Do not go.

495
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,710
There is still time. I will make it quick.

496
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:24,400
I must see him before I leave.

497
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,790
- But— 
 - I must tell him.

498
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:33,490
He must to know the truth, at least.

499
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,130
It should have been thus from the beginning.

500
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,090
Promise me...

501
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,280
that you will return.

502
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,310
Do not worry.

503
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,040
I will go straight to the quay.

504
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,560
I promise I will be there, Hong Deok Su.

505
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,610
I promise.

506
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,320
Take this.

507
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,230
This sword is yours now.

508
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:45,130
I changed my fate using this sword.

509
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,300
Jun Hwa, your fate also...

510
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:52,360
will depend on the sword in your hand.

511
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,570
Long time no see.

512
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,390
Seol Mae Hwa.

513
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:14,440
You look like you saw a ghost.

514
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:37,630
That sword. Did your father give it to you?

515
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:43,060
You returned shamelessly after killing Hong Deok Su's father.

516
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,820
Can you call yourself a human?

517
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,950
Did Master Cheon say that?

518
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,870
Hong Deok Su... I mean,

519
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,050
the young Hong Jae On witnessed it herself.

520
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:58,340
Will you persist in denying it?

521
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,770
Wake up and see clearly.

522
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:06,160
The man who killed Jae On's father and even the mother who raised her,

523
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,690
is your father, Master Cheon.

524
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,020
With the sword in front of you,

525
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,430
he stabbed Hong Jae On's father to death. Understand?

526
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,110
What?

527
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,130
What did you say?

528
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:31,630
What happened to the Young Master Jun Hwa I knew?

529
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:36,260
Did you change because you changed your clothes?

530
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,030
That is a lie.

531
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,270
- Do not lie! 
 - Twelve years ago,

532
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:47,030
your father, Cheon Mak Dong, killed Hong Jae On's father.

533
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,830
Will you slay another precious someone with that sword?

534
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,010
Are you leaving?

535
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:45,690
Climb the female innkeepers' fence. It is safe there.

536
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,190
What?

537
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:55,890
All right, thank you, Go Su Ra.

538
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:58,680
Please understand Jun Hwa, too.

539
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,810
You cannot control your feelings for someone.

540
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,930
You understand that, too.

541
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,760
Cheon Jun Hwa must have struggled, too.

542
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,080
Travel safely.

543
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,790
Let us see each other again.

544
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,770
Yes.

545
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:55,900
 A family was ruined because of that ledger. 

546
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,070
 Are you aware of how his daughter has lived? 

547
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,530
 She has lived in torment every day, 

548
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:05,160
 waiting to avenge her father. 

549
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,970
 Let us hurry. 

550
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,680
Royal Guard.

551
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:31,130
Is that girl from earlier Hong Min Shik's daughter?

552
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,490
She is, Your Majesty.

553
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:37,800
She must have the ledger.

554
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,010
- Royal Guard. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

555
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,340
Catch Prince Mu Yeong and that girl.

556
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,050
 It is a bead from Prince Mu Yeong's belt. 

557
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:56,480
 There will be an uprising soon. 

558
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,410
 You must leave no trace until then. 

559
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:04,510
 Yes, I will follow your order. 

560
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:58,930
The boat needs to leave soon. Why are they not here?

561
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:01,340
Our hands are full with the plan already.

562
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,010
Must we also aid someone in escape?

563
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,630
Are you from Ulju?

564
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:08,700
Yes. Look, they are here. Release the rope immediately.

565
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,460
You cannot.

566
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:15,290
Another person shall arrive. Please wait a moment.

567
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,390
Show this when you reach Ulju.

568
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,140
That will keep you safe.

569
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,540
Let us go, Baek Baek.

570
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,720
Thank you.

571
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,920
Thank you so much!

572
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:58,610
Did you want to see me?

573
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:09,380
I... also came to tell you something.

574
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,370
Twelve years ago, the former king...

575
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,730
was poisoned.

576
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,480
And... the person behind it was—

577
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,500
I know.

578
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:52,700
This is the evidence found at the Minister's murder scene.

579
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:07,590
I am certain you are not the culprit.

580
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:14,300
But I do not wish another to acquire it and frame you.

581
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:20,750
I am glad that I could assist you.

582
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:23,270
- Hyeongnim. 
 - Leave now.

583
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:27,470
And... do not return.

584
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,820
We cannot leave if we wait longer.

585
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,840
Just one moment.

586
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,100
He will be here soon. Just wait a moment.

587
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:14,710
 Do not worry. I will go straight to the quay. 

588
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:18,150
 I promise I will be there, Hong Deok Su. 

589
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:32,780
♫  The passing years say nothing at all  ♫

590
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:38,930
♫  Like sorrowful words of a song  ♫

591
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:43,290
 Promise me. That you will come back. 

592
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:48,190
♫  On nights when the dark comes calling  ♫

593
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:52,690
♫  Oh moonlight, silently weeping  ♫

594
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:57,080
♫  If the shadow of fate casts over me  ♫

595
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:01,270
♫  Light up this endless road for me  ♫

596
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:06,070
♫  Rise again  ♫

597
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:09,910
♫  Even if I crumble and fall  ♫

598
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:14,760
♫  Embracing the bitter scars in my heart  ♫

599
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:20,620
♫  Oh, flowing tears, remember for me  ♫

600
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:40,580
   

601
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:51,430


602
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:05,150
♫  The round moonlight has suddenly  ♫ 
 ♫  Turned into a crescent moon  ♫

603
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:11,210
 My father said he obtained what he desired by slaying his friend with this sword. 

604
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:13,520
 Is that the only way I can win Hong Deok Su? 

605
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,450
 Step aside, Cheon Jun Hwa. This is the sole means to protect her. 

606
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:18,060
 What power do you possess? 

607
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:23,210
 I, Prince Mu Yeong, shall now be on the throne. 

608
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,550
 That is the ultimate recourse to protect Hong Deok Su. 

609
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:28,220
 Have you finally resolved? 

610
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,090
 Please begin a new world. 

611
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:33,580
 I summoned the court officials to request the crown prince's proclamation. 

612
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:37,700
 Why should I not do as my father did? 

613
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,600
 Return Yongcheonru to Hong Jae On. 

614
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:45,240
 I will eliminate those who obstruct us in advance. 

615
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,490
 As long as I am with you... 

616
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:54,720
 No matter how dangerous it may be, I... 

617
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,150
 I also... 

618
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:59,020
 ...promised to protect you.
