1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
   

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,290
   

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:13,350


4
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,280
You are suddenly going to Ulju?

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,270
If you become the inn owner one day,

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Yongcheonru shall change as well.

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,450
Is something occurring between you and Father?

8
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,530
Was it the However Quartet?

9
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,850
Your Gyohwadang friends, I mean.

10
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,560
- Master Innkeeperâ€” 
 - The four of you... it is pleasing to see you together.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,110
You must cherish good friends.

12
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,810
You are acting as though you will not return.

13
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,700
You differ from Master Cheon.

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,710
I am aware of that.

15
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,570
Permit me to ask a favor.

16
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,380
You know Hong Deok Su is a woman, do you not?

17
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,520
If something transpires while I am absent,

18
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,510
please protect her on my behalf.

19
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,840
Capture them.

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,430
You must not let them escape.

21
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,050
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,870
There are two of them. Search!

23
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,870
Lee Eun Ho.

24
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,280
What are you doing here?

25
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,070
 Find them swiftly! 

26
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,590
 That way. 

27
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,630
 Capture them! 

28
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,470
Run.

29
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,920
Should we cease the event and initiate a search?

30
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,790
It is a royal event. We must apprehend them as discreetly as possible.

31
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,200
- That way. 
 - Yes.

32
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,550
Let us go.

33
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,230
Lee Eun Ho, who are you?

34
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,150
Find them swiftly!

35
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,560
Hong Deok Su.

36
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,610
- What are you doing? 
 - Hold still.

37
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,560
Let us go.

38
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,900
Let us go.

39
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,550
You are a woman.

40
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,960
Have you been hiding that you were a woman?

41
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,960
How could you, Hong Deok Su...

42
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,090
Why...

43
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,770
Why now?

44
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,120
I am sorry I have been keeping it a secret.

45
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,830
Do you know how much I have...

46
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,260
You should have merely remained a man.

47
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,340
What is the issue?

48
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,720
- Nothing changes. I am still Hong Deok Su. 
 - No.

49
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,690
You are Hong Jae On.

50
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,690
Who are you?

51
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,150
How do you know my name?

52
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,070
Hand me the golden key.

53
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,180
- There is no time. Give it to me. 
 - I do not want to.

54
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,290
That golden key is mine.

55
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,100
I need the golden key, too.

56
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,110
You...

57
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,950
 Just one moment. It will take just a moment. 

58
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,490
 Why are you doing this to me? 

59
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,010
 What is it? Are you hiding something? 

60
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,380
 What is this? 

61
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,340
 What is it that you ran over here as soon as you woke up? 

62
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,020
You have been approaching me because of the golden key.

63
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,390
Your father's safe, which can only be opened with the golden key.

64
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,090
I need the ledger inside of it.

65
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,040
Who are you?

66
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,520
Cheon is holding my family's fate.

67
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,170
What does your family have to do with Cheon?

68
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,790
That...

69
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,130
I cannot tell you that now.

70
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,880
You have been approaching me to obtain the golden key.

71
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,570
You intended to steal mine as well, correct?

72
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,120
You also had reasons to conceal that you are a woman.

73
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,430
I also... have a reason.

74
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,420
When we locate the safe and examine the ledger,

75
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,150
I shall inform you of everything.

76
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,480
Go Su Ra, have you seen Hong Deok Su?

77
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,160
Hong Deok Su?

78
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,520
I believe I saw him earlier.

79
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,650
He appeared to be hurrying somewhere with Lee Eun Ho.

80
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,370
With Lee Eun Ho?

81
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,350
I am uncertain. I did not observe clearly, either.

82
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,480
Where did they depart to?

83
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,250
I wish to change my mask.

84
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,470
Which one would you prefer?

85
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,090
Lee Eun Ho,

86
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,280
do you mean what you say?

87
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,820
I do.

88
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,860
How about you, Hong Deok Su?

89
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,930
Are you not desperate for this golden key?

90
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,830
Very well, let us proceed.

91
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,920
What?

92
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,920
Let us search for the safe together.

93
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,280
Thank you.

94
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,390
Hand me the golden key first.

95
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,000
Contemplate carefully, Hong Deok Su.

96
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,430
Having me with you...

97
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:01,140
will undoubtedly aid you as well.

98
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,790
There you were.

99
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,480
The pre-celebration is nearly concluded. We should return.

100
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,320
Oh, yes.

101
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,640
I should go clean up.

102
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,440
Hold on, Hong Deok Su.

103
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,860
Yes?

104
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,580
Look at your hair. Allow me to fix it for you.

105
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,720
What is amiss with my hair?

106
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,110
What have you been doing that has rendered your hair so disheveled?

107
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,610
I shall manage it myself.

108
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,290
He wishes for you to leave it be.

109
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,390
The pre-celebration is over. Only the wedding remains.

110
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,470
Are you not anticipating tomorrow?

111
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,220
I am uncertain.

112
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,990
Tonight is not concluded yet.

113
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,250
I shall depart.

114
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,340
As I anticipated, it did not succeed.

115
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,930
W-What do you imply?

116
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,240
 You are Prince Mu Yeong tonight. 

117
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,640
What are you speaking of?

118
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,370
Go tell your master...

119
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,090
that I cannot marry a man who dispatches his servant

120
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,670
because he lacks courage.

121
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,470
My apologies.

122
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,370
There were too many individuals with similar masks...

123
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,510
Hong Deok Su,

124
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,380
where have you been?

125
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,300
Well, the thing is...

126
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,080
These are your masks, correct?

127
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,360
I found them on the way, so I collected them.

128
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,900
Thank you.

129
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,950
You are so clumsy. Where is your head?

130
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,410
Good question.

131
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,600
I shall leave. Good night, Go Su Ra.

132
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,150
 I am uncertain. Tonight is not concluded yet. 

133
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,670
I am sorry.

134
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,360
You have finally arrived.

135
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,840
The wedding...

136
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,740
will not transpire tomorrow.

137
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,820
How could I compensate you?

138
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,620
When I consider how troubled my uncle and aunt will be,

139
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,450
I believe I have already been compensated.

140
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,710
However, would you be able to manage the aftermath?

141
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,620
I am responsible. I shall stop the Minister of Defense.

142
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,320
You should...

143
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,200
go where you want to go.

144
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,360
I will not express gratitude.

145
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,060
Take care.

146
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,530
Yeo. Hee. Hyang. Wi. Bae.

147
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,380
Yeo. Hyang. Bae. 
    

148
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,220
   

149
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,400
Hee. Wi.

150
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,190
   

151
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,000
There are five characters when combined.

152
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,760
 The counterfeit golden key did not bear any characters. 

153
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,720
By the way, what does this signify?

154
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,280
Your father engraved those characters.

155
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,610
Does it not evoke any memories?

156
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,550
Hyang wi bae...

157
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,460
All the innkeepers must emerge.

158
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,020
 Assemble! 

159
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,610
Cheon must be mobilizing.

160
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,920
Do not emerge. I shall halt matters somehow.

161
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,380
No.

162
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,600
I shall proceed.

163
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,930
Everyone, disperse and conduct a thorough search.

164
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,540
 Yes, sir! 

165
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,720
Search!

166
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,270
Come forth!

167
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,190
- Go! 
 - That way!

168
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,540
What is transpiring in the middle of the night?

169
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,580
Aigoo, this is no good.

170
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,070
Attention, everyone!

171
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,100
During the party,

172
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,500
something terrible that should never have occurred took place.

173
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,020
There is a thief in Yongcheonru.

174
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,900
Thief?

175
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,490
Everyone must cooperate with the emergency search.

176
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,870
Aigoo, those are expensive books!

177
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,100
You cannot even purchase them with money.

178
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,830
Gosh, you bastard.

179
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,440
Did you look at them behind my back?

180
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,740
Dirty bastard.

181
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,180
You looked at them as wellâ€”

182
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,760
There is a mask here!

183
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,540
Everyone who attended the party wore a mask.

184
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,080
That is enough, Lee Eun Ho.

185
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,860
This must be the location. Examine thoroughly.

186
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,340
 Yes, sir. 

187
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,360
What is this...

188
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,780
It was you, Hong Deok Su.

189
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,570
What are you speaking of?

190
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,690
The masked man who deceived the guards.

191
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,140
Was that not you?

192
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,360
No...

193
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,230
What are you doing?

194
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,910
Please let go of this and speak.

195
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,360
Follow me, Hong Deok Su.

196
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,350
What is occurring? Why is the head manager apprehending Hong Deok Su?

197
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,850
Lee Eun Ho, do you comprehend what is happening?

198
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,590
Nothing will happen.

199
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,580
 - Cheon knows that I am Hong Jae On. 
 - What? 

200
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,130
 He probably knows I possess the other half of the golden key as well. 

201
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,000
 It would be prudent to strike first. 

202
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,590
 That is the sole method to protect the golden key. 

203
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,280
What is going on, Master Cheon?

204
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,270
We have been robbed.

205
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,750
Pardon?

206
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,370
Is that why the head manager...

207
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,520
That is the only keepsake my father left me.

208
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,100
I am aware.

209
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,870
Jae On,

210
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,290
I committed something terrible against you.

211
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,100
Something terrible? What do you imply...

212
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:18,500
The golden key's two pieces were intended to become one.

213
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,660
Your father requested me to safeguard one half.

214
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,310
And he bestowed the other half upon you during your youth.

215
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:30,690
But the thief who has just intruded took my half.

216
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,920
I am sorry.

217
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,380
Pardon?

218
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,580
I intended to safeguard it and return it to you if I found you,

219
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,650
but it was unfortunately stolen as soon as I did.

220
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:53,120
I shall ensure to apprehend the thief and return the golden key to you.

221
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,290
Can you surmise who the thief was?

222
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,440
Who would desire the keepsake from your father?

223
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,000
It must undoubtedly have been Seol Mae Hwa.

224
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,340
You are the one who informed me, Jae On.

225
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,040
You have nothing to worry about.

226
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,890
I shall manage everything myself.

227
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,290
 Excuse me. 

228
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,910
Stop.

229
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,190
Yes, Master Innkeeper.

230
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,740
Let us traverse Ssari Pass in the southern direction instead of Muak Pass.

231
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,000
The Muak Pass is the swiftest route to Ulju.

232
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,660
I merely wish to avoid a crowd along the way.

233
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,110
Yes, Master Innkeeper.

234
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,430
 Change the direction. We are proceeding through Ssari Pass. 

235
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,110
 Your Majesty, the royal guard has arrived. 

236
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,150
   

237
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,040
The wedding was canceled?

238
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,450
Are you stating Prince Mu Yeong canceled the wedding?

239
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,620
I documented the details in the report I presented.

240
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,850
Is there any other news?

241
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,770
Master Cheon's residence was evidently robbed last night.

242
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,560
- Robbed? 
 - I suppose he lost something important.

243
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,070
He searched Yongcheonru all night yesterday,

244
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,910
but it appears he failed to capture the thief.

245
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,180
Is that so?

246
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,460
Prince Mu Yeong...

247
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,480
What?

248
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,430
Why is it so silent?

249
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,770
Is the wedding not occurring today?

250
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:20,180
Should they not have hung flowers and lanterns?

251
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,400
You are correct.

252
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,310
Is Cheon being miserly?

253
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:30,840
This is all because you are too kind and gentle.

254
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,820
Seriously.

255
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,250
I suppose I am.

256
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,800
Should I go reprimand him?

257
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,430
I need to attend to my skin at Dohwajeon.

258
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,800
You had better keep an eye on Do Gyeong.

259
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,550
Gosh...

260
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,530
Do Gyeong.

261
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,300
She is not present.

262
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,200
What?

263
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,400
Lady Do Gyeong has vanished.

264
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,390
Prince Mu Yeong assisted her in fleeing.

265
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,240
Prince Mu Yeong...

266
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,460
That bastard.

267
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,420
It would have been beneficial for all if they had married without any complications.

268
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,740
Does His Majesty know of this as well?

269
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,710
He must have been secretly hoping for the engagement to dissolve.

270
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,190
We will not be able to thwart Prince Mu Yeong easily anymore.

271
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,020
At this rate,

272
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,610
he might become the greatest obstacle to Prince Seon Yang's proclamation.

273
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,080
He transformed me into a dog chasing a chicken?

274
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:12,870
I could simply break the chicken's neck.

275
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:20,040
You made a critical decision for the country twelve years ago as well.

276
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,440
 For the country and Prince Eun Seong, 

277
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,080
 you must make up your mind. 

278
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,780
 Prolonging it will not benefit either of us. 

279
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:43,350
 Your Majesty! 

280
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,080
You have done it once.

281
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Why can you not do it twice?

282
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,560
The second time would be easier.

283
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:23,030
Sir, this is the innkeepers' dormitory. You cannot enter.

284
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,660
I shall assist you if you are lost.

285
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,000
Go Su Ra?

286
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,380
Yes, that is I.

287
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,770
I am informing you that you have not paid the interest since last month.

288
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,650
If you do not pay next month, either,

289
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,510
he will go to Namhae himself.

290
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,990
Your mother and sister are well, correct?

291
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,150
No!

292
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,720
Of course, that cannot occur.

293
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,370
You understand what I mean, correct?

294
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,890
Go Su Ra, are you apprehensive about something?

295
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,140
It is nothing.

296
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,300
We are suffering because of Prince Mu Yeong.

297
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,230
He had a grand pre-celebration, but he annulled the wedding.

298
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,670
I know.

299
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,710
How will he manage the aftermath?

300
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,470
It is something that cannot be forced.

301
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,000
Is Hong Deok Su not present yet?

302
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,880
He will arrive soon.

303
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,850
Speak of the devil...

304
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,790
Are you all right?

305
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,140
Your face looks pale.

306
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,120
What?

307
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,610
No, it is nothing.

308
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,550
Let us clean up. Come on.

309
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,380
Why are you trailing me?

310
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,490
Go clean over there.

311
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,530
Are you suspicious of me by chance?

312
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,330
We are mates, are we not? We are roommates.

313
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,910
Mates must remain together.

314
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,500
Let us search my old house tonight.

315
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,350
Your old house?

316
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,990
Yes.

317
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,960
We shall assemble the golden key. We must search for the safe.

318
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,810
No.

319
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:32,360
If the safe was concealed there, there is no manner in which Cheon could not have discovered it.

320
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,440
Even if it is not,

321
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,480
there will be a clue.

322
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,610
Everything must commence from the origin point.

323
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,930
We would appear suspicious if we moved together.

324
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,100
Let us meet there at midnight.

325
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,180
Sounds good.

326
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,870
You may go.

327
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,450
You cannot obtain a loan since you have been an innkeeper for less than a year.

328
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,040
I appreciate you looking into it.

329
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,050
I shall consult Master Cheon and seek an alternative.

330
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,000
It is all right.

331
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,430
Innkeeper loan?

332
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,630
You must worry about money greatly.

333
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,990
Where are your companions? Why are you here alone?

334
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,310
Stop looking upset.

335
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,730
You are not the only one from a poor family.

336
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,090
How much do you require?

337
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,150
Tell me.

338
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,010
I, Kim Myeong Ho, could grant you a loan.

339
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,970
You would grant me a loan?

340
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,650
Of course.

341
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,210
If you, Go Su Ra...

342
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:26,910
agree to serve under me.

343
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,190
Are you instructing me to become your subordinate?

344
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,550
No. I mean it literally.

345
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,390
Serve under me.

346
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,760
If you crawl beneath here,

347
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,650
you will receive one nyang each time.

348
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,590
What do you say?

349
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,470
Filthy mongrel.

350
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,350
W-What? F-Filthy mongrel?

351
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,440
Take care.

352
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,870
Did something transpire between you and Hong Deok Su?

353
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,830
I do not know. Like what?

354
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,210
You have been together all day.

355
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,940
He is a friend who requires considerable attention.

356
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,640
Friend?

357
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,180
I do not believe he is merely a friend.

358
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,390
Did you annul the engagement because of Hong Deok Su,

359
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,430
Prince Mu Yeong?

360
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,980
- Cheon Jun Hwa. 
 - Yes, I have known.

361
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:21,450
How long will you conceal your identity and remain at Yongcheonru?

362
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:25,680
Should you not return to where you belong?

363
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:34,040
I also concealed the fact that I am the inn owner's son.

364
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:40,350
Shall we consider ourselves even since we are both culpable?

365
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,760
Nothing should change between us.

366
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,740
If so, how about Hong Deok Su?

367
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,450
What is the reason you are asking?

368
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,390
 There is a woman I like. 

369
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,330
 I fell for her at first sight. 

370
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,440
 I have never felt this way in my life. 

371
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,160
The woman you were going to confess love to...

372
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,520
was her.

373
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,790
Did you know that he was a woman?

374
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,730
Hong Deok Su informed me last night.

375
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,410
You heard directly from her?

376
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:51,170
So, do you love her or something?

377
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,540
Why now?

378
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,960
You had no feelings before, but now that you know he is a woman,

379
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,870
you have suddenly developed feelings?

380
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,280
It is none of your concern.

381
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,890
Does Hong Deok Su know?

382
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,840
That Lee Eun Ho is actually Prince Mu Yeong?

383
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,970
Return before Hong Deok Su discovers everything.

384
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,920
- That is enough. 
 - You belong in a different world.

385
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:21,580
If you desire her to be truly happy,

386
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,720
you should let her go.

387
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,810
   

388
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,550
   

389
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,170
Go Su Ra of Namhae Merchants.

390
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,570
- Yes. 
 - I heard about your Merchant.

391
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,960
Namhae Merchants are renowned for their honesty and trustworthiness.

392
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,330
It cannot be closed down in such a manner.

393
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,920
I shall assist your business.

394
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,570
Thank you, Master Cheon.

395
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,420
Would you like to assist me as well?

396
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:10,350
Last night, something unfortunate occurred at Yongcheonru.

397
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,560
I heard there was a robbery.

398
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,240
By chance, on the night of the pre-celebration,

399
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,720
did you see Hong Deok Su and Lee Eun Ho?

400
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,760
Be honest as someone befitting Namhae Merchants.

401
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,850
Did you wish for me to respond honestly?

402
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,260
Why do you require my honesty, Master Cheon?

403
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,280
Honesty?

404
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,230
I require a poor man's desperation more.

405
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,260
Do you not require money? Desperately?

406
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,910
Jun Hwa is indeed blessed with good friends.

407
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,240
He selected the appropriate one.

408
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,220
Cheon Jun Hwa. He is my son.

409
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,320
He shall become Yongcheonru's owner in the future.

410
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,470
But it is problematic that he is so weak.

411
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,230
Could you assist him by his side?

412
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:57,900
Inform me of what deters Jun Hwa and renders him weak.

413
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:03,400
You shall report to me everything he does.

414
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,080
If so...

415
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,320
would you pay me enough...

416
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,510
so that I may never be humiliated because of money?

417
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,970
Yes.

418
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,530
I will do that.

419
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:42,670
You cannot change direction to avoid the sword, Seol Mae Hwa.

420
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,370
Was it Cheon's order?

421
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,560
Kill her!

422
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:23,770
Did you know Prince Mu Yeong would annul the engagement?

423
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,100
You cannot always discern what people think.

424
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,540
I merely tested him slightly.

425
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,100
It is too rigid.

426
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,470
I should sever it.

427
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,010
Look.

428
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,070
Is it not a masterpiece?

429
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,370
By pruning and tying the unruly branches,

430
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,980
and training them over time,

431
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,850
I created it just as I desire. It is my handiwork.

432
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,370
Would you like to attempt it?

433
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,750
It is hard with a big tree.

434
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:32,980
Training a young tree...

435
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,360
is considerably easier.

436
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,910
His Majesty has a young son.

437
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,660
Do you mean Prince Seon Yang?

438
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,580
How about Prince Mu Yeong...

439
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,700
To create a new bonsai,

440
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,510
you must break the old pot it resided in.

441
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:18,680
That way, Prince Seon Yang

442
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,830
will become your bonsai wholeheartedly.

443
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,690
Prince Mu Yeong is not your friend.

444
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,380
Discard him.

445
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:16,640
Provide me with a few men, Father.

446
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,870
You frightened me!

447
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,610
You and your skincare.

448
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,210
Enough is enough!

449
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,460
It is not the time for this!

450
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,880
I have already done it. What can be done?

451
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,630
The wedding is annulled. Why peel off your skin?

452
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,710
I need to apprehend Do Gyeong and instruct her accordingly.

453
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:57,490
This is so humiliating!

454
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:00,990
Cease the nonsense and prepare my official robe.

455
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,830
Your robe?

456
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:05,650
Will you enter the palace now?

457
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:09,930
I shall seize the King by his collar

458
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,930
and terminate this entire matter.

459
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,500
There is a guest at the annex.

460
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,240
What? Guest?

461
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,770
Yes.

462
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,370
Why did you come?

463
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:07,550
Are you here to observe our misery after the wedding has been annulled?

464
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:11,510
I am responsible for everything.

465
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:15,810
It is not your niece's fault at all. I hope you comprehend.

466
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:18,480
What are you attempting to do?

467
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:25,090
I shall assemble the distinguished men of the palace and inform His Majesty of this humiliation.

468
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,670
Minister!

469
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:32,090
How much longer will you mock the royal family?

470
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:35,850
Do not be disloyal to His Majesty any longer.

471
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:38,930
His Majesty approved this engagement.

472
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,480
It was due to your greed from the outset.

473
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:46,220
Will you sell your niece's future because of it?

474
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,600
What grants you the confidence to undertake all this?

475
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,550
As you are my brother, Prince Seon Yang's grandfather,

476
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,080
I endeavored to respect you.

477
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,990
However... I shall not continue to do so.

478
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,770
Are you out of your mind?

479
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:10,890
I shall no longer ignore your disloyalty and crimes.

480
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,570
I am making this clear to you today.

481
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,740
So, keep this in mind.

482
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,770
I, Prince Mu Yeong, shall become the crown prince.

483
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,010
Pardon?

484
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,010
I shall bring order to the country and royal family as my father did.

485
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:32,800
You had better accept that as my loyal servant.

486
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,620
 Why now? 

487
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,780
 You had no feelings before, but now that you know he is a woman, 

488
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,560
 you have suddenly developed feelings? 

489
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,920
 It is none of your concern. 

490
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:14,410
 Wow! Petals! 

491
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,840
Is Lee Eun Ho not present yet?

492
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,500
Who are you?

493
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:30,880
Who sent you?

494
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,260
Yeo...

495
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,720
Hyang...

496
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,420
Bae.

497
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,350
The other one says, "Hee. Wi."

498
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:08,590
Yeo. Hee. Hyang. Wi. Bae.

499
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,080
What does that signify?

500
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,480
You have lost him.

501
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,410
My apologies.

502
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,290
 We would appear suspicious if we moved together. 

503
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,500
 Let us meet there at midnight. 

504
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:39,400
This...

505
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,430
 Go ahead and pick one. 

506
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,550
Hong Deok Su.

507
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,330
Hong Deok Su.

508
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,870
No.

509
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:04,610
Hong Deok Su.

510
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,800
- No... 
  - Lee Eun Ho.

511
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,040
What caused your delay?

512
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:14,330
Hong Deok Su.

513
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,530
Are you all right? Are you injured?

514
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,470
What? This?

515
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:21,510
It is all right. It is merely a small cut.

516
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,030
Why do you...

517
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:29,180
drive me so crazy?

518
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:35,290
I am fine.

519
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:38,240
It is nothing. What is the issue?

520
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:43,060
You are the one who caused me worry by arriving late.

521
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,170
Hey.

522
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,660
Lee Eun Ho, are you all right?

523
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,120
Is something going on?

524
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,830
I am all right.

525
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:09,340
Nothing is wrong.

526
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:13,680
I do not believe that is true.

527
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,620
Well, I mean, did you think I would abscond with the golden key?

528
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:22,430
Do you believe I am acting because of a mere golden key?

529
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,900
- What is it, thenâ€” 
 - It is because of you, Hong Deok Su. Because of you.

530
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,850
â™«  A trembling feeling for the first time  â™«

531
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:44,300
â™«  A distant gaze  â™«

532
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:51,490
â™«  Could this moment be a dream?  â™«

533
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:58,700
â™«  The noisy world becomes completely silent  â™«

534
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:05,810
â™«  And like warm sunlight, you come to me  â™«

535
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:13,100
â™«  I started to wonder since when it began  â™«

536
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:21,090
â™«  How do you think of me?  â™«

537
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:25,580
â™«  If you feel the same as I do  â™«

538
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:34,650
â™«  Is your heart pounding like mine right now?  â™«

539
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:41,670
â™«  The blooming flowers sing  â™«

540
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:48,910
â™«  The blowing wind whispers  â™«

541
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:57,410
â™«  Like the warm sunlight  â™« 
 â™«  You look at me  â™«

542
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:06,580
â™«  And I bloom again as the person I used to be  â™«

543
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,240
   

544
01:07:52,630 --> 01:08:01,710


545
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:14,370
â™«  When your eyes look at me  â™«

546
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,110
 Gosh, Lee Eun Ho! 

547
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:17,950
 It is concluded once we locate the safe. 

548
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:19,850
 Everything shall conclude shortly. 

549
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:22,070
 You are quite strong, Hong Deok Su. 

550
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:25,010
 I am a true man, Hong Deok Su. 

551
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:26,870
 You are not. 

552
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:30,470
 Whether you are Hong Deok Su or Hong Jae On, 

553
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:34,910
 - I have chosen to keep only you in my heart. 
 - Me too. 

554
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:38,410
 No matter what happens, I will protect you. 

555
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:40,220
 I will not let him take her. 

556
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:44,270
 Hong Jae On was yours from the beginning, Jun Hwa. 

557
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:48,300
 I will make sure to get Hong Jae On back. 

558
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:52,110
 You had better approve my request! 

559
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:55,680
 I struck a dog who is irrational about the proclamation ceremony. 

560
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,520
 All that remains is for it to bite me. 

561
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:02,150
 Hong Deok Su! 

562
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:04,060
 Lee Eun Ho! Let her go. 

563
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:07,670
 Do you not know Deok Su could be in danger? 

564
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:10,250
 I will protect those who are close to me.
