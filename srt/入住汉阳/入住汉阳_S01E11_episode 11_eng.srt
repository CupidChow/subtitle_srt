1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
   

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,590
   

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:15,050


4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,530
   

5
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,030
   

6
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,330
I have brought you some medicine.

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,460
Thank you for the past few days.

8
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,920
Is he still like that?

9
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,340
Yes.

10
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,490
Hong Deok Su, please get up and have at least some porridge.

11
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,420
Just leave him for now.

12
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,100
I will feed him later.

13
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,790
Get up.

14
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,770
Get up, Hong Deok Su.

15
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,810
Will you end things in this manner?

16
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,600
Will you lie down until you die?

17
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,870
It is my fault.

18
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,440
It is entirely my fault.

19
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,770
Does blaming yourself change anything?

20
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,120
Gather yourself, Hong Deok Su!

21
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,320
Please, just...

22
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,410
leave me alone.

23
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,210
Leave me as I am.

24
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,290
What are you doing?

25
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,410
Do not do it.

26
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,780
Do not do it.

27
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,340
Mom!

28
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,960
This does not bring her back.

29
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,650
Hong Deok Su,

30
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,220
please let your mother go now.

31
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,000
That is likely what she desires as well.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,040
♫  But your heart won’t change  ♫ 
 ♫  like the moon, will it?  ♫

33
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,670
♫  Left alone  ♫

34
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:30,400
♫  I draw you, then erase you  ♫ 
 ♫  Tears well up  ♫

35
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,790
Mother...

36
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,680
Mother!

37
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,670
♫  I'll fly, fluttering  ♫

38
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,720
♫  Following this longing to where you sleep  ♫

39
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,510
♫  Under the same sky, no matter where  ♫

40
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,270
 Whose son are you? 

41
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,260
 - Your son. 
 - That is right. 

42
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,850
♫  In my dreams  ♫ 
 ♫  Why did you hold me so gently?  ♫

43
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,070
♫  When I wake up, it hurts  ♫

44
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,160
Mother!

45
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,290
♫  If you call my name  ♫

46
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:42,020
♫  I'll fly, fluttering  ♫

47
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,220
♫  Following this longing to where you sleep  ♫

48
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,130
♫  Under the same sky, no matter where  ♫

49
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:59,390
♫  I'll go  ♫ 
 ♫  Like the wind, I'll soar  ♫

50
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,750
Can I live without Mother?

51
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,270
What should I do now?

52
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,070
She is gone now.

53
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,900
I am alone.

54
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,160
How can you be alone?

55
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,770
You have us by your side.

56
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,890
Everyone is waiting for you.

57
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,090
Come back.

58
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,630
 I am not the one you should take revenge on. 

59
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,070
 The one who came to kill you. 

60
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,580
 It is that Master Cheon. 

61
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,140
How did...

62
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,400
my father pass away?

63
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,690
Everything started with Master Cheon's ledger.

64
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,410
   

65
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,100
The amount is too large.

66
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,200
I said power is just like a sword.

67
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,170
Do not worry.

68
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,200
I guarantee we will profit a hundred or a thousand times more.

69
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,540
I do not wish for you to be in danger, either.

70
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,830
Hong Min Shik, I am Cheon Mak Dong.

71
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,720
Do you not trust me?

72
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,800
Hold on.

73
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,060
Place this inside, too.

74
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,840
What is this?

75
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,810
That is our lifeline.

76
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,040
This is all for you, me, and everyone—

77
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,370
What do you mean by that?

78
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,230
Do you remember?

79
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,040
When everyone refused to make a deal with me in the market,

80
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,870
you were the first person to give me a chance.

81
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,760
I am giving you a chance now.

82
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,600
Trust me, Hong Min Shik's friend Cheon Mak Dong, just once.

83
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,030
Why are you doing this?

84
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,610
The ones who laughed at me because of my background.

85
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,950
The ones who looked down on me.

86
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,890
I am merely trying to step on them to climb up.

87
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,830
The world will turn upside down tomorrow.

88
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,800
What have you been up to?

89
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,560
Master Hong,

90
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,150
I have stocked all the materials for this month.

91
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,380
How long have you been standing there?

92
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,630
My apologies.

93
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,140
We should...

94
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,710
talk later.

95
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,260
 Your Majesty! 

96
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,350
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim!

97
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,940
- His Majesty has passed away. 
 - What?

98
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,820
A department has already been created for the national funeral.

99
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,730
 The world will turn upside down tomorrow. 

100
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,070
The physician, Lee Sang Yong.

101
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,700
The attendant court lady, Jung Seo Yi.

102
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,310
   

103
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,840
   

104
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,050
Cheon Mak Dong.

105
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,540
The former king's death?

106
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,550
Cheon's ledger not only details the bribes,

107
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,570
but all the secrets regarding the former king's death.

108
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:45,340
Did my father pass away because of that ledger?

109
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:51,070
The item that Master hid in the safe is Cheon's ledger.

110
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,710
The only thing that can open the safe is a golden key that has been split in half.

111
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,690
That is the only one.

112
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,250
This golden key...

113
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,210
is the key to the safe?

114
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,370
Master Cheon acquired the other half that day.

115
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,260
The other half disappeared with you like this.

116
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,790
Master Cheon was...

117
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,780
after the golden key, not me.

118
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,450
The ledger is those people's greatest weakness.

119
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,070
The moment the ledger is revealed, it will become a powerful weapon

120
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,810
that will take down the Minister of Defense and Master Cheon, who attempted a coup,

121
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,300
and even the King on the throne now.

122
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,320
The one who acquires the ledger...

123
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,950
will possess that power.

124
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,450
Master Cheon already knows you are Hong Jae On.

125
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,830
Therefore, you need to go far away now.

126
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,120
No.

127
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,820
I cannot do that.

128
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,880
The golden key he has...

129
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,240
I will take that back.

130
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,060
Revenge for the past belongs to the past.

131
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,160
My mother died for no reason.

132
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,190
I will be...

133
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,540
taking this revenge.

134
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,190
I will return to Yongcheonru.

135
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,600
 My revenge... 

136
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,170
 is commencing now. 

137
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,300
My mother...

138
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,560
was murdered.

139
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,060
Murdered?

140
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,750
By whom?

141
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,870
Twelve years ago, someone stabbed my father to death.

142
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,340
And my mother, who raised me, was also...

143
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,920
- What do you... 
 - Seol Mae Hwa.

144
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,180
It was Master Innkeeper Seol Mae Hwa.

145
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,000
If so,

146
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,870
was your father...

147
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,510
Hong...

148
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,120
Min Shik.

149
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,440
He was my father.

150
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,230
You are his...

151
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,700
Yes, I am...

152
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,730
Hong Jae On.

153
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,160
It cannot be.

154
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,100
I...

155
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,900
was your father's...

156
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,210
Hong Min Shik's one and only friend.

157
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,390
Hong Jae On...

158
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,190
Do you know how hard

159
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,830
I have searched for you since that night twelve years ago?

160
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:37,370
Everything is finally in its place.

161
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:59,430
Jae On, I will help you from now on.

162
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:06,750
The enemy who killed your father. Do not ever forgive her.

163
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,490
 Master Cheon does not trust anyone. 

164
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,570
 He will attempt to test our relationship. 

165
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,100
 I will make him trust me completely. 

166
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,050
By the way...

167
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,750
how did you know it was Seol Mae Hwa?

168
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,040
I saw it myself.

169
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,480
- You saw it? 
 - Yes.

170
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,330
I saw her stabbing my father... and she ran away.

171
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,420
I see.

172
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,500
Seol Mae Hwa.

173
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,830
Seol Mae Hwa.

174
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,490
I will never forgive her.

175
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
I will make sure...

176
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,490
she pays for what she did.

177
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,190
You went through something devastating at a young age.

178
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,820
If only you had come to me a little sooner...

179
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,560
When I heard about what happened to your family that night,

180
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,660
it was already too late.

181
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,660
Having someone to rely on is sufficient.

182
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,330
I am certain Seol Mae Hwa did not act alone.

183
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,000
I am certain someone was behind it.

184
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,380
Do you remember anything?

185
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,720
Perhaps something your father used to say or someone he used to meet with?

186
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,010
Seol Mae Hwa was the only one Father brought into our house.

187
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:33,030
Yes, let us wait and see until we discover who was behind it.

188
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:38,630
Jae On, what goes on with you concerns me from now on.

189
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,650
Discuss everything with me first.

190
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,270
Do you understand?

191
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,280
Yes, Master Cheon.

192
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,500
I am truly...

193
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,890
grateful.

194
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,920
 Hong Min Shik! 

195
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,850
 Seol Mae Hwa, you wench. 

196
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,670
 How could you betray me? 

197
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,830
 Where did you hide the safe? 

198
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,890
 Is that all you can say to your friend? 

199
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,580
 Give me the safe. 

200
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,190
 Give me the safe, I said! 

201
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,510
 What is this? What is this engraving? 

202
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,250
 Do you think I will not find it if you do not tell me? 

203
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,150
 Look, Cheon Mak Dong, you are doomed. 

204
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,450
 No! 

205
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,030
 I am not doomed! 

206
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,150
 Cheon Mak Dong... 

207
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,930
 will be above the King by using money. 

208
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,800
 Far above him! 

209
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,820
 I will be at the top of the world! 

210
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,210
 Watch me from your grave. 

211
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,790
 See if I am wrong. 

212
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,530
Are you not curious about what your daughter would do?

213
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,790
It will prove that I was right.

214
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,880
Go Su Ra?

215
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,240
What is all this?

216
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,750
You have finally come. The pork is getting cold. Seriously.

217
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,720
Cheon Jun Hwa.

218
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,010
- Jun Hwa made all this. 
 - Gosh.

219
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,430
Let us sit and speak. Sit, sit.

220
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,820
You made all this yourself?

221
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,070
It was only a day, but I learned directly from your mother.

222
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,190
Here. Try tasting it.

223
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,510
Although it could never be as good.

224
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,730
You should have rested more. Why did you return so soon?

225
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,410
Well,

226
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,280
I wish to thank you for that time.

227
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,620
Thanks to you,

228
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,400
I was strengthened while sending Mother away.

229
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,790
Hey, we are not strangers.

230
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,050
We have been together since we were in the Bottom-Tier Room.

231
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,360
We are the However Quartet.

232
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,870
Yes.

233
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,190
By the way, where is Lee Eun Ho?

234
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,850
I wonder. I have not seen him today.

235
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,820
Eat some. Go ahead.

236
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,320
It melts in your mouth.

237
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,360
It tastes amazing.

238
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,770
Good work, Cheon Jun Hwa.

239
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,260
What did I tell you?

240
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,600
Nothing energizes you more than pork.

241
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,460
It is so tasty.

242
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,060
It reminds me of my mother.

243
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,480
You should leave Yongcheonru now.

244
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,500
However, I am almost there, Father.

245
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,580
- If you give me a bit more time— 
 - The Minister of Defense...

246
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,720
wants you and his niece to have an arranged marriage.

247
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,190
Arranged marriage?

248
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,960
How did he threaten you this time?

249
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,950
He did not threaten me.

250
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:59,330
He has your dragon sword, Mu Yeong.

251
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,680
Dragon sword...

252
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,670
 I will keep investigating the murder 

253
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,360
 and catch the culprit. 

254
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,070
That case is a trap set by the Minister of Defense.

255
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,240
You are also aware of that, Father.

256
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,500
The truth is meaningless to those people.

257
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,880
They also caused a disaster without reservation twelve years ago.

258
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,100
What happened...

259
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,080
twelve years ago?

260
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,580
What is tormenting you so much, Father?

261
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,360
The Minister of Defense and Cheon...

262
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,060
assassinated the former king.

263
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,760
Do you mean...

264
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,160
they committed treason?

265
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,080
Why did you not punish such evil men immediately?

266
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,800
I was not able to.

267
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,610
Because I did not have the evidence of the treason.

268
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:26,000
 Your Majesty! 

269
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,520
If so, what you were seeking by using the golden key is...

270
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,540
The evidence of the assassination.

271
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,310
Before Cheon's business partner, Hong Min Shik was murdered,

272
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,500
he hid the ledger in his safe.

273
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,880
If only I had that...

274
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,660
So that is why Hong Min Shik died.

275
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,520
The Minister of Defense is like a wolf.

276
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:19,130
- He could do anything to make Prince Seon Yang the crown prince. 
 - Father.

277
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,870
Cheon is making the Minister of Defense more powerful.

278
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,500
I cannot put you in danger also, Mu Yeong.

279
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,440
I will...

280
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,280
catch all of those traitors.

281
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,190
Let him arrange my marriage.

282
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,750
I will take care of the rest.

283
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,550
There will be a royal wedding at Yehwajeon soon.

284
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,600
The royal family will have a wedding at Yongcheonru?

285
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,250
The niece of the Minister of Defense and Prince Mu Yeong will be married.

286
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,350
You mean, Lee Eun Ho?

287
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,440
Did he agree to it willingly?

288
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,890
The royal family's marriages are all about politics.

289
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,180
Prince Mu Yeong's opinion does not matter.

290
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,450
He will act accordingly while understanding the situation, correct?

291
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,470
I wonder.

292
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,050
Let us wait and see.

293
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,760
If Prince Mu Yeong and the Minister of Defense fought

294
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,240
and hurt each other fatally, it would be even better.

295
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,210
Would that not be enjoyable to watch?

296
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,540
Master Cheon, this is Mae Hwa.

297
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,630
You have come, Master Innkeeper.

298
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,360
I am here to report to you regarding the wedding budget of the Minister of Defense.

299
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,770
I told you to let the head host be in charge of that.

300
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,650
Hong Jae On is back.

301
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,190
Hong Jae On?

302
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,250
Will you continue playing ignorant?

303
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:51,690
Why did you hide that Hong Deok Su was Hong Min Shik's daughter?

304
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:05,340
I did not tell you because she did not know what happened that day.

305
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,090
She said she saw you killing her father.

306
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,320
She relied on me, thinking I was her father's friend.

307
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,850
What else can I do but help her?

308
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,210
The Ulju merchants have been complaining a lot.

309
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,080
You should be in Ulju for a while.

310
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,610
You must feel uncomfortable seeing Hong Jae On, too.

311
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,040
Do you still have something to say?

312
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,630
Good, Hyeongnim.

313
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,820
Hyeongnim, did you hear?

314
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:48,060
Yongcheonru is hosting a wedding for the royal family and the family of the Minister of Defense.

315
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,340
It is a royal wedding. How could I not know?

316
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,740
I have sent a letter to Ulju already.

317
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,720
Ulju needs to make a connection with the royal family, too.

318
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,990
That is correct.

319
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,730
Twelve years ago, after the former king died,

320
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,130
Yongcheonru grew close to the royal family quickly.

321
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,590
That is why they have grown so much.

322
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,560
Watch your mouth.

323
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,120
 The former king's death? 

324
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,720
 Cheon's ledger not only details the bribes, 

325
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,790
 but all the secrets regarding the former king's death. 

326
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,100
You returned late last night, too.

327
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,800
Are you going somewhere again?

328
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,200
I am on vacation since something arose at home.

329
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,750
You should have rested a few more days. You have returned already?

330
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,440
I must work since I am back.

331
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,970
By the way, did you hear?

332
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,690
A prince is coming to Yongcheonru.

333
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,760
What?

334
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,830
Remember the lady who stayed at Jakyakjae?

335
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,450
We went to the lake together, too.

336
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,540
She and His Majesty's eldest son...

337
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,010
are having a wedding at Yehwajeon. Everyone is becoming anxious.

338
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,820
That wedding... will not happen.

339
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,820
It will not happen?

340
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,010
Do you know something, Lee Eun Ho?

341
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,680
Well... Prince Mu Yeong ...

342
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,150
is very particular and a perfectionist.

343
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,820
An arranged marriage will not work. That is what I meant.

344
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,190
Hold on.

345
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,820
By chance, are you...

346
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,060
Prince Mu Yeong...

347
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,880
Are you his acquaintance?

348
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,490
I actually know him, too.

349
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,730
Did you not know? I know His Majesty, too.

350
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,370
All of their subjects know the royal family.

351
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,780
It is my fault for listening to you seriously.

352
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,850
Good heavens...

353
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,110
Look, Lee Eun Ho.

354
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,590
What?

355
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,760
I want to...

356
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,200
thank you for that time.

357
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,060
Should I go?

358
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,130
Yes, I should. I will.

359
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,870
 Prince Mu Yeong and the niece of the Minister of Defense 

360
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,610
are having a wedding?

361
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,520
Not only that, but Yu Su In,

362
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,620
you are the person in charge?

363
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:41,160
Master Cheon finally acknowledged my abilities, you know.

364
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,740
He acknowledges Head Host Yu?

365
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,670
Master Cheon is taking a risk.

366
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,220
I am certain he is doing it for a reason.

367
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,780
He would not have sent the Master Innkeeper to Ulju without a reason.

368
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,170
It is because she was demoted.

369
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,310
I have connections in Ulju.

370
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,640
I consulted with Ulju Merchants.

371
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,750
They thought she was already dismissed.

372
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:13,300
If this wedding proceeds well, I will become the Master Innkeeper.

373
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:22,440
Tiger moths die because they get close to the fire.

374
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,460
Watch from afar.

375
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,410
Do not get too close.

376
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,330
I decided to send Seol Mae Hwa to Ulju.

377
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,850
Pardon?

378
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,860
You do not take revenge at once.

379
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,700
If you act hastily, you will become vulnerable and exacerbate the situation.

380
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,650
Wear the opponent out slowly...

381
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:07,400
and suffocate them little by little.

382
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,580
What is it?

383
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,440
Do you not agree with my decision?

384
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,310
No, sir.

385
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,600
 I will make him trust me... 

386
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,520
 completely. 

387
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,510
 I will stay as close as possible and... 

388
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,630
 wait for a chance to get the golden key back. 

389
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,680
I have heard there will be a royal wedding at Yongcheonru soon.

390
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,630
By chance, is there something I could do?

391
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,100
It involves the royal family and the Minister of Defense.

392
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:03,090
I understand how important this wedding is to you.

393
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,100
So?

394
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,260
I will be your hands and feet, Master Cheon.

395
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,900
Hong Jae On.

396
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,920
The more I see you, the more you resemble me.

397
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,740
More importantly,

398
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,230
I would like you to go to Seol Mae Hwa.

399
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,760
Go and get the Master Innkeeper's seal.

400
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,380
That way, she would know I am behind you.

401
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,750
Yes.

402
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,140
Follow her.

403
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,340
Give me your seal.

404
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,170
There are three department heads. Why are you requesting this?

405
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,140
Are you fleeing from me?

406
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:49,210
Look forward to Prince Mu Yeong's wedding with the niece of the Minister of Defense.

407
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,420
I will obtain what I desire that day.

408
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,650
It will not take long.

409
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,530
 You believe everything will proceed as you wish now. 

410
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,980
 I thought that as well. 

411
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,280
 You will have to exercise greater caution from now on. 

412
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,750
 Hand me the seal! 

413
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,560
Aigoo,

414
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:58,280
you arrived unexpectedly.

415
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,800
Please come inside.

416
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,810
I came to inspect something.

417
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,480
We would have seen each other at Yongcheonru.

418
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,810
You did not have to come here.

419
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,760
 Now listen carefully. 

420
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,190
 We have much to accomplish. 

421
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,610
 Find my dragon sword, which the Minister of Defense possesses. 

422
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,930
 While I am buying ample time by claiming the minister's attention, 

423
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,010
 you should search his residence and retrieve the sword. 

424
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,420
Let us go inside and speak, then.

425
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,490
Would you like to walk with me?

426
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,910
Pardon?

427
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,130
I desire the wedding to be extravagant.

428
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,300
Pardon?

429
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,800
It concerns your reputation and is a royal event, after all.

430
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,370
Well, I suppose it is true.

431
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,260
Cheon stated he would finance it.

432
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,010
Let him boast of his wealth all he wishes.

433
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:14,210
Yes, yes. Understood. Let us go inside and speak.

434
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,890
Festive!

435
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,640
My wedding must be festive.

436
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,380
It should differ from everyone else's.

437
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,380
I thought you preferred keeping things simple.

438
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,840
Chirping!

439
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,850
Birds.

440
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,430
Parrots.

441
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,120
- I heard my bride-to-be has a parrot. 
 - Yes.

442
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,240
Tell her I cannot allow a flamboyant hobby such as that.

443
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:19,480
You just mentioned you liked extravagant things.

444
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,900
Do you not feel pity for that bird?

445
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,900
Yes.

446
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,260
Every single aspect of her...

447
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,090
will be judged by everyone.

448
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,760
Have you not heard of the "Three Rules for Women"?

449
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,650
Of course, I have.

450
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,600
"Obey the father when you are young.

451
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,310
Obey the husband after being wedded and..."

452
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,450
That is correct.

453
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,670
I will document the details and send them to Yongcheonru.

454
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,380
If every single one of them is fulfilled,

455
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:10,740
I will gladly have the wedding.

456
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:14,380
I have told you everything, so I take my leave now.

457
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,930
What is wrong with him?

458
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,720
Long time no see.

459
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,730
You look splendid in the innkeeper uniform.

460
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:53,410
You know you owe me, correct?

461
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,920
Yes.

462
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,230
Did you have a pleasant visit to Onyang?

463
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,290
My uncle caused a fuss, sending me there.

464
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:04,880
He is finally making me marry into the royal family.

465
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,090
I will be serving you until the wedding.

466
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,310
That would allow me to finally breathe a bit.

467
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,070
We are already so busy. There will be a pre-ceremony, too?

468
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:29,940
Can the future leader abuse his power in this manner?

469
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,900
- Prince Mu Yeong? 
 - Yes, him.

470
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,550
He is so particular.

471
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,890
He apparently does not want anyone near the guest room.

472
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,010
Is he planning not to marry?

473
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,470
What?

474
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,740
It is an arranged marriage.

475
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,350
Perhaps he is devising an excuse to flee.

476
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:57,370
We cannot permit that to happen.

477
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,460
Did you wish to see me?

478
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,850
You are working diligently on my wedding.

479
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:27,560
I should commend you for it, at least.

480
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:33,630
It is my honor to serve you, Prince Mu Yeong.

481
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,630
Thanks to you, I have been able to make up my mind, too.

482
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,030
What do you think of me...

483
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,360
having my proclamation ceremony...

484
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,320
at Yongcheonru also?

485
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:54,370
You are not a suitable match with the Minister of Defense.

486
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,870
You should stand behind me instead.

487
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,330
My goodness.

488
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,480
I cannot be more flattered.

489
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,530
What will you do now?

490
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:48,340
Beom Ho, you should impersonate Prince Mu Yeong here for now.

491
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,130
Pardon?

492
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,970
Will I be doing that until the wedding?

493
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,830
In the meantime,

494
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:58,300
I will search for Cheon's golden key.

495
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,370
I will ensure to find it...

496
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:04,940
and resolve matters myself.

497
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,300
Including my father's suffering...

498
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,790
and the royal family's concerns.

499
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,200
Allow me to serve you snacks.

500
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,000
What is he doing here?

501
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,310
Is that not Hong Deok Su?

502
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,180
You go out. Hurry.

503
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,770
He saw my face, too.

504
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,290
- I suppose he did. 
 - Yes.

505
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,430
What are we supposed to do, then?

506
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,860
You should know what to do.

507
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,180
 May I come in? 

508
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,040
Never open the door.

509
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,620
Good luck.

510
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,720
You cannot just leave me here.

511
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,550
What should I do with the snacks?

512
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,380
Leave them there and depart.

513
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:19,010
You need to drink the tea before it cools.

514
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,980
 You are being so annoying! 

515
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,490
 Do I need to punish you to make you listen? 

516
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,380
What?

517
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:08,860
Prince Mu Yeong?

518
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,580
Where are you fleeing to so rashly?

519
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,780
Well, have...

520
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,230
have you seen Prince Mu Yeong? Prince Mu Yeong.

521
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,990
Prince Mu Yeong?

522
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,530
Wear it properly. It is tilted.

523
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,410
Do not touch me.

524
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,670
Done, correct?

525
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,040
What was that?

526
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,310
Are you back now?

527
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,290
 Gosh, Prince Mu Yeong is annoying. So annoying. 

528
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:08,460
Prince Mu Yeong is not such a bad person.

529
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,970
How do you know that?

530
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:22,080
Why do you keep defending him?

531
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,150
Everyone has a situation they are going through.

532
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,880
You do not even know.

533
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,780
You cannot judge him in such a manner.

534
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,340
I suppose you are correct.

535
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,170
I went there today to learn more about him.

536
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:41,240
But he refused to see me.

537
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:48,190
Perhaps the Prince's face...

538
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,350
resembles a lump of fermented soybeans fallen from the sky.

539
00:54:56,350 --> 00:55:01,130
That is not true. He is quite handsome, they say.

540
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,680
No. He must be a recluse or...

541
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,060
he must have a personality flaw.

542
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:11,880
I called him, and he fled quickly.

543
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,440
So... did you see him?

544
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,520
I only saw the back of his head briefly.

545
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,730
He looked quite good in his attire.

546
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,600
Really?

547
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,560
Well...

548
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,860
it must be because he is fit from the swordcraft training.

549
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,390
Gosh, please...

550
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:41,000
I hope he does not flee and remains until the wedding.

551
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,310
This is not good.

552
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:47,240
I need to remain vigilant and observe him.

553
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,090
Hong Deok Su,

554
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:56,710
why are you so passionate about this?

555
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,370
It is an important day.

556
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,550
Is it an important day for you, too?

557
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,180
I will make it as extravagant as possible

558
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,130
and ensure everyone observes.

559
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,020
That day...

560
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,980
must be as such.

561
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,860
As extravagant as possible?

562
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,850
It is sad I cannot be there with you.

563
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:45,990
Are you going somewhere?

564
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:52,640
Unfortunately, I need to attend to something important that day, too.

565
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,510
Hong Deok Su,

566
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,940
I hope you achieve what you desired.

567
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,510
My monthly salary... 
    

568
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,820
will not be sufficient to pay even the interest.

569
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,770
What is that letter?

570
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,160
Is it from home?

571
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,770
It is nothing.

572
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,090
How about you? Why do you appear upset?

573
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,900
Are you feeling ill?

574
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,510
Go Su Ra, could you assist me?

575
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,700
Is it Hong Deok Su again?

576
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,690
You are the only one I could trust.

577
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,890
- First of all... 
 - First of all?

578
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:04,890
First of all, tell her you know she is a woman.

579
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:08,740
You should apologize first for delaying telling her.

580
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,000
All right. And?

581
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,170
Cheon Jun Hwa, you are sincere, are you not?

582
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,360
You need to prepare to be rejected, too. Would that be acceptable, too?

583
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,610
You think I am not prepared for that?

584
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,090
Gosh, Go Su Ra.

585
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,620
Proceed slowly. Slowly.

586
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,650
A pre-ceremony in masks?

587
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,700
Good heavens, how obnoxious.

588
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,920
I know. He truly is something.

589
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,500
Do you not agree?

590
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,970
I am certain he has his reasons.

591
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,060
Let us proceed.

592
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:12,260
All right! Here are the masks!

593
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,920
Good work.

594
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,360
Oh my!

595
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,110
Choose one.

596
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,240
Is this handsome?

597
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,770
What is this object?

598
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:48,080
It is a Dongshimgyeol knot.

599
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,920
It is the trendiest thing among the young people of Hanyang.

600
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,590
You tie it on your lover's wrist.

601
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,900
Cheon Jun Hwa.

602
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,500
I heard you were seeking me.

603
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,980
What did you wish to convey to me?

604
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:39,250
Well, you must be weary from preparing for the pre-ceremony.

605
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,480
I wished for you to rest for a moment.

606
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,820
What?

607
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,490
Should I take a brief respite, then?

608
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,220
Good heavens, I was tired. This is good.

609
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,050
Gosh.

610
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,010
Lee Eun Ho and Go Su Ra are approaching, too.

611
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,770
Right, I forgot.

612
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,390
What? Did you forget something?

613
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,490
I should have inspected the masks for the innkeepers.

614
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,060
What?

615
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,730
Come with me.

616
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,270
You should assist me.

617
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:37,390
- Why can you not— 
 - Let us go.

618
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,390
Come.

619
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:43,250
Did they forget something? Why are they returning?

620
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:45,020
Oh, right.

621
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,060
Here.

622
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:51,760
What is this?

623
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:58,640
Hey, where did you obtain this pumpkin yeot?

624
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,450
I happened to need something sweet.

625
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,380
Whoa. It is so tasty.

626
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:11,820
Hong Deok Su.

627
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,230
Yes?

628
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:18,000
Well, Hong Deok Su...

629
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,030
What?

630
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,510
Tell me.

631
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,250
I need to apologize to you.

632
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,740
You will forgive me, correct?

633
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,790
We are friends. No need to apologize.

634
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:41,460
I knew you were a woman.

635
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,750
For a long time.

636
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,170
I am sorry I took so long to inform you.

637
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,760
S-Since when?

638
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:07,660
H-How?

639
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,950
I do not know why you kept it a secret,

640
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:18,070
but inform me if you require my assistance.

641
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,300
Cheon Jun Hwa, is that why you—

642
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,440
This is called a Dongshimgyeol knot.

643
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,320
It connects fates from the sky to the land.

644
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,770
Could you perceive me as a man instead of a friend?

645
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,970
I am sorry, Cheon Jun Hwa, I...

646
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:12,800
You... do not have to respond now.

647
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:15,650
Please give it a little more thought.

648
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:22,830
I will return now. You should rest longer.

649
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,100
All right.

650
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,590
Do not become distracted, Hong Deok Su.

651
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,300
Today is the day.

652
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,410
Here.

653
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,550
I am engaging in various activities.

654
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:54,430
I am attending a mask party.

655
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:58,190
He is quite an obnoxious prince. So obnoxious.

656
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:01,330
No, it suits you well.

657
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:03,730
You will join me, too, correct?

658
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:07,500
Good heavens, I cannot be beside you.

659
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,730
I will remove myself discreetly.

660
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:12,570
Attempt to converse with him naturally.

661
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,870
Let us proceed now.

662
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:46,080
The man in the nobleman mask is Prince Mu Yeong.

663
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,800
I provided him with a mask in advance.

664
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:52,050
He does appear nice and stylish.

665
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:48,540
You should greet him while he is alone.

666
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,610
Should I?

667
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:53,720
I will bring you something to drink.

668
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:26,330
What is it that you desire?

669
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:28,800
Why do you not stab me?

670
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:34,860
You halted the dagger because you desired something.

671
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,980
All I possess is one-half of it.

672
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:09,160
What will you do with that?

673
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,500
Here it is.

674
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:56,700
   

675
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:07,970


676
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:19,700
♫  The round moonlight has suddenly  ♫

677
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:22,300
 Lee Eun Ho, who are you? 

678
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,180
 How could you, Hong Deok Su... 

679
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,340
 That golden key is supposed to be mine. 

680
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,100
 I also need the golden key. 

681
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,440
 You approached me because of the golden key. 

682
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,080
 Did something happen between you and Hong Deok Su? 

683
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,320
 He requires a lot of attention, as you know. 

684
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,060
 I do not think you are just friends. 

685
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:40,420
 Did you break off the marriage because of Hong Deok Su... 

686
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:43,810
 Prince Mu Yeong? Do you love him? 

687
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,950
 - That is enough. 
 - You belong in different worlds. 

688
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:49,790
 If you really want him to be happy, let him go. 

689
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:52,620
 I, Prince Mu Yeong, will become the crown prince. 

690
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,850
 Pardon? 

691
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:55,910
 You need to break it like this. 

692
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:59,580
 Give me a few men, Father. 

693
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:02,190
 Are you saying it was not you? 

694
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:04,840
 Please let go of this. 

695
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:12,940
 If something happens to Hong Deok Su while I am gone, 

696
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,350
 please protect him on my behalf. 

697
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,570
 Hong Deok Su.
