1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
   

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,210
   

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,100
   

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,120


5
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,820
A long time ago, you told me

6
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,900
to switch to a game you are better at if you want to win.

7
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,070
I finally realized...

8
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,910
what that meant today.

9
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,630
Jae On...

10
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,590
Do not call my name with your dirty mouth.

11
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,530
That is enough now.

12
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,640
No matter what you do, the more you try, the more dangerous it will be for you.

13
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,960
It is not too late to go far away from Yongcheonru.

14
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,640
Go far away?

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,970
I have finally come to face you like this, and you want me to go far away?

16
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,170
It...

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,630
It was so hard for me to get here.

18
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,980
I cannot go until I kill you.

19
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,960
You killed my father.

20
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,650
You should also die and atone.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,550
Do you think I killed Teacher?

22
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,660
Do not play ignorant.

23
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,040
I saw everything.

24
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,570
I never forgot, even for a day.

25
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,660
I know how you killed...

26
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,310
my father that night... twelve years ago.

27
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,540
 How could you do that? 

28
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,680
You were closer than family to us. How could you?

29
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,860
I have been clenching my teeth for twelve years

30
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,260
waiting to repay you for what you did.

31
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,730
No. No, Jae On.

32
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,580
That is not true.

33
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,100
- Let me explain— 
 - Do not blabber your dirty mouth.

34
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,700
Do you think my father's blood on your sword will disappear that way?

35
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,320
I...

36
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,050
did not kill Teacher.

37
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,250
How dare you call him your teacher?

38
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,250
You backstabber.

39
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:32,170
I have never betrayed Teacher. Not even for a moment.

40
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,250
I have never brought shame to him

41
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,040
or abandoned my beliefs.

42
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
Beliefs?

43
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,310
You killed someone and took over as the Master Innkeeper. Is that your belief?

44
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,130
Hong Jae On, leave Yongcheonru.

45
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,420
That is how you will survive

46
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,950
and what Teacher wanted.

47
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
He asked me until the last moment.

48
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,300
He asked me to protect you.

49
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,370
You are lying.

50
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,790
Stop lying!

51
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,090
Why did you stop?

52
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,990
Stab me.

53
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,710
If you would be satisfied by stabbing me,

54
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,380
if this is the revenge you have dreamed of,

55
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,230
go on and stab me.

56
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,350
Why are you hesitating?

57
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,800
You said you dreamed of avenging your father for twelve years.

58
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,650
I am not the one you should take revenge on.

59
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,260
Do you think I would fall for that?

60
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,730
You will die if you jump in carelessly.

61
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,380
Shut up!

62
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,180
Your father only worried about you while dying.

63
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,510
Do not make his...

64
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,460
sacrifice go to waste.

65
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,350
 I noticed something unusual while investigating Cheon. 

66
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,020
 It is regarding the missing person's poster at the market recently. 

67
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,390
 Cheon had a business partner who died long ago. 

68
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,760
 He put up the posters to look for his daughter. 

69
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,090
 Why do you think he is looking for her? 

70
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,200
 I am not the one you should take revenge on. 

71
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,230
 You will die if you jump in carelessly. 

72
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:32,400
   

73
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:18,890
♫  The round moonlight has suddenly  ♫ 
 ♫  Turned into a crescent moon  ♫

74
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,690
♫  But your heart...  ♫

75
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,560
 Keep this thing with you. 

76
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,180
 You must never lose it. 

77
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,910
 Do you understand? 

78
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:35,350
♫  Left alone  ♫ 
 ♫  I draw you, then erase you  ♫

79
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,550
 Jae On, a jade ring does not guarantee happiness. 

80
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,550
 Just live happily, no matter what you find. 

81
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,590
♫  If you cannot come, then please call me instead  ♫

82
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:51,700
♫  And if you tell me your wish  ♫

83
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,620
♫  I'll fly, fluttering  ♫

84
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,560
♫  Following this longing to where you sleep  ♫

85
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,450
♫  Under the same sky, no matter where  ♫

86
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:14,550
♫  I'll go  ♫ 
 ♫  Like the wind, I'll soar  ♫

87
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,160
What?

88
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,040
Prince Mu Yeong was not even in Onyang?

89
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,360
Are you sure about that?

90
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,500
Yes, Your Excellency.

91
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,850
I knew... the King's intention was something else.

92
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,770
Do you think I would leave things that way?

93
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,660
Does he think I would hand over the throne when I am so close?

94
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,320
He certainly sees me as a pushover.

95
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,570
 Your Excellency! 

96
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,430
Someone from Yongcheonru came by with urgent news for you.

97
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,770
Who? Is it Seol Mae Hwa?

98
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,930
No, it is not.

99
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,110
He apparently is an innkeeper.

100
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,250
Innkeeper?

101
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,920
He wants to talk to me directly?

102
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,430
Yes.

103
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,270
Tell him to come in.

104
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,600
Your Excellency.

105
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,400
Who are you?

106
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,610
That is enough.

107
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,400
You are handsome. You are handsome.

108
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,390
Today is finally the day.

109
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,350
I know. Hong Deok Su really is an impressive fellow.

110
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,490
He ended up doing it.

111
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,360
Jun Hwa, you helped greatly.

112
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,240
Both Lee Eun Ho and I were against it in the beginning.

113
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,480
That is also true.

114
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,440
But there was a reason I had to do it.

115
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,630
So? When will you confess?

116
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,850
C-Confess?

117
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,040
Hong Deok Su told me she is actually a woman,

118
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,800
but she does not know that you know it.

119
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,570
Should you not tell her you know before you make a mistake?

120
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,210
Oh, that confession? I see.

121
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,210
Should I?

122
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,250
She tries hard to pretend to be a man in front of you.

123
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,750
If she finds out later that you already know,

124
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,150
things would become awkward between you two.

125
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,150
That is right. I should tell her first.

126
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,670
Yes, tell her before it is too late.

127
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,540
   

128
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,930
Hey, it sure is a well-made sign.

129
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,370
Were you all here yesterday?

130
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,020
Did you put this back on?

131
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,570
What is this?

132
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,280
I am sure it was not there yesterday.

133
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,160
- What is that mark? 
 - Did something happen yesterday?

134
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,460
No, nothing happened.

135
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,490
Did you not sleep last night?

136
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,810
Your eyes look a bit puffy.

137
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,110
Did you catch a cold?

138
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,390
Did you get rained on yesterday or something?

139
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,710
Look at yourself. Your face appears puffy.

140
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,800
It is...

141
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,390
because I am nervous about Bulrakho's opening soon.

142
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,920
Lee Eun Ho, what happened to your hand?

143
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,020
What are you doing?

144
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,210
Bulrakho is opening soon. You cannot hurt your hand.

145
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,190
Was it badly hurt?

146
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,840
You only care about Bulrakho.

147
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,940
Was I too harsh?

148
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,160
Let us go.

149
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,000
   

150
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,450
Seol Mae Hwa, do you not have anything to tell me?

151
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,000
I am not sure.

152
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,590
Really?

153
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:38,320
I heard something major is happening at Yongcheonru today.

154
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,230
Do you not know?

155
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,260
I am not sure what you heard, but I will look into it if you want me to.

156
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,560
How could you not tell me Yongcheonru is opening a gambling house?

157
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,130
Were you going to play ignorant until the end?

158
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,590
How dare you open a gambling house?

159
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,990
It is against the law.

160
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,710
Cheon must be up to something, right?

161
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,190
I can smell something. Something very suspicious.

162
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,050
We are all ready.

163
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,790
Let us open.

164
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,840
It is a high-class gambling house in the capital.

165
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,050
You will have to ambush as quickly and quietly as possible.

166
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,380
Yes. Let us go.

167
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,050
- Let us go. 
 - Twenty-one.

168
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,880
Congratulations.

169
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,770
That is it.

170
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,340
Go inside and look everywhere!

171
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,980
 Yes, sir. 

172
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,890
This is amazing.

173
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,010
 - Go inside! 
 - Yes, sir! 

174
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,770
Stop! Stop!

175
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,560
 Stop! 

176
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,570
 - Stop! 
 - Stop! 

177
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,750
Arrest all the criminals who broke the law!

178
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,420
 What shall we do if the Investigation Bureau comes for a search? 

179
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,230
 Just practice. Do not worry about such matters. 

180
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,800
 What makes you so confident, exactly? 

181
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,670
 Goodness... 

182
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,990
 Because we will not break the law. 

183
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,350
 Did Master Cheon know, too? 

184
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,740
I am sorry, but you are not allowed in here.

185
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,990
Wait, you are...

186
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,320
What is going on?

187
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,860
Are they from the Investigation Bureau?

188
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,900
This is not an official event. Go back.

189
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,820
Please proceed and continue the game.

190
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,230
My apologies.

191
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,690
Go, go. Get started.

192
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,290
Start again.

193
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,580
Let me help you, Your Excellency.

194
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,690
 Please do not... 

195
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,910
 come to Yongcheonru tonight. 

196
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,910
 What? 

197
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,040
 Did I ever suggest something harmful to you, Your Excellency? 

198
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,130
 It is not the time now. Please listen to me. 

199
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,000
Seol Mae Hwa, did you—

200
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,650
Goodness!

201
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,430
It is so noisy that I cannot choose my card!

202
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,410
My apologies!

203
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,000
Sorry, I am late. The Investigation Bureau must be mistaken.

204
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,930
Things were just becoming enjoyable.

205
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,730
- Make them leave quickly. 
 - Yes.

206
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,820
What is he saying?

207
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,830
Please leave now.

208
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,380
He is an ambassador from the Qing dynasty.

209
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,430
What? An ambassador?

210
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,330
Please enjoy yourselves.

211
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,670
He is an ambassador from the Qing dynasty?

212
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,730
Yes, that is correct.

213
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,340
No natives are allowed in here.

214
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,620
The Qing dynasty's ambassador is in Hanyang?

215
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,600
How do you know about matters that the ministers are unaware of?

216
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,320
Did His Majesty order you to do this?

217
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,480
How could I know what the higher-ups think?

218
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:46,540
I will keep my mouth shut about the fact that

219
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,820
you rushed over here.

220
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,970
Did I tell you Jun Hwa shares his name with someone?

221
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,290
There is someone who shares the name that attracts fortune.

222
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:26,840
I looked for that lost name all my life for my immature Jun Hwa.

223
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,140
I am starting to think...

224
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:36,300
he might have found someone else instead.

225
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,030
It is because Young Master Jun Hwa is blessed with good people.

226
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,480
I was after Prince Mu Yeong,

227
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,450
but I amazingly caught someone superior.

228
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,230
My son's fortune is a frightening one.

229
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,450
It certainly is frightening.

230
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,030
Good, good.

231
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,850
I will wash my hands quickly.

232
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,560
What should we do, Your Excellency?

233
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,090
I will make them pay for humiliating me.

234
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,590
Take the soldiers back.

235
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,970
Yes, sir.

236
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,440
Let us go.

237
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,020
Things must not have gone the way you wanted with the Minister of Defense.

238
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:22,820
Are you happy that things went your way?

239
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,780
Do you still think...

240
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,450
I am reckless?

241
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,500
How is it that you two are together?

242
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,040
Hong Deok Su,

243
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,680
you did a great job.

244
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,170
I will allow your reinstatement as promised.

245
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,750
Thank you, Master Cheon.

246
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,390
You agree as well, right, Master Innkeeper?

247
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,930
I would like you to train him well.

248
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,220
He is so talented. It would have been a shame to lose him.

249
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,080
I will do so.

250
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,130
Are the guests all right?

251
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,640
I was wondering what kind of flies would be attracted to Bulrakho.

252
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,620
I did not expect the Minister of Defense to come on the first day.

253
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,290
Let us go.

254
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,850
Yes.

255
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,630
I do not know who the rat was,

256
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,170
but it certainly was quick.

257
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,890
- Hong Deok Su. 
 - Yes?

258
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,080
When you are running a business,

259
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:10,130
you must beware of mice that put holes in your house's storage.

260
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,560
Do you understand?

261
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,070
Yes.

262
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,900
 You killed my father. 

263
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,700
 You should also die and atone. 

264
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,710
 Teacher! 

265
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,490
 Please get up. 

266
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,790
 You need to run away. 

267
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,240
 Hong Min Shik. 

268
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,260
 You should live. 

269
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,090
 Live and see the world we have dreamed of. 

270
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,050
 Teacher, why... 

271
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,490
 Someday, 

272
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,140
 if my Jae On comes to see you, 

273
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,560
 you should care for her. 

274
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,190
 My Jae On is in your care. 

275
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,500
 Please let go. 

276
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,360
 Please let go! 

277
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,280
 Try going that way. 

278
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,960
 That way! 

279
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,880
 Jae On. 

280
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,700
 Stop lying! 

281
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,170
 My Jae On is in your care. 

282
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,180
I knew you could be reinstated quickly.

283
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,120
Yes, the true man, Hong Deok Su...

284
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,120
came back in no time.

285
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,000
What are you doing? What...

286
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,080
Goodness, what is with you?

287
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,430
Goodness, seriously.

288
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,040
- Hold on! 
 - You scared me.

289
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,760
You need to dust your feet before entering.

290
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,080
All right. Here, here.

291
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,180
I dusted them off. Are you happy?

292
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,090
Dust off your clothes, too. Behave yourself, Hong Deok Su.

293
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:53,370
Are you possessed by a ghost that demands cleanliness? Why are you nagging?

294
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,290
He has been sneezing since earlier.

295
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,340
He must be sensitive because he caught a cold.

296
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,490
No.

297
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,120
Lee Eun Ho,

298
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,250
something is bothering you, right?

299
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:14,130
Hong Deok Su, I share a room with someone who is unclean like you. How could I be happy?

300
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,430
Lee Eun Ho, do you want to switch rooms with me, then?

301
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,710
Being excessively concerned with cleanliness is no good, either. Go inside now.

302
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,580
W-What is wrong with you? How bad is your cold?

303
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,580
- Let us go, too. 
 - I am happy to switch rooms anytime.

304
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,520
Just ask me.

305
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,030
You are not switching any rooms.

306
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,050
Welcome back, true man, Hong Deok Su.

307
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,660
Yes. I told you I would be back soon.

308
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,850
Yes. Do not blame me for what is in the past.

309
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,340
Rules are still rules.

310
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,300
- Of course, Instructor Bang. 
 - You went through a lot.

311
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,240
And Lee Eun Ho, you should return the hammer you borrowed.

312
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,970
Why make me come to get it back?

313
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,750
I am not feeling well.

314
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,350
Bring it back quickly.

315
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,750
Lee Eun Ho,

316
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,260
are you sleeping?

317
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,000
I am.

318
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,990
What if...

319
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,120
you have been running all your might

320
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,230
but ended up on the wrong path?

321
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,230
Are you talking about Bulrakho?

322
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,810
You worked hard on it. Do you regret it?

323
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,680
It is not that.

324
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,730
If you get to the end, you will find out

325
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,060
if you chose the wrong path or not.

326
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,950
What if I got to the end

327
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,950
and it was the wrong path?

328
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,860
You can go back and correct things.

329
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,260
That is what I will do.

330
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,400
You put the sign back up, did you not?

331
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,800
I just put it back up because it had fallen.

332
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,530
You nagged and yelled at me so much earlier.

333
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,160
Thank you.

334
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,570
Did you cry because the sign fell?

335
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,870
W-Who? Who cried?

336
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,160
It is all right to cry.

337
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,700
I said I did not cry. Goodness...

338
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,300
When I was little,

339
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,330
I could not cry because I had to be cautious.

340
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,030
But when I wanted to cry later,

341
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,100
I could not cry anymore.

342
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,380
It is all right to cry here.

343
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,650
Anyone could use...

344
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,790
a place like that.

345
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,870
Sleep soundly tonight.

346
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,160
What kind of man has such a pale face?

347
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,670
He looks like a painting.

348
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,570
 My goodness, my goodness. 

349
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:57,430
I did not think the Qing dynasty's ambassador would come.

350
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:00,700
Hey, Hong Deok Su is truly remarkable.

351
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,900
Hey, hey. I have chosen him as mine.

352
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,650
Do not try to steal him.

353
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,360
Master Cheon seems to be interested in him, too.

354
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,970
Yes, I heard he is having lunch with them today.

355
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:18,710
Anyway, does it not seem Master Innkeeper is falling out of favor?

356
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:25,670
This is the first time she did not attend the lunch with Master Cheon.

357
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,670
No.

358
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,930
Maybe she was not invited at all.

359
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,240
My goodness!

360
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,350
 This is Seong Jin. 

361
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,690
The Master Innkeeper asked for the Geumokdang hosting plan.

362
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,800
Did I not give it to her?

363
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,210
Here it is.

364
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,000
My goodness, my goodness. What shall we do?

365
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,650
What if he heard everything we said?

366
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,700
"We"? You were the only one talking.

367
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,920
Stop saying silly things.

368
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,780
What will you do if the words spread?

369
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,900
I heard the Bottom-Tier Room excelled in Gyohwadang this year.

370
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,890
Good job opening Bulrakho as well.

371
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:39,420
This meal is for you. Eat as much as you would like.

372
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,140
 Yes, sir. 

373
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:48,860
I heard you were against opening Bulrakho at first.

374
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,970
Yongcheonru would be in danger if we broke the law.

375
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,430
I cannot believe you are worried about Yongcheonru.

376
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:01,380
You have become a true innkeeper.

377
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,520
Your father would be truly happy.

378
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,890
I have learned a lot ever since I came to Yongcheonru.

379
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:20,480
I have learned how to distinguish between real and fake,

380
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,710
in either an object or a person.

381
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,410
Is that so?

382
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:34,160
How do you distinguish between real and fake?

383
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,280
How do you do that?

384
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,400
It is fake if it copies what is real.

385
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,540
What is the reason you made Yongcheonru just like the palace?

386
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,850
Do you want to be the King?

387
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,290
Hey.

388
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:12,810
All right...

389
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:21,810
By the way, how did you know Master Innkeeper was good at Ssangpae?

390
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:30,810
She told me once when I played the game with a Jakyakjae guest.

391
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:42,130
Was Master Innkeeper Seol around since Yongcheonru first started?

392
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:48,820
Well, you could say that.

393
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,920
How did she end up in her current position?

394
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:01,230
You are very interested in the Master Innkeeper.

395
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:06,290
Yes. My dream is to become one someday.

396
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,140
We might be from the Bottom-Tier Room,

397
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,870
but we are ambitious, Master Cheon.

398
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,260
You are so magnanimous, like a real man.

399
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,140
But you are as pretty as a woman.

400
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,760
Hong Deok Su, is your mother your only family?

401
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,470
Yes, my father passed when I was a child.

402
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,650
Is that why the fortune got mixed up?

403
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:11,140
Anyway, the more I look at your forehead, the more familiar it seems.

404
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,970
And the mouth, too.

405
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:29,740
You told us to eat comfortably, but you keep talking. We will not be able to digest.

406
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:35,020
Oh, right. I talked too much since I have not done this in a while.

407
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:40,710
Hong Deok Su, bring your mother to Yongcheonru sometime.

408
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:46,260
She must be a great mother since she raised her son so well.

409
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,920
I would love to meet her.

410
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,520
Yes, I will.

411
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,620
Tasty.

412
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,790
Have I upset you somehow, Your Majesty?

413
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:25,660
Why are you saying that as soon as you arrived?

414
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:30,730
I have been only loyal to you for the last twelve years.

415
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,710
I am so deeply disappointed.

416
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,930
Speak so I understand what you mean.

417
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:44,390
Do you know what I saw at Yongcheonru yesterday?

418
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:49,480
The Qing dynasty's ambassador came here secretly?

419
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,190
How could you do that without telling me anything?

420
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:57,430
It was an unofficial visit.

421
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,370
How did you see him?

422
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:04,820
By chance, did you get caught

423
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,680
trying to do something with that lowly Cheon?

424
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,990
Minister, watch what you say.

425
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:14,660
The ambassador visited for Prince Seon Yang's birthday celebration.

426
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,040
Pardon?

427
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,680
To prepare for the upcoming proclamation ceremony,

428
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,990
I wanted to introduce Prince Seon Yang to him.

429
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:24,360
And you could not wait to run to the palace?

430
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,480
Wait... t-the thing is, I...

431
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,670
You should have told me about it.

432
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,950
I am Prince Seon Yang's maternal grandfather.

433
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,690
Why would you hide that from me—

434
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:44,870
Prince Seon Yang is my son first and your grandson second.

435
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,100
What is this?

436
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:19,770
Cheon is looking for his late business partner's daughter.

437
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:24,050
I thought he had quit a few years ago, but he seems to be looking again.

438
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:33,780
That will not bring the dead back to life.

439
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,790
Just leave him be.

440
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:43,360
Your Majesty, Cheon has grown exceedingly powerful.

441
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,660
What else can I do?

442
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,450
Years of famine have lasted.

443
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,600
It is difficult to run the country without his money.

444
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,360
If you allow me,

445
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,390
I will teach him the authority of the royal family and the power

446
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:05,280
of government officials clearly, Your Majesty.

447
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,160
When we ate in front of Master Cheon,

448
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,600
I could not tell if the food was going into my mouth or nose.

449
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,150
Eat slowly. You will get indigestion.

450
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:38,970
It is all right. My stomach is bigger than you think.

451
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,150
By the way, Hong Deok Su,

452
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,100
when is your mother coming?

453
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,670
She will probably come as soon as she hears about it.

454
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,610
Should we all say hello to her?

455
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,110
Yes, that sounds good.

456
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,850
Lee Eun Ho, why are you not eating?

457
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,350
He was sick yesterday.

458
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,290
Did your temperature go down?

459
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,970
I was not sick at all.

460
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,400
- Hong Deok Su. 
 - Yes?

461
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,200
I need to tell you something. Please set some time aside.

462
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,460
What is it? Tell me now.

463
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,000
Later.

464
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,640
I need to tell you privately.

465
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,670
All right, then.

466
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,940
I will get going now.

467
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,600
I am done, too. Let me come with you.

468
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,710
 Hey, hey! Stay seated. 

469
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,890
 What is with you? 

470
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:26,940
Lee Eun Ho,

471
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:31,710
I would like to consult you on something.

472
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,680
What? A love confession?

473
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,870
Be quiet. People can hear you.

474
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:48,090
Are you out of your mind?

475
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,800
What love confession?

476
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,760
You cannot do it.

477
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,160
There is a woman I like.

478
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:59,520
I fell for her at first sight.

479
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,590
You fell for a woman...

480
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,600
at first sight?

481
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,720
I have never felt this way in my life.

482
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,960
Jun Hwa, you said...

483
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,930
so...

484
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,770
you are in love with a woman, right?

485
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,820
Hey, stop that!

486
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,830
You are embarrassing me.

487
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,020
Is that so?

488
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,310
A woman?

489
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,940
Lee Eun Ho,

490
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:36,130
please help me figure out how to tell her.

491
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,870
You came to the right place.

492
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:43,930
I am essentially an expert in that field.

493
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,440
I am glad to hear that.

494
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:52,950
To confess love to a woman,

495
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,160
you need to speak smoothly.

496
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,240
You need to compliment her with sweet words first.

497
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,900
How?

498
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,510
Listen.

499
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,690
If being beautiful was a sin,

500
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,950
three generations of your family will have to be executed.

501
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,800
- What? 
 - Repeat after me.

502
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,350
"If being beautiful was a sin..."

503
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:42,080
This really works?

504
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,560
- Have you ever courted a woman? 
 - Of course.

505
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,820
You would be shocked to see how many women I have back in my house.

506
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,560
Do you not believe me?

507
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,270
I mean...

508
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,620
How about...

509
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,470
a more detailed advice?

510
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:12,000
Describe the woman to me first.

511
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:25,450
When we first met, she scammed me.

512
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,260
Scam?

513
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,370
 I am Hong Deok Su. Five tenths. 

514
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:34,170
The first encounter was rather harsh.

515
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:37,650
Although it was not easy afterward, either.

516
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,480
More than anything,

517
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,820
her smile was definitely the loveliest part.

518
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,450
 Look at this! 

519
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,570
I like your smile.

520
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,230
Please keep smiling like that...

521
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,400
and stay by my side.

522
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,270
I like that.

523
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:53,500
What? What did you say?

524
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,750
Thank you, Lee Eun Ho.

525
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:58,740
I will treat you properly if my confession goes well.

526
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,480
Thank you.

527
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,130
Why did I think of that Hong Deok Su rogue?

528
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,840
Wake up, Lee Eun.

529
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,620
He is nothing but the golden key.

530
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,070
Why are you waving your hand?

531
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:47,060
Is it dusty?

532
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:49,610
I dusted myself off before coming in.

533
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:52,970
Where are you going?

534
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:58,020
My family is coming today. We are staying in Geumokdang together.

535
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,920
Lee Eun Ho. Hey.

536
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,790
What? Yes.

537
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,970
Why are you zoning out?

538
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,840
Are you still sick?

539
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,090
Why do you keep...

540
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,170
No, you can go.

541
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,310
I am leaving now.

542
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,590
No.

543
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,450
This is not right.

544
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:59,200
Goodness...

545
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,110
Are you feeling ill?

546
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,240
You do not look well at all.

547
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,000
My chest feels a bit stuffy.

548
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,960
Are you having indigestion?

549
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,380
I have a medicine that works well.

550
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:21,090
Sharing delicious food helps you digest.

551
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:24,150
You ate all the soup alone last time, too.

552
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:26,770
It haunts me that I never got to try Hong Deok Su's mother's soup.

553
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:29,530
Do not even bring him up!

554
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:32,260
Did he do something?

555
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,040
Let me teach him a thing or two—

556
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,710
I told you to stop, did I not?

557
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,740
You really do not listen.

558
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:43,300
Follow me.

559
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,820
Hey. Even the King would live here.

560
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,330
I know!

561
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,020
Mother, how is the air up there?

562
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,900
I am dizzy.

563
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,620
Be careful. Be careful.

564
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:07,490
This is Yongcheonru, which I have only heard about.

565
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,820
It is incredibly flashy.

566
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,310
Hey, when is Deok Su coming?

567
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:16,740
I will go get him.

568
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,650
You should wait inside.

569
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,890
Hey, hey. You cannot just walk around here.

570
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:24,270
I want to check things out.

571
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,010
Yes, yes.

572
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:35,600
Goodness...

573
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,780
This way.

574
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:21,810
This is the late Hong Min Shik's residence?

575
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,220
Yes.

576
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:10,990
He lived here with his only daughter.

577
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,150
   

578
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:33,890
What happened twelve years ago?

579
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,260
Cheon's business partner, Hong Min Shik, died

580
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,100
and his daughter went missing?

581
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:49,540
He created a poster to look for her. There must be a reason.

582
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,810
Cheon is looking for the other half of the golden key he lost.

583
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:55,970
Not the late business partner's daughter.

584
01:07:55,970 --> 01:08:00,030
He must be looking for the other half of the key she disappeared with.

585
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:04,500
If so, what is the golden key Hong Deok Su has?

586
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,850
 My late father willed it to me. 

587
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:19,590
 It is the only thing he left behind in this world. 

588
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:25,050
He only had one daughter?

589
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,680
   

590
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,530
Hong Jae On.

591
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:43,500
Hong Deok Su.

592
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,680
 Hong Deok Su. 

593
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,940
Hey.

594
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:53,310
I would like to talk to you.

595
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:55,080
Right now?

596
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,980
I need to go in now.

597
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,900
It will only take a moment.

598
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,130
Good.

599
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,310
I did not notice while I was working,

600
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:12,810
but it looks so pretty looking at it like this now.

601
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:26,060
What did you want to tell me?

602
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:32,830
I... I need to make a confession to you.

603
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:34,490
Confession?

604
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,330
Did you do something you are sorry for?

605
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:41,660
Confession, my foot.

606
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,470
I forgive you for everything.

607
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,240
So...

608
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:51,760
 If being beautiful was a sin, 

609
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,440
 three generations of your family will have to be executed. 

610
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,630
Hong Deok Su, three generations of your family will be executed.

611
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:59,050
What?

612
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,510
Well, the thing is...

613
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:05,120
 I like your smile. 

614
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,240
 Please keep smiling like that and stay by my side. 

615
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,200
Your smile...

616
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:14,050
It will get three generations of your family killed.

617
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,000
That is not it.

618
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,670
Did you eat something funny?

619
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:31,640
Are you sick, too?

620
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:38,030
Do you... Do you have a fever?

621
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,830
Hong Deok Su,

622
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:51,370
would you go to the Summer Palace with me this summer?

623
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:54,470
The Summer Palace?

624
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,140
Later, I mean.

625
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,290
I would like to go to the Summer Palace with you someday.

626
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,340
Would you come with me?

627
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,820
 There is a woman I like. 

628
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,460
 I fell for her at first sight. 

629
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,930
 More than anything, 

630
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:52,280
 her smile was definitely the loveliest part. 

631
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,440
Hong Deok Su...

632
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:03,230
is a woman?

633
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:19,150
   

634
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:30,230


635
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:43,360
♫  The round moonlight has suddenly  ♫

636
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,990
 I heard you were looking for some woman. 

637
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,960
 Should I look into her for you? 

638
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,170
 It is none of your business. 

639
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:53,160
 You are old enough to wed. You must be interested in women now. 

640
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:58,130
 Hong Deok Su, you should live as a woman now. 

641
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:03,700
 Does love make your heart pound and feel tingly? 

642
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,270
 You scared me! 

643
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,950
 I came to ask you something. 

644
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:08,530
 By chance, are you... 

645
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:11,820
 I am Hong Deok Su's best friend at Yongcheonru. 

646
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,750
 You need to trust only me. 

647
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:16,070
 Do not be silly, Cheon Jun Hwa. 

648
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,840
 You need to go far away from Yongcheonru immediately. 

649
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,550
 It is not too late to leave with Hong Deok Su, 

650
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,990
 Prince Mu Yeong. 

651
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:29,250
 Why are you... 

652
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:31,190
 Deok Su! Deok Su! 

653
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:34,180
 Are you Hong Deok Su's mother? 

654
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,110
 What a cheeky bastard. 

655
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:40,510
 So it was you.
