00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:03,461
Hi

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:04,838
Hello

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,052
In 3 seconds

4
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,552
It's enough to guess

5
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:13,472
What kind of person someone is

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,849
So you're also a freshman at Korea University?

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,807
We're friends

8
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:19,894
I'm from ME, Mechanical Engineering

9
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,856
I'm in Business Administration

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,402
Hey, help me with this

11
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,364
I almost dislocated my shoulder

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,786
I thought in 3 seconds

13
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:39,289
That Kang Minha and I are incompatible

14
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:42,668
Did the landlady tell you the rules?

15
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,586
I think so

16
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:50,175
Curfew is at 12 and men are not allowed in

17
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,469
Woo Yeon, just speak casually

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:54,679
Huh?

19
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:57,224
Okay

20
00:00:58,474 --> 00:00:59,518
You can bring friends over

21
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,519
But they can't stay overnight

22
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,690
The landlady doesn't check every day, right?

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,315
No

24
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:07,567
She doesn't come often

25
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,112
That's good then

26
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,786
And smoking is prohibited

27
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,414
E-cigarettes aren't allowed either

28
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,708
Then where can I smoke?

29
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,208
Out in the alley

30
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,628
Ugh, that's so annoying

31
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,753
Right

32
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:29,463
I heard there's a men's sharehouse here too?

33
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:30,173
Where?

34
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,717
Probably the next building?

35
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:32,925
Really?

36
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:33,677
Who lives there?

37
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,594
Are they good-looking?

38
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,764
I don't know, I've never seen them

39
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,559
I should try to get to know them

40
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,813
I said no smoking!

41
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,065
But this doesn't have nicotine

42
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:49,192
This one is fine

43
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,197
Fine

44
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:56,324
Sorry, sorry

45
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,284
I won't do it

46
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,952
What's this...

47
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,498
It's hot in here

48
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,043
Hey!

49
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,501
No, don't take off your clothes like that...

50
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,545
It's hot in here

51
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,260
Uninhibited behavior even with strangers

52
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:25,978
What are you doing?

53
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,400
Hey, at least knock!

54
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,693
What?

55
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,027
Were you watching something weird?

56
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,780
No, it's not that

57
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,405
When you enter someone else's room, obviously...

58
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,407
If you have something good, let's watch together

59
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:39,284
What are you saying?

60
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,621
Entering rooms without permission

61
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,458
I prefer novels to videos

62
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,668
I like slightly rough types

63
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,711
Or completely opposite, pure love stories

64
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:51,922
Any recommendations?

65
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,005
No thanks

66
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,257
Get out, I'm studying

67
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,012
Talking about embarrassing things so casually

68
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,389
Hey, what's a freshman studying for?

69
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,601
Don't you have a lot of engineering assignments?

70
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,228
You won't die if you postpone them a bit

71
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,063
Today's my first day, won't you throw me a welcome party?

72
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:12,067
I'm busy today

73
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,777
I have soju, beer, highball, wine, everything

74
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,778
What do you want to drink?

75
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,208
Oh right

76
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,793
Do you have a boyfriend?

77
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:32,963
No...

78
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:34,673
What about you?

79
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,842
I broke up last week

80
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,885
When did you break up?

81
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,682
Don't tell me...

82
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,934
Are you a relationship virgin?

83
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,605
I'm not a relationship virgin!

84
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,608
I think you must be popular

85
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,820
You're cute too

86
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,739
Stop it

87
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,492
So

88
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,494
What's your ideal type?

89
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:12,210
Someone kind and cute?

90
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,798
Cheers, cheers

91
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,385
For Lee Woo Yeon's escape from singledom!

92
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,344
Ah...

93
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,057
Even your alcohol tolerance

94
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,728
Is completely opposite to mine

95
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,521
And besides

96
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,273
That attitude of yours bothers me

97
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,034
Hey, this cereal is delicious

98
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,577
Can you make me a bowl too?

99
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,369
No

100
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,704
I can't eat anything

101
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,708
I'm dying from this hangover

102
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,251
There's Gatorade in the fridge

103
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,338
Drinking Gatorade will help with your hangover

104
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,632
Hey, I'm leaving first!

105
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,673
I have a first-period class

106
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:09,516
This is mine

107
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,108
Why don't you clean up after yourself?

108
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:28,369
Hey!

109
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,414
I told you the bathroom door is broken!

110
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,748
Sorry, sorry

111
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,958
What's the big deal?

112
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,960
We're all girls

113
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,005
Oh~

114
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,465
Yours are pretty big?

115
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,385
What are you saying?

116
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,764
You're really not my style

117
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,097
Ah...

118
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:26,737
Kang Minha

119
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,782
Kang Minha

120
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,492
Mmm...

121
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,619
Go to bed

122
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,333
Oh, sorry...

123
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,085
Did I wake you up?

124
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,119
It's 3 AM now

125
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,247
I told you curfew is at 12

126
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,502
I might be a little late sometimes

127
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,421
Follow the rules

128
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,966
And do the dishes on time

129
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,842
Ah! Don't eat my food

130
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,051
Why don't you ever bring in the laundry?

131
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:32,052
Do I have to bring it in?

132
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,596
And I'm always the one organizing the shoes

133
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:35,597
Did you know that?

134
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,600
Living with you is really hard

135
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,563
If there are so many things that bother you

136
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,148
Why didn't you say something earlier?

137
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,108
I thought we were living without worrying about what's yours or mine

138
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,609
I thought you liked it that way too

139
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,735
I don't eat apples

140
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,613
I bought them because I saw you eating them

141
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,989
Do I have to say everything out loud?

142
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,615
How am I supposed to know if you don't say it?

143
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,284
You think I've been living comfortably?

144
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,244
I've been really conscious of you too

145
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,373
Alright

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,083
Let's stop

147
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,252
Since we're talking, let's clear everything up
