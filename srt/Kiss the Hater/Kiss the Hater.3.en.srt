1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,128
Woo Yeon!

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,298
Are you angry?

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,302
I'm sorry

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,804
I thought a kiss would be okay

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:16,807
It's just a game...

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,518
Just

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,561
It was just a light kiss

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,565
I don't even understand why I got angry

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,568
Did we go too far?

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,277
I'm sorry

11
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,070
After we clean up this place a bit

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,905
Just you and me

13
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,405
Let's go home and have another drink

14
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:31,989
Yeah?

15
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,074
Deal?

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,710
This is a bit embarrassing

17
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:50,175
I ruined the mood because of me

18
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,550
No, it's not like that

19
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:53,387
The others are drunk anyway

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,097
We needed to wrap up the gathering anyway

21
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,394
Um...

22
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,853
This is my first time playing

23
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:05,273
These kinds of games

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,027
The others also said they're sorry

25
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,862
It's not your fault

26
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:13,114
Don't worry about it

27
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,117
I envy you

28
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,918
I thought when I became a college student, I'd make lots of friends

29
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,005
And have a lot of fun

30
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,134
But I still seem to be a boring person

31
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,222
I want to be like you

32
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:40,599
But it seems that doesn't suit me

33
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,271
I...

34
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,188
I think you're really fun

35
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,860
Huh?

36
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,655
The older girls, guys, school seniors

37
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:56,742
More than hanging out with them

38
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,286
I have the most fun with you

39
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,835
So

40
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,922
Don't try to change yourself forcefully

41
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,632
These days I...

42
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,010
I don't understand myself

43
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,101
You're here?

44
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,811
Working out?

45
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:26,605
Yeah

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,356
Just finished running

47
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,985
You run and then do home workouts too?

48
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,570
I have to exercise if I'm going to drink

49
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,492
How is it?

50
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:41,952
Don't you think my hips look better?

51
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,958
I keep feeling jealous of you

52
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,376
Childishly

53
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,887
[It's Yoonsu who hung out with you yesterday!
Did you get home okay?]

54
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,813
My head feels like it's going to split open, seriously

55
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,065
Hey, let's go get some hangover food

56
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:12,818
I don't need hangover food though?

57
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,320
Weaklings

58
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,239
Woo Yeon!

59
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,197
Going to school?

60
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,199
Aren't you going today?

61
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,869
Yeah, one of my classes got canceled, so I'm going later

62
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:25,038
See you in a bit

63
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,498
I'm going

64
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:30,043
Come quickly

65
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,840
Why are you like this?

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,634
Why are you so weak?

67
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,969
Let's go together

68
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,179
I don't know if I'm jealous because I envy you

69
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,103
Minha

70
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,271
Hi!

71
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,856
Where are you going? Are your classes over?

72
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:51,731
Yeah, are yours over?

73
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,608
Yeah, mine are over too

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,152
Then let's have dinner before going home...

75
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,652
Hey! Kang Minha

76
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:58,697
Oh, you're here?

77
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,032
This is my housemate, Woo Yeon

78
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,657
You know her, right?

79
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,994
I've heard a lot about you

80
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,954
I'm Kim Jisoo, Minha's classmate

81
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,371
Hello, nice to meet you

82
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,831
It must be hard living

83
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,083
With Kang Minha

84
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,376
What are you saying?

85
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,628
We're going to get drinks, want to come?

86
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,503
Let's go together

87
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,840
No, no

88
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,007
I'm going home

89
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,342
Have fun

90
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,344
Okay, see you later

91
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,597
Senior Hyunsuk is coming too

92
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:24,931
What?

93
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,016
When I asked that oppa earlier

94
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,766
He said he was busy

95
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:30,519
He says he'll come right away when he heard Kang Minha was coming

96
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,273
In my opinion

97
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,108
I think that oppa likes you

98
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,862
Good luck~!

99
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:41,447
No thanks

100
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:43,074
That oppa is not my type

101
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,076
Or maybe...

102
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,369
I'm jealous of the people

103
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:49,206
Who like you...

104
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,208
I'm confused

105
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,143
Who keeps messaging you?

106
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,688
It's nothing important

107
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,570
Do you have plans today too?

108
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:24,365
Why?

109
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,409
Well, if you don't have plans

110
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,994
I wanted to hang out with you

111
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,496
Let's hang out

112
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,706
I do have plans, but I can cancel them

113
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:33,541
No, don't

114
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,335
Your plans are...

115
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,128
It's okay

116
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,922
I prefer spending time with you

117
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,550
Then let's go shopping

118
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,052
And eat something delicious?

119
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:04,572
Wait just 5 minutes, let's leave after that

120
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,826
Should I help you?

121
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,208
Close your eyes

122
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,134
Now open them

123
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,764
Okay, I'm done

124
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,728
Ah, I bought too much

125
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,103
I was only going to buy a little

126
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,648
No, everything suits you

127
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,650
Would you have regretted not buying it?

128
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,110
And that dress really looks good on you

129
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,528
Wear it tomorrow

130
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:45,237
Okay

131
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,702
Hello?

132
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,786
Yeah

133
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,831
The bar we went to last time

134
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,706
What?

135
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,876
Really?

136
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,668
Right in front?

137
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:00,670
Wait a second

138
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,880
Yoonsu says he's coming

139
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,757
Is that okay?

140
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,257
Ah...

141
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,092
Yes...

142
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,304
Yeah, she says it's okay

143
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,722
Okay

144
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,396
Hi

145
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:20,981
Hi

146
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,652
You look different today

147
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,572
What?

148
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:31,909
You look prettier

149
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,954
What's this, are you flirting?

150
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,335
What should I do?

151
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,922
I forgot I have an assignment due today

152
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,173
I think you two will have to eat without me

153
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:47,384
Really?

154
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,217
Yeah

155
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,344
Is that okay?

156
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,014
You two go and enjoy your meal

157
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,474
Oh my

158
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,934
Anyway, hurry up and go

159
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,195
Looks like we're done eating, should we leave?

160
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,197
Can't we stay a bit longer?

161
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,324
Is there something else you want to eat?

162
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,493
No, that's not it, just...

163
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,662
I want to spend more time with you

164
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,791
Actually, I asked Minha

165
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,876
To set this up

166
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,836
Huh?

167
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,131
I was interested in you

168
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,131
Didn't you know?

169
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,092
Yeah

170
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:32,636
Let's have just one more drink and go

171
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:33,512
Okay?

172
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,431
Excuse me

173
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,015
Can we have one more beer?

174
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,939
Did you get back okay?

175
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,149
How was it?

176
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,443
Did you have fun?

177
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,237
What did you eat?

178
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,572
What did you two talk about?

179
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,699
We didn't talk about anything special

180
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:59,413
But Yoonsu is tall

181
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,498
And he looks pretty good too

182
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,837
What do you think of Yoonsu?

183
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,422
I don't know

184
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,801
Why are you suddenly irritated?

185
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,095
Who asked you to set up a meeting with him?

186
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,514
Why do you do whatever you want

187
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,974
Without asking me?

188
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,685
If you disliked it so much, you could have left sooner

189
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:23,854
Why are you acting like this after having fun until late?

190
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,148
Today was a plan between you and me

191
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,940
To spend time together

192
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,569
That's why we went to the café and shopping

193
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:30,653
I don't understand why
