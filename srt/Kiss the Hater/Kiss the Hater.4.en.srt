1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,293
Today, you and I

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:03,878
We promised to hang out just the two of us, didn't we?

3
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:06,340
That's why we went to the cafe and went shopping too

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,840
I don't know if I

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,342
Did something so wrong

6
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,719
I said I wanted to be alone with you

7
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:23,523
Right?

8
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,608
So that's why you got so mad?

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,278
What? Why are you laughing?

10
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:31,489
Because you're cute

11
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:34,201
Whatever

12
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,414
There's someone who makes my heart flutter

13
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,963
What are you watching?

14
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,675
Just watching a movie

15
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,106
Usually with friends

16
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:08,110
I don't get excited

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,998
What a surprise!

18
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,416
Ta-da!

19
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,711
I'm hungry

20
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,795
Did you eat?

21
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,505
I haven't eaten yet

22
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:30,840
Want to eat together?

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,050
Yeah, sounds good

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,969
I keep liking you more

25
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:45,396
How long are you going to study?

26
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,610
All day until night

27
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:59,452
Then I'll order chicken just for myself?

28
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,088
Why?

29
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,925
Do I smell like cigarettes?

30
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,719
No

31
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,262
Really?

32
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,766
If I like you more

33
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:23,434
I don't think it'll be okay

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,362
[Kim Yunsu: Want to watch a movie tomorrow?]

35
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,490
Right

36
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,409
Let's go watch a movie together tomorrow

37
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,452
The one I said I wanted to see

38
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,579
I have plans

39
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,416
Oh

40
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,460
Really?

41
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,505
Can't be helped

42
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,264
[Woyeon: Yeah, see you tomorrow]

43
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,771
I decided to push you away

44
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,068
The movie was more interesting than I thought, right?

45
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,945
Yeah, I really didn't see that final twist coming

46
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm in a movie club

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,282
I should tell the people there about it

48
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:20,951
A movie club?

49
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,661
Where do you guys meet?

50
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:24,871
It's a university joint club...

51
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,831
Do you want to join too?

52
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,666
Yeah

53
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:35,548
Spend time with other people

54
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,342
And try to keep myself busy

55
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,179
Really?

56
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,764
So how did you handle it?

57
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,474
No, Sanghun and I

58
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,934
Thought there were burglars and grabbed a frying pan

59
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,936
I'm telling you, we made such a scene

60
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:50,813
Cheers

61
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:51,815
Cheers

62
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,403
Oh

63
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,114
You're drinking pretty well today?

64
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,824
Yeah, it's going down smooth today

65
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:05,244
Is it because I'm drinking with you?

66
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,255
[Minha: Did you enjoy the movie?]

67
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,224
I need to stay busy so I don't think about you

68
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,103
I think that way I can keep being your friend

69
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,865
Looks like you're having fun

70
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:47,996
Yeah

71
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,956
So

72
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,625
You're drinking with Lee Woyeon right now?

73
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,835
Hey, think it's gonna work out?

74
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:55,586
Damn

75
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,548
Hey, that's not a success yet

76
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,675
If you send me proof that you took Lee Woyeon to a motel

77
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,719
Then I'll send you the 30 bucks

78
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,387
Yeah

79
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,056
Damn, what are you talking about?

80
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,432
Hey, we bet 30 bucks!

81
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:09,893
Yeah

82
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,519
Alright, I'm hanging up

83
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,353
Yeah

84
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,070
What are you doing?

85
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,617
I think we should stop drinking now

86
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,663
Come on, you drink to get drunk

87
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,996
I'll take you home

88
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,123
Huh?

89
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:37,461
Ugh

90
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:42,967
It's all wet

91
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,802
Thanks

92
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,681
Should we go outside?

93
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:48,806
Huh?

94
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,351
To sober up a bit...

95
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,394
Let's rest somewhere nearby

96
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:54,896
Where?

97
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,523
I know a place

98
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:05,864
What?

99
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,574
Hey Kang Minha, are you crazy?

100
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,744
We're having a good time, why are you being such a jerk?!

101
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,996
Ah!

102
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,414
I know you guys made a bet about her

103
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,208
I know everything, you bastard

104
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:19,713
Let's go

105
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,548
Hey Kang Minha

106
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,465
Hey

107
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,012
Hey

108
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,014
Walk slower

109
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,682
Why are you so drunk?

110
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,019
Why are you getting angry?

111
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,856
Do you know how worried I was about you?

112
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,523
You almost got into serious trouble

113
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:40,608
That bastard!

114
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,375
As long as nothing bad happened, it's fine

115
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,759
Don't touch me

116
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,599
Don't look at me with those eyes

117
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,309
You're confusing people

118
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,440
Don't mess everything up

119
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,695
What do you mean?

120
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,614
I

121
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,413
Like you

122
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,048
Should we...

123
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,387
Stop being friends?
