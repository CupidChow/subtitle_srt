1
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,628
If so many things bother you

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:04,170
Why didn't you say something earlier?

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,173
I was just living without separating yours and mine

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,840
I thought you liked it that way too

5
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,760
I don't eat apples

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,677
I bought them because I saw you eating them

7
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,221
Do I really have to say that in words?

8
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,639
How am I supposed to know if you don't tell me?

9
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:16,516
You think I've been living comfortably?

10
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,601
I've been really mindful of you too

11
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,396
Alright

12
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:23,856
Let's stop

13
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,858
Since we're on the topic, let's talk it all out

14
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:34,992
Get up

15
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,423
Since we're on the topic, let's talk it all out

16
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,179
Whatever complaints you have about me

17
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,978
You...

18
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,146
I got curious

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,210
I bought this

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,672
Oh

21
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,550
The apples too

22
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,387
Thanks

23
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,478
I was thinking of ordering chicken later

24
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:45,646
Want to eat together?

25
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,485
Let's do that

26
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,784
Kang Minha is a tsundere type with no grudges

27
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,041
You watch documentaries like that

28
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,626
What's so interesting about that?

29
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,128
Weren't you watching with interest too?

30
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:10,505
No, I wasn't

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,673
What's so interesting about European history?

32
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,186
It's my turn now

33
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,728
I'm going to watch UFC

34
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,523
You like that kind of stuff?

35
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,735
Yeah, I'm a Holloway fan

36
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,318
You should watch it too

37
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,028
If you keep watching, it gets really interesting

38
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,206
Wow! It's a K.O.!

39
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,922
Hey, wait a second

40
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,255
What?

41
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,730
I'm going out for drinks

42
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,648
Want to come?

43
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,233
We have midterms next week

44
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,943
With my close club senior

45
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,903
Ah! And that Hyunseok from your department too

46
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,530
We agreed to drink together

47
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,949
Hyunseok?

48
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,449
You don't know him?

49
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,992
Tall with bleached hair

50
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,954
Let's go... yeah?

51
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:26,998
I need to study for the exam

52
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,333
Start tomorrow

53
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,085
No, I'm staying home

54
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:32,461
Tsk...

55
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,215
Let's go out together after the exams

56
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:37,467
Okay

57
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,304
Aren't you cold dressed like that?

58
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,893
You have to endure the cold to look pretty

59
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,394
Sis, I'm heading out

60
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:53,358
A popular person always surrounded by people

61
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,570
Pretty and well-dressed too

62
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,869
Do you have plans tonight?

63
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:05,829
No

64
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,289
Then let's drink with the guys

65
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,623
from the share house next door

66
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,041
You know them too?

67
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,043
Yeah, when I went to take out the recycling

68
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:14,670
I ran into them a few times

69
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,922
They say they're from Daehan Sports University

70
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,382
They're the same age as us

71
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,009
I was just chatting with them

72
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,135
If you come, there'll be four of us today

73
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,266
Didn't you say we'd hang out after exams?

74
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:26,932
Huh?

75
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:28,143
Alright

76
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,311
Great!

77
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,813
Then I'll let them know

78
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,110
Was today when grades come out?

79
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,027
Yes

80
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,280
Let me borrow your laptop for a moment

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,963
You're such a lucky girl

82
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,634
What?

83
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,760
You got all A's?

84
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,012
So you guessed right on the ones you marked?

85
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,019
Anyway, we're meeting at 7 today

86
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,478
Uh...

87
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,070
Seems like you're always partying

88
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,072
But you're the annoying type who still gets good grades

89
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:26,701
Ta-da!

90
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,494
Nice to meet you

91
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,878
Hey! How many bottles can you guys drink?

92
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,338
Hey, Minha, at first glance

93
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,048
looks like she can drink a lot

94
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,675
Me?

95
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,094
I drink well

96
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,344
There's actually nothing I can't do

97
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,764
Where does that confidence come from?

98
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,099
Are you good at drinking games too?

99
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,599
Are you challenging me?

100
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,978
Okay, I'll start then

101
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,438
I'm not good at these games

102
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,523
You learn as you drink

103
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,860
Sanghoon's favorite random game!

104
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,030
What game! Game start!

105
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,615
Subway~ subway~ subway~!

106
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:07,074
Line 2

107
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:07,701
Yeoksam Station

108
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:08,576
Shinrim

109
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,286
Gangnam

110
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:10,911
Caught you!

111
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,916
Drink~ drink~ drink~!

112
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,585
The alcohol goes down, glug glug glug~!

113
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,726
What is this, Black Rose?

114
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:36,103
Let's just stop this now

115
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:37,188
Let's do something else

116
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,481
Something like "mountain after mountain"?

117
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,860
Think you can handle it?

118
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,737
Hey, then we should mix up the seating

119
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,740
It's more fun this way

120
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,869
Mountain after mountain~ mountain after mountain~!

121
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:03,715
Hey, we need to gradually increase the intensity

122
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:25,652
What?

123
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,197
What's with that look? Don't do it!

124
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,407
Seriously, don't do it!

125
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,242
I can't! I can't!

126
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,452
I'll drink, I'll drink

127
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,413
Let's stop this now

128
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,998
Okay, something different

129
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:38,833
Let's play the King Game, the King Game

130
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,210
Okay

131
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,847
Okay

132
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,358
Number 1 and number 3, kiss

133
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,235
Hey, it has to last more than 3 seconds

134
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,778
If not then...

135
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,780
This!

136
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,912
Hey! Who's number 3? I'm number 1

137
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,623
Is it me?

138
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,918
If you can't do it, this is what happens

139
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,966
Can we split it and drink instead?

140
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:28,800
Yes

141
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,176
You can't even drink

142
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:32,261
A kiss is no big deal

143
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:43,605
Done, right?

144
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:44,231
Hey!

145
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,150
Draw a new king! This is dead!

146
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,027
It was a big deal for me

147
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,280
It seemed like it meant nothing to you

148
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,198
Hey!

149
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,993
Why did you just...?

150
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,328
I just...

151
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:00,457
For some reason I got angry

152
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,791
I'm not playing anymore
