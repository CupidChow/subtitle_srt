1
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,520
Zhi Yi.

2
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,440
You've been here all night.

3
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,800
Why don't you go home and rest?

4
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,730
We're still here to watch over him.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,479
No.

6
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,560
He got hurt because of me.

7
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,170
I have to stay here with him.

8
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,289
Don't blame yourself too much.

9
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,560
If anyone's to blame, it's Jiang Dahai for being so malicious.

10
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,220
How could he do such a thing in front of everyone?

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,960
It's just too despicable.

12
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,620
It is indeed very despicable.

13
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,080
But he's been detained now.

14
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,039
Zhi Yi,

15
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,360
don't worry too much.

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,759
Don't wear yourself out.

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,860
It's getting late.

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,680
You all should go back and rest.

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,540
I'll stay here.

20
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,450
Take care of yourself then.

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,280
Let's go.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Zhi Yi.

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,840
Why are you so stupid?

24
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,920
Ouch!

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

26
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,200
Where does it hurt?

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
My arm hurts.

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,940
Should I call a doctor for you?

30
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,000
No, no need.

31
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,500
No need, it's fine.

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,480
I'll be fine in a moment.

33
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,200
The doctor said you need to rest for a few days.

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
Don't go anywhere for a while.

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,640
Just stay in the hospital.

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,500
Did you hear me?

37
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,040
Okay.

38
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,520
Also,

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,880
in situations like this in the future,

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,520
can you please not try to act tough?

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Little brat.

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,480
I'm not a little brat.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
Why do you always call me a little brat?

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
Lie down.

45
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,980
You keep calling me a little brat all day.

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,600
It seems,

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,090
I need to be as mature as senior Mu Chen.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,260
I want to take a shower.

49
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,090
Help me take off my clothes.

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,360
My hand hurts.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,820
Then I'll close my eyes and help you undress.

52
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,880
Step back.

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,420
That's enough.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,930
Look at me directly.

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,480
How is it?

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,440
See if you still call me a little kid now.

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,200
Manly enough, right?

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,040
You seem to be just fine.

59
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,570
Are you going to wash or not?

60
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
Help me take off my pants.

61
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,840
Let me explain.

62
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,700
Don't touch me.

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,520
You're messing with me, aren't you?

64
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,050
Is it fun?

65
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,960
I didn't.

66
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,880
This angle is good.

67
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,340
Let me take a photo for you.

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,840
move closer.

69
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,640
It's for work.

70
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,890
It's gone viral.

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,530
It's gone viral.

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,960
Our account has gained more followers.

73
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
Cheers.

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,440
That's great.

75
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Our account has finally reached over 10,000 followers.

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,320
I didn't expect this.

77
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,960
This time, it's a blessing in disguise.

78
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
The theater stage didn't attract fans.

79
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,520
But,

80
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
the video went viral.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,730
Yes, indeed.

82
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
It's all thanks to having me, the lucky charm, around.

83
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,560
And you know what?

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,240
Many netizens are commenting below,

85
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,200
asking where this guesthouse is located.

86
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, yes, yes.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,260
It's all thanks to you.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Of course.

89
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,920
Nanling Village hasn't been this lively in a long time.

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,360
All the young people in the village have gone out to work,

91
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,560
leaving only the elderly and the young.

92
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,040
Thank you for coming.

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,640
You've brought so much vitality to our village.

94
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,200
Ma Yi.

95
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,520
I guess it's after Jiaojiao came

96
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,980
that Nanling Village became so full of life.

97
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,600
An Jin, what are you talking about?

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Don't talk nonsense.

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
Come, let's have a drink together.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,840
Cheers!

101
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,320
The road we've traveled.

102
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,720
Will you all sing with me?

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,680
You're singing so strangely.

104
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,810
Who told you to sing?

105
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,970
You sing with me.

106
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
I won't.

107
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,280
Babies,

108
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,280
Today we've arrived at a

109
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,240
very beautiful little courtyard.

110
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
Welcome everyone to check in with me!

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,520
Welcome to Banshan Banshan.

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,720
Are you here for accommodation?

113
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,400
Look this way.

114
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,560
Staying overnight?

115
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,290
Hello there!

116
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,120
Are you two here for accommodation?

117
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,600
Ah, yes.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,720
The reception is over there.

119
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,240
You can go there to register.

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,880
Excuse me.

121
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,159
Excuse me, are you...

122
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,020
Isn't that the guy from the video?

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,060
Come on, handsome.

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,440
Come.

125
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,120
Say hello to the babies.

126
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,580
One more photo.

127
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,400
Look here.

128
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,460
Hello, beautiful.

129
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,040
Just a moment, I'll be right there.

130
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,600
Oh.

131
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Hello, everyone.

132
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,400
Hi.

133
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,850
Beautiful lady,

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
we're currently short on available rooms.

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,040
If you don't register soon,

136
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm afraid there won't be any desirable rooms left.

137
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,120
Alright, I'm coming.

138
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,040
This way, please, beautiful.

139
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,320
Come.

140
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,450
Goodbye, handsome.

141
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,480
Still.

142
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,800
So enthusiastic.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,400
You two make a good match.

144
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,300
really.

145
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,200
Boss Shen,

146
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,600
are you still buying our vegetables?

147
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,400
Jiang Dahai,

148
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,409
what are you doing here?

149
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,040
Weren't you detained?

150
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,760
There are so many customers today.

151
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,280
Let's discuss this in private later.

152
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,720
The cabbage has been sold,

153
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,360
and the shepherd's purse is now in season.

154
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,960
You need to take responsibility till the end, okay?

155
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,560
Why should we be responsible for everything?

156
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,720
Didn't we already help you sell a batch last time?

157
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,560
besides,

158
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,000
you coming here with all these people,

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,040
it doesn't look good for our customers to see.

160
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,400
If you have something to discuss, let's change the location.

161
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,920
We can talk another day.

162
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,120
So we can't come here, huh?

163
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,320
Another day, you say?

164
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,850
I need to settle this today.

165
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,320
What are you doing?

166
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,880
Stop!

167
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
What do you think you're doing?

168
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,800
I'm selling vegetables.

169
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,320
We forgave you for what happened last time.

170
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,280
This time you're causing trouble at the guesthouse again.

171
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,800
Don't mention that.

172
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,240
Then you sell these vegetables.

173
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,000
Alright.

174
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,170
A remarkable woman.

175
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,570
Here.

176
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,970
Let's put it in writing.

177
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,130
Rich people.

178
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,919
Thank you.

179
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,570
Let's go.

180
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,600
What vegetables are you harvesting?

181
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,159
You can sell them after harvesting.

182
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,640
I...

183
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,559
Last time, I...

184
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:39,760
Yeah, right.

185
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,320
That's right.
