1
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,880
My name is Shen Zhiyi.

2
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,680
A year ago, I returned to my hometown and opened a guesthouse.

3
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,479
There's no urban hustle and bustle here.

4
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,800
it allows me, in my busy life,

5
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,880
to find inner peace and healing.

6
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,039
Making my hometown more beautiful

7
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,920
has always been my grandmother's and my wish.

8
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,200
To further develop the guesthouse and build up our hometown,

9
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,280
we've specially invited an important investor for an inspection.

10
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,940
Shen Zhiyi.

11
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,640
Good luck!

12
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,360
Jiaojiao.

13
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,440
This is prepared for the investor.

14
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,280
No sneaking bites.

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,880
I just wanted to have a taste.

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,340
That's still not allowed.

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,130
There's an earthquake!

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,930
Everyone, hurry up!

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,480
Lift it up, up, up!

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,440
Stop!

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
Who are you people?

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,560
So you're the owner of this guesthouse?

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,330
Perfect.

24
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,700
Just letting you know,

25
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,960
this land belongs to us now.

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,200
We're starting construction today.

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,600
You're Jiang Dahai.

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,500
Well, well.

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,450
You know me, huh?

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,480
He's a notorious scoundrel in the village.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,079
I heard that this area of ours

32
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,560
has caught the eye of their chemical plant.

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,640
They want to build a factory here.

34
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,720
Since you know who I am,

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,920
I won't waste any more words.

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
Grab your personal belongings and get out of here.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,210
Boys, let's get to work.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,160
Wait.

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,000
Even if you own the property rights here,

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,660
our lease hasn't expired yet.

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,760
That's right.

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,160
You're being completely unreasonable.

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,400
I've already asked around.

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
You're just tenants, you don't own the property.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,600
Why are you still talking?

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,079
You...

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,360
Get to work!

48
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,760
What are you waiting for?

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Nobody move!

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,820
You damn woman!

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,210
Do you have a death wish?

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,360
Our opening of this guesthouse

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,320
was approved by Secretary Ma and the village chief.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,280
It's legal and compliant.

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,840
What Secretary Ma? What village chief?

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
I couldn't care less about them.

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,980
Let me tell you,

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,440
this place, I-

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,920
Da Hai!

60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,660
Village Chief!

61
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,200
How dare you speak like that?

62
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,560
Their lease hasn't expired yet.

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,960
Why did you bring excavators here?

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,840
Village Chief,

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,120
this guesthouse is in such a prime location,

66
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,960
yet it hasn't brought our village any benefits.

67
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,680
We might as well build a chemical plant instead.

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,360
Da Hai,

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,680
do me a favor.

70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,240
Take the excavators back first.

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,160
If there's anything to discuss,

72
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,880
let's talk it over properly.

73
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,560
Village Chief, please be the judge here.

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,220
I'm not doing this for myself.

75
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm doing this for our fellow villagers,

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,160
for all of us.

77
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,760
How about this:

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
The contract expires in three months.

79
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,160
If within three months,

80
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,840
you can't come up with the rent for the next ten years,

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,400
the village

82
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
won't renew the contract with you.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,960
Three months?

84
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,160
Village Chief,

85
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,360
three months

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,360
isn't that too short?

87
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,420
It's three months,

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,079
otherwise,

89
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,440
I won't be able to explain it to the villagers.

90
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,240
Village Chief,

91
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,760
they won't be able to make anything of it.

92
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,520
Giving them another three months is just a waste of time.

93
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,160
We might as well start construction now.

94
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,640
Fine.

95
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
Then let's set a three-month deadline.

96
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
If within three months,

97
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,240
the investment for the guesthouse doesn't materialize,

98
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,160
we'll terminate the lease.

99
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Zhi Yi.

100
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,080
Remember what you said.

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,210
I'll demolish it within three months.

102
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,720
How can we possibly

103
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
raise ten years' worth of rent in three months?

104
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,079
That's why the inspection from Maimang Group is even more crucial now.

105
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
But our guesthouse has only been open for a short time.

106
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
We haven't even turned a profit yet.

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Can we do it?

108
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,040
We can't worry about that now.

109
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,320
The investors will be here soon.

110
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,160
Go make preparations.

111
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,760
Oh.

112
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,880
Based on calculations of the current trajectory,

113
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,480
a meteorite will cause a disaster in Lingnan Village.

114
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
You need to initiate the warning system immediately

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,800
and evacuate the villagers in advance!

116
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm truly sorry.

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
The planetarium hasn't received any notice yet.

118
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,159
We will verify the situation with the relevant departments.

119
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you for your call.

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,800
This is the place!

121
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,840
My calculations can't be wrong.

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,320
I'm going to save the people here.

123
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,920
You will reach your destination in 100 meters.

124
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,080
Is anyone here?

125
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,560
He...

126
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,320
Oh no!

127
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,280
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,000
Senior Zhi Yi,

129
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,720
I'll help you with this in a moment.

130
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,760
Let me take care of this for you.

131
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm really sorry about this.

132
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,120
I...

133
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,840
You...

134
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,970
Don't you recognize me?

135
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
Are you here to stay at the hotel?

136
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,020
Do you have a reservation?

137
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,970
My surname is...

138
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,600
Jiang.

139
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,280
Mr. Jiang.

140
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,200
Mr. Jiang.

141
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,440
Mr. Jiang,

142
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,600
You must be tired from your journey.

143
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,930
Here.

144
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,240
Try our ten-year-old yellow rice wine.

145
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,360
You're too kind.

146
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,760
Mr. Jiang,

147
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
Don't you think the scenery here in Nanling is beautiful?

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
And this Banshan Guesthouse on the hillside,

149
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,690
isn't it nicely decorated?

150
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:03,980
Hmm.

151
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,960
It's alright.

152
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,800
The scenery in our Nanling Village is picturesque.

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,760
Moreover, in recent years,

154
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,440
there has been a strong focus on developing the tourism industry.

155
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
The future influx of tourists will only continue to grow.

156
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
So, the homestay business is sure to be profitable.

157
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,050
We don't need to discuss these things, right?

158
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,760
Well then,

159
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,880
we'll rely on Mr. Jiang's help.

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
The reason I'm here today

161
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,280
is to save everyone.

162
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,680
Mr. Jiang is indeed a straightforward person.

163
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,440
Just now, someone from Maimang Company contacted me and said

164
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,040
The person in charge's plane won't arrive until tomorrow night.

165
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,280
Listen to me, look.

166
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,880
Then who are you?

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,400
You.

168
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,770
Don't you recognize me?

169
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,000
Jiang Cheng.

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
You remember now?

171
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,130
Jiang Cheng.

172
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
I heard you've fallen for

173
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
a senior girl in our academy.

174
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,520
Who is it?

175
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,400
I didn't expect you to like the older sister type.

176
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,060
You'll have to work hard then.

177
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,280
Older girls are usually hard to pursue.

178
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,480
Senior,

179
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Jiang Cheng.

180
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,720
Oh, it's you.

181
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,320
You've changed so much.

182
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm still getting used to it.

183
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
About what happened earlier today,

184
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,600
I'm really sorry.

185
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,840
I must have embarrassed myself.

186
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,500
I feel quite embarrassed too.

187
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,320
I...

188
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,840
Can I stay here

189
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,450
for a couple of days?

190
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,720
It's okay.

191
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,140
Feel free to stay here.

192
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,320
There are plenty of vacant rooms in the guesthouse anyway.

193
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,159
Can I sit here?

194
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,400
Oh, right.

195
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,520
When did you start studying

196
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,160
astronomy and such?

197
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,160
I never would have thought

198
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
that the little tagalong who used to follow me around

199
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,200
would become so accomplished now.

200
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,530
Looking down on me, huh?

201
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
Who was it that, back in school,

202
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,040
cried to me because he couldn't win over a girl?

203
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,770
You were sobbing to me about it.

204
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,720
You're blushing.

205
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,840
N-no, I'm not.

206
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,520
Really?

207
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,690
Don't tell me you still like that girl.

208
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,600
For all you know,

209
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,660
she might be married with kids by now.

210
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,130
Let's not talk about me.

211
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,970
What about you, senior?

212
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,809
Are you married?

213
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,250
How come I don't see Senior Mu Chen?

214
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:42,919
You two

215
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,640
must be

216
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,260
We broke up a long time ago.

217
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,960
Broke up?

218
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,000
That's great!

219
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,160
What are you smiling about?

220
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,200
It's kind of creepy.

221
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I-I'm not smiling.

222
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,880
I just

223
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,280
Also,

224
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,240
about that meteorite you mentioned,

225
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,700
what's the deal with that?

226
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Oh right, the meteorite.

227
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,780
So, do you believe what I said?

228
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,880
Of course

229
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,900
I don't believe it.

230
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,640
It's not about the meteorite.

231
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,240
But it's good for young people to be inquisitive.

232
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,640
It's always a good thing.

233
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,320
Can you

234
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,400
stop using

235
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,120
that tone of an elder when talking to me?

236
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm not a child anymore.

237
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm only one year younger than you.

238
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,640
One year younger is still a child.

239
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,240
In my eyes, you'll always be my little brother.

240
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,120
Call me Jiang Cheng.

241
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,040
Don't call me brother.

242
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,100
Alright, alright.

243
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,800
Little brother Jiang Cheng.

244
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,400
Happy now?

245
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,440
The boss Zhang from the chemical plant said,

246
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,520
as long as we can make the homestay

247
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
go bankrupt,

248
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,000
Boss Zhang will get that piece of land.

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,240
You won't miss out on the benefits.

250
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,040
Yes, yes, yes,

251
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,760
I'll do whatever Hai Ge says.

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,600
So,

253
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,720
when will their investors

254
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,680
be coming?

255
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,280
Investors are coming to inspect the guesthouse tomorrow.

256
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,000
It's up to you to mess this up.

257
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,440
I told you to pick up the guests.

258
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,300
Where are they?

259
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,250
They're in the back,

260
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,560
but they seem to be carsick.

261
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,000
I...

262
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,480
You're good for nothing but causing trouble.

263
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,410
You're useless.

264
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,690
I was just trying to get them here quickly.

265
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,280
Are you okay?

266
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,320
Let me help you.

267
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,380
hurry up, hurry up.

268
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,970
Let's go.

269
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,920
Slow down.

270
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
That's not right.

271
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,300
This way, please, Mr. Lin.

272
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,600
This is the room specially prepared for you.

273
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,000
If you like it, you can stay for a few more days.

274
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,930
I've invested in your guesthouse.

275
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,840
Sir.

276
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,340
Won't you reconsider?

277
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,760
Thanks for your help yesterday.

278
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,420
you returned my luggage to me,

279
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,200
from the illegal taxi driver.

280
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,060
You helped me get my luggage back.

281
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,720
And,

282
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,770
this place is so beautiful.

283
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,720
It's exactly as I imagined.

284
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,320
Well, how about this?

285
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,480
I'll go prepare the meal first.

286
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,140
We can talk while we eat later.

287
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,120
Room service.

288
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,360
Mr. Lin.

289
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,920
I came to warn you.

290
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,120
Whatever you do, don't invest in this guesthouse.

291
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,600
There's a meteorite

292
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
that's about to fall here.

293
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,960
If you invest,

294
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,280
you'll not only lose everything,

295
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,010
but your life will be in danger.

296
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,160
Really?

297
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,740
Really.

298
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,770
I don't want to live anyway.

299
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,040
You're still so young, and you don't have a boyfriend yet, right?

300
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,290
Jiang Cheng.

301
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,800
How dare you bully Manager Lin!

302
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,130
Do you have a death wish?

303
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,920
I didn't.

304
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,220
I'll teach you a lesson for bullying her.

305
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,080
I'll make you pay for bullying her.

306
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,140
I didn't bully her.

307
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,370
Are you alright?

308
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,760
What are you doing?

309
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,000
An Jin.

310
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,020
Let me explain.

311
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,400
Scumbag.

312
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,640
how's that?

313
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,120
You deserved that beating, didn't you?

314
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,000
It wasn't me.

315
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,440
He actually called that woman 'cutie.'

316
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,400
What's so cute about her?

317
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,360
Not cute, not cute at all.

318
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
Certainly not as cute as you.

319
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,360
Mr. Lin,

320
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,480
do you have any other grievances?

321
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,360
feel free to tell me,

322
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,020
I'll go teach Jiang Cheng a lesson for you again.

323
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,240
It wasn't him.

324
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,570
See? I told you it wasn't me.

325
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,120
You know what?

326
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,480
She's not as rich as I am,

327
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,300
and she's not as pretty as I am either.

328
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,360
But...

329
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,080
Why did he choose her of all people?

330
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,410
It just shows that jerks are blind.

331
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,320
You're right, Manager Lin.

332
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,440
We can live just as well without men.

333
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,400
You can stay with us for a few more days,

334
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,120
get some rest,

335
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,320
and adjust your mood.

336
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,840
Can I say something?

337
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,080
That meteorite is about to fall,

338
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,200
we need to quickly...

339
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,920
Get out!

340
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,720
Are you alright, Mr. Lin?

341
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,440
I'm fine.

342
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,980
Don't call me Mr. Lin anymore.

343
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,760
Just call me An Jin.

344
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,440
Home.

345
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
I enjoy talking with you.

346
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
Your guesthouse.

347
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,610
I'm investing in it.

348
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,360
An Jin,

349
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,290
are you sure you don't want to reconsider?

350
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,440
I like it here.

351
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,210
I want to invest.

352
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,650
Well,

353
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,000
let's drink to this.

354
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
We're in this together now.

355
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,960
A deposit is required before the contract.

356
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
I'll pay by card.

357
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,000
Alright.

358
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
It's ahead of schedule.
