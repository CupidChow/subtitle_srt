1
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,640
This is it.

2
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,760
I suspect this factory is polluting the water source.

3
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,920
looking at our entire Nanling Village,

4
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,960
this is the only factory.

5
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,240
This factory belongs to Manager Zhang.

6
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,039
They bought a piece of land from the village a few years ago.

7
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,900
How's the profit of this factory?

8
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,039
The factory's profit is quite good.

9
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,600
Last year,

10
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,440
they even gave their employees

11
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,560
a substantial year-end bonus.

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,680
Chemical factories are polluting enterprises.

13
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,680
How do they treat their wastewater?

14
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,640
Why don't we go inside

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,900
and ask Manager Zhang?

16
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,800
This is the third one.

17
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,800
We've checked the water sources at all three locations.

18
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,440
Only the downstream area is showing problems.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,700
Is it really President Zhang's factory?

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,840
Look.

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,020
We follow all the regulations

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,000
to properly treat

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,200
before discharging.

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,530
Well,

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,360
we don't have any evidence then.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,520
Is this what you solemnly promised me at the time

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,480
that you weren't discharging wastewater?

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,210
What's this?

29
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,720
Evidence of your wastewater discharge.

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,850
We don't discharge.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,079
What do you want our chemical plant to do?

32
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,200
You can completely treat it before discharging.

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,880
Treat it?

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
Don't the machines cost money?

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
The chemical plant has so many employees.

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,280
Do you want us to live on air?

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
To tell you the truth,

38
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,690
even if we really did discharge it,

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,200
what can you do to us?

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,730
Jiang Cheng.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,530
I want to thank you on behalf of the villagers.

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,560
Why so formal all of a sudden?

43
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,160
Once we get the professional water quality test report,

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,490
we can report them to the Environmental Protection Bureau.

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,720
I did it for Zhi Yi.

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
I'm still thinking about

47
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,240
the contamination of the crops.

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Something just doesn't feel right.

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,250
If there's no source of pollution,

50
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,740
why would the crops be contaminated?

51
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
Don't think about it.

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,040
Boss,

53
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,440
what brings you here?

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,360
Someone reported your chemical plant

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,480
for discharging polluted water.

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,520
How is that possible?

57
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,250
This is the inspection report.

58
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
It's polluting the environment.

59
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,680
Make immediate improvements.

60
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,480
Yes, yes, yes.

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,280
We'll fix it right away.

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,400
We'll fix it immediately.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,080
Useless.

64
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,700
Can't even handle such a simple task.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,060
Let's wait for now.

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,540
We'll observe how things unfold.

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,300
Are you playing games?

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,159
I have something to tell you.

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,280
But you can keep playing first.

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,880
I can wait.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,720
It's okay.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,200
Go ahead.

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,800
What is it?

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,480
It's nothing really.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
When you saved me that day,

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,960
what were you thinking?

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,520
Weren't you scared?

78
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,800
That day,

79
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,960
I didn't think too much.

80
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,520
I just couldn't reach any of you.

81
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,580
My mind went blank.

82
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,640
The first thought was

83
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,370
to find you as soon as possible.

84
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,960
But it's still a pity.

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,440
What's a pity?

86
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,240
It's a pity that Mu Chen found you first.

87
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,300
Teacher Mu,

88
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,120
perfect timing.

89
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,280
Can you help me with something?

90
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,880
Come here.

91
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,680
Jiang Cheng,

92
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,440
actually, I...

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,040
Zhiyi,

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,440
Zhiyi,

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,400
The supermarket owner needs our agricultural products.

96
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,600
They want us to deliver them right away.

97
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
Is it that urgent?

98
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,400
Can't we deliver them tomorrow?

99
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,880
Alright then,

100
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,400
I'll go.

101
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,159
You rest.

102
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,490
I'll drive them.

103
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,000
That works too.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Let's get going then.

105
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,680
Help!

106
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,080
Help me!

107
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,320
Help!

108
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,600
Save me!

109
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,040
Save me!

110
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,360
Save me!

111
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,120
Jiang Cheng.

112
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,480
Jiang Cheng.

113
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,200
How did you end up like this, Jiang Cheng?

114
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,080
Jiang Cheng.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,000
how did you get into this state?

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,080
Jiang Cheng.

117
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,600
It's all my fault.

118
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,640
I shouldn't have let you go driving.

119
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
If anything happens to you,

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,400
I'll definitely take responsibility for you.

121
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,600
Don't worry,

122
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,280
I'll take care of you for the rest of my life.

123
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,360
Jiang Cheng.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,440
Do you mean what you say?

125
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,600
I do.

126
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,600
I

127
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
I've recorded it.

128
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,920
You can't go back on your word later.

129
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,580
your body has recovered well.

130
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,480
Thank you.

131
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,280
It's nothing.

132
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Jiang Cheng,

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,920
you scared me to death.

134
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,000
Keep your voice down, don't wake them up.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,860
You have no idea how worried I was.

136
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,960
I... yesterday, I...

137
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,240
I ran out of battery playing games yesterday.

138
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,900
I just plugged it in to charge.

139
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,720
You have no idea what I've been through.

140
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
Let go of me.

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,040
I won't let go.

142
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,040
Alright, alright.

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
I can't believe you lied to me.

144
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
I won't lie to you ever again.

145
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,880
Zhiyi,

146
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,640
I won't lie to you ever again.

147
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,500
You didn't answer any of my calls.

148
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:17,920
Look at them.

149
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Let's talk when we get back.

150
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,580
I thought I'd never see you again.

151
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,200
It seems Zhiyi

152
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,080
still cares more about Jiang Cheng.

153
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,340
She was the first one to rush in to see him.

154
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,920
My wrist is still a bit uncomfortable.

155
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,200
I'll go see the doctor again.

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
You guys go ahead.

157
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,080
Boss,

158
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,880
how's the business at the chemical plant?

159
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,840
After the cost of raw materials decreased,

160
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,440
the profits have increased.

161
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,360
I have another task I need you to handle for me.

162
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,690
Okay.

163
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,520
Your instructions, please.

164
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,680
Mu Chen is leaving.

165
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,410
Did you know?

166
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,360
Wasn't everything fine?

167
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,680
Why is he suddenly leaving?

168
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,200
I don't know the details either.

169
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,530
He said his research project is finished.

170
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,920
He's leaving.

171
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,840
Isn't that good news for you?

172
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,420
You don't seem happy about it though.

173
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,810
Of course I'm happy.

174
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,770
I couldn't be more pleased that he's leaving.

175
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,700
Maybe it's because

176
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,680
you've spent so much time together,

177
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
you're a bit reluctant to see him go.

178
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,840
Have you heard?

179
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Mu Chen is leaving next week.

180
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,240
he's about to leave.

181
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,880
What?

182
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,570
I thought he wasn't going to leave.

183
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
the main thing is,

184
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,680
he doesn't have a reason to stay.

185
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,600
The village's crop issues have all been resolved.

186
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
He can't stay here forever.

187
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,320
That's true.

188
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,840
But I think

189
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,960
he still has feelings for Zhi Yi.

190
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,620
He still has feelings for her.

191
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,520
I hate eating fruits the most.

192
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,920
I have no appetite at all.

193
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,440
Apples contain a large amount of phloridzin.

194
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,320
it's mainly distributed in the apple peel.

195
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
it's a natural

196
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,900
skin whitening agent.

197
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
Really?

198
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,220
Then I'll eat more.

199
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,680
I feel like my skin has actually improved a bit.

200
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
I'm sure

201
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,460
that's just a placebo effect.

202
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,360
Professor Mu,

203
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,160
you're an expert in plants,

204
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,680
so you must know a lot about their components.

205
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,520
What do you think?

206
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,480
Could some of our Nanling Village's specialties

207
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,600
possibly have effective ingredients extracted

208
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
to make skincare products?

209
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,930
For example, the rutin you mentioned.

210
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,850
Rutin can indeed be directly absorbed by the human body,

211
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
but in plants,

212
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,080
naturally occurring rutin is rare.

213
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Rutin mostly exists in the form of

214
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,460
its glycoside derivative, rutinoside.

215
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,320
As expected of an expert,

216
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,450
I've never even heard of rutin before.

217
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
So, according to what you're saying,

218
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,210
our Nanling Village is full of treasures?

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,520
It's rutin.

220
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,800
Rutin.

221
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,440
Nanling Village indeed has very rich plant resources.

222
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,200
For instance,

223
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,560
the common purslane that can be seen everywhere

224
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,520
is usually considered

225
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
by people to be

226
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,840
a ubiquitous weed,

227
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,920
but it actually has significant benefits.

228
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,760
You mean

229
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
the purslane that we can see

230
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,280
everywhere by the roadside?

231
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Vitamin E can be extracted from it,

232
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,570
as well as Vitamin A,

233
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,040
glutathione,

234
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,210
and melatonin J,

235
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,600
which can be used for skincare.

236
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Its stems are tender.

237
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,600
Hello?

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,930
Chairman Zhang,

239
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,400
I have something

240
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,160
I'd like to ask for your help with.

241
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,840
What is it?

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,160
Where shall we discuss it?

243
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,040
Let's meet at

244
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,120
that popular homestay,

245
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,920
Banshan Banshan.

246
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,450
Yes, yes,

247
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Banshan Banshan.

248
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,690
Alright,

249
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,000
see you then.
