1
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,560
Come.

2
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,680
slow down.

3
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,440
Slow down. Be careful.

4
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm fine.

5
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,800
Can you still drink alcohol?

6
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Have a soft drink.

7
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,720
I'm really okay now.

8
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,320
Look if you don't believe me.

9
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
Nothing's wrong.

10
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
How are you okay?

11
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,740
You're still bruised.

12
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
If we keep looking,

13
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,320
the wound will heal soon.

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
Excuse me for interrupting,

15
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,680
don't mind me, please continue.

16
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,690
I won't bother you anymore.

17
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,579
I've got goosebumps all over.

18
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,240
They're so lovey-dovey.

19
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,440
I can't even be jealous.

20
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,600
Work is the only thing that suits me.

21
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,240
Jiaojiao,

22
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,520
I have something to tell you.

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,320
Wait a moment.

24
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,840
Let me finish organizing the report first.

25
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,280
Jiaojiao,

26
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,650
During the time I've known you,

27
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,860
I've been constantly influenced by you.

28
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,600
You're so positive and cheerful every day,

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
like a

30
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,180
joyful nut bringing happiness to everyone.

31
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,600
When you're not around,

32
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,440
I feel like something's missing in my life.

33
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,680
When I go out and see delicious food

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,560
or fun things,

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,520
I think of you

36
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,050
and want to share them with you.

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,520
Ma Yi,

38
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,160
Actually, before,

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,080
I really disliked rigid boys.

40
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,040
But

41
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,200
since

42
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,120
you appeared in my life,

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,880
I feel

44
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,240
there's no room for anyone else in my eyes.

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,160
Jiaojiao,

46
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,250
I've actually liked you all along.

47
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,600
But I'm the kind of person

48
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,930
who's a bit slow when it comes to emotions.

49
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,560
I didn't know how to tell you.

50
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,040
So today, I want to

51
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,820
gather my courage and express my true feelings.

52
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
I like you.

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,460
Let's be together.

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,760
Ma Yi.

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,690
I've been waiting for these words for a long time.

56
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,240
We've been through so much together recently.

57
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,320
what I'm more certain of is

58
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,240
that you are the one

59
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,330
I want to spend the rest of my life with.

60
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,250
Here, eat more vegetables.

61
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,000
Yi, you eat too.

62
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,440
Why do I smell the stench of love?

63
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,000
Me too.

64
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,960
Everyone,

65
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
stop looking at us with envy.

66
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,200
Jiaojiao and I

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,660
are officially together now.

68
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,960
Ma Yi is a real man.

69
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,720
When did this happen?

70
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,680
If you love someone,

71
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,440
you should bravely confess your feelings.

72
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,840
What do you think, Zhiyi?

73
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,780
What you've been working on recently...

74
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,080
I can see this is a gourd.

75
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,960
But what's this thing?

76
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,240
Oh, don't worry about that.

77
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,159
That's homework Uncle Zhou left for me.

78
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,120
This is my masterpiece.

79
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,960
If I call out to you, do you dare to answer?

80
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,720
Sun Wukong.

81
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,400
Jiang Cheng.

82
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Are you asking for another beating?

83
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,600
Zhi Yi.

84
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,040
Look at this.

85
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,970
It's my new work.

86
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,120
Not bad.

87
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,480
At least it's taking shape.

88
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,200
Seems like there's some improvement.

89
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,760
What do you mean 'not bad'?

90
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,240
This is clearly a bowl for a big goose.

91
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
What do you know?

92
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,600
Even Zhi Yi said I did well.

93
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,330
Zhi Yi is the encouraging type.

94
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,360
I want to make you face reality.

95
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,680
Otherwise, you'll be kept in the dark every day.

96
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,810
How can you improve?

97
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,920
Right, Zhi Yi?

98
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,680
An Jin.

99
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,560
What's wrong so early in the morning?

100
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Why the long face?

101
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,880
What's wrong, An Jin?

102
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,540
What's the matter?

103
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,540
Come on.

104
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,680
My mom is coming.

105
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,520
It's great that your mom is coming.

106
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,200
Let's have Jiaojiao make a couple of special dishes.

107
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,000
That's right.

108
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,440
What's wrong, An Jin?

109
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,360
Yeah, what's the matter?

110
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,560
Don't you get along well with your aunt?

111
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,890
What's really going on?

112
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,490
My mom is a professional investor.

113
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,480
This time, she

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,160
is coming to withdraw her investment.

115
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,620
Withdraw the investment.

116
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,000
I see.

117
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,560
The money you invested in the guesthouse

118
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,290
was borrowed from your mother?

119
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,160
My mother has always been against me running a guesthouse.

120
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,480
She's called several times asking me to go back.

121
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,610
But I've always made excuses saying I couldn't get away.

122
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,660
I didn't expect

123
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,280
she would come here in person this time.

124
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,800
Let's lock the door and say we're out for team building.

125
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,660
How about that?

126
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,320
Okay.

127
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,240
What do you think?

128
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,960
No, we can't.

129
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,679
You can't avoid the inevitable.

130
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,400
We'll have to face this sooner or later.

131
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,559
But we can't withdraw the investment.

132
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,760
If we withdraw now, all our efforts will be wasted.

133
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,640
Actually,

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,760
my mom also wanted me to find a stable job.

135
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,440
But as you know,

136
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,880
I wanted to be a chef,

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,080
that's why I opened this guesthouse with Zhiyi.

138
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,680
Moreover,

139
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,360
after my persistent efforts during this time,

140
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,520
my mom also thinks I'm doing well.

141
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,720
Get to the point.

142
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,480
What I mean is...

143
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,800
An Jin,

144
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,760
even if you have disagreements with your aunt,

145
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,680
could you

146
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,480
try to

147
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
persuade her a bit more?

148
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,460
If the guesthouse keeps getting better,

149
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,360
your aunt will eventually support us,

150
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,880
right?

151
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,760
Let's treat your aunt well,

152
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
let her experience the charm of Nanling.

153
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,610
Maybe things will turn around.

154
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,800
Why do I have to wear this outfit?

155
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,760
To show our professionalism and enthusiasm.

156
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,360
Remember,

157
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,480
the person coming soon

158
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,210
is not Lin Ma,

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
but the empress dowager who will determine the fate of our guesthouse.

160
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Alright then.

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,560
Mom!

162
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,520
Mom!

163
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,240
Auntie,

164
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,920
hello.

165
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,680
Hello, auntie.

166
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,410
I'm Shen Zhiyi, the owner of Banshan Guesthouse.

167
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
There's no sun. Why use an umbrella?

168
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,170
Go pack all my luggage quickly.

169
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,760
Alright!

170
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,240
Okay.

171
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,320
Don't break anything!

172
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,760
Got it!

173
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,240
Mom,

174
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
you must be tired.

175
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,320
We've prepared a welcome dinner for you.

176
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
This waitress is so inconsiderate.

177
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,100
Fire her tomorrow.

178
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,160
Understood.

179
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,600
Please don't be angry.

180
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,130
Let's go.

181
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,000
This is it.

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,560
Auntie,

183
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
Hello, Auntie.

184
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,200
Welcome to our Nanling Village.

185
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,080
This young man looks quite promising.

186
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,250
This is Secretary Ma from our village.

187
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,160
he knew you were coming,

188
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,840
and came specially to welcome you.

189
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,240
Good.

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,720
Auntie,

191
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,560
we have specially prepared

192
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,920
some signature dishes from our guesthouse

193
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,280
for you to try.

194
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm so tired.

195
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,840
It was such a long journey.

196
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,120
I should get some rest.

197
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,520
Besides,

198
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,320
I never eat that kind of messy food anyway.

199
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,250
Alright,

200
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,680
you can rest for a while then.

201
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,210
I'll have An Jin prepare the best room for you.

202
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
Where's Jiang Cheng?

203
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,960
Zhi Yi.

204
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,940
Have you seen Jiang Cheng?

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,730
he hasn't been around for days.

206
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,970
He's so unreliable.

207
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,040
He told me he had something to do.

208
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,440
maybe he really has some personal matters to attend to.

209
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,240
What could be more important than the Celadon Hanfu Cultural Festival?

210
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,760
what could be more important?

211
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,120
Dropping the ball at the most crucial moment.

212
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,520
He better not let me catch him slacking off.

213
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Where could this kid have run off to?

214
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,240
Mom.

215
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,280
Our guesthouse, you know,

216
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,320
features this kind of

217
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,800
healing and fresh style.

218
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,180
This is the most popular room.

219
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,080
Usually,

220
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,560
you need to book it a week in advance.

221
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Because lately, business

222
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
has been getting better and better.

223
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,840
Now,

224
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,280
pack your bags immediately

225
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,210
and come with me.

226
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,760
If I leave, the guesthouse will collapse.

227
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,160
Let it go bankrupt then.

228
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,530
Who do you think you are,

229
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,160
running off to this poor backwater

230
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,560
to open some kind of farm stay?

231
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,480
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

232
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,560
Mom is even more embarrassed.

233
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,080
Mom,

234
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,130
this guesthouse isn't a farm stay.

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Don't say anything else.

236
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,440
I've already made up my mind.

237
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,040
Mom,

238
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,320
you can't do this.

239
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,080
Are you coming or not?

240
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,280
If you want to leave,

241
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
you can go by yourself.
