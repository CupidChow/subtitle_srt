1
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,520
Manage it.

2
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,640
Blow it up.

3
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,610
Brother,

4
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,920
This Shen Zhiyi is really hard to deal with.

5
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,580
do you know?

6
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,600
Old Shen, who often comes here to play cards,

7
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,080
is her father.

8
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,780
He loves gambling.

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,320
Ace,

10
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,080
location,

11
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,600
uncle.

12
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,840
Dahai,

13
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,600
uncle.

14
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,640
Do you need something?

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,280
I have something good to show you.

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,210
What good thing?

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,840
Look.

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,960
This is your daughter, isn't it?

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,880
It's her.

20
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,160
I didn't expect she'd hide here.

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,490
She seems to be living quite comfortably.

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,640
No,

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,810
I have to go find her.

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,560
Uncle, don't rush.

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,640
Uncle,

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Zhiyi, I'm exhausted.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,880
I've cooked fifty dishes.

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,610
I don't want to do this anymore.

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,040
Jiaojiao,

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,100
don't rest now.

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,920
The guest has ordered another twenty dishes.

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,280
Which room?

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,120
Room 301.

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
301 again?

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,079
I've already cooked the entire menu for him.

36
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,960
Is he starving to death or something?

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,720
How can he eat so much?

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm not going.

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,530
Do you remember what our service motto is?

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,360
To serve every guest well.

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,500
Come, have some water.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,440
I can't cook anymore.

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
If it needs to be done, you go do it.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,770
Come on, come on,

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,380
have a sip of water.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,880
Take a break first.

47
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
Even drinking water won't help me cook.

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,560
Jiaojiao is the best.

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,900
What's the situation?

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,320
A middle-aged man checked in today.

51
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,920
He ordered a bunch of dishes.

52
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,250
It's worn Jiaojiao out.

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,680
Isn't that a good thing?

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,280
Keep it up.

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,680
He hasn't eaten anything all day.

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,920
And now he wants eight hundred dishes cooked.

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,760
It's so unfair.

58
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,820
Alright, alright.

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,040
Hello,

60
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Banshan Mountain Resort front desk.

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,440
How may I help you?

62
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,280
It's being prepared.

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,480
Please wait a moment.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
Rushing again, that's all they know how to do.

65
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,040
Let him starve.

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,960
Let's go.

67
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,920
Go on, go on.

68
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm counting on you.

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,080
You can do it.

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,740
Shen Zhiyi.

71
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,380
Where's the money?

72
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,010
Get the alcohol.

73
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,760
get the alcohol.

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,040
Where's my alcohol?

75
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,900
Go, go quickly.

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
I won't go, I won't go.

77
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,640
Go quickly.

78
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,520
Dad,

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,160
can you stop drinking, Dad?

80
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,610
Get out of my way, you damn girl!

81
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,720
To raise you.

82
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't even have money for drinks anymore.

83
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
What good are you all?

84
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,570
You know each other?

85
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,640
Zhiyi,

86
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,850
how did you find this place?

87
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Please leave.

88
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,399
Come back here.

89
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm your biological father.

90
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,680
Is this how you should talk to me?

91
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,600
Just say it.

92
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
What do you want this time?

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,760
I've found you a match.

94
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,040
The family is very well-off.

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,159
They've agreed to give a bride price of 500,000 yuan.

96
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,159
500,000 yuan!

97
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,840
Quit your guesthouse business.

98
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,720
Come back with me now.

99
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,250
Let's go.

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,480
500,000 yuan.

101
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,760
You want to sell me off again.

102
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,620
To get money for gambling, right?

103
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,320
You ungrateful girl!

104
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,080
It's you who found a good-for-nothing boy who won't give you a bride price.

105
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,920
As a daughter,

106
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,080
shouldn't you compensate me first?

107
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,520
How can you talk like this?

108
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,000
Or...

109
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,930
Listen to me.

110
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Marry the match I've chosen for you.

111
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,160
Or...

112
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,880
just give me the money directly.

113
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,720
Where would I get that kind of money?

114
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,850
I heard your guesthouse is doing well.

115
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,120
You must be making quite a bit, right?

116
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
This guesthouse has just started.

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,640
I haven't made any money yet.

118
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,840
You won't give it to me, you little brat?

119
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,200
You won't, huh?

120
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,320
Zhiyi.

121
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,920
Dad.

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,840
dad.

123
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
I really don't have any money.

124
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,490
You're not giving it to me, are you?

125
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,400
Watch out!

126
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,570
Why are you resorting to violence?

127
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm disciplining my daughter.

128
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,400
It's none of your business.

129
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,330
Get out of my way.

130
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,000
I...

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,520
I thought

132
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,040
it was some guest making a scene.

133
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,100
So it's you, uncle.

134
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,240
But it's not right to hit someone.

135
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,880
Not right?

136
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm a relative of the guesthouse owner.

137
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,930
What can you do to me?

138
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,050
If you keep nagging,

139
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,440
I'll slap you, believe it or not.

140
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,370
Get out of my way.

141
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,290
Not moving, huh?

142
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,800
I...

143
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Ow, ow, ow!

144
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,720
It hurts so much!

145
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,240
Let go!

146
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,520
Zhiyi.

147
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,040
You're just going to watch a stranger bully your father, aren't you?

148
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,720
I can let go,

149
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,410
but I'm warning you.

150
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,720
Don't come bothering Zhiyi again in the future.

151
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm her biological father.

152
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,220
She's my daughter.

153
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,280
I can see her

154
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,370
without your permission, can't I?

155
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,650
Alright,

156
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
I promise, I promise.

157
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,640
I won't come again in the future.

158
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,240
You can let go now, can't you?

159
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Everyone, please judge this for me.

160
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,060
please judge this situation.

161
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,320
I can't go on living.

162
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,320
This guesthouse owner is my daughter.

163
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,680
She took 500,000 yuan in bride price to open a guesthouse.

164
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,560
but she won't give me money for medical treatment.

165
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,290
She even had someone beat me up.

166
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,040
I don't want to live anymore.

167
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,920
Isn't this Shen Zhiyi's father?

168
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,520
I heard he gambles every day and owes a lot of money.

169
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,040
Is that so?

170
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,700
That's him.

171
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,840
Shen Zhiyi,

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,440
no matter what, you're still the owner of the guesthouse.

173
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,640
How could you treat your biological father like this?

174
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,760
Yes, indeed.

175
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:25,960
Come out!

176
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,000
The daughter I raised with such hardship,

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,400
this is how she treats me.

178
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,240
I can't go on living.

179
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,320
Dad,

180
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,080
what are you doing now?

181
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,140
What act are you putting on this time?

182
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
I thought you looked decent,

183
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
but you're actually cold-hearted.

184
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,600
I can't go on living.

185
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,680
It's so pitiful.

186
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,720
It's truly so pitiful.

187
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,040
Cold-hearted?

188
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,400
He's lying.

189
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,760
Everyone, please don't believe him.

190
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,360
Everything he says is false.

191
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,160
How can you speak about your father like this?

192
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,890
You really have no conscience.

193
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,740
I'll pay the 500,000 yuan.

194
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm her man.

195
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,660
You have 500,000 yuan?

196
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,200
My daughter has recovered from her illness.

197
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,000
My daughter is sick.

198
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,860
How could you possibly be her man?

199
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
You're taking advantage of my daughter.

200
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,559
If you don't pay today,

201
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,490
this isn't over.

202
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,600
That's right.

203
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,080
Dad,

204
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,679
I'll find a way to get you the money.

205
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,140
Please leave here for now.

206
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,799
Everyone heard that, right?

207
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,799
She said she'll find a way to pay me.

208
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,720
If she doesn't pay me,

209
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm not leaving.

210
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,970
Bring out the money now.

211
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,600
Right.

212
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,660
bring it out first.

213
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Where would I get that kind of money?

214
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,320
It's okay.

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,530
I'll figure something out.

216
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,720
Hey.

217
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,480
Didn't you like my car?

218
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,340
You can take it.

219
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,250
Young Master Jiang,

220
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,680
how come you're willing to sell your precious car to me?

221
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,560
Cut the crap.

222
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Transfer 500,000 to my card.

223
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,820
I need it urgently.

224
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,650
That's a lot.

225
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,440
I can't gather that much right now.

226
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
It's really a lot.

227
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,040
How much do you have then?

228
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,250
Thirty, I guess.

229
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Thirty it is then.

230
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,800
Hurry up.

231
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,680
Alipay received 300,000 yuan.

232
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Why only 300,000?

233
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,480
Jiang Cheng.

234
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,010
Where did you get the money?

235
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,960
There's still 200,000 more.

236
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,620
Here you go.

237
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,810
How much could this crappy watch be worth?

238
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
200,000 is more than enough.

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Believe it or not.

240
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,400
If you don't believe me, give it back.

241
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,160
Since you've given it to me,

242
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,420
you can't take it back.

243
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,650
But I'm warning you,

244
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,320
if this watch isn't worth 200,000,

245
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
I'll be back next time.

246
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,780
It won't be so simple then.

247
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,800
His crappy watch is worth 200,000.

248
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,260
What kind of watch is this?

249
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,360
Everyone, please disperse.

250
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,780
Go home, all of you.

251
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,410
What's going on?

252
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,410
Where did you get so much money?

253
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,330
I borrowed it from a friend.

254
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,280
What about your watch?

255
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,320
The watch was a birthday gift from a friend last year.

256
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,120
What's wrong?

257
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,770
Don't worry.

258
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,920
This 500,000.

259
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,200
I'll definitely find a way to pay you back.

260
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
It's okay, don't worry about it.

261
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,520
Boss Shen,

262
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,640
where have you been making money lately?

263
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,570
Not bad, not bad.

264
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,640
Recently,

265
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
I've made a little money.

266
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,220
That watch is nice.

267
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,200
Where did you buy it?

268
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,060
It is, isn't it?

269
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,490
It looks expensive.

270
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,120
Dad,

271
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,800
how did it go?

272
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
Did you get the money?

273
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,760
You think your sister is that easy to deal with?

274
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,600
So what happened?

275
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
Did you get the money?

276
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,600
I got it.

277
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,100
A total of 150,000.

278
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,520
I went through a lot of trouble to get this money.

279
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
150,000?

280
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,960
Dad,

281
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
that's not even enough for the down payment on a house.

282
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,420
Not enough.

283
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,160
I didn't pocket a single cent of your money.

284
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,680
Your sister only gave this much.

285
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,880
What can I do about it?

286
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,200
I don't care.

287
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,120
Mengmeng and I have already agreed this time.

288
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
We'll buy a house first, then get married.

289
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,640
After buying the house,

290
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,000
we still need to pay the bride price.

291
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,680
That's going to cost quite a bit.

292
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,200
Dad,

293
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,120
you can't let me end up not being able to get married, can you?

294
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,320
You've got to help me.

295
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,800
Ask my sister for more money.

296
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,530
Don't worry.

297
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,480
Leave it to me.

298
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,680
If your sister could come up with 150,000,

299
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,360
she must have a lot more.

300
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,360
That guy by her side,

301
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,780
he seems like a money tree.

302
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,280
Alright then.

303
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,040
Dad,

304
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
you've got to get more this time.

305
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,320
Okay, I got it.

306
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,810
Take the money and get lost.

307
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,650
Thanks, Dad.

308
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,760
Bye-bye now.

309
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,520
Darling,

310
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,840
I've had my eye on a bag recently.

311
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,980
We'll buy it tomorrow.

312
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,480
Darling,

313
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
I love you so much.
