1
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,260
I have something to talk to you about.

2
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,850
My research project has ended.

3
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,090
I'm leaving too.

4
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,320
So sudden?

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,120
What?

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,240
Don't you want me to stay?

7
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,740
Since the project is over,

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,160
you should go back as soon as possible.

9
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,220
Don't delay your important matters.

10
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
Actually,

11
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,170
I want to hear you ask me to stay.

12
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,160
Mu Chen,

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,410
we ended things a long time ago.

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,979
There's no possibility anymore.

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,240
Mr. Zhang,

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,930
long time no see.

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,480
Long time no see.

18
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,720
Mr. Zhang,

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,800
It's so late,

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,920
you called me here.

21
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,980
What's the matter?

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,720
Indeed, there is something.

23
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,800
Our company

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,320
has been developing

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,680
an anti-inflammatory skincare product recently.

26
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,320
However, one of the ingredients

27
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,250
is substandard.

28
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,079
Be careful,

29
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,610
Mr. Chen.

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,079
This is the inspection report

31
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,140
from the Market Supervision Bureau.

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,920
Failed again.

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
Our product department

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,600
In order to develop this product,

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,800
has been working overnight for several days in a row.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,160
We really have no choice

37
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,080
but to add some

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,920
This skincare product

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,840
is our company's

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,680
most important project this year.

41
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
The company has already

42
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,120
invested a lot of money and effort in its development.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,380
If this issue affects the company's IPO,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,680
the company's losses

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,760
will be extremely significant.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,640
So,

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
we've come to you.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,560
anti-inflammatory ingredients.

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,200
Our factory does have a product

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,880
with very effective anti-inflammatory ingredients,

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,240
but the price is not low.

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,329
Chairman Zhang,

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,970
Chairman Zhang,

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,000
as you know,

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
our company

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,210
has already invested a lot of money

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,400
in developing this skincare product.

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,240
We really

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,020
don't have any more money.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,360
Excuse me for interrupting,

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,020
I overheard you discussing skincare products.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,500
Young lady,

63
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,160
do you have any insights?

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,960
I don't have any particular insights,

65
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,480
but

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,480
I know someone very capable

67
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,320
who might be able to help you.

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,440
You're just a young girl fresh out of school,

69
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,480
what could you possibly know?

70
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,080
Go away,

71
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,600
don't waste our time while we're doing business.

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,280
I do know.

73
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,320
I really do.

74
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,040
Do you understand proper etiquette?

75
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,519
Otherwise, I'll file a complaint against you.

76
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,279
Chairman Zhang,

77
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,959
don't get angry.

78
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,760
It's not good for your health.

79
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,320
Come on, let's eat.

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,640
If you don't believe me,

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,760
it's your loss.

82
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,480
Manager Wu,

83
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,120
our product inventory

84
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
is running low.

85
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,920
And it's difficult to develop new ones.

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,240
I'll definitely give it serious consideration.

87
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,170
Come, let's eat.

88
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,650
Come,

89
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,520
eat.

90
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,280
Oh, Zhiyi,

91
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,409
I want to ask you something.

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
Last time, didn't you mention

93
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,810
something about purslane?

94
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,940
I was wondering if there's a possibility

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
to have Mu Chen help us

96
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,159
extract the effective components from plants

97
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,880
and

98
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,800
turn them into skincare products.

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,720
This would definitely be

100
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,980
a great way to promote Nanling Village and the guesthouse.

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,120
Zhiyi,

102
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,120
are you really not planning

103
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,280
to have him stay?

104
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,080
Why don't you reconsider it?

105
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,680
Teacher Mu

106
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,000
We have a favor to ask of you.

107
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,440
Secretary Ma,

108
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
please speak freely.

109
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,880
Our Nanling Village

110
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,040
has its own skincare brand,

111
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,600
which is a key revenue-generating project for the village.

112
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,080
We now need a botanist,

113
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,740
and we'd like to ask for your help.

114
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,920
But my research project has already ended.

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,159
Can I understand this as

116
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,820
you're trying to keep me here?

117
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,640
Haven't we already discussed this?

118
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,159
Mu Chen.

119
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,360
So, do you want me to stay?

120
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,050
Nanling Village wants you to stay,

121
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,640
but it's your choice.

122
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,900
You can choose not to stay.

123
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,240
I promised you

124
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,330
that whatever you wish for,

125
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,580
I will definitely make it happen.

126
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,560
I'll stay.

127
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,940
Thank you, Teacher Mu.

128
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,000
Hello.

129
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,400
Who are you?

130
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,520
Are you looking for someone?

131
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm looking for someone here.

132
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
with big eyes,

133
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,360
and two small dimples.

134
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,560
You must be referring to Meng Jiaojiao.

135
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,920
Please wait, I'll call her.

136
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,600
Jiaojiao.

137
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,560
Jiaojiao,

138
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,650
someone's looking for you.

139
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
What is it, Zhiyi?

140
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,650
This person is looking for you.

141
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,800
Oh, it's you.

142
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,850
Didn't you doubt me yesterday?

143
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

144
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,600
Someone was there yesterday.

145
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,480
It was really...

146
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,140
inconvenient to contact you.

147
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,000
Who is this?

148
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,080
This is...

149
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
my business card.

150
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,360
Our company...

151
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,440
urgently needs a...

152
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,120
anti-inflammatory ingredient.

153
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,159
The person you mentioned yesterday...

154
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,159
who could help me.

155
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,800
Who is it?

156
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,440
The person who can help you has arrived.

157
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,000
Hello.

158
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,840
Boss,

159
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
you called for me?

160
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,320
Did you bring the patent?

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,160
Yes, I did.

162
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,850
How much?

163
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,060
One hundred thousand.

164
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
I'll give you two hundred thousand.

165
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,320
From now on, this patent

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,760
has nothing to do with you anymore.

167
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,290
Alright.

168
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,760
Thank you, boss.

169
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,120
You added plants to it.

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,320
Yes.

171
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
It's a natural plant called purslane.

172
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,120
Purslane is used in skincare products.

173
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
It has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.

174
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,520
It helps maintain the skin barrier.

175
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,160
At the same time, it has a relatively low risk factor.

176
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,690
It's also quite safe to use.

177
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,640
I didn't expect that.

178
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,080
this common weed

179
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
has so many benefits.

180
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,640
This is the research report.

181
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,500
You can take a look at the efficacy data of purslane.

182
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,160
Your

183
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,560
cost for purslane,

184
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,250
how is it?

185
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,640
Purslane

186
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
can be found everywhere in Nanling Village.

187
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
But if you want to have

188
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,320
a large quantity of purslane at once,

189
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,799
it still needs to be cultivated.

190
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,280
Good.

191
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,360
That's great.

192
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,840
Your skincare product factory,

193
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,360
approximately how much purslane do you need?

194
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,320
It depends on the sales volume.

195
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,400
If it sells well,

196
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,200
the more, the better, of course.

197
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,840
I see.

198
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,360
I'll go back and study the plan first.

199
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,400
If possible,

200
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,280
our company will start production and development immediately.

201
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,740
Come on.

202
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,010
If it can really be mass-produced,

203
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,640
that would be wonderful.

204
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,920
This way, not only can the factory

205
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,850
get fresh, natural raw materials,

206
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
but it can also allow villagers

207
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,120
to grow purslane together

208
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,380
and earn extra income.

209
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Manager Wu's intention just now should be

210
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
to have Mu Chen

211
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,720
help with the research and development.

212
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,250
If I can be of any help to you,

213
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm willing to do my part as well.

214
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,620
Hello, Manager Wu.

215
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,000
that batch of raw materials

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
I have prepared them.

217
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,560
President Zhang,

218
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,000
the raw materials from your company

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,460
are really too expensive.

220
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,210
Our company can't afford them.

221
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,440
So,

222
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,100
we won't consider it anymore.

223
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,220
Manager Wu,

224
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,480
how can you

225
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,610
go back on your word?

226
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,560
Shen Zhiyi,

227
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm not done with you.

228
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,020
Thank you, Manager Wu.

229
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,930
How did it go?

230
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,840
Manager Wu said

231
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,960
our proposal has been accepted.

232
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,480
Production will start tomorrow.

233
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,140
He also said

234
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,040
he will buy all the purslane from our Nanling Village.

235
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
he'll take it all.

236
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
That's great, Zhiyi!

237
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,160
Does that mean we can

238
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,090
count money until our hands cramp?

239
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
What are you thinking?

240
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,540
This money all belongs to the villagers.

241
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,840
Oh.

242
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,880
Then let the villagers

243
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,940
count money until their hands cramp.

244
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,160
Shen Zhiyi.

245
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,960
It's you.

246
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,840
You're the one who's been stopping me from making money.

247
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,770
I don't know you.

248
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,960
If you're looking for accommodation,

249
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,800
please go to the front desk.

250
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,400
It's you.

251
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,920
You didn't let Manager Wu buy our raw materials.

252
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,360
That was Manager Wu's own choice.

253
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,200
Isn't running a guesthouse enough?

254
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,320
You're making all of us go hungry.

255
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,700
Shen Zhiyi,

256
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,420
you're too heartless.

257
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,960
Today,

258
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,560
I must teach you a lesson.

259
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,640
Mr. Zhang,

260
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,580
this is fair competition.

261
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
your product is overpriced,

262
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
and its ingredients pose potential risks.

263
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,040
it's understandable that it wasn't chosen.

264
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,840
you should focus on

265
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
improving your product's competitiveness,

266
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,570
instead of making a scene here.

267
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Shen Zhiyi,

268
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
you just wait and see.

269
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,500
The last dish is ready.

270
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,730
Here.

271
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,280
I'd like to propose a toast.

272
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,160
congratulations to us.

273
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,490
The contract is signed.

274
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,040
Cheers!

275
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,360
Come on, come on.

276
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,960
Try the new dish I made today.

277
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,440
Zhiyi,

278
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,700
taste the new ribs I developed today.

279
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,760
Oh, Zhiyi.

280
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,400
Don't overthink it.

281
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,840
Don't let others

282
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,120
affect your mood.

283
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,640
We're on a roll now, everything's going our way.

284
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,240
But isn't it going a bit too smoothly?

285
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,300
It feels like it's all been arranged.

286
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,160
Do you really want us to face one setback after another?

287
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,760
The popular saying now is

288
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,280
if you stand in the right spot,

289
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,320
even a pig can fly.

290
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,160
Things are going so well for us now

291
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,840
because

292
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,280
we've been through a lot of hardships before.

293
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,920
Exactly.

294
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,120
Let's all raise a glass to Teacher Mu.

295
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,000
Let's thank him

296
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,200
for leading us villagers of Nanling Village

297
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,600
to prosperity together.

298
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,820
Thank you, Teacher Mu.

299
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,450
No need to be so formal, no need to be so formal.

300
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,960
Today,

301
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,360
because I've taken some medication,

302
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,620
I can't drink alcohol.

303
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,520
So,

304
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,840
I'll use water instead of alcohol

305
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,200
to toast Zhi Yi separately

306
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,130
and Jiang Cheng.

307
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,640
Before,

308
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,920
after talking with you,

309
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,680
I thought about it for a long time after I got home.

310
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,880
I think you're right.

311
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,880
I shouldn't be stuck in the past,

312
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,280
but should look forward.

313
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,610
And after spending so much time together,

314
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,660
I feel that someone braver than me

315
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,700
has appeared by your side.

316
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,930
I believe he will surely bring you happiness.

317
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,600
I wish you both

318
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,120
a hundred years of good marriage,

319
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,250
lasting happiness,

320
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,290
and a new life together.

321
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,020
Come on.

322
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,080
Your perspective is quite impressive.

323
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,000
Mu Chen,

324
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,160
thank you.

325
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,380
I also wish you find your own happiness soon.

326
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,090
You can do it.

327
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,000
Don't be embarrassed.

328
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's all in the past.

329
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Let's eat.

330
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,520
Come on, come on,

331
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,240
let me toast you again.

332
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,760
Thank you.

333
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Come on, drink up.

334
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,840
Zhiyi.

335
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,080
I've arrived at the village entrance.
