1
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,840
What's wrong, Dad?

2
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,680
it's so late.

3
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,560
Your brother is missing.

4
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,490
Has he come here?

5
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,160
No.

6
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,920
What are you doing?

7
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,360
What's going on?

8
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,039
Let me go!

9
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,920
Who are you?

10
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,180
Where's Zhiyi?

11
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,970
I don't know.

12
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,640
Thank you.

13
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
Who are you people?

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
Why are you arresting me?

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,410
Let's go.

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,880
Where is this?

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,680
An Jin.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm Shen Zhiyi's father.

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,600
You...

20
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,120
Hurry.

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,210
Quickly bring money to the lumber mill to ransom her.

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,090
Kidnapping.

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,050
kidnapping.

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,600
kidnapping.

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,520
Five million.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,650
Not a penny less.

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,880
Have it ready by tomorrow.

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,680
Otherwise...

29
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,770
You'll be collecting his body.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,650
Jiang Cheng gets in the car.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,280
I'll go alone.

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,660
Don't turn off the engine.

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,460
wait for me.

34
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,480
Shen Zhiyi.

35
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,980
Your heart is too dark.

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,760
Today,

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,280
I must teach you a lesson.

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,600
Just you wait and see.

39
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Is this it?

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,220
That's the one.

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,040
Boss,

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,490
everything has been arranged.

43
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,200
Stop hitting!

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,160
stop hitting!

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,720
Dad,

46
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,920
stop hitting!

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,850
Brother, please stop hitting!

48
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,440
Who are you people?

49
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,100
We're from the casino.

50
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,960
I haven't gambled for a long time.

51
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,860
And I've already paid off all my gambling debts.

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,440
Why did you kidnap my daughter?

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,920
You went gambling again?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
No, I didn't.

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
I haven't gambled for a long time.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
I don't know why they're doing this either.

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,880
Get lost.

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,200
It's so noisy.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
We're just taking money from people.

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,360
solving problems for others.

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,920
Old man,

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,480
think carefully.

63
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,400
Who have you offended?

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,080
Daughter,

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
you must believe me.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,040
I've been staying at home, behaving myself.

67
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,680
I haven't offended anyone.

68
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,960
I know, Dad.

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,520
They might be after me this time.

70
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
What are they?

71
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,930
Kidnappers.

72
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Open the door.

73
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,560
Follow me.

74
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,090
Once they get the money,

75
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,760
we can leave.

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,960
Daughter,

77
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,760
who did you offend?

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,200
Move faster.

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,530
What are you looking at?

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,680
Where's Jiang Cheng?

81
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,540
He just went in.

82
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,080
He said he wanted to make the deal alone.

83
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,540
He wouldn't let me follow.

84
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,250
Don't worry.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,490
I called the police.

86
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,520
I know.

87
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,530
I've really let you down these past years.

88
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,840
But I couldn't just stand by and

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,040
watch Wen Tao with no one to care for him.

90
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,610
Your mother's only wish was for you and Wen Tao

91
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,820
to both have a home.

92
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,970
Brother.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,800
They're here.

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,080
Are you sure he's inside?

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,720
I saw them go in.

96
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,680
Zhiyi has such a father and brother.

97
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,340
She really has the worst luck.

98
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,130
Keep it down.

99
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,220
Where's the money?

100
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,250
Release them first.

101
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:23,720
Add 404.

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,640
90, release them.

103
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,720
Like hell I will.

104
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,440
Do you have any fucking leverage to negotiate with me?

105
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,360
Are you giving it or not?

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
are you going to give it or not?

107
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,600
are you going to give it or not?

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,330
I'll give it.

109
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,130
Brother.

110
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,120
Can you release them now?

111
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,920
Release them.

112
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
You're too naive.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,730
Beat them up.

114
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,280
Keep beating.

115
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,480
I.

116
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,760
I... I won't fight anymore.

117
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,020
I won't fight anymore.

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,840
Kill them!

119
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,000
Jiang Cheng.

120
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,560
Stop fighting.

121
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,480
I'm begging you.

122
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,920
Please stop fighting.

123
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,040
Stop fighting, please.

124
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Jiang Cheng.

125
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,560
Stop fighting.

126
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,159
fight.

127
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,840
Zhi Yi.

128
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,200
Zhi Yi.

129
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,840
Zhi Yi.

130
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,280
Jiang Cheng.

131
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,920
The police are here.

132
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,650
run quickly.

133
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,010
Nobody move.

134
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,860
Don't move.

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,900
Police.

136
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,340
Take them away.

137
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,570
Are you alright?

138
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,720
It's all my fault.

139
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,480
How long are you going to burden Zhi Yi?

140
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,680
If it weren't for you,

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,400
Zhi Yi wouldn't have gone through all this.

142
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,000
Daughter,

143
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,680
I was truly misguided before.

144
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,480
I haven't been a good father.

145
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,360
Your mother passed away early,

146
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,620
and I didn't take good care of you for her.

147
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,720
Daughter,

148
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,560
do you still resent me?

149
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,480
It's all my fault.

150
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,380
You've misunderstood Jiaojiao.

151
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,040
This was aimed at me.

152
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
I heard them say yesterday

153
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,330
that it's because I offended someone.

154
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,250
I suspect it's Chairman Zhang.

155
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,000
Because we touched his cake,

156
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,960
causing his raw materials to be overstocked.

157
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,160
That's why he hired people to kidnap us.

158
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,760
Uncle,

159
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,600
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,940
We wrongly blamed you.

161
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,840
I'm truly sorry.

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,480
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

163
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,240
You guys,

164
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
I understand.

165
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,000
I know you all are

166
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
trying to do what's best for my daughter.

167
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,560
Since you suspect Mr. Zhang,

168
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,680
do you have any evidence?

169
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,280
Evidence?

170
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,140
I need to talk to Mr. Zhang.

171
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,800
Zhiyi,

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
are you crazy?

173
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,440
We need to find a way

174
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,240
to get him to the police station.

175
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,040
And you actually want to talk to him?

176
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,640
Wouldn't that be dangerous?

177
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,610
Let's hear Zhiyi out first.

178
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,640
Oh, right.

179
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,850
Jiang Cheng,

180
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,200
that five million you had the other day,

181
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,460
where did it come from?

182
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,610
Go ahead.

183
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,640
What did you want to see me about?

184
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,380
Have you heard, Mr. Zhang?

185
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,440
A lot of police came to the village yesterday.

186
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,480
They even caught a

187
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,760
kidnapping gang.

188
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,600
If you called me here

189
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,880
just to discuss these boring topics,

190
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,360
I'm sorry,

191
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,280
but I have other things to do.

192
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,400
But I've heard

193
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,120
that this gang

194
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,180
is connected to President Zhang.

195
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,740
Where's Zhiyi?

196
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,400
She went to see President Zhang.

197
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,330
She really went?

198
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,890
She left a while ago.

199
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,400
What's wrong?

200
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,680
This is the recording from last night.

201
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,240
If President Zhang doesn't believe it,

202
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,600
he can listen to it himself.

203
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,280
Shen Zhiyi,

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,860
what exactly are you trying to do?

205
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,360
I can help you secure Manager Wu's order,

206
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
but on one condition:

207
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,480
you must use our raw materials.

208
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,120
No way.

209
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,680
We've put a lot of effort into this batch of raw materials.

210
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't easily

211
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,050
give them up.

212
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,480
From what I know,

213
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
that batch of your raw materials

214
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,720
doesn't have very good components, right?

215
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,320
Losing one batch of raw materials

216
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,640
but gaining a new long-term partner

217
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,380
isn't a bad deal, is it?

218
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,280
Okay.

219
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,760
I promise you.

220
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,680
Welcome back next time.

221
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,000
if you're satisfied,

222
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,640
please leave us a good review.

223
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,200
Alright.

224
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,800
Thank you.

225
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,770
Goodbye.

226
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,520
Goodbye.

227
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,320
Have the housekeepers cleaned all the rooms?

228
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,400
We have guests coming this afternoon.

229
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,880
Don't worry about it.

230
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,600
Oh, by the way,

231
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,320
Teacher Mu's room is also available now.

232
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,050
I'll list it online in a moment.

233
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,570
Mu Chen checked out?

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,480
Yes,

235
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,860
didn't he tell you?

236
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
I didn't know.
