1
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry, child.

2
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,840
I'm sorry, grandmother.

3
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,560
Are you hurt?

4
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,160
It's alright, it's alright.

5
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,400
Try it.

6
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,039
This is Yingao.

7
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,240
I loved eating this when I was little.

8
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,170
Since my grandmother passed away,

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,130
I haven't had it for a long time.

10
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you, grandmother.

11
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,000
You're welcome.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,560
Eat up.

13
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,560
After you finish,

14
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,720
you'll feel better.

15
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,479
Eat.

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,400
How is it?

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
It's really sweet.

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,800
It tastes just like it did when I was young.

19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,960
I've never asked you,

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,600
how long have you been running this shop?

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,200
It's been over twenty years.

22
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,240
Grandmother,

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,500
can I learn how to make it from you?

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
Of course.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,400
Alright.

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,020
Open it and take a look.

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,400
It's delicious, isn't it?

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,060
Delicious.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,960
Forget it.

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,250
Let's stop playing.

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,780
Let's call it a day.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,600
Damn it.

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,120
Today,

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,760
why am I so unlucky?

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,220
I didn't win a single game.

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,200
At least

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
I have you by my side.

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,160
Darling,

39
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,120
when are we going to buy that bag?

40
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,600
It's just a bag,

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,930
I'll definitely buy it for you.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,600
Baby.

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
I've been having bad luck lately.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,440
Your bag.

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,820
Let's buy it next time.

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,680
You said you'd buy me a bag.

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,400
Liar.

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,440
Baby.

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,250
I'll definitely buy you the bag next time.

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,079
Looks like I still didn't get enough money.

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,980
I need to go find her again.

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,680
Open the door.

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,850
Police inspection.

54
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,480
You said we'd be together forever.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Open the door.

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Open up! Open up!

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,120
Why did you abandon me again?

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Ding dong.

59
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,570
Do you need any service?

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,400
Together forever.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,560
Shen Zhiyi.

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,000
Come out now!

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,520
I want to check out.

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,560
There's a lunatic here.

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,280
he keeps knocking on the door.

66
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
How can we sleep with all this noise?

67
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

68
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,600
How about I upgrade your room for you?

69
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,160
No, no, that's not necessary.

70
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,760
Please just cancel my reservation.

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,490
Alright, please wait a moment.

72
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,170
How many couples is that today?

73
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,019
What are we going to do?

74
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,680
We've worked so hard to build up this business.

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,480
I hope that bloodsucker doesn't ruin everything.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,420
Don't let Zhi Yi hear you say that.

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
Shen Zhiyi.

78
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
I know you're in there.

79
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,400
Come out now.

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,580
Shen Zhiyi.

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,260
Don't hide inside.

82
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,120
Open the door.

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,880
Come out here.

84
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,720
I know you're in there.

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,040
Open up.

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
Shen Zhiyi.

87
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,440
Shen Zhiyi.

88
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,600
Why are you always hiding from your old man?

89
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,240
It's not like I'm going to eat you.

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,440
What are you doing here again?

91
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,760
Didn't I already give you 500,000?

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,680
500,000?

93
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,520
How could 500,000 be enough?

94
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,180
Don't you know your brother is getting married?

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,480
500,000.

96
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,520
500,000 is not enough.

97
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,120
That little brat needs to pay the down payment.

98
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,770
I came here this time

99
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
to ask you for

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,090
your brother's bride price money.

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,320
He's your son,

102
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
not mine.

103
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,440
Why should I pay for his bride price?

104
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,370
The eldest sister is like a mother.

105
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,770
Don't try to deny it.

106
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Give me the money.

107
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,840
No matter what,

108
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,040
He is Zhiyi's father.

109
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm also doing this for Zhiyi's sake.

110
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,000
as long as she doesn't get rid of that bloodsucker,

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,800
she won't have a single good day.

112
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,760
Bloodsucker?

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,200
What are you talking about?

114
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,260
What bloodsucker?

115
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,920
Zhiyi's father is causing trouble again.

116
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,050
Why is he here again?

117
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,720
Zhiyi is really pitiful.

118
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,760
This can't go on like this.

119
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,250
Jiang Cheng,

120
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
this time, for Zhiyi,

121
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,240
I really need to ask for your help.

122
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,680
Me?

123
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,930
Jiang Cheng,

124
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,250
are you truly sincere about Zhiyi?

125
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,250
I won't give you any more money.

126
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,120
No way.

127
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,140
I raised you with my blood, sweat, and tears.

128
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,170
You've barely achieved anything,

129
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,880
and now you're disowning me?

130
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,720
Unacceptable.

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
Only my mother raised me.

132
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,520
What have you ever done for me as a father?

133
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,850
A money-losing burden.

134
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,480
You still want love and care?

135
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,620
You're just like your mother.

136
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Don't you dare talk about my mother.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,260
If you don't leave now,

138
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
I'll call the police.

139
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,880
What?

140
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,280
You ungrateful girl!

141
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,340
What are you doing?

142
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,560
I admit I went a bit too far last time.

143
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,600
I'm afraid she might hate me.

144
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,480
Are you stupid?

145
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,200
If she really hated you,

146
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,730
would she let you stay here?

147
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
You've grown so capable you don't even recognize your own father.

148
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,080
Look at me.

149
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,960
Try that again.

150
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,480
Zhi Yi, are you alright?

151
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,120
Look at your miserable state.

152
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,980
Who are you putting on this life-and-death act for?

153
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
After this slap,

154
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,880
I'll no longer owe you anything.

155
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,900
From now on, we're strangers.

156
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,920
What?

157
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,020
Come back here!

158
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
Zhiyi, what's wrong?

159
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,040
Did he hit you?

160
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,080
What?

161
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,160
Do you want a slap too?

162
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,920
Look at me.

163
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,450
I'll fight you to the death!

164
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,770
Shen Jianjun, don't go too far!

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,260
I'm warning you, don't touch my friends!

166
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,970
You little brat.

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,200
You've recovered from your illness, huh?

168
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,330
How dare you push me?

169
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
I'll teach you a lesson.

170
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,920
Enough!

171
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,360
All these years,

172
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,600
I've been trying so hard to escape.

173
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,960
Everything I've done was to forget the pain you caused me.

174
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,320
I've finally managed to run this far away.

175
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,050
I have my own family now.

176
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
I thought I could finally

177
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
live like a normal person at last.

178
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,560
If you dare to cause trouble here again,

179
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,520
I'll call the police and have you arrested.

180
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,320
You dare to call the police on me?

181
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,820
I'll beat you to death!

182
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,840
Dad,

183
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,840
I really

184
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,760
I've really done all I can.

185
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,800
I'm begging you,

186
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,440
please leave.

187
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,360
Come back!

188
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,220
Come back here!

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,120
Get back here!

190
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
I see you're Zhi Yi's father.

191
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,690
I won't lay a hand on you,

192
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,919
but I advise you to behave yourself.

193
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,370
What do you want?

194
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,080
You're not allowed to bully Zhi Yi anymore.

195
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,600
Zhi Yi!

196
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,560
You just wait!

197
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,930
I won't let you off the hook!

198
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,960
Get out of here, quick!

199
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,490
Get lost!

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,560
Leave now!

201
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,440
Hurry up and go!

202
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,820
Get out of here, quick!

203
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,450
Thank you all for today.

204
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,400
Don't mention it.

205
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,240
If you need anything in the future,

206
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,960
just call us.

207
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,490
Alright!

208
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,250
Please, everyone, go home for now.

209
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay,

210
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
let's all head back.

211
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,520
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

212
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,120
Goodbye.

213
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,080
Bye-bye.

214
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,880
Let us know if you need anything.

215
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,080
Thank you all.

216
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,480
That wasn't me speaking like that just now.

217
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,800
I'm actually quite gentle.

218
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,520
I know.

219
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,170
I wonder how Zhi Yi is doing now.

220
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,280
Don't worry.

221
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,480
Jiang Cheng will bring her back safely.

222
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,980
I'm really not at ease about Jiang Cheng.

223
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,240
Zhi Yi.

224
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm tired.

225
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,610
I'll go back and rest first.

226
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,620
Go ahead and cry if you want to.

227
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,440
There's no one else here.

228
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Everyone's here.

229
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,220
Where's Zhi Yi?

230
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,600
Zhi Yi.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,480
Zhi Yi.

232
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,040
The rash is gone.

233
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
It's really gone.

234
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
It seems so.

235
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,120
Ma Yi.

236
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,920
Try it.

237
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:44,960
Okay.

238
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
It's really gone.

239
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
I guess this is a blessing in disguise.

240
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,130
This is the only good thing Old Shen has ever done.

241
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,120
We should celebrate properly tonight.

242
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,400
To celebrate Zhi Yi's return to normal life.

243
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,480
We should indeed celebrate.

244
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,040
Jiao Jiao,

245
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,640
tonight,

246
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,360
cook us some delicious dishes.

247
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,020
Sure thing!

248
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,450
Thank you all so much for today.

249
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,240
Really.
