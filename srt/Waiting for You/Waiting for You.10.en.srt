1
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,600
As An Jin's good friend,

2
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,600
if he dares to be a scumbag,

3
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,000
we'll tear him apart.

4
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Everyone's here.

5
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,280
I just heard you talking about tearing something.

6
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,880
Together?

7
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,680
Tear.

8
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,560
tear.

9
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,900
tear apart.

10
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,120
we were saying we'd

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
eat hand-pulled chicken together.

12
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,160
Right?

13
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
We're out of chicken,

14
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,120
but I did buy a duck.

15
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,200
Let's eat together.

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,530
Come on, old classmate.

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,200
Thank you.

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,360
Actually,

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,330
I want to ask you for a favor.

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,620
As you know,

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
I've been pursuing Lin Anjin lately.

22
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,520
So,

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,280
I'd like to ask you all

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,340
to put in a good word for me with Anjin.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,250
Okay?

26
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,250
I'm counting on you all.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,560
Okay?

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,600
Please, old classmate.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,730
I'm counting on you.

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,480
Alright.

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,680
Thank you.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,140
Thanks.

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,620
Please.

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,570
It's delicious.

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,600
Thank you.

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,010
See, what did I tell you?

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,600
Heading for An Jin, I suppose.

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,400
So now we

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,800
what's our first step?

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,960
The first step

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,480
is to find those two thugs.

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,579
Ask them

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,680
about their relationship with Jiang Chuyang.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,600
If we find those two,

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,329
everything will become clear.

46
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,320
But where do we look for them?

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,840
That, I

48
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,210
really don't know where they've gone.

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,320
Is there any surveillance footage?

50
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,120
Yes, there is.

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,620
Waiting for me?

52
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,060
I'm exhausted.

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,840
Today I took the guests from the homestay to the mountaintop.

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,760
It wore me out.

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,290
Take a break.

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,820
Where's Jiaojiao?

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,480
Jiaojiao went to Ma Yi's place.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,520
It's just us.

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,880
Let's eat.

60
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,800
An Jin,

61
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
I was thinking...

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,480
could I move into your suite?

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,400
Live with you?

64
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,320
Come here.

65
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,880
I'm afraid it might not be appropriate.

66
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,050
I'd feel more at ease if I were with you.

67
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,700
your room is so big.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
You live there alone.

69
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,140
I'm really worried you might get scared.

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,100
My room isn't that big.

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,640
You see, our homestay business is doing so well now.

72
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,770
you're all getting busier and busier.

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,420
I'm really concerned about your health.

74
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
If I move here,

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,680
I can take good care of you,

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,940
and help you with work.

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,680
Then you just...

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,080
An Jin,

79
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,120
you guys...

80
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,260
This roast duck is really delicious.

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,200
It's fragrant, isn't it?

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,960
I specially asked him to bring it back from the city.

83
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,800
Try it while it's hot.

84
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,260
Come on,

85
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,450
Alright.

86
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,240
Think of something.

87
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,840
hurry.

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,920
An Jin,

89
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,090
can I stay at your place for a while?

90
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,480
What's wrong?

91
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,560
Well...

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,440
She hasn't been doing well lately.

93
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,800
So I took her to see a doctor.

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,440
The doctor said her mental...

95
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,400
...health is problematic.

96
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,000
She's ill.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,360
Yes.

98
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,420
She can't be alone.

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,520
I've been observing...

100
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,200
...Zhi Yi's condition seems fine these days, doesn't it?

101
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,130
What's going on?

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,120
It's okay.

103
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,440
My place is spacious.

104
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,170
You can just keep staying here.

105
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,320
Okay.

106
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:12,850
Well,

107
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:13,800
I

108
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,720
let's eat.

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
We're all hungry.

110
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,640
Eat.

111
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,160
An Jin,

112
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,160
actually,

113
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,640
I have something else to ask of you.

114
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,600
What is it now?

115
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,080
It's about my little brother.

116
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,740
He's sick and in the hospital.

117
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,960
I've already given him all my money,

118
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,490
lent him everything I have.

119
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,420
But it's still not enough.

120
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,010
What's he sick with?

121
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,800
Leukemia.

122
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,480
That's so serious.

123
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,800
Illness is a serious matter.

124
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,060
We need to diagnose and treat it quickly.

125
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,330
He has already started chemotherapy.

126
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,040
I have all the bills here.

127
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,540
That's not necessary.

128
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,680
How much

129
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,000
do you still need?

130
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,940
One hundred thousand.

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,480
I don't have

132
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,960
that much liquid capital on hand right now.

133
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,920
Look,

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
I know this,

135
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,410
I shouldn't have asked you in the first place.

136
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,200
Stay calm.

137
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,300
But I really have no other choice.

138
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,260
Please help me.

139
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,640
How about this,

140
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,640
I'll transfer you twenty thousand.

141
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,760
Just to tide you over for now.

142
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,490
Is that okay?

143
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,850
Alright.

144
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,360
We'll take it one day at a time.

145
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,120
Listen to me.

146
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,820
Did you receive it?

147
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Thank you, An Jin.

148
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
It's nothing, don't worry about it.

149
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,640
It's okay.

150
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,280
Let's eat.

151
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,640
Eat.

152
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,880
Eat.

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,680
Have something to eat.

154
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,280
It's alright.

155
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,610
Things will get better.

156
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,100
Let's get started.

157
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,580
Fellow villagers,

158
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,840
You said Jiang Chuyang owes us that money.

159
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
When will he pay us back?

160
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,170
When can he give it to us?

161
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,020
Listen.

162
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,120
He's about to leave our Nanling Village.

163
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
Here.

164
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,680
We especially thank him for his generous spending.

165
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,610
He has made a contribution to our rural development.

166
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,580
We hope he will visit our Nanling Village again.

167
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,640
What is he trying to do?

168
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,240
He's trying to run.

169
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Go after him. Let's go, let's go.

170
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,320
Let's...

171
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,600
...sing him a song.

172
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,560
What are you two trying to do?

173
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,220
Jiang Chuyang, come out here!

174
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,420
It's those two.

175
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,220
Jiang Chuyang.

176
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,330
He's over there.

177
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,040
Come here.

178
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,760
Let's go.

179
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,820
What are you doing?

180
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,650
Stand still.

181
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,490
What are you guys doing?

182
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,240
You've been discharged from the hospital?

183
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,640
Don't give me that useless talk.

184
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,960
What's going on with you?

185
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,090
Why are you running?

186
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,570
You must be that rich woman Jiang Chuyang hooked up with.

187
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,000
Didn't I tell you three days?

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
What's the rush?

189
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,480
Hurry up and pay us our wages.

190
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,320
800 per day.

191
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,000
One week.

192
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,880
5,600.

193
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,520
And there's the car rental fee.

194
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,640
And the compensation for lost work hasn't been paid.

195
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,040
Jiang Chuyang.

196
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,560
Pay up.

197
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Wait a minute.

198
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,200
What money are you talking about?

199
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,360
His purpose for coming here

200
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,620
was just to scam money.

201
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,520
Beautiful lady,

202
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm afraid you're still in the dark about this.

203
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,039
Jiang Chuyang,

204
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,280
he's just a con artist.

205
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,120
He got close to you

206
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,520
just to scam your money.

207
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,440
An Jin,

208
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,920
don't listen to them.

209
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,780
Let me explain.

210
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,600
Zhiyi.

211
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,160
Zhiyi.

212
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,320
Zhiyi.

213
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,640
For the sake of our old classmate relationship,

214
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,280
can you put in a good word for me?

215
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,040
To think that Jiang Cheng said you were a con artist at first, and I didn't believe him.

216
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,100
That car was rented by you too, right?

217
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,180
You really went all out to deceive us.

218
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,920
You two, take him away quickly.

219
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,560
Don't let my guests here see this.

220
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,620
Let's go, let's go.

221
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,360
Hurry up.

222
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:07,960
No.

223
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,170
Let's go.

224
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,600
Alright, alright.

225
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,160
Really.

226
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
At this point,

227
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,560
there's no need for me to pretend anymore.

228
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:16,960
Yes.

229
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,120
I don't truly like An Jin.

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,660
Because...

231
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,780
It's you I love, Zhiyi.

232
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,720
Scumbag.

233
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,560
Let's go.

234
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,000
Jiaojiao,

235
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,170
you knew all along, didn't you?

236
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,280
I was just afraid of hurting you.

237
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,000
Men are all no good.

238
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,880
Okay.

239
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,520
Let's just let this go.

240
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,000
Only the bond between us sisters

241
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,760
is real.

242
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,560
Our guesthouse must

243
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,120
get better and better.

244
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,560
No chemistry.

245
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,660
It's settled then.

246
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,770
Alright.

247
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,920
Event

248
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,240
planning proposal.

249
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,840
What's wrong?

250
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,240
My dad is coming to see me.

251
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,330
It's them again.

252
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,720
Why don't we call the police?

253
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
Report them for harassment.

254
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,680
Watch me.

255
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,840
I can't go on.

256
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,490
He usually looks so arrogant and hateful.

257
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
now he's lying here so quietly,

258
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,880
I'm not used to it.

259
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,680
Are you Shen Jianjun's family?

260
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,040
Yes.

261
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,280
His emergency treatment is over.

262
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,010
You can go in and talk to him now.

263
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:30,960
Dad.

264
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,570
How are you, Dad?

265
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,010
Are you feeling better?

266
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,400
You...

267
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,050
You want to find Wen Tao?

268
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:45,960
Sixty thousand.

269
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,400
Pong!

270
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,540
This hand is really...

271
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,320
Hello?

272
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,490
Shen Wentao.

273
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,640
Dad is sick.

274
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,120
He wants you to come see him.

275
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,880
I'm busy.

276
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,600
I don't have time to come.

277
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
Do you have any conscience left?

278
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,280
You're sick.

279
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,800
Nagging all day long.

280
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,120
Hurry up.

281
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
Who's being so annoying?

282
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,960
My sister.

283
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,560
Dad,

284
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,320
Shen Wentao

285
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,640
has something to do today,

286
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
and can't make it.

287
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,960
Please stay here and take care of yourself.

288
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,250
Nan Feng.

289
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,560
What?

290
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,600
Are you crazy?

291
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
Dad is still lying in the hospital.

292
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,820
And you're here playing mahjong?

293
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,810
Shen Wentao,

294
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,160
are you even human?

295
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,040
I don't have any money.

296
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,640
What can I do at the hospital?

297
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,650
You're sick.

298
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,080
What does this have to do with having money or not?

299
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,280
This is your duty.

300
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm not like you.

301
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,960
I don't like to play these melodramatic roles.

302
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,240
I

303
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
If you give me money,

304
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,980
I'll go to the hospital with you right now to show filial piety.

305
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,240
How dare you hit me!
