1
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,640
Zhi Yi.

2
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,140
You're finally awake.

3
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,400
There was a big fire in the rehearsal room last night.

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,860
you and Jiang Cheng almost

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,640
didn't make it.

6
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,440
This...

7
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,170
I changed your clothes for you.

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,840
How did I get back?

9
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,979
Jiang Cheng brought you back.

10
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,490
Jiang Cheng.

11
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,120
Zhi Yi.

12
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,759
Zhi Yi.

13
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,410
Are you feeling better?

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,360
Are you alright?

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm fine.

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,050
I'm okay.

17
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,810
Zhi Yi, take it easy.

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,170
I'm really fine now.

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,360
The door to the rehearsal room

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,160
must have been locked by the old security guard.

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,889
He didn't know you were inside.

22
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,880
No wonder.

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,480
I thought someone had locked it on purpose.

24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,920
I thought Jiaojiao had locked it.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
I didn't lock the door.

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,650
I don't have the key either.

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,920
This rehearsal room,

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,320
how could it just catch fire out of nowhere?

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
I think I saw a ghost.

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,440
it just floated by,

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,280
in a line.

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,050
Don't you dare scare me.

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,000
It's true.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,079
Someone must be playing tricks.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,720
They even dare to set fires so brazenly.

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,800
That fire...

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,560
I set it.

38
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,200
Ah!

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,880
You set it?

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,500
No, it's not like that.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,360
Zhiyi said she saw a ghost.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,840
I've never encountered this kind of situation before.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,520
I panicked...

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,760
...and threw my lighter over there.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,880
Who knew the clothes would catch fire?

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,760
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,810
I've caused trouble for everyone.

48
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,720
I'm sorry, Secretary Ma.

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,120
the village's losses...

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,240
We will compensate for them.

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,200
Well, this is just great.

52
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
We didn't make any money,

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,760
and now we have to pay compensation.

54
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,480
It's okay.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,720
As long as everyone is safe, that's what matters.

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,380
We can always earn more money.

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
Fortunately, the firefighters arrived in time.

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,930
There wasn't any major damage.

59
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,800
I won't dare to play with fire next time.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,320
My name is Wang Meili.

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,640
I'm from our village,

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,930
the sister in charge of the information station.

63
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,120
Everyone also calls me

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,440
Universe.

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,520
The top gossip girl.

66
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,560
That's right.

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,120
I'm the one who knows the juiciest gossip.

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,160
And I'm the most sincere person you'll ever meet.

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,480
Gossip Girl, Gossip Girl,

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
oh yeah!

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,570
Does everyone understand now?

72
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,160
Quick, quick, quick!

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,490
What's going on?

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,280
Come on.

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,640
Have you heard?

76
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,610
Last night, right here,

77
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,760
there was a fire.

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,320
What?

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,040
You didn't know?

80
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
There were so many fire trucks here last night.

81
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,440
It was a huge fire!

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,920
I saw it with my own eyes.

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
That Shen Zhiyi

84
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,490
was carried out of the rehearsal room by a man.

85
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,690
Tell me, tell me.

86
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
A single man and woman, late at night,

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
together,

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,920
what could they be doing?

89
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,560
Right?

90
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,160
I guess they were rehearsing Yue Opera.

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,600
Yue Opera?

92
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
How is that possible?

93
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,200
What Yue Opera?

94
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,440
Think about it.

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,080
At their age,

96
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,480
still unmarried,

97
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,920
a single man and woman,

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,920
always together.

99
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,800
But I reckon

100
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,159
they must be a couple.

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,280
They're definitely married.

102
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,560
Right?

103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Mm, yes, yes, yes.

104
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,540
Hey, quick, quick!

105
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,159
Let's go see what's happening.

106
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,160
Come on, let's go!

107
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
You must be Zhiyi's husband, right?

108
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,400
No, I'm not.

109
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,520
Don't misunderstand.

110
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,720
I... we haven't reached that stage yet.

111
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,040
Wang Dama told me everything.

112
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,360
Please don't listen to her nonsense.

113
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,160
It's not true.

114
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,760
He's just my schoolmate.

115
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,480
You see,

116
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Zhiyi is so beautiful,

117
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,880
and so capable.

118
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,560
You better cherish her well.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,730
How did it get spread like this?

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,360
Aunt Li,

121
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,120
we have something to do, so we'll be going now.

122
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,780
Please, don't let us keep you.

123
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Auntie Li,

124
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,020
spread the word, spread the word.

125
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,920
Young man,

126
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,880
remember to cherish her, okay?

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,480
Oh, okay.

128
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,520
Bye-bye.

129
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,050
Grandma,

130
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,680
we have a Yue Opera performance tomorrow.

131
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
Remember to come and watch, okay?

132
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,480
Oh, okay.

133
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,120
Opera.

134
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,080
I heard there's a Yue Opera performance.

135
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,960
Yes, uncle,

136
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,840
we have a Yue Opera performance tonight.

137
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,880
It's 'The Butterfly Lovers.'

138
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,600
It's especially stunning.

139
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,440
You must come.

140
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,960
It's been many years since I've seen a play.

141
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,400
Indeed,

142
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,040
so don't miss it if you're passing by.

143
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,640
You must come, we'll be waiting for you.

144
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,320
Young lady,

145
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,080
there will be peanuts and sunflower seeds to share in the evening.

146
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,800
Tonight, we'll have more than just peanuts and sunflower seeds.

147
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,880
There will be various snacks as well.

148
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,680
You must come.

149
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,100
Ah, that's wonderful!

150
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,320
Okay.

151
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,380
Get me one too, please.

152
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,160
I want to go too.

153
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,760
Sure.

154
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,540
I'll definitely wait for you.

155
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,160
Brother Liang,

156
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,160
If Yingtai were a lady in red,

157
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,360
Ninth Sister would resemble you.

158
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:35,760
Reluctant to part at farewell.

159
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,120
How did you forget again?

160
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,280
Oh my, our Zhiyi is amazing!

161
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,900
you learned it so quickly,

162
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,409
and you sing so well too.

163
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,159
Why don't you compliment me as well?

164
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,360
You have the nerve to say that after forgetting the lyrics?

165
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,600
Hurry up and practice, the performance is tonight.

166
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,860
You're not bad either.

167
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,560
Really?

168
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,920
Yes, yes, yes.

169
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,560
Alright.

170
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,800
Let's go prepare the stage.

171
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,240
Good luck.

172
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,770
Let's go.

173
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,570
Let's go.

174
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,570
Let's go.

175
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,120
Brother Liang,

176
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,000
There's a well right in front of us.

177
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,440
I wonder how deep the water is.

178
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,000
Look at those two shadows at the bottom of the well.

179
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,360
I am clearly

180
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,600
Hurry up, brother.

181
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
a man,

182
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,120
why do you compare me to a woman?

183
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,760
Okay.

184
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you, everyone.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,400
okay.

186
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,840
Thank you.

187
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,200
Zhiyi.

188
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,080
Zhiyi.

189
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,920
Zhiyi.
