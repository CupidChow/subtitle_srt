1
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,720
An Jin.

2
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,690
It's for you.

3
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,010
Give it to me.

4
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,650
Who told you to pick my flowers?

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,760
It's not like that.

6
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,690
What do you mean by 'your flowers'?

7
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Did you pick them from the roadside?

8
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,280
Well...

9
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,210
just over there.

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,240
I planted them.

11
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,570
It's just a few flowers.

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,520
At worst, I can pay for them.

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,520
You think money solves everything?

14
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,759
I'll replant them for you.

15
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,289
That should be fine, right?

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,970
Your friend?

17
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,450
Zhi Yi's classmate.

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,240
Fine.

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,460
You said it.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,810
Have them planted by tomorrow.

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,640
Tomorrow?

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,780
Yes, tomorrow.

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,720
Tomorrow it is, then.

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,040
Since you've already picked them,

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,570
you might as well keep them.

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,690
What kind of person are you?

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,570
Do you like them?

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,290
You should keep them for yourself.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,400
What's wrong?

30
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,680
Netizens are saying our rice is full of weevils.

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,210
It's completely inedible.

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,800
For your own selfish interests, you harm the public good. Your actions are unforgivable!

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,960
How could this be?

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,280
That's not right.

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,800
We personally inspected all this rice before shipping it.

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,240
This shouldn't be happening.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,800
Indeed.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,520
The rating has dropped to 3.3.

39
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,840
Could someone be maliciously giving bad reviews?

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,520
look, they're all

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,320
new accounts.

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,520
Why don't we

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
delete all these negative reviews?

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,400
From these photos, it does appear to be our terrace rice.

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
These accounts aren't bots.

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
We need to respond positively.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,130
Otherwise, people will criticize us.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,240
Contact the accounts that left negative reviews.

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,280
If there really is a quality issue with our product,

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,540
we should promptly compensate them or send replacements.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,680
Boss Jiang,

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,370
Your hairstyle has really taken off since I last saw you.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,640
Me? Taken off?

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,400
What do you mean by taken off?

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,930
I've been planting flowers for Secretary Ma.

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,980
I'm exhausted.

57
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,340
You're so useless.

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,720
No, that's not true.

59
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,160
My body is in great shape.

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
This is nothing.

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,680
Look.

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,800
It's nothing.

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,130
Look.

64
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:53,920
Hello?

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,850
Brother,

66
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,120
your trick is brilliant.

67
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,320
The rotten grain from several years

68
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,580
has all been sold by us.

69
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,920
That's right.

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm different from Ma Yi.

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,180
As the village secretary,

72
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
he favors outsiders.

73
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,780
I sincerely want to help the villagers earn more money.

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,680
Brother, won't this

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,560
be discovered?

76
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,279
Who knew this was what you were selling?

77
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,010
We found out.

78
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,000
What did you find out?

79
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,600
That batch of substandard rice

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,480
was from Jiang Dahai.

81
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,600
It was produced with those farmers' households in Jiangxi.

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
Jiang Dahai again?

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,920
Unbelievable.

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,080
Those farmer households

85
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,840
are all Jiang Dahai's relatives.

86
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,840
He's also a part of Nanling Village.

87
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,970
Why does he keep ruining Nanling Village's reputation?

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm afraid he wants us to fail to fulfill our agreement

89
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,050
so he can take back our guesthouse.

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,460
He's really gone crazy for money.

91
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,840
What should we do now?

92
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,320
Let's quickly go find Zhi Yi and Jiang Cheng.

93
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,960
We'll go seek revenge on Jiang Dahai.

94
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,490
Let's go.

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,700
Come on.

96
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
You guys go ahead.

97
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,720
That guy called something Hai

98
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,580
leave him to me.

99
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll go gather some people.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,860
I have more brothers than they do.

101
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,940
Big brother always has a plan.

102
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,160
Everyone's here.

103
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,220
What are you doing?

104
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,970
Can't you see we're eating?

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:17,920
Zhi Yi,

106
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,440
what do you think we should do with them?

107
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,400
I'll take care of it.

108
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,200
Brother Wang,

109
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,980
we're neighbors here.

110
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,450
We didn't want things to get this ugly.

111
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,760
This moldy rice.

112
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,100
They were all found in your rice bags.

113
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,130
How do you explain this?

114
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,040
You've sold so much rice.

115
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:38,159
What evidence do you have to prove this is what we sold?

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We have evidence.

117
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,000
The evidence is that each bag has our product number on it.

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,400
We have checked each one.

119
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,640
All the problematic rice

120
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
came from your place.

121
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,770
I was going to give you another chance.

122
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,060
Since that's the case,

123
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,980
let's not cooperate anymore.

124
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,600
Why don't we call the police?

125
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,400
Don't call the police.

126
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,159
We promise we'll never dare to do it again.

127
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,520
You.

128
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,480
You ungrateful bastard.

129
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,010
Let's go.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,530
Brother.

131
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,120
I've already arranged for those rice orders to be resent.

132
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,320
Fortunately, we stopped the losses in time.

133
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,200
But.

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,880
some customers who didn't have quality issues

135
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,440
have also left us quite a few negative reviews.

136
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,200
What do you think?

137
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,400
Could Jiang Dahai be behind this again?

138
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,400
I don't think it's him.

139
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,880
He wouldn't come up with this kind of method.

140
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,480
Jiaojiao,

141
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,680
do you think it could be

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,940
malicious competition from our rivals?

143
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,040
It's not impossible.

144
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,960
Since the quality issue has been resolved,

145
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,680
I think

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,000
we can put the negative reviews aside for now.

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,720
I believe

148
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,530
good quality

149
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,880
will definitely win consumers' trust.

150
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,600
An Jin.

151
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,120
The tour group has arranged a two-day package tour to Nanling for us.

152
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,180
It's selling well.

153
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,400
That's great.

154
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,920
Once the tour group arrives,

155
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,000
the traffic to our village will increase.

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Grandma Sun's products can be sold,

157
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,850
and the villagers can earn a good amount of money.

158
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
When will the tour group bring people here?

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,600
I think it's

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
this weekend.

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,880
Dear passengers,

162
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,640
We have arrived at the picturesque Nanling Village.

163
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,770
Please gather your belongings and follow me off the bus.

164
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,880
This way.

165
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,040
Look at how beautiful the weather is.

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,570
The scenery is really nice.

167
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,200
Careful.

168
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,660
Come, this way.

169
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,560
Our first stop in Nanling Village.

170
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,020
We're about to visit the thousand-year-old terraced fields.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hello, everyone!

172
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm currently at

173
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,760
the Hillside Companion Guesthouse in Nanling Village.

174
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,560
A couple of days ago,

175
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,040
those who bought our two-day tour package

176
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,200
will be arriving today.

177
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,640
I'm

178
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,360
Jiaojiao,

179
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,280
waiting here to welcome everyone.

180
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Foodie Jiaojiao.

181
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,810
It's really you!

182
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm such a big fan of yours.

183
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,720
Can I take a picture with you?

184
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,360
Sure.

185
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm

186
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,400
I'm

187
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank you.

188
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,880
Have a pleasant journey.

189
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,920
Check-in, please.

190
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,240
Hello.

191
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,920
Welcome.

192
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,800
We'd like to check in.

193
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,960
I'm sorry, we're fully booked at the moment.

194
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,680
Could you help us contact other guesthouses then?

195
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,880
Please wait a moment.

196
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,280
Hello, Ma Yi.

197
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,960
Can you check for me

198
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,560
if there are any rooms available at other guesthouses?

199
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,160
An Jin.

200
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,520
It's completely full.

201
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,600
All rooms are occupied.

202
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,559
We really can't accommodate any more.

203
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,159
Oh, right.

204
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,159
Could you please notify Jiaojiao for me?

205
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,799
The reporters from Yucheng TV station will be here soon for an interview.

206
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,280
Okay.

207
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,559
I'm sorry.

208
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,600
There are no other rooms available either.

209
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Alright then.

210
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,330
Let's go.

211
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,440
Jiaojiao.

212
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,120
Jiaojiao, come here quickly.

213
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,880
Good news.

214
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
You're going to be famous.

215
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,560
Ma Yi said the TV station will come to interview you in a couple of days.

216
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,360
Interview?

217
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,800
This hand needs to go down further.

218
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Further down.

219
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,120
Slowly, slowly squeeze it back.

220
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,400
Squeeze and release at the same time.

221
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,860
Slower.

222
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,400
When everyone is pulling,

223
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,540
you must go slowly.

224
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,080
That's right.

225
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,940
Just like this.

226
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,500
Slower.

227
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,810
What's going on?

228
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,320
Mom.

229
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,760
Could you come back in a few days?

230
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,420
There are just too many tourists in the village.

231
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,280
Jiaojiao.

232
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
The guesthouse suddenly lost power.

233
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,400
I'll call Ma Yi.

234
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,680
Why isn't he answering?

235
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,610
The power's out.

236
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Did the circuit breaker trip?

237
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,240
I don't know.

238
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
I tried flipping the switch, but it didn't work.

239
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,880
He must be at the village committee office.

240
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,720
I have an interview later.

241
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,780
You go ahead first.

242
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,480
Alright.

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,140
I'll go ask.

244
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,040
How's it going with that rich lady?

245
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,600
Is it going to work out or not?

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Of course it will.

247
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,440
When your brother Jiang takes action,

248
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,720
there's never been a time when it didn't work.

249
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,320
Don't give us this useless talk.

250
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,760
When are we going to get paid?

251
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,040
Yeah, and what about the car rental fee?

252
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
The car rental company is already chasing us for payment.

253
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,840
That's right.

254
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,040
Why don't you cover it first?

255
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,000
Jiang Chuyang,

256
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,320
the organization has entrusted you with such an important task.

257
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,360
You can't keep focusing on this small amount of money right in front of you.

258
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,760
Right?

259
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,740
Three days.

260
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,570
Give me three more days.

261
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,000
I promise I'll take you two

262
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,260
to enjoy the good life.

263
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,770
Don't worry, Zhiyi.

264
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,160
The village won't experience power outages anymore.

265
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,880
I've arranged for new transformers to be installed.

266
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,440
Anjin.

267
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,600
Anjin.

268
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,540
Where's Anjin?

269
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Anjin just took some guests to stay at Auntie Li's house.

270
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,480
he hasn't come back yet.

271
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,540
What's the matter?

272
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
Guess who I saw at the village entrance.

273
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,170
who did I see?

274
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,440
Who was it?

275
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Who?

276
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,410
Tell us quickly!

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
That old classmate of yours.

278
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
He was with two thugs.

279
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,520
Thugs?

280
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,240
Here you go again.

281
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,880
Why do you always gossip about others behind their backs?

282
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,240
He doesn't look like a good person at all.

283
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
You should trust a man's intuition.

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,240
Is it Ma Yi?

285
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,920
Yes.

286
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,040
What good person?

287
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,100
Stealing flowers?

288
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,380
What were they doing at that time?

289
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,410
I didn't hear that clearly.

290
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,320
It seemed like they were talking about something.

291
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,650
Something about money.

292
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm just worried that Anjin might be deceived.

293
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,720
Whether it's true or not,

294
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,240
I think

295
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,760
we need to warn An Jin.

296
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,840
Come back.

297
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,960
come back.

298
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,760
We don't have any evidence.

299
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,720
What if it's a misunderstanding? That would be so awkward.

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,050
I saw it with my own eyes.

301
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,840
Jiang Cheng,

302
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,170
did you take any photos?

303
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,600
I didn't.

304
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
I had just taken out my phone

305
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
when he disappeared.

306
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,240
As An Jin's good friend,

307
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,200
if he dares to be a scumbag,

308
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
we'll tear him apart.

309
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Everyone's here.

310
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,800
I just heard you talking about tearing something?

311
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,240
Let's do it together.
