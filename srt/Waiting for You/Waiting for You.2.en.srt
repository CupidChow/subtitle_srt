1
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,400
This...

2
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,240
We'll report it to the township.

3
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,120
Let them come.

4
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,810
Through this application.

5
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,220
Which one of you is the secretary?

6
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,120
I am.

7
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
How should I address you?

8
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,090
Ma Yi is fine.

9
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,880
Secretary Ma,

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,440
come,

11
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,240
look.

12
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,920
After my careful calculations,

13
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,960
a meteorite is about to fall in our village.

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
The location is the rapeseed field next to the guesthouse.

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
I've already marked it.

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,400
Quickly notify the villagers.

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,060
Get ready to pack up and leave.

18
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,410
What did you say?

19
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,700
Meteor... meteorite.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,380
Are you a new employee at the guesthouse?

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,880
My name is Jiang Cheng.

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,540
I forgot to introduce myself.

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,080
This is a serious matter.

24
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,880
We can't afford to waste any time.

25
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,080
We only have about twenty hours left.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,200
we only have about twenty hours,

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,120
this meteorite is about to fall.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,000
Quickly notify the villagers.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,460
Really.

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,690
Otherwise, it will be too late.

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,970
Jiang Cheng, right?

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,120
Are you deliberately trying to cause trouble in the village?

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,780
I truly want to save everyone.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,079
They don't believe me at all.

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,050
Zhi Yi is still here.

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,020
we can't just leave like this.

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
I must save everyone.

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,800
Boss Shen,

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
everyone expanded their planting because of the old village chief,

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,040
expanded their planting,

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,880
you initially said it would be four yuan per jin,

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
but now you're not buying?

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,400
Buy it!

44
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,000
Why aren't you buying anymore?

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,200
I'm just here to help.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,320
I also hoped everyone could earn more money.

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Things turning out this way

48
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,520
is not what I wanted either.

49
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,850
I really have no choice.

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,440
Dahai,

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,880
let's just forget it.

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,080
Boss Shen was just trying to help us sell our vegetables.

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,960
Let's go.

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,520
I despise you people,

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,980
who bully the common folk,

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
you capitalists.

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,170
Two yuan per jin.

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,680
Fellow villagers can't even recover their costs.

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,760
all the losses here

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,320
should be your responsibility, right?

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,450
Why should I bear the responsibility?

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,040
What's going on here?

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,640
I suggested to the village elder

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
that the village could grow more organic vegetables.

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,320
I even found a vegetable buyer for them.

66
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
But who would have thought

67
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,440
that when it was time to harvest,

68
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,200
the vegetable buyer

69
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,730
suddenly only wanted to buy this batch of cabbage at a low price.

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
Didn't they sign a contract?

71
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,120
They did sign one,

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
but the price in the contract

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,800
was set based on the market price at that time.

74
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,360
Who knew the price of cabbage would suddenly plummet these past few days?

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,440
That's how it turned out.

76
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,000
Doing business

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,660
inherently comes with risks.

78
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,920
Boss Shen didn't take any advantage of you,

79
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,320
how can you turn around and try to extort me?

80
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Boss Shen,

81
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,360
we know we shouldn't be coming to you about this,

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,820
but we're at our wits' end.

83
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,080
If possible,

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,120
could you help us find some more sales channels?

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,200
Yes, Xiao Shen,

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,160
we're all from the same village now.

87
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,720
Dahai may be a bit rough,

88
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,600
but he's thinking about our village's interests.

89
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,330
Let's not get angry, everyone.

90
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,959
Old Zhang, Old Wang,

91
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,040
don't speak up for her.

92
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,000
She should take full responsibility for this matter.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,399
How can I be responsible?

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,240
I know

95
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,520
I'll definitely help if there's anything I can do,

96
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,050
but this really isn't something I can handle.

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
What do you mean by helping everyone?

98
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,020
Let me tell you,

99
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,800
you were the one who led everyone to sign the contract for this matter.

100
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,440
I'm only holding you responsible for this.

101
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,900
Otherwise, how am I supposed to explain this to the villagers?

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,210
Brother,

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,450
Jiang Dahai,

104
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
you all saw the contract.

105
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,520
You all signed it voluntarily.

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,320
Why are you bothering Zhiyi now?

107
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,970
Exactly.

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,960
How can you be so unreasonable?

109
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,320
What about the villagers then?

110
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
If there's anything, we can figure it out together.

111
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,600
You're pushing all the responsibility onto Zhiyi now.

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,040
Is this how you handle things?

113
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,920
You people,

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,800
are all liars.

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
There's no time left.

116
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,040
What do you mean there's no time left?

117
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,500
Are you trying to run away?

118
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,690
Brother,

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
I heard what you were just talking about.

120
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
I understand it now.

121
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
This batch of cabbage,

122
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,680
if it's not urgent,

123
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,000
let's put it aside for now.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
There's something more urgent now.

125
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,010
We all need to run for our lives.

126
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Run for our lives?

127
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,610
Are you messing with me?

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,170
My dear brother,

129
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,380
let me tell you all,

130
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
if this matter isn't resolved today,

131
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,520
no one is leaving this place.

132
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,640
There's no other way.

133
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I'll sell this batch of vegetables.

134
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
You'll sell it?

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,060
Awesome, brother!

136
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,170
Alright.

137
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,300
Let me tell you all,

138
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,800
it doesn't matter who sells the vegetables.

139
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,260
But I'm laying it out here,

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,800
kid,

141
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,440
if you can't sell all these vegetables,

142
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,640
you'll bear all the losses by yourself.

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,330
Let's go.

144
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,840
You sell.

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,530
How are you going to sell it?

146
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,880
I have a friend who runs a supermarket.

147
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,480
It's fine.

148
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,500
What are you busy with?

149
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm not busy right now, buddy.

150
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,960
If you have anything to say, just go ahead.

151
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,920
I remember your family has a supermarket, right?

152
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,200
Can you save a few vegetable shelves for me?

153
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,520
I have a batch of cabbage to sell.

154
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,080
I thought you were working at the aerospace institute.

155
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,200
How come you're selling vegetables now?

156
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Come on, just tell me if it's possible or not.

157
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm in a hurry here.

158
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,520
I'll have to ask my dad about this.

159
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,640
My word doesn't count.

160
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,560
Then try to find a way to convince your dad.

161
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,159
I'll definitely thank you properly after this is resolved.

162
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,690
Alright.

163
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,480
When will it be delivered?

164
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,010
Tonight.

165
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Tomorrow morning at the latest.

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,720
That fast?

167
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,540
It's settled then.

168
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Okay.

169
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,090
Whatever you say, Young Master Jiang.

170
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,920
Secretary Ma,

171
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,850
have some water.

172
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,360
Thank you.

173
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,400
Zhi Yi,

174
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,770
have some water.

175
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,960
Thank you.

176
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Why did you scratch yourself like this?

177
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
It's okay.

178
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,020
She actually has a psychological issue.

179
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,840
Androphobia.

180
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,080
androphobia.

181
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,360
Everyone, please hurry up a bit.

182
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,320
We can handle it here.

183
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,580
You go arrange the car.

184
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,290
Alright.

185
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,060
Then I'll go get the car ready.

186
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,840
Secretary Ma.

187
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,500
Be careful.

188
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,920
This vehicle is too big.

189
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,120
We wasted some time getting on just now.

190
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,580
Urge everyone to hurry up.

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,640
It's alright.

192
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,160
No rush.

193
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,640
The villagers have been busy all day.

194
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,800
Jiang Cheng, slow down, take it easy.

195
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,930
No hurry, it's fine.

196
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,720
Everyone, hurry up a bit.

197
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,280
Uncle, please slow down.

198
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Everyone, please speed up a little.

199
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,480
Uncle, take it easy, slow down.

200
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,409
There's no rush.

201
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,650
Uncle, please take it slow.

202
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,610
No need to hurry.

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,440
We need to go a bit faster.

204
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Let me help you.

205
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,380
Take it over there.

206
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,320
I won't want it anymore after another minute.

207
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
Oh, don't be in such a hurry.

208
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
Hurry, hurry!

209
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,730
Everyone, hurry up!

210
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,720
Quick!

211
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,410
Everyone, move faster!

212
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,520
Zhi Yi.

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,760
Zhi Yi.

214
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
Everyone, line up properly.

215
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,040
Zhi Yi.

216
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
Dying here with Zhi Yi,

217
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,400
would be a death without regrets.

218
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,530
Zhi Yi, listen to me.

219
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,720
Zhi Yi.

220
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Are you crazy?

221
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,280
Meteor shower.

222
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,400
Look quickly!

223
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
A meteor shower!

224
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,800
Make a wish when you see a shooting star.

225
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,000
Zhi Yi.

226
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,880
It's okay.

227
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,200
Fortunately, it's just meteors.
