00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,920
Secretary Ma,

2
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,800
I'd like to discuss something with you.

3
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,000
It's about the students facing financial difficulties.

4
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:28,170
It's the list of students with financial difficulties.

5
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,400
These few

6
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,080
are indeed the financially struggling students from our village.

7
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,800
Some parents work away from home year-round,

8
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,930
leaving their children alone at home.

9
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
The school

10
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
can only provide limited assistance

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,400
to them.

12
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,560
Zhi Yi.

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,840
Ma Yi,

14
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,880
I've already transferred the village's share of the guesthouse profits

15
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,000
to the account.

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
I just overheard you talking about

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,240
the financially struggling students.

18
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,320
Perhaps this money

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
could be used to establish

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,080
a scholarship fund for them?

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,480
A scholarship for financially struggling students

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,960
was actually part of our school's initial plan

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,360
when it was established.

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,880
However,

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,160
due to insufficient funds,

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,889
it was canceled a long time ago.

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
We originally opened this guesthouse

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,160
to revitalize Nanling Village.

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,920
Now that the guesthouse is profitable,

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,120
why don't we use the money

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,450
where it's needed most?

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,200
That would be wonderful, Zhi Yi.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
On behalf of the students,

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,720
Thank you.

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,620
It's what we should do.

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,820
Where is everyone?

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
where did they all go?

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,210
Jiang Cheng.

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,240
Who?

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Which senior?

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,690
Older girls are hard to pursue.

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,480
You're blushing.

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,450
Don't tell me you still like that girl.

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,770
Just enjoying the view.

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,420
It's quite beautiful.

46
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,980
I wish we could stay here forever.

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,560
Remember when I first came here?

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,240
I was thinking of leading everyone to leave.

49
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,500
I didn't expect that in such a short time,

50
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,579
I wouldn't want to leave anymore.

51
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,360
This place is like a paradise.

52
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,970
And there's you.

53
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,000
Zhi Yi,

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,440
actually,

55
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,800
the senior I've been secretly in love with,

56
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,320
is you.

57
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,600
I know.

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,320
You know?

59
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,000
I...

60
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,440
I saw something in your room today.

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,760
I...

62
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,330
The reason I kept it from you is because

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,400
I used to be quite insecure.

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,460
I didn't have the courage to tell you.

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,840
I...

66
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,170
I'm going all in.

67
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,880
Zhi Yi.

68
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,250
These words,

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,280
I

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,490
I've wanted to say this for a long time.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,320
I must tell you today.

72
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,480
Zhi Yi,

73
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,720
I like you.

74
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Shen Zhi Yi.

75
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,840
Get out here right now!

76
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,000
Shen Zhi Yi.

77
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,200
Shen Zhiyi.

78
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,480
Get out here!

79
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,800
Shen Zhiyi.

80
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,080
You still have the leisure to be romantic here?

81
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
The three-month deadline has arrived.

82
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,210
You must fulfill your promise.

83
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,880
Jiang Dahai.

84
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,240
The guesthouse is already profitable.

85
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,000
The dividends you're entitled to will be given to you.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,730
I don't care.

87
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,080
You promised to give it,

88
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,600
so you must give it.

89
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,760
I want to see the money today.

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm here to collect the money today.

91
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,920
The profits from the guesthouse

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,280
have already been given to establish a scholarship fund for Nanling Village Primary School.

93
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,400
Village primary school.

94
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
Well, Shen Zhiyi.

95
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
You gave our money

96
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,730
to someone else.

97
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,250
We villagers

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,680
haven't received a single penny.

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,480
My pockets now

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,480
are completely empty.

101
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,120
I haven't received a single penny either.

102
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,159
Well, you!

103
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,400
We promised to give the three months' profits to the village.

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,240
Now we have done everything we said we would.

105
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,040
Our guesthouse is running well.

106
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,920
The villagers' income has also increased.

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,760
Everyone supports our guesthouse.

108
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,290
Only you few are against it.

109
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,250
Jiang Dahai,

110
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,480
you're full of evil intentions.

111
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,840
What exactly do you want to do?

112
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
You're so eager to let the chemical factory in.

113
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,200
I'm afraid you've taken some benefits from them.

114
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
Don't make false accusations.

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,040
I'm making false accusations?

116
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,880
You know very well what you've done.

117
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,720
Shen Zhiyi.

118
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,720
This has nothing to do with you.

119
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,200
People should keep their word.

120
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
You should do what you say.

121
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,660
Do you understand?

122
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,930
Jiang Dahai,

123
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,840
if you keep causing trouble,

124
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,770
don't blame me for being impolite.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,200
Impolite?

126
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,280
You loser,

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
you beat my brother

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
so badly he ended up in the hospital.

129
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,480
And you're talking about being impolite?

130
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,410
Come on, come on.

131
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,180
Come on.

132
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,980
Hit me here.

133
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,320
Still not polite enough?

134
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
If you've got the guts, come here.

135
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,080
Come here.

136
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,260
You were also involved in the attack on Anjin back then.

137
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,130
Stop talking nonsense.

138
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Give me the money!

139
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,960
Jiang Dahai.

140
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,180
Hurry up, hurry up.

141
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,409
What's going on?

142
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,200
Village Chief.

143
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,120
You're finally here.

144
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
In this village,

145
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,360
you're the one I trust the most.

146
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,020
Please make a decision for me.

147
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,900
What decision?

148
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,680
Dahai.

149
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,159
Why are you causing trouble again?

150
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,000
It's not me.

151
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,320
Shen Zhiyi

152
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,360
She's not giving us our dividends.

153
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,080
Dahai.

154
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,440
Xiao Shen and the others

155
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,320
have donated the guesthouse profits

156
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,050
to the village primary school.

157
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,960
After we land,

158
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,000
Ma Yi will post the announcement on the bulletin board at the village entrance.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,600
At that time,

160
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,260
you can go and see it yourself.

161
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,780
It's been donated to the village school.

162
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,840
That's great.

163
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,570
You old fool,

164
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,440
you're in cahoots with them, aren't you?

165
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,880
How dare you speak like that?

166
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,320
If you're not going to be kind, don't blame me for being unkind.

167
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,580
I'm done playing nice.

168
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,440
Brothers,

169
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
take what you should,

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,480
and take what you shouldn't too.

171
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,010
Let's go.

172
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
I'd like to see who dares to move.

173
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,360
Dahai,

174
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
stop giving these young people a hard time.

175
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,240
That's right.

176
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Their guesthouse

177
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,160
has brought so many benefits to our village.

178
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,400
Just think about before,

179
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,960
in our village,

180
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,280
it was just us old folks,

181
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,160
so quiet and lonely.

182
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,440
Look at the village now,

183
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,799
so many young people have come.

184
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,039
Don't you all agree?

185
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,039
Yes, indeed.

186
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,480
What do you know?

187
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,220
How much money can a guesthouse make?

188
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,170
A chemical factory is where the real money is.

189
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,880
Don't be fooled.

190
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,660
You can't say that.

191
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,680
This Zhi Yi

192
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,640
even helped us sell all our vegetables.

193
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,280
We should be grateful to them.

194
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,240
When doing things,

195
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,970
we can't be so ruthless, can we?

196
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,040
Yes.

197
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,440
Yes.

198
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,720
Listen to me,

199
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,800
fellow villagers.

200
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Let's drive Jiang Dahai out.

201
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,400
Drive him out!

202
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,530
Siding with outsiders to bully me.

203
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,480
You're all bullying me.

204
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,920
You all

205
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,120
You'll regret this.

206
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,120
Dahai,

207
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,800
Dahai,

208
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,540
be careful!

209
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,410
Are you alright?

210
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,680
Zhi Yi!

211
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,480
Senior Mu Chen.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,920
The dress is long.

213
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,600
Be careful.

214
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,080
A bow.

215
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,400
Wholeheartedly.

216
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,800
With deep affection.

217
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,360
Growing old together.

218
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,120
Thank you, Mom and Dad.

219
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,980
Come here, you.

220
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,360
Okay.

221
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,010
Come on, come on.

222
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,920
Time for photos, let's take pictures.

223
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,040
Zhi Yi, come here.

224
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,120
Say cheese!

225
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,120
Zhi Yi.

226
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,520
Zhi Yi.

227
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Let's start over.

228
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,160
Between us, from the moment you called off the wedding,

229
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,290
it was already over.

230
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,080
Zhi Yi.

231
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
I know I wronged you before.

232
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,250
Please give me another chance.

233
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,160
I will make it up to you, I promise.

234
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,680
Let go.

235
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,200
Zhi Yi.

236
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,520
Let go of me.

237
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,480
Zhi Yi.

238
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,130
What do you want?

239
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
This is between me and Zhi Yi.

240
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,040
It's none of your business.

241
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,320
Since you chose to leave back then,

242
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,880
you should let go completely.

243
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
Only I can bring happiness to Zhi Yi.

244
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,280
You disappeared because of that small amount of bride price,

245
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,540
how can you face Zhi Yi?

246
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,980
And you talk about giving her happiness?

247
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,960
Stop fighting! Stop it!

248
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,640
Stop it!

249
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,800
Zhi Yi!

250
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
This person is just a con artist.

251
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,240
You can't be fooled by him again.

252
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,620
I'll teach him a lesson for you today.

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,860
Stop fighting!

254
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Zhi Yi and I have been together for five years.

255
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
How long have you known each other?

256
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,520
It can't compare to what we have.

257
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,680
Zhi Yi likes me.

258
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,300
Stop talking, both of you.

259
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,860
Both of you,

260
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,580
I don't like either of you.

261
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,440
Don't bother me anymore.

262
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Zhi Yi!

263
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,130
Let's go.

264
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,160
Zhi Yi!
