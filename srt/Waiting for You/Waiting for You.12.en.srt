1
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,820
Auntie,

2
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,520
This dish is An Jin's favorite.

3
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,880
It's scrambled eggs with Chinese toon.

4
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,360
Auntie,

5
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,400
please try it.

6
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,570
Alright.

7
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,940
It's really not that good.

8
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,240
Why are you all just standing there?

9
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,120
Let's eat together.

10
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,680
Auntie,

11
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,479
I

12
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,320
actually care about you very much.

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, Auntie,

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,400
An Jin usually never goes into the kitchen.

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,840
You mean

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,960
this dish was made by An Jin?

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,009
She made it especially for you.

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,520
An Jin,

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
you still like eating this even now?

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,200
Yes, Auntie,

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,560
An Jin feels uncomfortable if she doesn't eat it for three days.

22
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,620
She says it's a habit from childhood.

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,200
Yes,

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,920
I used to make this for her often when she was little.

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,380
So many years have passed,

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,759
I didn't expect you still haven't had enough of it.

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,840
Let me tell you all,

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,980
actually, from any perspective,

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,440
the chemical plant

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,040
has more investment value than your business.

31
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,210
It's just that An Jin can't understand it for now.

32
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,840
Auntie,

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
we all understand.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,320
Auntie,

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
through our unremitting efforts,

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,560
our occupancy rate

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,400
has already exceeded 80 percent,

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,640
and it has become Nanling Village's...

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
That's enough.

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,780
No need to keep acting.

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,520
I've already investigated.

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,240
The business of your guesthouse

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,770
is actually quite average.

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,560
Alright,

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
let's eat first.

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,980
We'll talk after the meal.

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,120
Let's eat.

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,920
Today,

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,000
we are honored to have invited our local renowned celadon master,

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,730
Master Zhou.

51
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
These two teacups

52
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,720
are also crafted by Master Zhou.

53
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,520
Now, we will

54
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,640
ask Master Zhou to explain to everyone.

55
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,200
Alright.

56
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,040
This one,

57
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,410
the design inspiration

58
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,320
is the sun.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,920
Yue kiln is the most famous ancient celadon kiln system in our country.

60
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,680
Our Yucheng

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,360
is

62
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,040
the birthplace of Yue kiln celadon.

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,480
If you're interested,

64
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,280
you can follow me to the Banshan Hillside Homestay later

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
to DIY by yourselves.

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,920
There's more over here.

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,050
I'll take you there.

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,760
Mom,

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,519
this is a homestay, not a rural guesthouse.

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Come, come, come.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,840
Keep up!

72
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
We're almost there.

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,280
Watch your step.

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,840
Auntie,

75
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,280
Your village is so beautifully built.

76
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,400
We thought the videos were enhanced.

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,880
Didn't expect it to be exactly the same.

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,680
Right?

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,320
As for our village,

80
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,040
since some young people came to open guesthouses,

81
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,120
things have been getting better and better here.

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,600
Come, come,

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,260
take a look.

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,000
Look around.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,080
It's really nice.

86
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,800
You're welcome to visit often.

87
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Okay, definitely, definitely.

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,520
Come on,

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,400
look over here.

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,440
Zhi Yi.

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
I've been cooking all day.

92
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
and I still have to clean up the cups.

93
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,600
Hello?

94
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes, alright, alright.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Please wait a moment.

96
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,680
There's a tour group at the front desk.

97
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,560
About twenty or so people.

98
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,020
I'll go attend to them now.

99
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Then hurry and go.

100
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Should we go check how the kitchen is doing with the food preparation?

101
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,800
Oh, right.

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,400
Food prep.

103
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,460
I'll go check on it.

104
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,720
Those in the back, please move forward.

105
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,000
Your room number is 0125.

106
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,320
Let's check in first.

107
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,980
Hurry up, hurry up.

108
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,760
There are so many people.

109
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
I'm dying of thirst.

110
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
My throat feels like it's on fire from all the talking.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,840
You should drink more water.

112
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,100
I'll go attend to them.

113
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,600
Those in the back.

114
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,520
Please line up here.

115
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,580
Please don't push.

116
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
Everyone, please don't panic.

117
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,800
Form an orderly line, please.

118
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,040
We still have rooms available.

119
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,880
Everyone, please don't worry.

120
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,760
Don't push.

121
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,200
We'll make sure to accommodate all of you.

122
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,600
Right.

123
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,490
Don't worry.

124
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,810
Boss.

125
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,320
Boss, we're out of rooms.

126
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,520
Shh.

127
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh.

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Go check if other places have any vacancies.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,840
See if there are any available guesthouses.

130
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,500
Wait for me.

131
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,040
An Jin.

132
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,440
We did it.

133
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,520
I didn't expect it either.

134
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,240
This Celadon and Hanfu Cultural Arts Festival

135
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
is unexpectedly popular.

136
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,040
The entire Nanling Village

137
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,360
is filled with tourists from outside.

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,880
Indeed.

139
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
You must work diligently,

140
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,880
and never be negligent.

141
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,520
Make sure to receive every guest with sincerity.

142
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,580
Do you understand?

143
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,800
Don't worry,

144
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,880
I've got this.

145
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,580
Let me tell you,

146
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,680
President Zheng from the Yucheng Youth Palace will be coming

147
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,360
to sign a contract with us later.

148
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,620
What kind of contract?

149
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,640
He said next month

150
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,560
he will bring the children

151
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,760
here to do that

152
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,720
study tour and investigation.

153
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,840
He wants us to help with the event planning.

154
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
That's great!

155
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,740
Please come in.

156
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,800
Chairman Zheng.

157
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,480
You're here.

158
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,410
Chairman Zheng.

159
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,960
Hello.

160
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,640
Hello.

161
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,600
Hello, hello.

162
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,660
Please have a seat.

163
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,010
Here.

164
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Please take a look at this contract.

165
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,200
Here's some tea for you.

166
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Thank you.

167
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,080
This time, you...

168
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,960
This art festival has been organized quite well.

169
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,160
Secretary Ma has been full of praise for you all.

170
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,080
Even Old Zhou...

171
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,480
you've managed to invite him here.

172
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,040
And who is this?

173
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,640
This is Master Zhou's apprentice.

174
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,240
You're the only apprentice...

175
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,600
Old Zhou has taken in all these years.

176
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,240
Young man,

177
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,040
you must work hard, alright?

178
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,290
It's going alright.

179
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
I'll do my best.

180
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Oh, by the way,

181
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,280
Xiao Lin,

182
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,680
I wonder if you're interested in setting up a creative base?

183
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,640
Creative base?

184
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,600
Yes.

185
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,840
I have a friend

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,360
who's looking for a nice place these days

187
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,480
to set up a creative base.

188
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,320
I think your place here would be great.

189
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
If there's a chance,

190
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,920
I'll find time for you to discuss it.

191
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,600
That sounds good.

192
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,200
That's great.

193
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,840
Thank you.

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,640
Nowadays, young people like you

195
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,920
who are willing to return to the countryside are rare.

196
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,640
Not to mention,

197
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,040
you've provided us with such good conditions.

198
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,570
Alright,

199
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,400
then let's...

200
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,840
Here's to a pleasant cooperation.

201
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,170
Pleasant cooperation.

202
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,640
Mom.

203
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm sorry.

204
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,820
I apologize to you.

205
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,660
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you.

206
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,960
I've thought it through.

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,059
I want to stay here.

208
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,200
Auntie,

209
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,360
Although An Jin initially

210
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,440
joined us as an investor,

211
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
after spending so much time together,

212
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,760
she has become one of us.

213
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,120
So,

214
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
even if you want to withdraw your investment,

215
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,800
please allow An Jin

216
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,440
to continue staying here

217
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,240
and start this business with us.

218
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,440
You mean

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,920
even if she can't bring you investment,

220
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,300
you're still willing?

221
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,960
Of course.

222
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,080
To us, An Jin

223
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
is like family.

224
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
Yes, auntie.

225
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,400
Please, I beg you,

226
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,640
let An Jin stay.

227
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,480
An Jin is already part of our family.

228
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,840
An Jin.

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,730
Are you really sure about this?

230
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,400
I've really thought it through.

231
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
Ever since I was young,

232
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,330
I've always lost interest in things quickly.

233
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,440
But this time,

234
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,370
I've really made up my mind.

235
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,290
Alright.

236
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,280
An Jin,

237
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,920
go and do what you like.

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,080
Mom won't force you anymore.

239
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,260
Thank you, auntie.

240
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,890
Send me a message when you get home.

241
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,280
When you go back, please tell Dad

242
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,880
that I'm doing well here.

243
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,920
Don't keep urging me to come home.

244
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,520
Right now,

245
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
I just want to start my own business.

246
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,960
This place

247
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,760
is my home now.

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,280
Our daughter has grown up.

249
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,480
She needs to make her own decisions now.

250
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,520
An Jin,

251
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,140
based on your mother's years of professional experience,

252
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,600
this investment of yours

253
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,920
may not necessarily be the best choice.

254
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,330
But with the efforts of you and your guesthouse partners

255
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
and your passion,

256
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,000
the success or failure of this investment

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,080
might be difficult to measure with data for now.

258
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
From now on,

259
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,640
do what you want to do.

260
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,280
Mom will always support you.

261
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,530
No matter what happens,

262
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,400
Dad and Mom

263
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
will always be your strong support.

264
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,600
Why am I feeling a bit nervous?

265
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't be nervous, don't be nervous.

266
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,170
if we don't make a profit this time,

267
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,960
our guesthouse

268
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,820
will it really have to close down?

269
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,820
I can't bear the thought of it.

270
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,880
Trust Zhi Yi.

271
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,760
Our event this time has been so well organized,

272
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,290
we're sure to make a profit.

273
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,610
I've calculated it.

274
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,120
Did we make a profit?

275
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm afraid to hear it.

276
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,160
After deducting the initial losses

277
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,560
and labor costs,

278
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,040
in three months, we've made a total profit of

279
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,400
291,500.

280
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,960
We finally made a profit.

281
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,800
That's great!

282
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,640
Now we finally have something to show for our efforts.
