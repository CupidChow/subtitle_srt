1
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,200
Zhi Yi is here.

2
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,880
Pickling bamboo shoots again?

3
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,520
Yes.

4
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,920
my son called and said

5
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,200
he wants to eat the dried bamboo shoots I make.

6
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,560
While I still have the energy,

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,690
I'll make a bit more.

8
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,560
When he comes,

9
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,580
he can take some back with him.

10
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
This is a new gift box from our guesthouse.

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
I brought one for you.

12
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,360
No,

13
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,400
that's not necessary.

14
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,259
Please take it.

15
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,240
Thank you, thank you.

16
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,080
The rice cake you made last time

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,800
sold very well in our livestream.

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,120
So we'd like to order more.

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,240
Do you have any more?

20
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,920
Yes, I do.

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,479
When I'm done making them,

22
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,610
I'll deliver them to your guesthouse.

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,140
No need,

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,800
we can come pick them up ourselves.

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,730
It's very close.

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,880
Let me help you smoke the bamboo shoots.

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,840
No need.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,210
You should rest.

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,440
Someone's already helping.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,919
Is this the grandmother?

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,050
Come on, come on.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,920
Let me help you with that.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,130
What are you doing here?

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,560
This is so unlike you.

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,730
shutting yourself in your room to read books.

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,200
About plants.

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,240
What's wrong?

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,720
I'm just brushing up on some plant knowledge.

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,650
Is that not okay?

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
It's fine, but...

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
it's just that...

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm afraid no matter how hard you try,

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,480
you still won't catch up to that person.

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Get out.

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,360
I've come with news.

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,320
Are you sure you want me to leave?

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,690
Then speak quickly.

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,079
Jiaojiao said

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,320
Zhiyi hasn't been feeling well.

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,180
She's been coughing constantly.

51
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,760
Coughing?

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
If she's coughing, she should take some medicine.

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,970
Alright.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,920
I've delivered the message.

55
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,980
I'll be going then.

56
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,770
Give this to her.

57
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,540
Can't you give it to her yourself?

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Thank you.

59
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,920
Zhiyi.

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,160
Why aren't you feeling better yet?

61
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,240
The medicine from the infirmary isn't working.

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,120
It's just a cough.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,160
His medicine definitely won't work.

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,090
Why don't you...

65
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,320
If you're not feeling well, you should rest.

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,120
Leave these small matters to me.

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,040
It's nothing.

68
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
The medicine Jiang Cheng brought

69
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,000
is actually for treating coughs.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,130
Why don't you try it?

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,320
Offering help for no reason,

72
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,360
what if it works?

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,530
Give it a try.

74
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,640
How's this?

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,060
It's passable.

76
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
There's still room for improvement.

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
Passable.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,080
Passable.

79
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,610
That's high praise indeed.

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,050
Come.

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,980
I'll teach you.

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,440
Let's go.

83
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,840
Zhiyi.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Aim for that spot.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,730
Do you see it?

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,440
This is a new variety we've cultivated in our department.

87
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,100
Red Beauty.

88
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,480
Try it.

89
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,720
Thank you.

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,640
Hold it steady.

91
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,820
If you still feel unwell tonight,

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,000
remember to come find me.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,560
I live right next door to you.

94
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,360
That won't be necessary.

95
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,840
I'll take care of Zhiyi tonight.

96
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,570
Don't worry.

97
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:14,680
Come.

98
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,080
Zhiyi.

99
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,400
Be more serious.

100
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,690
How are you walking?

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,640
So strangely.

102
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,720
I want some too.

103
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,200
I'll feed you.

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,680
Try it.

105
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
It's so sweet.

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,840
Granny Sun.

107
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Oh, Zhiyi is here.

108
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,280
Be careful.

109
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,240
Don't get wet.

110
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,680
You haven't been here for a long time.

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,740
I thought you wouldn't come anymore.

112
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,659
I've been really busy these days.

113
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,680
This is the money for the rice cakes.

114
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,810
Please keep it safe.

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,860
You keep it.

116
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,360
We don't need this much money.

117
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,490
Our rice cakes aren't worth that much.

118
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,660
Please take it.

119
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
Everyone loves your rice cakes so much.

120
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,620
They're selling really well online.

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,290
Where's that young man who was with you last time?

123
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,640
He has something to do.

124
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,900
He can't make it today.

125
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
You young people,

126
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,240
have such hot tempers.

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,970
You take things too seriously.

128
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,880
When you get to my age,

129
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,460
you'll see everything more clearly.

130
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,840
No.

131
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,320
It's my fault.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,730
I don't know what I'm afraid of.

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,120
Something that could be resolved with just one word,

134
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,180
but I can never bring myself to say it.

135
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,840
My husband and I,

136
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,700
we've been together for decades.

137
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,100
During these decades,

138
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,050
we've argued countless times.

139
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,680
When we were young,

140
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
we were stubborn.

141
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,520
We often had

142
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,760
'breaking up' on the tip of our tongues.

143
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
There were a few times

144
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,480
when we almost got divorced.

145
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,120
Now it's better.

146
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,880
Even if I want to argue,

147
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,410
there's no chance anymore.

148
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
He's doing well,

149
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,880
buried in the ground,

150
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,770
not worrying about anything anymore.

151
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,320
If he's the one you've chosen,

152
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,200
give him another chance.

153
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,000
Zhiyi.

154
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,240
Jiaojiao.

155
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,920
I heard that in town,

156
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,720
there's a new stinky tofu shop that's really delicious.

157
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,250
Let's go.

158
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,600
In town?

159
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,320
Let's go.

160
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,260
I just borrowed an electric bike.

161
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,730
Alright.

162
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,340
Look how eager you are.

163
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,840
Mimi,

164
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm going to ride the bike now.

165
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,840
I'll play with you later.

166
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,440
They've been gone for so long.

167
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,880
Haven't they come back yet?

168
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,540
No, not yet.

169
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,040
Hello.

170
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,640
Excuse me,

171
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,640
where can I find shelter from the rain?

172
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,170
Up there.

173
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,170
Up there is fine.

174
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,490
Okay, thank you.

175
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
It's not good.

176
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
There's been a flash flood in the valley near the village.

177
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,520
The roads are all flooded.

178
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,840
Is it the road to town?

179
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,840
Yes, that mountain road.

180
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,600
And Jiaojiao.

181
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,660
They're together.

182
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,080
Ah!

183
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,380
Uncle, Auntie,

184
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,460
have you seen two girls riding an electric bike?

185
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,250
They're still in there.

186
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,240
Zhi Yi.

187
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,680
Shen Zhi Yi.

188
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Did the call go through?

189
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,280
Neither of them is answering the phone.

190
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
Let's go look over there.

191
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,680
Shen Zhi Yi.

192
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,360
Jiao Jiao.

193
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,440
Zhi Yi.

194
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,400
Zhi Yi.

195
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,760
Jiao Jiao.

196
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,920
Zhi Yi.

197
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,730
Are you alright?

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,800
Put it inside.

199
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,600
Zhi Yi.

200
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,320
Zhi Yi.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,730
Jiang Cheng.

202
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,000
Zhi Yi.

203
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,880
Zhi Yi.

204
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,240
You got soaked, didn't you?

205
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,120
Are you hurt?

206
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,180
Come on.

207
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,600
Let's toast to Zhiyi and me.

208
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,320
May we survive great calamities,

209
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,280
and be blessed afterwards.

210
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,880
Jiaojiao,

211
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
that's a bit dramatic.

212
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,360
What's all this talk about death?

213
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,620
Choose another toast.

214
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,520
Well then,

215
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,960
let's toast to our survival

216
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,080
and future happiness and health.

217
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,940
That's better.

218
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,740
Come on,

219
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,260
cheers!

220
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,080
Cheers!

221
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,920
I have some good news to share with everyone.

222
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,780
What good news?

223
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,290
Did you win the lottery?

224
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,770
You little money-grubber.

225
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,320
Ma Yi,

226
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,480
stop keeping us in suspense.

227
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,680
What's the good news?

228
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,800
In our village,

229
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,520
there are several high-risk hillsides

230
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,600
that have now been fitted with protective nets.

231
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,040
This can prevent rolling stones from falling.

232
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,280
Even if there's another mountain flood,

233
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,600
it will reduce the damage.

234
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,400
That's great.

235
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,920
Ma Yi

236
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,880
You really are a

237
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,480
good secretary who cares about the villagers.

238
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,620
Come on,

239
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,960
everyone, let's eat.

240
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,120
Jiaojiao,

241
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,600
the water quality test results are out.

242
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,520
I didn't realize the irrigation water in the village

243
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,920
was so heavily polluted.

244
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,920
The heavy metal content in the wheat field water exceeds the standard,

245
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
causing poor growth of crops in the fields

246
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,360
and even death.

247
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,720
No wonder the crops are all getting sick so quickly.

248
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,120
Fortunately, we discovered it in time.

249
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,280
If it had gone into production,

250
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,160
the damage would have been enormous.

251
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,600
Why is the heavy metal content exceeding the standard?

252
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,800
We need to conduct an on-site survey of the pollution source.

253
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,360
Then let's go right away.

254
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,160
The sooner we go,

255
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,760
the sooner we can mitigate the losses.

256
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,420
I'll go too.

257
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,600
You all go ahead.

258
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I'll notify the villagers first

259
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,320
to stop irrigation.
