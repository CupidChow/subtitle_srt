1
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,680
I want to discuss something with everyone.

2
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,860
I want to sell our guesthouse.

3
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,400
Zhiyi,

4
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,600
This is all of our hard work.

5
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,760
But we've lost so much money.

6
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,440
The villagers are still counting on this money.

7
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,200
I don't want to see everyone at a dead end.

8
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,840
How about

9
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,360
I borrow some more from my mom?

10
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,120
No, Anjin.

11
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,360
I don't want to put you in a difficult position.

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,440
Your mother never agreed with you staying at the guesthouse in the first place.

13
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Now it's perfect.

14
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,340
The guesthouse is closed,

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,000
all problems will be solved.

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,200
Then all our hard work on the guesthouse

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,680
would be for nothing, wouldn't it?

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,640
But Zhiyi,

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
if we just disband like this,

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
I can't bear it.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,120
Zhiyi,

22
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,050
are you sure about this?

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,280
You've all been so helpful during this time.

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,720
Zhiyi,

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,240
our fellow villagers

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,800
are all very grateful to you.

27
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,320
Zhiyi,

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,920
can't you stay?

29
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Jiaojiao,

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,820
take good care of yourself, okay?

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,810
Don't worry,

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,120
Jiaojiao.

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,320
I'll take good care of her.

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
Although we're old,

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,200
we know

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,280
that money

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,410
can't be recovered.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
Zhi Yi,

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,280
thank you so much.

40
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,440
Please verify the information,

41
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,900
and if there are no issues,

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,400
please sign below.

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,920
Don't sign.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,730
I won't sign.

45
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,290
Are you sure?

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,640
Yes, I'm sure.

47
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,250
Alright.

48
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,780
I'll pay for it.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,730
Jiang Cheng,

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,530
where did you get so much money?

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,130
I got it from my parents.

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,200
Your parents?

53
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,130
Jiang Cheng,

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
what do you mean?

55
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,640
it must cost quite a bit to buy this.

56
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,040
Your parents just gave it to you like that?

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
It's not for free.

58
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,040
I have to give them 50% of the profits.

59
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,440
I'll pay them back with interest.

60
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,040
I see.

61
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,200
So you're a secret rich kid, huh?

62
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,120
That's great!

63
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,840
Then we can continue running the guesthouse here.

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,240
So we don't have to leave.

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,800
But

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,460
They have a condition.

67
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,400
Zhi Yi,

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,040
you

69
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,480
will

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,400
manage the guesthouse well.

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,010
I can lend you the money.

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,159
But there's one requirement.

73
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,840
You must leave that guesthouse

74
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,370
and come back to inherit the family business.

75
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,800
Zhi Yi,

76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,760
I have to go.

77
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,420
It's because of that money, isn't it?

78
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,200
I want to be a rich kid now.

79
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,680
Alright,

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,720
it's not like we'll never see each other again.

81
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Come back soon.

82
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,180
I'll come pick you up in a helicopter.

83
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,440
Stop here, stop here.

84
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,040
Stop here.

85
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,480
We charge for parking here.

86
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
It's five yuan per hour.

87
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,540
Five yuan per hour.

88
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,240
No random parking once you're inside.

89
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,100
Random parking

90
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
will result in a fine.

91
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,900
You're charging for this?

92
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,370
You're ruining Nanling Village's image.

93
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,560
I'm sorry,

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,490
we don't charge.

95
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,780
We even provide water.

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Please go inside.

97
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,500
Let's go in.

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
This way, please.

99
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,409
Please, come in.

100
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,000
Have a good time!

101
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,290
Your coffee.

102
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,280
Hello.

103
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,600
Come this way.

104
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,260
Put it here.

105
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,480
Zhiyi.

106
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,560
It's your birthday today.

107
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,280
Jiang Cheng

108
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,120
has prepared a surprise for you.

109
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,040
It's just a birthday.

110
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,840
Is there a need to be so dramatic?

111
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,040
What surprise?

112
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,640
You're being so mysterious.

113
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
You'll find out soon.

114
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,010
Are we there?

115
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,400
What is it?

116
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,960
Zhiyi.

117
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,320
Today

118
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,520
marks

119
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
the 2,950th day since we met,

120
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,610
and the seventh year of my secret love for you.

121
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,580
Do you remember

122
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,320
when I first entered school,

123
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,650
that summer when we met?

124
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,460
Classmate,

125
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,980
classmate.

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,200
Since that day,

127
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,809
I've wanted to see you again every day.

128
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,520
It seems like heaven

129
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,600
heard my prayers

130
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,160
and allowed us to meet again.

131
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,480
So this time,

132
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,140
I must seize the opportunity.

133
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,960
I want to give you the best of everything in the world.

134
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,560
You said you like

135
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,800
blatant favoritism,

136
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,000
so today,

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,660
in front of the whole village,

138
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,860
I'm confessing to you.

139
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,480
Zhiyi,

140
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,240
I once thought my life

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,800
was just

142
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,000
an ordinary journey.

143
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,170
Until you appeared,

144
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,360
making me realize that life has many possibilities.

145
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,480
It can be free,

146
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,610
it can be beautiful.

147
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,320
I know

148
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,720
life

149
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
has many uncertainties and variables,

150
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,780
but as long as I have your company,

151
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,040
I have the courage to face everything.

152
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Whether it's mountains or valleys,

153
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,850
whether it's good times or bad,

154
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,650
I hope to have you by my side.

155
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,160
This is a DR diamond ring,

156
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,120
given to only one person in a lifetime.

157
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,920
It symbolizes

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,720
that you are my

159
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,180
one true love in this life.

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
So I want to use it

161
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,890
to witness my unwavering love for you,

162
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,760
to witness the promise I make to you

163
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,490
to love only you for a lifetime.

164
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,840
Choose one person to grow old with,

165
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,100
meet one person to spend a lifetime with.

166
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,160
I want to spend

167
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,820
many moments of life with you,

168
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,560
watching sunrises and sunsets together,

169
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,020
sharing joys and sorrows.

170
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
Will you walk towards

171
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,520
our happy future with me?

172
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,080
Say yes to him.

173
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,000
I do.

174
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Now that the ring is on,

175
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,200
you can't change your mind.

176
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,920
Kiss him.

177
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,080
Kiss,

178
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,120
kiss.
