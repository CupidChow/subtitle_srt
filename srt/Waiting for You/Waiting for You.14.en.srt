1
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,580
Let's have a toast.

2
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,039
Thank you.

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,600
Thank you, thank you.

4
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,560
Thank you all for coming to support us.

5
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,160
Thank you.

6
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,490
Please, eat more, eat more.

7
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,440
Zhi Yi,

8
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,840
where have you been?

9
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,080
I've been looking for you for ages.

10
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,039
you weren't here for the photos.

11
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,360
You're not being a very good bridesmaid, are you?

12
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,880
I went to watch two puppies fighting.

13
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,200
Dogs?

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,060
Is that my seat?

15
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,920
Thank you.

16
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,240
Zhi Yi.

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,940
This handsome guy.

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,050
I don't think I've seen you before.

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,340
I'm here as a guest.

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,560
Well...

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,120
I came here in such a hurry,

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,320
I didn't have time to prepare anything.

23
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,640
No need to prepare anything.

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,560
Just a small token of my appreciation.

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,680
It's not much, but please accept it.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,480
I wish you both

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,240
a hundred years of good marriage.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,320
May you grow old together with white hair.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,760
May your hearts be forever united.

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,090
Oh, you shouldn't have.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,960
Hurry, hurry!

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,210
Please, have a seat.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,120
Zhi Yi.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Congratulations on your marriage to Ma Yi.

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,250
What happened to your face?

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,560
How did that happen?

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,320
I was bitten by a dog.

39
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,840
A dog?

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,050
Where did the dog come from?

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,040
Dear friends and neighbors,

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,079
today

43
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,960
is the joyous day of my wedding to Jiaojiao.

44
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,480
If there's anything we've overlooked today,

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,540
please forgive us.

46
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,800
Jiaojiao and I

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,329
would like to propose a toast to everyone.

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,050
Thank you all for coming to celebrate with us.

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,240
Handsome and generous too.

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,440
If you had come last year,

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
Ma Yi wouldn't have stood a chance.

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,920
Jiaojiao,

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,200
after today,

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,440
you'll be a married woman.

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Be careful, Ma Yi might get jealous.

56
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,340
No, no, that won't happen.

57
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,160
Handsome,

58
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,100
are you single?

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,880
Although I'm no longer available,

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,320
but

61
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,240
we have two

62
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
excellent independent women here.

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,360
My ex-boyfriend.

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,079
He's Zhi Yi's ex-boyfriend.

65
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,840
That's you.

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,880
What are you doing here?

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,040
Are you here to cause trouble?

68
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,200
Jiao Jiao,

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,340
I'll come find you in a bit.

70
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,010
Go ahead and eat.

71
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,320
Zhi Yi,

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,600
Zhi Yi,

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
My stomach hurts.

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
I feel so uncomfortable.

75
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,120
I feel a bit unwell too.

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
It hurts so much.

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,130
Grandma,

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,370
are you alright?

79
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,600
Zhiyi,

80
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,760
something terrible has happened!

81
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,089
People have been poisoned at the wedding!

82
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,240
What's going on?

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
My stomach hurts.

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Sister,

85
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,360
you too?

86
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,730
Are you alright, ma'am?

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,050
It hurts so much.

88
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,159
My stomach...

89
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,600
It looks like food poisoning.

90
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,400
Could it be the wedding feast?

91
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Something must be wrong with the food at the wedding.

92
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,560
Jiang Cheng and I didn't eat anything earlier.

93
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,890
The three of us are fine.

94
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,520
It might really be a problem with the wedding feast.

95
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,600
What should we do?

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Jiaojiao,

97
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,040
keep a sample of all the dishes.

98
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,400
Um,

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
the doctor from the village clinic,

100
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,480
has Dr. Chen arrived?

101
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,159
He came too,

102
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,640
but

103
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,960
he's also been affected.

104
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,360
He said

105
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,560
with so many people having diarrhea,

106
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,280
there's not enough medicine in the village.

107
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,440
The nearest hospital

108
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,040
is over an hour's drive away.

109
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
And we have so many people poisoned.

110
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,060
What are we going to do?

111
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,440
I just saw in the village

112
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,880
there's patchouli leaf that can stop diarrhea.

113
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,440
Perhaps we could gather some and make a decoction to try.

114
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,840
No,

115
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,760
we don't know what kind of food poisoning this is yet.

116
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,440
If you give people something to eat carelessly,

117
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,400
what if it makes them worse?

118
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,720
Are you going to take responsibility?

119
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,180
Mu Chen,

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,680
what are you up to?

121
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,720
Patchouli leaf has no side effects.

122
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,840
Even if a healthy person eats it, there won't be any problem.

123
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,570
Besides, do you have a better solution right now?

124
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,420
Let's try it first.

125
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,180
I can't bear the pain anymore.

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,120
Why don't we give it a try?

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,850
Let's try it.

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,210
I'll go with you.

129
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,520
No,

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,200
Zhiyi.

131
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,400
It's too dangerous for a girl like you.

132
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,659
I'd better go instead.

133
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,640
Do you even know what patchouli leaves look like?

134
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,000
I...

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,440
Alright, I'll go and be back soon.

136
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,970
Let's go.

137
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,440
Zhi Yi,

138
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,260
be careful.

139
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Give me your hand.

140
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,360
No need.

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,100
The slope is slippery.

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,920
If you don't give me your hand,

143
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,520
you'll slip down in a moment.

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,880
Really, it's not necessary.

145
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,480
It's fine.

146
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,690
I can walk by myself.

147
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,960
After picking the patchouli leaves,

148
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,520
there's a faint herbal scent.

149
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,250
Take a sniff.

150
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,170
It does seem to have a bit of a scent.

151
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
Let me hold the light for you.

152
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,240
How are you feeling, Uncle?

153
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,440
are you feeling better?

154
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,000
It seems

155
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
I really feel a bit

156
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
less painful now.

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,440
Uncle,

158
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,360
if it still hurts badly later,

159
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,400
we should go to the hospital tomorrow to have it checked.

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,930
Alright.

161
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,560
Then let's

162
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,640
distribute these medicines to everyone.

163
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,120
Okay.

164
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,120
Alright.

165
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,420
Let's go divide it.

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,520
That's enough.

167
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,400
Don't take it off, it's quite cold.

168
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,200
Leave it to me.

169
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
Go back and rest quickly.

170
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,560
Someone needs to watch over the medicine while it's brewing.

171
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,200
I've brewed Chinese medicine before.

172
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,659
You go back and rest first.

173
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,040
Jiang Cheng,

174
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,840
you should go back first.

175
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,900
I'll leave once I finish these tasks.

176
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,720
I'll go back.

177
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
I'm not going back.

178
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,360
I prepared this especially for Teacher Mu.

179
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,800
If you hadn't been there yesterday,

180
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,660
we wouldn't have known what to do.

181
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,160
I helped out yesterday too.

182
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
What's wrong with having a snack?

183
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,480
Don't be so polite.

184
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,809
It was no trouble at all.

185
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,780
Zhi Yi's business is my business.

186
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,539
Mu Chen,

187
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,760
thank you so much for yesterday.

188
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,320
There's no need to be so formal with me.

189
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,880
But...

190
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Gratitude aside,

191
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,520
if you dare to bully Zhi Yi,

192
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,170
I won't let you off the hook.

193
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,520
I rushed

194
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,360
to have all the wedding banquet food tested yesterday.

195
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,960
It turns out there really was a problem with the food.

196
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,560
It was the dish of black fungus.

197
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,480
When the wedding chef was soaking the black fungus yesterday,

198
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,740
he left it for too long,

199
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,600
causing the formation of bongkrekic acid toxin in the fungus.

200
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,360
Take a look at this.

201
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,520
Fortunately, it didn't exceed by much.

202
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,800
It didn't lead to more serious consequences.

203
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,860
Luckily, all the villagers are fine.

204
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,240
If they still feel unwell in any way,

205
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,280
remember to have them go to the hospital.

206
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,800
Alright.

207
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,860
I'll go right away.

208
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,560
Please be careful.

209
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,090
As for me,

210
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,360
I usually like to go

211
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,440
all around the country,

212
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,770
to gather inspiration.

213
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,100
I heard you've set up a talent and creativity base here,

214
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,760
so I immediately booked a trip.

215
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,800
We knew you were coming,

216
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,840
so we specially reserved a room for you.

217
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,560
The scenery in Nanling Village is very nice.

218
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,820
You should come often.

219
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,290
Here,

220
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,680
this way.

221
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,410
So, let's arrange it like this.

222
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,360
This is

223
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,090
the manager of our Banshan Hillside Guesthouse.

224
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,140
This is Li Ming,

225
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,760
Master Li,

226
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,360
who specializes in landscape painting.

227
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,040
Master Li,

228
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,480
I've long heard of your reputation.

229
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,340
I didn't expect

230
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,860
the manager to be so young.

231
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,080
Let me introduce our guesthouse to you.

232
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,320
This is our lobby.

233
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,680
That area over there

234
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,400
and that area

235
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,800
are the guest room areas.

236
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
The room specially reserved for you is there.
