1
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,480
Mu Chen.

2
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Something urgent came up.

3
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,380
I didn't have time to tell you.

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,289
Thank you for this time.

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,160
Take care on your way.

6
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,600
In the end, I still let you down.

7
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Zhiyi,

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,130
What do you mean by letting me down?

9
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
It's nothing.

10
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,450
let's not talk about it.

11
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,380
I'm relieved that someone is taking care of you.

12
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,520
Come out.

13
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,240
Stop eavesdropping.

14
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,320
I wasn't eavesdropping.

15
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,050
I was just...

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,000
passing by.

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,530
My car will be here soon.

18
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I'll be going now.

19
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,580
Then let me see you off.

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,000
He's a grown man, why does he need to be seen off?

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,170
Have a safe trip.

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,290
Come visit us often.

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,040
Then why don't you see him off?

24
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,160
His car has arrived.

25
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,360
No need to see him off.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,520
There's no need to see him off.

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:35,960
No need to see him off.

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,760
Look at you.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,600
Good news.

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,160
Good news.

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,880
What good news?

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,680
Manager Zhang and his team are planning to expand the factory

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,320
to our village for production.

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,840
It will be located at the back of the mountain.

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,280
So,

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,440
it won't cause pollution to our village.

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,760
So, your so-called good news is...

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,920
Manager Zhang has agreed

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
that villagers can invest in shares.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,320
There will be annual dividends for the villagers.

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,840
It sounds good,

42
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,880
but all investments come with risks.

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,920
And this is the hard-earned money of the villagers.

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,280
We should be cautious.

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,600
To avoid any mistakes.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,060
Well, we'll be keeping an eye on it, won't we?

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,160
That's true.

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Alright then.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,400
Pay back the money.

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,320
What are we going to do?

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,120
It's all our hard-earned money.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,720
Pay us back!

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Pay us back!

54
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,520
Make way!

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,700
Pay us back!

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,380
Pay us back!

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,370
What's going on?

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
The factory owner is a fraud.

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,240
The business was running fine yesterday.

60
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,000
overnight,

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,300
the entire factory has been emptied out.

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,140
Give us our money back!

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
Heartless boss, pay us back now!

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
Return all our hard-earned money to us!

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,570
You heartless boss!

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,079
He's not answering his phone at all.

67
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,160
Pay us back!

68
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,740
Did all the villagers invest?

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
Yes, everyone invested.

70
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,160
I invested too.

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,370
How could someone be so heartless?

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,400
That's all our hard-earned savings!

73
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,680
Grandma Sun,

74
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,800
did you invest too?

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,720
Yes, I did.

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,360
They said we'd get dividends after just one month of investment.

77
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,040
Now they've run off with the money.

78
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,320
That was my savings for my funeral!

79
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,740
These people were raised without any moral education!

80
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,220
Do you know how hard it is for us to earn money?

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,680
What are we supposed to do now?

82
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,720
Tell us, what should we do?

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
Everyone, please don't panic.

84
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,880
We will definitely help resolve this issue for everyone.

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,800
Fellow villagers,

86
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,460
please calm down for a moment.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,130
I admit I was negligent in this matter.

88
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,920
I promise I'll help everyone get their money back.

89
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,960
Tell us,

90
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,920
can you really help us get our money back?

91
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,440
That's right.

92
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,320
Impossible.

93
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,520
I've known Boss Zhang for many years.

94
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,850
He wouldn't deceive me.

95
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,050
The police have been notified.

96
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's wait for the police to handle it.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,260
Isn't it all over then?

98
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,720
Boss,

99
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,720
just taking the money and running,

100
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,320
won't there be any problems?

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,960
What problems could there be?

102
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,760
But I feel

103
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,170
something's not right.

104
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,520
Don't forget,

105
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,240
I still have your son.

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,200
If you don't want him to suffer a fate worse than death,

107
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,840
keep your mouth

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,040
shut tight.

109
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,120
I'll do whatever you say.

110
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
whatever you say.

111
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,640
Zhi Yi.

112
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,960
I've looked into Chairman Zhang's background.

113
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,290
I found a few addresses.

114
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,840
Let's help the police search.

115
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,640
let's go check them out.

116
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,040
Okay.

117
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,970
Let's hurry.

118
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,180
Trying to run, huh?

119
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,120
We really caught you.

120
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
I didn't expect you to come so quickly.

121
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,530
Chairman Zhang,

122
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,000
why did you do this?

123
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,680
This is all the villagers' hard-earned money.

124
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
Aren't you afraid of karma?

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,530
This world isn't as beautiful as you imagine.

126
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm just trying to make a living too.

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,440
Mu Chen has already given you the formula for the raw materials.

128
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
Manager Wu has also agreed to sign a contract with you.

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
You could have continued to make money this way.

130
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,920
Why did you have to deceive others?

131
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,280
You're all too naive.

132
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,960
To tell you the truth,

133
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,200
Mu Chen orchestrated all of this.

134
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,130
My son is still in his hands.

135
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,200
If you can rescue my son,

136
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,160
I'm willing to turn myself in.

137
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,090
What did you say?

138
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
It was all Mu Chen who instructed me to do it.

139
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
It was all Mu Chen.

140
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,320
It was all Mu Chen.

141
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
The police are already looking for him.

142
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
let's wait and see.

143
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,720
How could he do this?

144
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,330
For such a long time,

145
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,360
we didn't even realize

146
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,080
that he was the owner of the chemical plant.

147
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,610
We were all deceived by him.

148
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,840
Before,

149
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,200
he enthusiastically helped the guesthouse.

150
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,000
In fact, everything

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,520
was part of his calculation.

152
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
It's too much.

153
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
It's all my fault.

154
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,040
Zhiyi,

155
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,120
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

156
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,380
This isn't your fault.

157
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
The police will find him.

158
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,120
Mr. Mu,

159
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:13,960
Mr. Mu,

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,960
you can't leave.

161
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,960
Mr. Mu,

162
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,520
release my son.

163
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,160
You can't leave, Mr. Mu.

164
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,820
I'll give you every cent I owe you.

165
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,810
Get out of my way.

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,100
Please release my son.

167
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,720
Get lost.

168
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,880
Release my son.

169
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,010
Why are the police here?

170
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,159
Did you expose us?

171
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,080
Did you?

172
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,640
No,

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,980
I didn't say anything.

174
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,970
Get out of my way.

175
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,480
I didn't say anything.

176
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,060
Please, I beg you, release my son.

177
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,360
Mr. Mu.

178
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,980
Don't move!

179
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,570
Mu Chen, why did you do this?

180
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,700
Mu Chen,

181
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,090
return the money to the villagers.

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,880
Officer,

183
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,560
can we talk for a moment?

184
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,120
Make it quick.

185
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,300
Don't look at me like that.

186
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,890
Once you know how I've lived these past few years,

187
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,300
you'll understand me.

188
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,770
I can't understand you.

189
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,000
From beginning to end,

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,260
it was all your scheme.

191
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Even the incident with Jiang Dahai.

192
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,929
What about the kidnapping?

193
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,280
That too.

194
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,679
The drugging,

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,400
harassing the guesthouse,

196
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,320
the kidnapping,

197
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,240
I did it all.

198
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,280
What's wrong?

199
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,080
I just couldn't stand

200
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,720
seeing you with Jiang Cheng.

201
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,880
I came back this time

202
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
to reconcile with you.

203
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
Couldn't we be like we were before?

204
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,970
But instead,

205
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,760
you and that brat Jiang Cheng

206
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
are together now.

207
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Or maybe

208
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,840
you two hooked up

209
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,800
back when you were in school?

210
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,360
Don't assume

211
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,680
everyone is as despicable as you.

212
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,440
Despicable?

213
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
You forced me into this.

214
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,920
When your father pressured me for money back then,

215
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,120
why didn't you call me despicable then?

216
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,880
How was I supposed to

217
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,080
come up with that much money all at once?

218
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,840
I've done things even more despicable than this.

219
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,080
I've done things even more despicable than this.

220
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
Do you know how I've

221
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,490
lived these past few years?

222
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,760
I've finally achieved

223
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,890
my current success.

224
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,360
I never want to go back to those days

225
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,120
when people looked down on me.

226
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,060
You're truly beyond help.

227
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,530
Hand over the money.

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,760
The money?

229
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,020
I've already spent it all.

230
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,320
You.

231
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,040
Legal proceedings.

232
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,570
Let's go.

233
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,050
Why are you drinking alone here without inviting me?

234
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,850
I'm just having a casual drink.

235
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,660
I'll keep you company.

236
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,050
Jiang Cheng,

237
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,040
I have a question for you.

238
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,520
What is it?

239
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,240
What do you like about me?

240
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,800
Liking someone

241
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,000
does it need a reason?

242
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
It's enough that you know I like you.

243
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,560
If

244
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,560
I have to say what I like,

245
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
then I like

246
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,780
everything about you.

247
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,680
I like your seriousness,

248
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,240
I like your laziness,

249
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,420
I like your frankness,

250
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,160
I like your attitude towards life,

251
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,960
I like your indomitable spirit.

252
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
In short, I just like you as a person.

253
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
Where did you learn all these smooth-talking tricks?

254
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,160
Is this smooth-talking?

255
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,480
How is this smooth-talking?

256
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:05,920
Well,

257
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,400
So according to what you're saying,

258
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,200
I, as a person,

259
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,680
don't have any flaws?

260
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,140
If you insist on talking about flaws,

261
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,890
there is one.

262
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,120
What flaw?

263
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,960
Your only flaw is

264
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,450
that you don't like me as much as I like you.

265
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
Nonsense.

266
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,840
How do you know

267
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,770
that I don't like you even more?

268
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,360
I guess I like you a bit more.

269
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,040
Nonsense.

270
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,970
It's clearly me who likes you more.

271
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,450
it's obviously me who likes you a bit more.

272
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:49,760
You.

273
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
you like me.

274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,280
at most.

275
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,080
this much.

276
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,640
I like you.

277
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,880
this much.

278
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,240
even more than this.

279
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,840
even more.

280
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,440
this much.

281
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,640
What about you?

282
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,300
Do you have?

283
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,880
do you have this much?

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,930
I don't think so.

285
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,860
How much have you had to drink?

286
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,360
I haven't been drinking.

287
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,080
I.

288
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,480
I just drank.

289
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,900
this much, I guess.

290
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,640
This wine is really delicious.

291
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,170
Try some.

292
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,640
the one I just drank from.

293
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,730
Then I'll drink.

294
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,890
You're in my way.

295
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,400
Shh.

296
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,440
They're about to kiss.

297
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,000
Sorry.

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,530
Carry on.

299
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,440
It's getting late.

300
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm heading back.

301
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,840
I want to discuss something with everyone.

302
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm thinking of selling our guesthouse.
