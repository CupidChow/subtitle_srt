00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,940
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,020
(Address)

4
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,160
This street is nice.

5
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,400
The third house.

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
As the old saying goes,

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,330
the residential community
is still upscale.

8
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,030
My family,

9
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,830
it's here.

10
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,160
The third house up Anye Alley.

11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,270
Ms. Du said the previous house
was rented out.

12
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,160
But it's OK.

13
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,550
This one is better, and more spacious.

14
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,590
It even has a yard.

15
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,430
How is it?

16
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,990
It really is big.

17
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,120
Quite big.

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,270
It is indeed beautiful.

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Beautiful.

20
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,150
Just...

21
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,270
Just...

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,310
Where is the big house?

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Shen Gongcai!

24
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,250
- Shen Gongcai!
- Mother.

25
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,710
Where is the big house?

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,480
No, no, no.

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,360
Come over here.

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,680
- Father, you...
- Don't run.

29
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
It's a pre-sale unit,

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
isn't it?

31
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,300
She made it perfectly clear before.

32
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,430
There really is a house here.

33
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,560
I don't know what's going on.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,640
Are you stupid?

35
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,300
Why didn't you go see it?

36
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,310
It was windy those days.

37
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,790
The window is broken and needs repair.

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,690
She didn't let me look.

39
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,840
- Oh my goodness.
- You...!

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,430
Without even looking at the house,

41
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,410
you gave her the money?

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,550
She said before

43
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,900
that she has an old mother

44
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,080
and a little kid to take care.

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,770
Her husband doesn't take care
of anything.

46
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,150
The whole family rely on her alone.

47
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,920
If she couldn't get money that day,

48
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,400
they wouldn't have dinner. It's pitiful.

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,520
This is the lowest-level scam

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,190
in the hierarchy
of modern fraud circles.

51
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,300
Even you could fall for it.

52
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,030
Are you stupid?

53
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,650
- How could you hit me?
- Are you stupid?

54
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm telling you,

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,290
you really need to learn more from me.

56
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,990
If you could be half as reliable
as I am,

57
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,990
or don't compare with me,

58
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,550
- if you could be,
- Alright, shut up.

59
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,360
You're not as smart as this donkey.

60
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,430
I'm on your side. I didn't...

61
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,480
Look at it.

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
Are you trying to make me furious?

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,920
I really shouldn't have counted on you.

64
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,590
You hit me again.

65
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,430
Well,

66
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,990
report to the authorities. Right away.

67
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,080
Get that woman...

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,830
- Ms. Du.
- Yes, Ms. Du.

69
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,800
Get her arrested.

70
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,680
- Don't.
- Tricks from hundreds of years ago,

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,030
she dared to use them on us.

72
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,040
- Report it.
- Report it.

73
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,710
Let's go.

74
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,600
Mother. Mother. Mother.

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,800
Mother.

76
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,740
Mother. Mother. Mother.

77
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,800
Wait. I'll go get the money back.

78
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,360
- Don't report it.
- Don't...

79
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,870
Hurry up. Report to the authorities!

80
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,990
- Well...
- I get the money back and let it be.

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,960
Alright?

82
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,550
Mr. Lin,

83
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,240
someone filed a complaint
against an agent surnamed Du,

84
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,270
claiming that she swindled

85
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,550
of a large amount of house rent.

86
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,150
Agent fraud?

87
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,990
First, we must detain the person

88
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,430
to ensure the money is recovered.

89
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,750
But the person handling the matter said

90
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,590
the victims

91
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,640
are the Shen family.

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,150
They know about your relationship
with them,

93
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,550
so they came specifically to ask

94
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,900
if you have any other instruction.

95
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,990
The Shen family?

96
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,920
I

97
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,740
have asked

98
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,090
several agents who handle rentals.

99
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,390
They were unwilling
to reveal Ms. Du's whereabouts.

100
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,190
Fortunately, our family

101
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,090
is familiar
with the Price Stabilization Office

102
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,950
and with their help,

103
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,480
we made one of the agents speak

104
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,240
and found out where this Ms. Du lives.

105
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,600
That's really great.

106
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,550
Yes.

107
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,920
Anyway, she can't run away.

108
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,500
As long as we know where she lives,

109
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,200
we should be able
to find this person soon.

110
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,910
That's right.

111
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,280
Mr. Liu,

112
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,190
luckily we had you

113
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
this time.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,480
They have made no move.

115
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,230
We even thought

116
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,200
they had dropped the case

117
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,260
because it was too minor.

118
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,310
If that's really the case,
then we

119
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,360
can't get our money back.

120
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,200
That's right.

121
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
Don't worry.

122
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
I think

123
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,700
we just need to get our money back.

124
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,360
There's no need
to pursue it any further.

125
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,480
This kind of bad person

126
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,240
must be punished.

127
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes, they must be punished.

128
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,320
Yangyang.

129
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,060
(The Du's Residence)

130
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,520
Mr. Cheng.

131
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,710
Mrs. Shen,

132
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,800
what brings you here?

133
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,080
Don't mention it.

134
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,070
We were swindled out of money
by an agent.

135
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,140
Luckily, Mr. Liu

136
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,460
helped us find her residence.

137
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,780
This is the place.

138
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,580
So he brought us over here.

139
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,060
Well...

140
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,500
What's going on here?

141
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,460
Mr. Lin also knew that.

142
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,280
The case has directly gone
to the Prefecture.

143
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,560
- Oh no.
- Right now, this agent

144
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,820
has now been arrested

145
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,640
and was sent to the Prefecture
awaiting trial.

146
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,700
Arrested?

147
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,020
This is good.

148
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,580
(Capital Prefecture)

149
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,460
Mr. Lin.

150
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,260
Why have the Shen family come?

151
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,460
Because they also found

152
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,500
Ms. Du's residence,

153
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,260
so I brought them here.

154
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,660
Mr. Lin.

155
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,260
No need for formalities.

156
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,220
This person

157
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,660
is the agent who swindled your rent.

158
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,180
I spent a long time

159
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,380
using connections to find her,

160
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,420
yet you got her effortlessly.

161
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,580
Sorry about that,

162
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,860
Mr. Shen.

163
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,340
Mother.

164
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,040
- She is not.
- She looks so much like her.

165
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,540
They just look alike.

166
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,980
But why does she look exactly

167
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,180
like my mother?

168
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,300
I don't know either.

169
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,420
But she really isn't.

170
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,780
I've already confirmed it.

171
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,740
So,

172
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,620
you were deceived

173
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,580
because she looks extremely

174
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,660
like my mother.

175
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,020
Mr. Lin,

176
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,140
may I ask you

177
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,540
to show leniency to Ms. Du?

178
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,940
She is just a weak woman.

179
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,940
She has no other means
of making a living.

180
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,500
Her whole family depends solely on her.

181
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,420
I believe

182
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,220
she resorted to this as a last resort

183
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,780
only because she truly had no choice.

184
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,140
It seems that you have misunderstood.

185
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,460
The estate transactions of her

186
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,220
are the largest in Yong'an.

187
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,500
She is good at inflating house prices

188
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,220
and earning high commissions from it.

189
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,740
Nowadays,

190
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,020
she has dozens of servants at home.

191
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,980
She also lives in a large mansion
with three courtyards.

192
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,180
See, what did I tell you?

193
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,460
I guessed it would be like this.

194
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,980
She is just a fraud.

195
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,580
I guessed it would be like this.

196
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,460
What else have you lied to me about?

197
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,620
Mr. Shen,

198
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,340
I really didn't mean to.

199
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,060
It's just that you looked

200
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,220
too easy to deceive that day.

201
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,630
It feels like if I don't lie to you,

202
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,120
I just can't feel at ease in my heart.

203
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,220
Then I had an evil thought.

204
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,880
- I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.
- I...

205
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,430
You drived up house prices in the past.

206
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,460
Though it was an evil act,

207
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,520
you didn't violate the law.

208
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,660
But this time,

209
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,820
you scammed.

210
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,860
According to the law,

211
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,500
you should be imprisoned.

212
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,510
Great!

213
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,350
No, no, no.

214
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,240
Mr. Shen,

215
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,060
this is the money you gave me that day.

216
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,340
I return it to you now.

217
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,140
Mr. Shen, please forgive me.

218
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,900
Otherwise I will have to go to prison.

219
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,500
Mr. Shen, I'm begging you.

220
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,310
Mr. Shen, I'm begging you.

221
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,940
Mr. Shen.

222
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,820
Mei,

223
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,420
have you thought this through?

224
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,940
Can't you think it over again?

225
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,400
The two of us,

226
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,620
from high school to university,

227
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,720
have always been together.

228
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,580
You know me well.

229
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,900
I am a bit lazy sometimes.

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,860
But I will change.

231
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,020
I will definitely change.

232
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,220
I can definitely change that.

233
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,420
Besides, I might not inferior
to that guy in the future.

234
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,940
Do you want

235
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,980
to think it over again?

236
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,500
Alright,

237
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,740
let's stop here.

238
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,620
You're here.

239
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,060
Wait a moment.

240
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,980
Shaojie,

241
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,820
I really have to go.

242
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,660
Today should be the last time we meet.

243
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,940
In the future,

244
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,380
take good care of Yangyang.

245
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,220
I'm counting on you.

246
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,340
Are you OK?

247
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,860
I'm fine.

248
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,060
I'm fine.

249
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,100
Nothing wrong with me.

250
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,060
I was thinking about it on my way here.

251
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,180
I'm wondering,

252
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
in what way is he better than me.

253
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,420
I have to work hard.

254
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,900
I have to strive for it, right?

255
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,380
After I saw this,

256
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,660
I immediately understood.

257
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,100
It's right that you don't want me.

258
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,900
It's human nature, isn't it?

259
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,060
Well, are you really OK?

260
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,180
I'm really fine.

261
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,180
I...

262
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
If you don't believe me,

263
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,260
ask him.

264
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,540
Tell him not to just support you.

265
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,780
Support me as well.

266
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,020
I don't really mind.

267
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,740
This is such a big house.

268
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,690
It won't make much difference
if I'm here, right?

269
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,360
Come on, you...

270
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,300
Why are you still the same as before?

271
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,260
Alright.

272
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,780
I'm leaving.

273
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,100
Let me help you carry your things.

274
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,540
I'll bring it in for you.

275
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,380
Just go.

276
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,220
I'm going.

277
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,620
Let's go.

278
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,900
It's just...

279
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,180
Mr. Shen...

280
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,260
I...

281
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,420
I...

282
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,180
Forgive her.

283
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,380
We can't possibly

284
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,940
let someone

285
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,020
who looks a lot like my mother

286
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,740
go to prison, right?

287
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,980
Since

288
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,940
Yangyang said so,

289
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,540
then let it be.

290
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,260
Yes.

291
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,820
Mr. Lin,

292
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,020
let it be.

293
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,820
Father,

294
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,100
I know

295
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,740
you just can't bear to hurt someone

296
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,500
who looks exactly like my mother.

297
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,020
I won't be mad at you.

298
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,540
And

299
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,620
it's also quite normal

300
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,180
for you to mess things up.

301
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
It's OK.

302
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,540
Yangyang,

303
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,460
do you feel

304
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,980
that I am embarrassing?

305
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,180
Every time,

306
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,660
I mess it up.

307
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,660
It makes you lose face,

308
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,500
doesn't it?

309
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,780
Father,

310
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,220
I've already gotten used to it.

311
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,260
I am already a big kid.

312
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,860
I have grown up.

313
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,340
I know what kind of person

314
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,860
my father is.

315
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,580
You just need to be a kind father.

316
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,060
I know

317
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,980
my father

318
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,060
definitely won't be some great hero.

319
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,260
So,

320
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,340
you don't have to try so hard anymore.

321
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
It's OK if you're not as good as others.

322
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,380
I understand.

323
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,500
I understand.

324
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,260
Father.

325
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,060
Get up.

326
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,460
Get up.

327
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,380
Thank you.

328
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,460
Many thanks, Mr. Shen.

329
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,980
Thank you.

330
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,060
(Capital Prefecture)

331
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,980
Mr. Lin,

332
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,660
about Ms. Du's matter,

333
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,660
thank you so much.

334
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,860
You're welcome.

335
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,420
Actually, we were planning
to move out quickly.

336
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,900
As a result, we've troubled you again.

337
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,780
It's getting late.

338
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,700
If you can't find a new residence today,

339
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,300
you can still return to Yunshui Manor.

340
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,020
I will send someone to pick Lady Shen.

341
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,500
Mr. Lin, don't worry about us.

342
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,740
Today,

343
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,100
we just make do at the restaurant.

344
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,060
Yes.

345
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,620
Once we find a new house,

346
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,060
we will move out right away.

347
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,360
Regarding the matter with Ms. Du,

348
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,500
it was just an accident.

349
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,460
We will find a house as soon as possible

350
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,340
and move in.

351
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,140
Then I'll have Cheng Hu take you back.

352
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,670
No need to trouble you, Mr. Lin.

353
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,660
My carriage is already waiting here.

354
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,660
Yes.

355
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,340
Mr. Liu will take us back.

356
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,660
Mr. Lin, attend to your business.

357
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,580
We're going.

358
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,940
Many thanks, Mr. Lin.

359
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,020
Thank you.

360
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,220
- Hurry up.
- Thank you.

361
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,980
Mr. Liu, please

362
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,900
escort them safely back
to the restaurant.

363
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,580
(Guixiang Tavern)
Mr. Lin is this attentive

364
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,300
to this matter.

365
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,260
It seems he has probably

366
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,060
fallen for Lady Shen.

367
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,780
In this light,

368
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,340
it's fortunate that after being rejected
by Lady Shen,

369
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,020
you didn't act rashly again.

370
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,180
Otherwise, if you offended Mr. Lin
because of this,

371
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,300
that would be a loss
outweighing the gain.

372
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,580
Previously, I only knew

373
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
Mr. Lin and the Shen family
are relatives.

374
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,420
I never thought about it deeply.

375
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,820
Thinking back carefully now,

376
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,160
it seems that Lady Shen also

377
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,100
has feelings for Mr. Lin.

378
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,900
No wonder.

379
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,380
I never had a chance
from the very beginning.

380
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,250
Since the feelings are not mutual,

381
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,500
it cannot be forced.

382
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,500
It's just

383
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,220
that after all these years,

384
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,820
this is the first time you've met a lady

385
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,940
you want to marry.

386
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,260
What a pity.

387
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,500
At my age,

388
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,500
establishing a career is more important
than starting a family.

389
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,180
Although we cannot be husband and wife,

390
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,020
we can be friends

391
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,700
and join forces in and business.

392
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,940
It's also great.

393
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,940
Mr. Lin has boundless prospects.

394
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,980
He will never stop here.

395
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,220
In the future,

396
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,500
if Lady Shen becomes his wife,

397
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,100
then our Liu family,
as the Shen family's right-hand,

398
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,020
can also benefit from it.

399
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,380
In this way,

400
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,500
this couldn't be better.

401
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,580
(Shen's Diner)

402
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,860
Form is emptiness.

403
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,020
Emptiness is form.

404
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,340
Form is emptiness.

405
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,740
Emptiness is form.

406
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,100
Form is emptiness.

407
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,540
Emptiness is form.

408
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,940
Form is emptiness.

409
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,100
Emptiness is form.

410
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,420
Form is emptiness.

411
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,820
Emptiness is form.

412
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,340
Form is emptiness.

413
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,500
Emptiness is form.

414
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,740
I'm a little scared.

415
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,100
It's OK.

416
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,190
Form is emptiness.

417
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,060
Emptiness is form.

418
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,900
Gongcai,

419
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,740
come out.

420
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,460
What are you doing?

421
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,780
What's going on in there?

422
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,220
What's wrong with Yangyang saying that?

423
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,220
Is that wrong?

424
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,340
You are unreliable in your own work.

425
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,380
Others can't point it out?

426
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,660
We haven't even done anything yet.

427
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,840
- You behave so foolishly.
- Emptiness is form, form is emptiness.

428
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,460
- Come out!
- Emptiness is form.

429
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,540
- Form is emptiness.
- Come out!

430
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,380
Stop.

431
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,020
If yelling were useful,

432
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,900
donkeys would rule the world.

433
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,060
Emptiness is form.

434
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,540
Form is emptiness.

435
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,740
Emptiness is form.

436
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,820
Form is emptiness.

437
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,660
Son,

438
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,860
listen to me. Come out.

439
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,140
I know you're feeling upset.

440
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,500
Come out, I will talk with you.

441
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,380
Is it OK?

442
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,060
Or let your father make you
a few dishes.

443
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,900
Alright?

444
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,860
Be good, Gongcai.

445
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,820
Come out.

446
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,660
OK?

447
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,580
See, everyone is here waiting for you.

448
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,820
Hurry up and come out.

449
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,740
Emptiness is form.

450
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,540
Form is emptiness.

451
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,300
Shen Shaojie,

452
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,180
you, a grown man, put on this act here.

453
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,460
Who are you trying to show it to?

454
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,300
If you still don't come out,

455
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,880
- I'll kick the door open.
- Emptiness is form.

456
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,020
- Form is emptiness
- Three.

457
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,180
- Emptiness is form.
- Two.

458
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,580
Grandma.

459
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,100
- Mother.
- My shoes.

460
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,940
Give me the shoes.

461
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Look at him.

462
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,340
Not swayed by persuasion or force.

463
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,060
My brother was never like this before.

464
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,980
Forgive him.

465
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,060
I guess

466
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,360
he was upset today by that lady

467
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,460
who looks just like his ex.

468
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,860
He just won't let it go.

469
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,180
Be more understanding toward him.

470
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,300
Yangyang also criticized him.

471
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,380
He felt upset.

472
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,380
Don't you often teach me
not to be impulsive?

473
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,540
If you really kick this door
and break it,

474
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,470
it will cost money.

475
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,820
We still have to fix it.

476
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,180
Alright, come over here.

477
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,300
Form is emptiness.

478
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,620
Emptiness is form.

479
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,100
Form is emptiness.

480
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,540
It seems he has really been affected.

481
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,140
He usually seems pretty carefree.

482
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,140
Why did he suddenly

483
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,260
become so vulnerable?

484
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,940
Emptiness is form.

485
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,700
Form is emptiness.

486
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,020
Emptiness is form.

487
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,220
Form is emptiness.

488
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,580
Emptiness is form.

489
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,180
Father,

490
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,620
I'm sorry.

491
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,140
I shouldn't have said that to you.

492
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,740
If you really want to be a great hero,

493
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,740
I will believe in you too.

494
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,460
Although it's hard to achieve,

495
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,580
I will still try hard.

496
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,820
Father,

497
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,780
please don't be sad.

498
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,700
Be good, Yangyang.

499
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,940
Don't cry anymore.

500
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,780
Your father will come out.

501
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,100
Father...

502
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,700
Yangyang,

503
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,700
no matter what,

504
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,540
I will never let you down again.

505
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,140
(Cao Mansion)

506
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,900
I've made some progress on the matter
you asked me to look into.

507
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,220
The person who stole the slips
from the Princess's residence

508
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,540
had been reported dead and removed
from the register five years ago.

509
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,420
Then I discovered,

510
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,500
the people reported dead

511
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,320
include quite a few soldiers
in recent years.

512
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,100
And like that thief,

513
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,140
we can't find where their graves are.

514
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,020
Maybe these people never actually died.

515
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,580
Could it be

516
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,740
that someone collected these soldiers

517
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,780
to fake their deaths?

518
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,490
In the Ministries of Revenue
and Personnel,

519
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,680
there are two groups who deregistered

520
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,500
the household records of these soldiers.

521
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,260
Interestingly,

522
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,380
these two groups of people

523
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,660
are all students of Zhao Xunzhi.

524
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,300
After talking with Zhao Xunzhi,

525
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,590
all these people resigned
and returned to their hometowns.

526
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,380
It still ended up involving Zhao Xunzhi.

527
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,900
This matter has a significant impact.

528
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
If they raise all these people,

529
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,940
that would be quite a number
of usable soldiers.

530
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,140
Who needs so many soldiers?

531
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,860
Who do you think

532
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,460
it will be?

533
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,060
(I don't know.)

534
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,500
I really don't know.

535
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,100
(Prince Zhao)

536
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,100
Zhao...

537
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,060
I'll go find His Majesty right away.

538
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,380
I'll risk my life to sue him.

539
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,190
Rest assured.
I will never drag you into this.

540
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,580
Uncle, Uncle.

541
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,620
Calm down.

542
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,700
You promised me

543
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,940
that you won't act impulsively.

544
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,020
OK.

545
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,220
I don't act impulsively.

546
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,340
Calm down.

547
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,540
Calm down.

548
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,740
I don't act impulsively.

549
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,740
But I can't stand all this filth.

550
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,740
I know you have a forthright nature.

551
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,380
When my father was alive,

552
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,940
he said that when you were classmates,

553
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,300
whenever you encountered injustice,

554
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,700
you would always stand up.

555
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,180
Even now, you are still willing
to give all to help me.

556
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,780
I am truly grateful.

557
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,580
It's just that right now
we must not act rashly.

558
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,980
Otherwise, it will alert the enemy.

559
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,220
And it will be harder.

560
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,660
OK.

561
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,660
Back when your father was still around,

562
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,900
I listened to your father.

563
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,620
Now I will listen to you.

564
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,580
Tell me

565
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,340
what we should do next.

566
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,900
Zhao Xunzhi

567
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,100
was able to accomplish these things
quietly.

568
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,740
It shows that he is extremely cautious.

569
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,620
We still need to find a pretext

570
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,820
to approach him.

571
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,780
(Miss You in Yong'an)

572
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,420
Go help her.

573
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,580
Lady Jingwen.

574
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:50,700
You are a guest.

575
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,980
How could I let you do this?

576
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,070
Just a casual act.

577
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,370
I see you're busy.

578
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,460
Sorry to disturbed you.

579
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,740
You don't.

580
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,590
You are the most important guest
in our family.

581
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,660
You can come anytime.

582
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,060
Help deliver this to the kitchen.

583
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,460
Sit with me?

584
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,700
OK.

585
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,420
Here.

586
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,540
In fact,

587
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,580
my grandfather is very pleased
with Lin Yan.

588
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,420
Is that what I understand it to mean?

589
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,420
I don't have a good father
to make arrangements for me.

590
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,580
Only my grandfather worries
about my marriage.

591
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,400
I am already at this age.

592
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
It would be improper
not to discuss marriage.

593
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,980
Although Lin Yan is older,

594
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,460
he seems to have good character.

595
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,860
My mother was deeply in love
with my father.

596
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,220
In the end, she was let down
and passed away in grief.

597
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,980
I think

598
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,300
there are no love
between Lin Yan and me.

599
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,900
I will never end up like my mother did.

600
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,540
Are you surprised?

601
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,020
I do not feel ashamed
for planning for myself.

602
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,140
You should do the same

603
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,620
and make some plans for yourself.

604
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,460
I am actually the same age as Lin Yan.

605
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,100
I have no plans to get married
in Yong'an.

606
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,060
Are you 25 years old?

607
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,780
That's not what I mean.

608
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,980
What I mean is,

609
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,220
I just feel surprised.

610
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,240
You are already this old.

611
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,990
Doesn't your family ever
urge you about it?

612
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,620
They just want me to be happy.

613
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,620
Aren't they ever afraid of gossip?

614
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,420
In fact,

615
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,020
Mr. Lin always wears a stern face,

616
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,860
but he is very kind-hearted.

617
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
He will definitely

618
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,180
treat his wife very well in the future.

619
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,940
He has a lot of unspoken pain
in his heart;

620
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,740
you must treat him well in the future.

621
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,980
Why does what you said sound so strange?

622
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,540
It's more like

623
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,740
an old mother entrusting her child.

624
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,400
You're almost done eating
all the candied hawthorns.

625
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,480
Aren't you afraid of a toothache now?

626
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,220
I'm still afraid.

627
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,700
But didn't my auntie say

628
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,140
that one must have courage?

629
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,180
Is this what your auntie taught you?

630
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,220
In his current state,

631
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,380
your father can't control you anymore.

632
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,770
He couldn't control her
even when he wasn't like this.

633
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,140
I really think Yangyang
should go to school.

634
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,340
Always keeping her in the restaurant
is not a solution.

635
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,500
That's right.

636
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,780
But can I go to the Hongwen Academy?

637
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,660
Yangyang,

638
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,500
listen.

639
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,820
Let's invite a mentor to our home
to teach you.

640
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,340
Actually, it's quite good.

641
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,700
At least it saves the commuting time.

642
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,180
We'll get you

643
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,220
an excellent mentor

644
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,060
to teach you first.

645
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,980
Then we'll find an opportunity
to get into the Hongwen Academy.

646
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,780
But I still want to go
to the Hongwen Academy.

647
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,900
If so, I can see the Crown Prince.

648
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,460
She still wants to see the Crown Prince.

649
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,940
I just don't understand.

650
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,280
Back when we were in modern times,

651
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,790
we didn't have a school district house,

652
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,890
so it was fine if we couldn't get
into a good school.

653
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,810
Now that we have money.

654
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,520
Why can't we still get
into a good school?

655
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,740
So ridiculous!

656
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,300
(Hongwen Academy)

657
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,740
Take care.

658
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,140
(Ruisi Pavilion)

659
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,860
(Boundless Ocean of Learning)

660
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,020
Excuse me.

661
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
I'd like to ask

662
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,420
who said

663
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,380
that our Yangyang

664
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,590
could get into Hongwen Academy.

665
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,620
I'm not sure either.

666
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,020
I just pass on the message.

667
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,020
Please take the young lady along.

668
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,940
Alright.

669
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,780
Yangyang, look.

670
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,340
(Ruisi Pavilion)

671
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,300
Auntie, look.

672
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,900
Their school uniforms look so nice.

673
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,300
That's called a 'Lanshan'.

674
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,180
This is what students wore at that time.

675
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,660
(Ruisi Pavilion)

676
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,500
Looks nice.

677
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,260
This is the teaching studio
in the academy,

678
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,820
where the mentors live

679
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,820
and study.

680
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,300
Mentor Zhao is waiting for you.

681
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,610
- Please.
- Alright, let's go.

682
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,500
- OK.
- Let's go.

683
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,350
Thank you.

684
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,240
Let's go.

685
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,460
Mentor Zhao, they have arrived.

686
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,860
Greetings, Mentor Zhao.

687
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,060
Greetings, Mentor Zhao.

688
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,500
You must be Shen Yangyang.

689
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,460
Alright.

690
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,060
Starting from tomorrow,

691
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,300
you can come here to study.

692
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,300
- That's great.
- That's great.

693
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,700
You all know the rules
of Hongwen Academy, right?

694
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,500
We know.

695
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,340
Be sure to dress her in men's clothing.

696
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,300
Alright.

697
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,140
Yeah!

698
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,580
I can finally get
into the Hongwen Academy.

699
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,220
Mentor Zhao,

700
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,420
I don't know how you chose Yangyang.

701
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,740
I hope you can enlighten me.

702
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,820
Yes.

703
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,660
You actually

704
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,620
don't even know.

705
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,740
We don't know.

706
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,820
We don't know.

707
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,620
Mentor!

708
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,380
You...

709
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,220
Mentor,

710
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,940
I heard you are
the most influential person

711
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,800
in the entire Academy.

712
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,580
I request you...

713
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,180
No, I beg you

714
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,300
to let our child

715
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,860
disguise herself as a boy to study here.

716
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,700
As long as you agree,

717
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
I'm willing to work
like a horse or an ox for you.

718
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,540
Alright, alright.

719
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,580
Sir,

720
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,980
please get up first.

721
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,580
Then we can have a proper talk.

722
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,700
Mentor, if you don't agree,

723
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,180
I won't get up. I'll stay on my knees.

724
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,020
I...

725
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,500
Please, please, please.

726
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,180
You...

727
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,700
Why don't you speak?

728
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,820
Mentor, if you don't speak,

729
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,100
I'll take it as your agreement.

730
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Then starting from today,

731
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,200
I will work like a horse or an ox
for you.

732
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,900
I'm yours

733
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,540
horse or ox.

734
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,200
I just mopped the floor.
Don't rush.

735
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Let me wipe the soles for you.

736
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,620
It's done.

737
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,660
Wait a moment.

738
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,860
The other one.

739
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,660
Please.

740
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,620
(Boundless Ocean of Learning)
Expose your belly to the sun,

741
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,140
and your back as well.

742
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,740
Get rid of dampness.

743
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,700
I don't believe I can't win you over.

744
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,220
Mentor.

745
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,860
Mentor. Mentor.

746
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,780
Don't go, Mentor.

747
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,940
Don't come over!

748
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,260
- Don't come over.
- Take a look first.

749
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,420
Look how my books are drying.

750
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,020
Good, very good, I'm telling you,

751
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,740
there are rules for admitting students.

752
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,790
If you keep making trouble,

753
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,810
I'll have to call someone.

754
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,510
Well, Mentor...

755
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,660
Let me go.

756
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,900
Mentor. Mentor. Mentor.

757
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,700
Don't be impulsive.

758
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,420
You'll gradually
realize my good qualities.

759
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,760
Mentor Zhao, you've finished work.

760
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,860
Wish you a prosperous business.

761
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,720
Mentor Zhao, you've finished work.

762
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,580
Wish you a prosperous business.

763
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,620
Who is it?

764
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,180
- You... this...
- Well,

765
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,420
it's me.

766
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,540
What I'm afraid of is you.

767
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,020
Mentor. Mentor.

768
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,060
Mentor.

769
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,940
You... you...

770
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,220
What are you doing?

771
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,320
Let me carry you on my back.

772
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,380
Someone!

773
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,420
Put me down.

774
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,300
Someone!

775
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,260
He's… he's...

776
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,300
I'll carry you on my back.

777
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,380
Someone!

778
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,700
Someone!

779
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,940
Calm down.

780
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,500
Mr. Shen,

781
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,140
what exactly do you want to do?

782
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,080
Mentor, you don't know.

783
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,180
I'm warming the bed for you.

784
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,540
This way you'll sleep more warmly.

785
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,980
It's already warm. Come on, sleep.

786
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,060
I'm begging you.

787
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,140
Stop messing around.

788
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,460
OK? Go back.

789
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,940
Go back, will you?

790
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,820
Mentor, don't beg me.

791
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,180
I'm begging you, truly.

792
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,780
Please let my daughter
enroll and study.

793
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,860
If she doesn't study here,

794
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,420
I will serve you here for one more day.

795
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,460
My mind is made up.

796
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
I'm begging you, Mentor.

797
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,300
I'm begging you.

798
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,180
Please. Please.

799
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,020
Alright.

800
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,260
Forget it.

801
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,980
I

802
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,900
make an exception for you.

803
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,060
Let your daughter come and enroll.

804
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,060
That's great.

805
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,740
Thank you, Mentor, thank you.

806
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,580
No need to thank.

807
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,300
I have only one request.

808
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,020
Got it, disappear immediately.

809
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,180
You, you...

810
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,300
Mentor, don't be afraid.

811
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,500
I forgot to take my shoes.

812
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,820
Disappear, disappear, disappear.

813
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,300
Yangyang.

814
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,220
Father.

815
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,700
Father.

816
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,300
You're amazing, father.

817
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,540
- Father, you're amazing.
- Look how happy she is.

818
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,180
- Gongcai.
- You actually managed to help me

819
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,980
get the chance to study
in the Academy.

820
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,940
Father.

821
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,180
- Shaojie, open the door.
- Gongcai.

822
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,390
- Finally, the door is open.
- Father.

823
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,900
Father.

824
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,740
Let's go.

825
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,860
Father.

826
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,560
- Father, where did you go?
- Shaojie.

827
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,660
Shaojie?

828
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,500
Father?

829
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,500
Where is he?

830
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,340
I don't know.

831
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,370
- Father.
- Shaojie.

832
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,380
Where is he?

833
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,700
You're back.

834
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,020
How is it?

835
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,560
Can Yangyang go to the Hongwen Academy?

836
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,300
- Great!
- Deyuan,

837
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,210
you've been here.

838
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,380
Have you seen my brother?

839
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,900
I've been in the kitchen.

840
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,790
I didn't notice.

841
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,680
What's wrong?

842
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,780
Mt father is missing.

843
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,020
My mother doesn't want me anymore.

844
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,860
Now my father has run away too.

845
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,580
No, that won't happen.

846
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,620
Don't cry, don't cry.

847
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,100
He wouldn't run away.

848
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,860
- He just goes out for a walk.
- Exactly.

849
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,060
He wants to get some fresh air.

850
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,860
- It's fine.
- Don't cry.

851
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,100
This kid...

852
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,900
What is this?

853
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,820
What's this?

854
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,580
Looks like it was scratched by a dog.

855
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,780
It's my father's handwriting.

856
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,820
Family members,

857
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,740
when you see this letter,

858
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,980
I have already embarked

859
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,500
the journey of starting anew.

860
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,180
At 30, it's the prime age
for exploration.

861
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,820
When I become a great hero,

862
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,860
I'll return home in glory.

863
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,320
At that time,

864
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,020
you will surely
achieve academic success

865
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,780
at the Hongwen Academy.

866
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,140
We will meet at the peak.

867
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,890
I will regularly let you know I'm safe.

868
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,980
Do not miss me.

869
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,420
This little brat!

870
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,980
What is he trying to do?

871
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,300
What is this?

872
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,970
How come there's money?

873
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,800
The money in the box
is what I've been saving.

874
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,220
Leave them to Yangyang

875
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,180
as pocket money.

876
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,340
- Well...
- Father!

877
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,140
It's all the money he tricked out of me.

878
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,330
He hasn't spent a single cent.

879
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,020
No, I have to go find him.

880
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,260
- Come back.
- Father...

881
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,540
Do you know where he went?

882
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,580
You just go find him.

883
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,860
Besides, he's a grown man now.
How could he get lost?

884
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,990
He wants to explore outside.

885
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,420
Just let him have a go at it.

886
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,880
There's no way he could be kidnapped.

887
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,300
Him? With that brain of his.

888
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,140
His brain was kicked by a donkey,
you know?

889
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,540
Father...

890
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,540
Yangyang, don't cry, don't cry.

891
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,860
Don't cry.

892
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,740
Your father has a really good mind.

893
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,380
Wise yet humble, truly.

894
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,890
He has turned misfortune
into good fortune since he was little.

895
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,560
Nothing happened.

896
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,700
He will definitely come back

897
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,540
and meet you at the valley.

898
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,660
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no.

899
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,580
Meet you at the peak.

900
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,660
- Really?
- Yes.

901
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,500
Sure.

902
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,420
Sure.

903
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,460
When he comes back,

904
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,420
he must have built a career for you.

905
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,840
Yangyang,

906
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,400
you study hard at the Hongwen Academy

907
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,760
and become an outstanding student.

908
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,380
He will be very happy when he returns.

909
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,540
Meet you at the peak.

910
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,740
Meet you at the peak.

911
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,100
Yangyang, Yangyang, don't cry.

912
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,460
Meet you at the peak.

913
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,580
Don't cry, don't cry.

914
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,460
Don't cry.

915
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,220
(Yunshui Manor)

916
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,780
You clearly didn't show up yourself,

917
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,700
and had Censor Pei invite Zhao Xunzhi.

918
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,940
No matter how I think about it,

919
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,340
he really has no reason to refuse.

920
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,820
But he still avoids meeting.

921
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,260
Zhao Xunzhi

922
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,060
must have grown suspicious.

923
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,980
I have obtained Master Xiao's slips.

924
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,500
Prince Zhao must have instructed

925
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,990
Zhao Xunzhi to be on guard against me.

926
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,960
I still can't rashly
enter the Hongwen Academy.

927
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,340
I need to think of another plan.

928
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,020
Yangyang,

929
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,780
what are you doing here?

930
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,140
Do your family know?

931
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,380
Mr. Lin, I came on my own.

932
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,900
I came here because I want

933
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,220
to give you this candied hawthorn.

934
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,300
Give it to me?

935
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,260
Thank you.

936
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,180
Ask me

937
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,380
why I want to give you it.

938
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,140
Why do you want to give me it?

939
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,340
Because I'm going to study
in the Hongwen Academy.

940
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,220
This is the opportunity

941
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,620
that my father fought for me.

942
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,040
I'm giving you this candied hawthorn

943
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,780
because I'd like to ask you
for some advice

944
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,660
on how I can

945
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,500
become an outstanding student.

946
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,100
Yangyang,

947
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,340
you can't.

948
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,500
Go back and tell your family

949
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,360
that something goes wrong
with Hongwen Academy.

950
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,860
You must not get involved.

951
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,940
What's wrong?

952
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,820
Is it because of Mentor Zhao?

953
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,060
Well, how did you know?

954
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,420
Mr. Liu Chang,

955
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,220
when you were just talking outside,

956
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,700
I've already heard what you said.

957
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,900
But this makes it even more exciting.

958
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,740
Mr. Lin,

959
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,900
I want to go there even more now.

960
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,500
I can help you approach Mentor Zhao.

961
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,900
Yangyang,

962
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,780
no, absolutely not.

963
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,580
This is not a game for children.

964
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,980
Don't mess around. Let's go.

965
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,580
I'm not a child.

966
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
I'm really impressive.

967
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,340
Let's go find your auntie.

968
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,540
(Shen's Diner)

969
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,980
No, absolutely not.

970
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,180
Yangyang, stop messing around.

971
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,540
This is not child's play.

972
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
Auntie, why are you so lacking
in justice?

973
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,340
Didn't we agree

974
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,860
that we were going to help Mr. Lin?

975
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,340
This has nothing to do with justice.

976
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,740
How does it not matter?

977
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,020
If a great hero is injured,

978
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,500
would we ignore him?

979
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,550
If a beggar asks for food at the door,

980
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,860
would you refuse to feed him?

981
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,620
Even if Ming wandered to our home,

982
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,820
it has already become family.

983
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,620
Will you ignore Mr. Lin?

984
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,420
Mr. Lin, please come with me.

985
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,700
It's OK.

986
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,940
It's OK.

987
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,820
You want to reverse the case.

988
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,320
We should give your our full support.

989
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,580
But Yangyang is just a child.

990
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,480
I don't know

991
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,000
whether you told something to Yangyang.

992
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,020
But this is too dangerous.

993
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,990
- She is not...
- Wait.

994
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,340
You think

995
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,080
I'm taking advantage of Yangyang?

996
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,420
I believe you are not
that kind of person.

997
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,100
If you don't have even a bit
of that kind of thought,

998
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,180
why would you bring her back
and tell us all this?

999
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,260
This is exactly what you think of me?

1000
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,860
It's not.

1001
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,740
I, I...

1002
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,580
Lady Shen,

1003
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,380
Yangyang is not my child.

1004
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,600
I can't take harsh words.

1005
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,200
I can't make it clear
with gentle words.

1006
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,700
So I brought her back to meet you.

1007
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,960
Put yourself in my position
and think about it.

1008
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,100
If she made such a proposal,

1009
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,080
and I kept it from you,

1010
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,500
then what kind of person am I?

1011
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,140
Sorry.

1012
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,300
I didn't think it through enough.

1013
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,620
Auntie.

1014
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,340
Auntie.

1015
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,060
It really wasn't Mr. Lin
who made me do that.

1016
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,420
Didn't you teach me

1017
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,620
to be helpful?

1018
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,500
I just want to ask Mr. Lin

1019
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,340
how to be an outstanding student.

1020
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,420
Mr. Lin helped me,

1021
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,900
and I also need to help him.

1022
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,060
Auntie,

1023
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,900
how can you criticize Mr. Lin like that?

1024
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,620
It's just that my concern
has made me anxious.

1025
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,060
How could I think
you're that kind of person?

1026
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,460
Even if I am, you are not.

1027
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,540
You're not that kind of person either.

1028
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,700
Why say that?

1029
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,740
Forget it.

1030
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,220
I understand what you mean.

1031
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,220
It's fine
as long as you're not mad at me.

1032
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,420
I've never been mad at me.

1033
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,740
We all don't mind.

1034
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,900
Right?

1035
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,900
We're family.

1036
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,700
But Mr. Lin,

1037
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,660
if Mentor Zhao really has a problem,

1038
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,700
can we send Yangyang to Hongwen Academy?

1039
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,580
Why can't I go?

1040
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,860
I'm not afraid.

1041
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,180
I just want to study there.

1042
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,220
The Hongwen Academy is so big.

1043
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,220
There are so many people.

1044
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,540
Could he really cause such chaos?

1045
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,460
Besides, all those issues of his

1046
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,980
are things of the past.

1047
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,260
We just need to be more careful.

1048
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,460
Harvard has produced criminals too.

1049
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,360
Who would refuse to go to Harvard
just because there are criminals, right?

1050
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,660
Oh my, you even speak of Harvard.

1051
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,860
You have a point.

1052
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,980
Hongwen Academy is indeed
the best school in Yong'an.

1053
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,580
But Zhao Xunzhi

1054
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,980
probably doesn't know
that our two families have old ties.

1055
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,860
That's why he agreed
to let Yangyang enroll.

1056
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,780
Gongcai's demeanor on the day
he met Mentor Zhao

1057
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,820
really made it hard
to associate him with you.

1058
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,860
Then can I help Mr. Lin?

1059
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,420
Yangyang, just focus on your studies.

1060
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,860
No need to help me.

1061
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,060
Mr. Lin,

1062
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,580
after Yangyang gets into the Academy,

1063
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,660
if she could really help you
approach Mentor Zhao,

1064
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,580
I think this is a good thing.

1065
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,460
Right?

1066
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,180
We're family. Nothing to be afraid of.

1067
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,380
She must go through hardships.

1068
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,860
By then,

1069
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,180
when Yangyang graduated
from the Academy,

1070
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,660
her résumé should definitely
include a note

1071
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,220
that she once helped you
clear your name.

1072
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,300
How impressive!

1073
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,180
Exactly.

1074
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,860
- This is so cool.
- Is it?

1075
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,780
Cool?

1076
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,700
It means impressive.

1077
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,140
In my heart,

1078
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,660
Mr. Lin is the coolest.

1079
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,340
Yes.

1080
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,020
The most awesome.

1081
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,540
Sorry.

1082
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,260
Sorry.
