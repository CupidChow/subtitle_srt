00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,990
=Yummy Yummy Yummy=

2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,190
You want to work?

4
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,910
Yes, it's me.

5
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,190
So sloppy.

6
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,350
Where did you work before?

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,350
I was in Fenglin Town.

8
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,550
Why did you come to Yong'an?

9
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,680
There are more opportunities

10
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,960
in Yong'an.

11
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,070
It's hard to find work
in Fenglin Town now.

12
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,990
I see.

13
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,480
You couldn't make it in Fenglin, huh?

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,240
Let's go.

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
Where are we heading?

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,480
To Juxian Alley.

17
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,430
Wait.

18
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,830
There are so many places.

19
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,300
Why Juxian Alley?

20
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,310
With your qualifications,

21
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,620
it's hard to find work elsewhere.

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,900
Recently, the Shen family

23
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,370
has been leading the recruitment.

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,600
Everyone's following suit.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,950
There are fewer slave trades now.

26
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,440
You can try to recommend yourself.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,200
Question: Is it the Shen family

28
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,030
who's running Shen's Diner?

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,400
- Yes.
- I won't go there.

30
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,710
I can't go there.

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,990
How can I?

32
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,870
I won't.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,360
Don't worry.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,640
Shen's Diner isn't hiring.

35
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,150
Many people want to go there.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
You won't be chosen.

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
Another question.

38
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,830
Which other diner has copied

39
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,080
Shen's Diner's recruitment method?

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,480
Yunlai Tavern.

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,750
Yunlai Tavern?

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,760
Right.

43
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,860
(Yunlai Tavern)

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,030
Name.

45
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,870
A Dou.

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,920
What?

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
A Dou.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,800
How strange.

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
A Dou?

50
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,870
What's the surname?

51
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
Just "A". Is that okay?

52
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,550
Why?

53
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,870
Any pimples on your face?

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,830
Aside from being dirty,

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
he's fine.

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,270
Just like in TV shows.

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,680
A fake beard is enough as a disguise.

58
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,480
Today,

59
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,950
we need someone to lead the horse

60
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,310
and show the way for Mr. Lu.

61
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,800
You need to be with him often.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
Be quick-witted.

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
Definitely.

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,030
When Mr. Lu makes tea,

65
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,600
you need to watch the water.

66
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,020
That's being quick-witted.

67
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,040
Hey, let me do it.

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,470
I'm good at this; you take a break.

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,030
Here, Mr. Lu.

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Here.

71
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,620
- Sorry.
- Go.

72
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,280
Give me another chance.

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,340
I'm not usually like this.

74
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,310
I was just too nervous.

75
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm usually very quick-witted.

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,040
Quick-witted?

77
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,630
Give me another chance.

78
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,990
- Let's talk this over.
- Leave.

79
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,920
With food and lodging,

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,240
I only need 10 qian a month.

81
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,190
We can't give you that.

82
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,040
Mr. Lu.

83
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
Eight qian will do.

84
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,260
We can't give you that.

85
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,310
Five qian, then.

86
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,310
Just leave.

87
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,920
I don't care about salary.

88
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
Mr. Lu.

89
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,830
Wait.

90
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,480
Go sign the contract.

91
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,120
Tidy up your hair and beard.

92
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,190
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

93
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,480
But my body and hair
are given by my parents.

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,550
I can't just damage them.

95
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
I'll just wash up.

96
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,280
Rest assured.

97
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,680
I'll be spotless.

98
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
Is that okay?

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,510
Come on.

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,080
This way.

101
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
Mr. Lu,

102
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,040
this man may be foolish,

103
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,190
but he'll do for a meal.

104
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,510
Aside from the Chunyan
that Feng Li bought,

105
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,430
there's no such bargain anymore.

106
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,680
Also,

107
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,750
for the Competition next month,

108
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,590
don't we

109
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,600
need a new face?

110
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,860
(Shen's Diner)

111
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,480
Mr. Shen, you called for me?

112
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,430
Yu San.

113
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,600
I've prepared a few dishes.

114
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,840
Sit and taste them.

115
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,710
Come on.

116
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,120
In other places,

117
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
we can only eat
after the diner is closed.

118
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,720
That's nonsense.

119
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,240
Once you're in Shen's Diner,

120
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,610
you're not just an employee;

121
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,720
you're family.

122
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,070
Stop wasting time and sit.

123
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,920
Taste these stir-fries

124
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,510
and give an honest evaluation.

125
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,270
Come on.

126
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,950
Why are you so kind to me?

127
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,280
That's kind?

128
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,390
People should treat each other this way.

129
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,280
It's normal.

130
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,240
Maybe I need to reshape

131
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,920
your understanding of relationships.

132
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,200
Also,

133
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,360
look at how thin you are.

134
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,950
You must've suffered a lot in the past.

135
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,510
No one treats a slave like this.

136
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
What?

137
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,070
Aren't you a commoner?

138
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,430
Why a slave now?

139
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,680
It doesn't matter.

140
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,360
Even if you are a slave,

141
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,200
it's okay.

142
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,240
We'll find a way to redeem you.

143
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,550
Do you know Deyuan?

144
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,360
She was deceived

145
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,990
by Manager Feng from Yunlai Tavern,

146
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,550
signed a Slave Deed,

147
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,920
and became a slave.

148
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,310
But we managed

149
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,120
to redeem her.

150
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,190
No, I was just joking.

151
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,310
Don't joke about that.

152
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,480
Come on.

153
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,390
Here.

154
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,360
Have a try.

155
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,200
Sure.

156
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,150
How is it?

157
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,950
Not bad,

158
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,840
but

159
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,280
nothing special either.

160
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,840
These are stir-fried dishes.

161
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,240
In our dynasty,

162
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,510
it's something groundbreaking.

163
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,870
Before us,

164
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,510
outsiders had never even seen it.

165
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,720
A revolutionary way of cooking.

166
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,710
Mr. Shen,

167
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,240
I've always thought

168
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,430
that the dishes you stir-fry

169
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,160
all taste pretty much the same.

170
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,880
At first, customers find it novel

171
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,830
because they've never

172
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,470
had it before.

173
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,550
But after a while,

174
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,950
to put it simply,

175
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,600
they're just ordinary.

176
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
What?

177
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,750
If there's nothing else,

178
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,720
I'll get back to work.

179
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,750
Not bad.

180
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,690
Not bad.

181
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,680
Just

182
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,880
ordinary?

183
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,220
You want to learn cooking from me?

184
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,480
Of course.

185
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,870
A man's word

186
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,220
is his bond.

187
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,080
I don't care

188
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,480
who you are.

189
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,750
I'll be strict no matter what.

190
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,990
Bring it on.

191
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,160
No problem.

192
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,910
How great.

193
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,850
Milady, just take a look.

194
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,750
I won't go.

195
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,990
Just one look.

196
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,230
Come on.

197
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,720
Take a look.

198
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,670
Mr. Shen has worked so hard

199
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,030
for the Competition.

200
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,480
He's giving it his all.

201
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,830
San.

202
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,870
Here.

203
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,920
Take this.

204
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,510
You're working two jobs now.

205
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,750
You deserve this.

206
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,580
If you want to practice this,

207
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,610
you should up the ante.

208
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,030
Grandpa, you can do it.

209
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,270
Grandpa, you're amazing.

210
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,080
Grandpa, are you okay?

211
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,790
I'm exhausted.

212
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,150
You scared me.

213
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,670
Mr. Shen is trying so hard

214
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,870
to impress you.

215
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,510
The Competition is quite a spectacle.

216
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,440
(Culinary Master Competition)
Yong'an is known its for food.

217
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,770
Today, the famous chefs of Yong'an

218
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,670
are all going to compete.

219
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,720
(Guixiang Tavern, Yunlai Tavern)
Juxian boasts delicacies.

220
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,990
All the chefs in Juxian Alley
will compete.

221
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,930
Councilor Kang
from the Ministry of Rites

222
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,140
is the best food connoisseur in Yong'an.

223
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,440
(Yunlai Tavern)
Whoever gets a good word from him

224
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,670
is the top in Yong'an.

225
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,670
Last year,

226
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,750
the winner was

227
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,600
(Guixiang Tavern)
Yunlai Tavern.

228
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,860
(Hermit Suxin)

229
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,220
(Jinxiu Tavern)

230
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,670
Aren't you going to watch?

231
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,240
Shen Jianshe is going to compete.

232
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,560
Why does that concern me?

233
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm not going.

234
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,320
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

235
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,670
- Don't drag me.
- Let's go.

236
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,320
(May wealth come)
I won't go.

237
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,720
I'm not going.

238
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,270
We're here to make friends through food

239
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,870
and select the culinary master.

240
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,200
How fortunate we are

241
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
to have

242
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,560
Chancellor Meng's presence.

243
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,670
To be invited by Councilor Kang

244
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,360
is my honor.

245
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,870
You're not only here

246
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,480
but also set the topic for the chefs.

247
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,030
That's kind enough,

248
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,480
and you even brought Mr. Lin.

249
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,440
This truly overwhelms me.

250
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,480
How dare I accept such praise?

251
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,510
Alright.

252
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,440
Don't make him nervous.

253
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,360
After 40 years,

254
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,240
you're still so polite.

255
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,270
We deserve

256
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,720
each other's respect.

257
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,320
You understand food the most.

258
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,840
You've spent a fortune

259
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,360
on fine cuisine.

260
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,910
With the younger ones around,

261
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,270
don't say that about me.

262
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,480
The people matter to the ruler;

263
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,750
food matters to the people.

264
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,080
A good dish can solve

265
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,270
a thousand worries.

266
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,360
By promoting the way of fine food,

267
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,090
Councilor Kang is also
serving the people.

268
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,300
Look, look.

269
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,440
Mr. Lin

270
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,910
truly understands me.

271
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,790
The Competition hasn't started.

272
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,030
Why don't we look around,

273
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,150
Anran?

274
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
Of course.

275
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,480
Excuse me, thank you.

276
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,990
Excuse me.

277
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,830
Mom, over here.

278
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,400
Come on.

279
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,590
Jicai,

280
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,080
no need to hold me.

281
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,920
Let's go.

282
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,240
Excuse me.

283
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,120
Thank you.

284
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,990
- Father.
- Grandpa.

285
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,710
Fengxia,

286
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,200
you came.

287
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,200
I knew you would.

288
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,150
I didn't come to see you.

289
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,870
Jicai, let's go over there.

290
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,990
Mother.

291
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,750
- Let's go.
- Grandma.

292
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,320
- I...
- Let's go.

293
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
Grandpa, you can do it.

294
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,030
Grandma, their dishes are so strange.

295
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,040
True.

296
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,670
I haven't seen anything like it.

297
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,600
Lady Jingwen.

298
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,280
Thank you.

299
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,160
Anyway, Anran

300
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,560
is about to be engaged to Lady Jingwen.

301
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,120
No need to talk about this.

302
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,600
When I left the court,

303
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,870
Chancellor Meng confirmed it,

304
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,150
saying Anran is about to become

305
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,670
his grandson-in-law.

306
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,910
Mr. Meng will set

307
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,080
the topic of this year's competition.

308
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,750
All chefs,

309
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,890
prepare dishes accordingly.

310
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,720
Once the dishes are ready,

311
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,990
the connoisseurs selected
by Councilor Kang will taste them.

312
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,870
Each connoisseur can cast a chopstick.

313
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,870
(Shen's Diner)
The one with the most chopsticks

314
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,960
(Guixiang Tavern)
will win.

315
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,100
(Yuelai Diner, Hermit Suxin)

316
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,090
After the topic is given,

317
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
you must prepare the dishes

318
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,510
in an incense stick of time.

319
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,670
This year's topic is:

320
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,600
In youth, we meet with joy.

321
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,800
At 20, we feel shy.

322
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,630
At 50, we see the world.

323
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,560
In old age, we envy the mayfly.

324
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,520
Jicai, what does this topic mean?

325
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,120
What is this about?

326
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,630
It feels like an open topic.

327
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,670
Please choose your ingredients

328
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,220
and create a delicious meal.

329
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,260
(Culinary Master Competition)

330
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,070
How do we make the dish?

331
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,950
Based on a poem?

332
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,950
Yes, that's it.

333
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,910
Your dad isn't smart enough.

334
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,630
I don't think he can come up
with anything.

335
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,870
Mayfly?

336
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,150
Look, Lady Jingwen is taking something.

337
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,600
A piece of tofu.

338
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,160
What can she do with that?

339
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,320
Yes, that's exactly it.

340
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,660
This idea is wonderful.

341
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,120
Everyone else has figured it out.

342
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,630
Why is your dad still standing there?

343
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,190
What is he picking?

344
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,990
He...

345
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,550
Your dad...

346
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,880
I'll go over there.

347
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,160
Grandma.

348
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,470
Excuse me.

349
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,870
Excuse me, coming through.

350
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,200
Shen Jianshe,

351
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,810
why are you taking
whatever everyone else takes?

352
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,360
Why copy others now?

353
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,280
I don't know what to take.

354
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,000
I just took a bit of everything.

355
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,080
Can't you use

356
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,630
your own mind?

357
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,470
- Ma'am.
- Think.

358
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,460
Don't interfere with the chefs' cooking.

359
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,560
Please step back.

360
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,840
Sorry.

361
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,710
Youth is the time of studying,

362
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,150
30 marks adulthood,

363
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,950
and then it's 50

364
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,950
and old age.

365
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,430
What is this topic about?

366
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,760
Shouldn't Mr. Lin know?

367
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,360
Why hadn't he come and told us?

368
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,150
That's cheating.

369
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,230
Right.

370
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,510
Have you decided?

371
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,000
What is a mayfly?

372
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,630
Jicai, help your father think.

373
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,230
You set this topic

374
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,950
to let the chefs infuse
the flavors of life

375
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,910
into their dishes.

376
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,520
Am I wrong?

377
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,230
You're being mysterious,

378
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,080
but he's already

379
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,630
seen you through.

380
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,760
I chose him.

381
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,040
Of course, he's good.

382
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,400
What?

383
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,630
You're planning again?

384
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,390
You're joking.

385
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,630
In the Competition,

386
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,950
everyone has their own plans

387
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,910
to win.

388
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,040
Mr. Lin, you keep staring at me.

389
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,760

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,800
At 20, we feel shy.

415
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,080
At 50, we see the world.

416
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,360
There's something about a mayfly.

417
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,840
Even now, I don't know

418
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,280
what a mayfly is.

419
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,520
Hurry up.

420
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,950
There's not enough time.

421
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,150
I know.

422
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,040
I think...

423
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,360
I think I remember something.

424
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,870
Tell me if I'm right.

425
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,880
Studying,

426
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,950
growing up,

427
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,790
reaching one's 50s,

428
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,080
and getting old.

429
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,470
Isn't this a person's whole life?

430
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,390
You've become smart.

431
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,560
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

432
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,710
So, this is a dish about life, right?

433
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,910
Hurry up.

434
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,320
- Keep going.
- That's right.

435
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,160
I get it.

436
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,630
I get it now.

437
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,710
Grandpa is amazing.

This is easy.

439
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,760
What's wrong?

440
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,600
But how should I

441
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,950
make a dish about life?

442
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,070
You...

443
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,600
Hurry up.

444
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,040
What a mystery.

445
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,600
He's driving me crazy.

446
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,710
- Grandpa.
- Keep going.

447
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,320
- Go for it.
- Keep going.

448
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,170
Keep going.

449
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,280
- Go for it.
- Keep going.

450
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,360
Keep going.

451
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,200
Go for it.

452
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,600
Keep going.

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,840
Go for it.

454
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,320
Always telling me to keep going.

455
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,670
You all went to the Competition,

456
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,900
leaving me here alone to wash.

457
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,760
There's not even a meal.

458
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,470
Keep going.

459
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,950
Sir, are there new dishes?

460
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,600
I can't even finish all these.

461
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,630
No need to wash.

462
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,470
Come here.

463
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,670
Mr. Lu has an important task for you.

464
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,430
That's great.

465
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,060
Mr. Lu is finally putting me
to good use.

466
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,870
Just go ahead and trust me.

467
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,600
I won't let Mr. Lu down.

468
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,230
Alright, stop wasting time.

469
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,630
You

470
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,430
infiltrate the Competition.

471
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,630
When someone's dish looks good,

472
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,800
figure out a way

473
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,600
to knock over all their dishes.

474
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,000
Just knock them over?

475
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,840
That...

476
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,040
That's too low-class.

477
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,880
Low-class?

478
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,040
That's how I made my way up.

479
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,520
What's low-class about it?

480
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,840
Feel free

481
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,630
to use your own method.

482
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,870
Anyway, no one can surpass Yunlai.

483
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,200
No, you...

484
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,270
You...

485
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,910
(You bunch of villains.)

486
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,510
By the way...

487
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,430
Take this.

488
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,640
Are you

489
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,120
crazy?

490
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,070
No.

491
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,080
I've been sitting for too long.

492
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,710
Just stretching my limbs.

493
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,680
- It's okay.
- Stop.

494
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,430
I forgot to tell you

495
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,800
to embarrass

496
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,520
the Shen family.

497
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,880
Otherwise,

498
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,430
it won't satisfy Mr. Lu's grudge.

499
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,510
Also,

500
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,870
if this doesn't go well,

501
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,630
Mr. Lu will make you pay.

502
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,910
Your eyes are wide open.

503
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,160
Go.

504
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,560
How...

505
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,040
Why is Mr. Shen moving so slowly?

506
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,910
Has he decided what to do?

507
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,710
With his pace,

508
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,390
everyone will finish before he does.

509
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,600
Just make something.

510
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,800
Go watch over there.

511
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,870
Wait for my signal later.

512
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,710
Hurry up and go.

513
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,160
Go.

514
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,910
Dad, you can do this.

515
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,760
That smells so good.

516
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,310
Dad.

517
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,270
Dad.

518
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,600
Dad.

519
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,440
Yangyang.

520
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,630
- Yangyang.
- Yangyang.

521
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,630
Keep it down.

522
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,800
You human trafficker.

523
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I'll make you pay.

524
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,520
Let her go.

525
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,360
Let her go, let her go.

526
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,640
Let her go.

527
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,320
I'll make you pay.

528
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,400
No, no, stop.

529
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,920
Gongcai.

530
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,180
What are you doing here?

531
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,160
Gongcai.

532
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,030
This...

533
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,840
What happened?

534
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Why are you like this?

535
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,840
Don't talk.

536
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,040
Don't call me.

537
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,150
- Who?
- I'll leave.

538
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,600
I'll explain later.

539
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,550
What's going on?

540
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,250
Chef Shen.

541
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,120
If you want to practice this,

542
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,060
you should up the ante.

543
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,520
I'll explain later.

544
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,710
I'll tell you later.

545
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,550
Gongcai.

546
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,710
Shen.

547
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,760
- Dad.
- Is it Gongcai?

548
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,600
Grandpa.

549
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,320
Is your hand okay?

550
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,760
Was that Gongcai just now?

551
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,950
(Anyway, Shen Jianshe hurt his hand.)

552
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,120
(That works, too.)

553
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,850
You...

554
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,040
Your wrist is swollen.

555
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,800
Stop this.

556
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,080
Let's go to the clinic now.

557
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,120
Fengxia, Fengxia.

558
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,280
Listen to me.

559
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,120
I'm really fine.

560
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,470
- Don't worry.
- Mr. Lin.

561
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,420
I'm not in pain anymore.

562
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,800
Your hand can't do this.

563
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,950
You have to go to the clinic.

564
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,660
Look at how swollen it is.

565
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,710
Trust me.

566
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,600
- Uncle.
- I'm fine.

567
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,440
How's your hand?

568
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,840
Thanks for your concern.

569
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,630
My father has an old injury.

570
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,280
He just hurt it again.

571
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,920
It's okay, Mr. Lin.

572
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,390
I can hold on.

573
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,630
Shen,

574
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,040
after so long,

575
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,390
you haven't come up with a dish.

576
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,760
You don't even know what to do.

577
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,870
Your wrist is so swollen.

578
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,040
Why still compete?

579
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,430
No need to hold on.

580
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,710
Just go to the clinic already.

581
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,670
Please, go to the clinic.

582
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,800
Even if you start now,

583
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,950
it's too late.

584
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,470
Dad, let's quit.

585
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,230
Yeah, go see the physician.

586
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,950
Right, let's quit.

587
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,080
Let's go to the clinic.

588
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,750
Uncle,

589
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,320
it's better not to force it.

590
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,510
Fengxia,

591
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,000
I think I know what dish to make.

592
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,360
For half my life,

593
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,470
I've been a failure.

594
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,520
I've caused a lot of trouble
for you guys

595
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,800
and made so many mistakes.

596
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,520
I've been preparing for the Competition

597
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,470
for a long time.

598
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,640
Really.

599
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,280
The result doesn't matter to me.

600
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,710
I just want a chance

601
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,800
to prove myself in front of my family

602
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,270
that I can do it.

603
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,400
Okay.

604
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
Then be careful.

605
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,470
You can do this.

606
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,880
Alright.

607
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,360
You can do this.

608
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,840
Grandpa, go for it.

609
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,840
You can do this.

Hermit Suxin

619
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,120
presents four bowls of plain soup,

620
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,330
each with a different flavor.

621
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,470
There seems to be a deeper meaning.

622
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,190
To have Councilor Kang my dishes,

623
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,230
I dare not be careless.

624
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,440
The noodle slices in the first bowl

625
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,670
are as tender as new leaves,

626
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,000
placed in a soup of honeysuckle

627
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,310
and sophora flowers.

628
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,080
Like a newborn baby's

629
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,190
third-day bath,

630
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,560
symbolizing rebirth.

631
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,000
So, it's called Rebirth Soup.

632
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,960
How wonderful.

633
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,520
In the second bowl,

634
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,190
you put cherries

635
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,480
in the soup?

636
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,670
Let me guess.

637
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,750
The cherry season...

638
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,190
Cherry...

639
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,670
Isn't it time to reveal results?

640
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,520
You saw through everything.

641
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,670
This is called Success Soup,

642
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,270
symbolizing passing the exams.

643
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,400
Interesting.

644
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,310
You're trying to incorporate
the most important moments of life

645
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,920
into these dishes.

646
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,190
In the third bowl,

647
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,150
there are lotus seeds,

648
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,720
longan, and white fungus.

649
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,190
It should be called

650
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,750
Family Soup, right?

651
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,790
Exactly.

652
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,270
It's to wish for kids.

653
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,840
Good.

654
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,520
Is this tofu thread?

655
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,400
The soup in the fourth bowl

656
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,150
has a different flavor.

657
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,630
Not very tasteful.

658
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,710
Because this one

659
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,440
is to commemorate separation,

660
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,930
symbolizing the end of life.

661
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,080
The flavors of life

662
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,270
are all in this Four-Flavor Soup.

663
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,040
I see.

664
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,520
How wonderful.

665
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,270
Every dish from Guixiang Tavern

666
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,960
is inspired by a poem.

667
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,880
The wind has turned the grass green,

668
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,270
bringing spring to purple
and red buildings.

669
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,790
Only the lotus,
accompanied by green leaves,

670
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,040
unfurls and closes
as naturally as it can.

671
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,790
Only the chrysanthemums
can withstand the cold.

672
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,270
When it blooms,
the morning is filled with an aroma.

673
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,710
When snowflakes drift into the house,

674
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,120
I sit and watch
the green bamboo turn white.

675
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,990
Good.

676
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,550
Good.

677
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,310
These four dishes

678
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,480
represent the four seasons.

679
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,630
Yes.

(Yunlai Tavern)

681
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,000
This is amazing.

682
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,960
It's a kind of splendor

683
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,120
that I've never seen before.

684
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,590
The fish.

685
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
The carving work.

686
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,710
They're

687
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,350
the most expensive dishes here.

688
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,350
Yes.

689
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,000
I can't even bear
to destroy it with a bite.

690
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,190
Please.

691
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,590
Are these

692
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,230
six home-cooked dishes?

693
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,920
Actually, this is one dish

694
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,080
called Six Bowls.

695
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,750
The chef usually puts

696
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,120
the dishes that are hard to forget

697
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,870
on one plate.

698
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,520
It's your diner

699
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,000
that makes the pork dish

700
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,190
(Shen's Diner)
what it is today.

701
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,120
The others are nothing special.

702
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,880
The taste must be very homey.

703
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,080
The more homey it is,

704
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,630
the more precious it is.

705
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,230
After a family has worked all day,

706
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,480
they come home

707
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,270
and sit around a table,

708
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,000
sharing the Six Bowls.

709
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,000
When eating these dishes,

710
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,080
there is no taste of loneliness.

711
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,560
The Six Bowls don't need to be special,

712
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,040
as long as the family likes them.

713
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,440
Before coming to the Competition,

714
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,790
I also thought about winning first place

715
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,480
to prove myself.

716
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,190
But when I picked up the knife

717
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,000
and started the fire to cook,

718
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,960
all I could think of

719
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,230
was the flavors my family likes.

720
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,400
My son loves meat.

721
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,920
My daughter

722
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,550
and Deyuan

723
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,120
love the dishes I stir-fry.

724
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,310
My beloved wife

725
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,600
likes some small seafood.

726
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,440
My granddaughter Yangyang

727
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,630
loves desserts.

728
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,790
There is also a special family member

729
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,080
who loves rice tofu.

730
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,880
At this moment,

731
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,190
the result doesn't matter.

732
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,350
Not at all.

733
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,600
If I have to choose one dish

734
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,040
to represent life,

735
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,510
I would say

736
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,070
this dish

737
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,230
must be the one
that my family and I often eat,

738
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,520
must eat,

739
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,000
and have eaten.

740
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,520
A family is always together,

741
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,350
enjoying every meal.

742
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,830
That is the most important thing

743
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,310
in life.

744
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,070
