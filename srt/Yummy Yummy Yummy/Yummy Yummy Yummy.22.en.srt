00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,800
Yangyang,

4
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,040
today is your first day of school.

5
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,430
You must study hard.

6
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,380
(Victory)

7
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,270
So beautiful.

8
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,880
Your auntie got up early

9
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,430
this morning to make it for you.

10
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,710
It's called Victory Cake

11
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
for good luck.

12
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,830
Your grandmother

13
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,480
scolded me again

14
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,800
just because I woke up a bit late.

15
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,460
I said you could just have breakfast

16
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,410
on the way.

17
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,550
Still,

18
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,390
she kept scolding me.

19
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,520
She thinks she can change her temper,

20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,750
but I don't think she can.

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,760
Grandpa,

22
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,710
don't you think everyone has changed

23
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,200
since we came to Yong'an?

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,710
What do you mean?

25
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,710
Dad has fans now.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,480
You've become a great chef.

27
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,240
Auntie is more amazing than before.

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,750
I can go to a good school.

29
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,400
Only Grandma

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,400
seems to be the same as before.

31
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,310
I don't even know what she likes.

32
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,920
Do you know?

33
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,780
(Hongwen Academy)

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
We're here.

35
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,480
Yes, we're here.

36
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,240
Go in by yourself.

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,830
- Okay.
- Take your lunch.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,550
Goodbye, Grandpa.

39
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,870
Be careful.

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,270
This child.

41
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,820
(Hongwen Academy)

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,220

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,860
(Shen's Diner)

44
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,990
Come on.

45
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,270
Everyone, have some water.

46
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,270
You've been working hard.

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,800
It's hard to expand the diner.

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,590
Have some water before you continue.

49
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,430
Come on, come on.

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,330
Thanks, Mrs. Shen.

51
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,480
You're welcome.

52
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,240
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,120
Thanks a lot.

54
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,960
Come on, take it.

55
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,360
Take it easy.

56
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,590
Fengxia.

57
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,200
Catch this.

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,920
Fengxia,

59
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,870
Shen Jianshe, what are you doing?

60
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,480
What is this?

61
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,750
This is called a carriage linchpin.

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,920
It's for locking the carriage wheels.

63
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,680
Just think of it as a car key.

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,560
Listen.

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,500
This is not an ordinary car key.

66
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,120
This is the linchpin of the most stylish

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
and luxurious carriage in Yong'an.

68
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,920
Shen Jianshe,

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,280
you're too old

70
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,720
to stand so high.

71
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,780
You can easily fall from there.

72
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,060
Do you think you're Jackie Chan?

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,580
What are you trying to do?

74
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,580
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

75
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,220
Lately, I've been thinking a lot.

76
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,300
I've realized

77
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,620
that our family

78
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,020
has changed.

79
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,420
We're different from before.

80
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,500
We've successfully entered

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,260
the upper class of Yong'an.

82
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,460
Mr. Liu, owner of Guixiang Tavern,

83
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,860
invested in our diner

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,020
out of respect for me

85
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,340
and helped me buy the place

86
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,420
next door.

87
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,420
With this expansion,

88
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,700
we'll be able to live here.

89
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
In short,

90
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,160
everything is heading

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,780
in a good direction.

92
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,020
The only exception is you.

93
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,260
You haven't shared in my joy of success,

94
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,700
so you're in a bad mood,

95
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,860
you're upset,

96
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,140
and I understand that.

97
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,440
What are you trying to say?

98
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,380
Back

99
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,620
in modern times,

100
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,340
we were poor and had no money.

101
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,900
You couldn't buy anything you wanted.

102
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,300
You were miserable all day,

103
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,820
working in the diner tiredly.

104
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,780
But now, it's different.

105
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,540
I just came back from the carriage shop.

106
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,820
I've ordered a four-horse,

107
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,140
spacious, and luxurious carriage

108
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,140
as your personal vehicle.

109
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,000
Also,

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm officially announcing

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,040
that you don't have to work
in the diner anymore.

112
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,270
I'll hire two helpers for you.

113
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,180
I'll let them...

114
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,030
No.

115
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,100
Not two helpers.

116
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,020
Four helpers.

117
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,220
You won't have to do anything.

118
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,540
You just have to give orders.

119
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,860
From now on, your job

120
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,820
is to sit in the carriage

121
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,900
I bought for you

122
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,540
and wander around Yong'an.

123
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,860
Whenever you see something nice,

124
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,500
just buy it.

125
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,980
Silk, satin, brocade, jewels...

126
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,700
You can buy whatever you want.

127
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,060
When you look at these things,

128
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,460
your mood will improve.

129
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,780
When your mood improves,

130
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,500
your temper won't be so bad.

131
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,020
And if your temper isn't so bad,

132
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,980
maybe you won't scold me anymore.

133
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,820
Shen Jianshe,

134
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,020
do you think my temper was bad

135
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,980
because you didn't make

136
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,340
enough money?

137
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
What else?

138
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,140
- Mr. Shen, are you okay?
- Mr. Shen.

139
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,300
It hurts.

140
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,540
Why don't you help me up?

141
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,820
I've bought you such a big carriage,

142
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,780
and you can't even help me up?

143
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,660
Make yourself clear.

144
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,140
Why do I have such a bad temper?

145
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,540
How can I know

146
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,580
why?

147
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,820
I've asked myself

148
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,100
over and over at night.

149
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,740
You've always been like this.

150
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,220
One wrong sentence,

151
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,020
and your anger just flares up.

152
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,140
When we were dating and got married,

153
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,980
your temper was like this.

154
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,420
It's still the same

155
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,580
even today.

156
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,460
Apart from hitting,

157
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,900
pinching, scolding, and kicking me,

158
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,220
what else can you do?

159
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,260
Fengxia,

160
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,420
I'm a man;

161
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,940
I have my dignity, too.

162
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,500
I'm under huge pressure.

163
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,020
Can't you show me some compassion?

164
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,980
Besides,

165
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,180
I've succeeded.

166
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,420
I have fans now.

167
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,540
Why can't you give in to me a little?

168
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,500
Why can't you treat me better?

169
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,320
This is the most luxurious carriage

170
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,200
in all of Yong'an.

171
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,420
Fengxia.

172
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,700
(Hongwen Academy)

173
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,300
The sky is like a dome,

174
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,140
covering all directions.

175
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,220
The earth is like a chessboard,

176
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,060
round and boundless.

177
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,500
Though the sky and earth
have different shapes,

178
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,620
their patterns

179
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,540
are interconnected.

180
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,900
The sky has the order
of the sun, moon, and stars;

181
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,540
the earth has the order of plants,
mountains, and rivers.

182
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,820
Only when all things in the universe

183
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,820
follow this order

184
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,060
can they...

185
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,480
... can they coexist peacefully.

186
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,740
You,

187
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,860
call her.

188
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,180
Shen, Shen.

189
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,340
Shen?

190
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,900
What did the mentor just say?

191
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,620
He said the sky is round
and the earth is square.

192
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,100
The sky is like a dome.

193
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,100
The sky is round; the earth is square?

194
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,380
That can't be right.

195
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,100
How can the sky be round

196
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,740
and the earth be square?

197
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,300
We live on a planet, don't we?

198
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,740
The sky is the atmosphere;

199
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,540
the earth is what we stand on.

200
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,580
Both the sky and the earth
are spherical.

201
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,100
How can they be square?

202
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,180
What planet?

203
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,220
Atmosphere?

204
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,300
Nonsense.

205
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,540
Shen,

206
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,020
the sky is always round;

207
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,420
the earth is always square.

208
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,620
Whether the sky

209
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,700
is round or square,

210
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,940
you just haven't read enough books.

211
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,340
Shen,

212
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,860
do you have any evidence

213
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,660
for such shocking statements?

214
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,460
Classmates,

215
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,660
Mentor Zhao,

216
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,180
have you ever raised a cat?

217
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,540
Cats love to push things to the ground.

218
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,500
If the earth were square,

219
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,980
then all the cats in the world

220
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,300
would have pushed everything

221
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,940
outside the earth by now.

222
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,400
But the sky and the earth

223
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,700
are actually round.

224
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,740
We live inside a sphere,

225
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,380
so the cats

226
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,860
haven't messed things up.

227
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,460
It's the planet.

228
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,340
Alright, alright.

229
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,260
Be quiet.

230
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,380
Shen,

231
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,740
please sit.

232
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,140
What did he mean?

233
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,260
If her father

234
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,100
hadn't pestered me,

235
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,820
I would never have accepted Yangyang.

236
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,180
Bringing in a girl

237
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,460
would only cause more trouble.

238
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,500
But Mr. Shen

239
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,420
loves his daughter

240
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,180
so dearly,

241
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,380
and I truly admire that.

242
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,220
That's why I agreed.

243
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,820
But after all, she's just a child,

244
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,740
and she needs guidance from adults.

245
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,300
Since her father is not here

246
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,540
today,

247
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,740
I have to ask you

248
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,700
to come here.

249
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,660
Yes, you're absolutely right.

250
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,380
So, what did Yangyang do?

251
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,660
Speaking one's mind is a good thing,

252
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,980
but in this world,

253
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,900
many people get into trouble for that.

254
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,420
Adults around her

255
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,060
must take responsibility

256
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,460
to prevent such trouble.

257
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,580
I thought you asked me to come

258
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,060
because she'd caused some trouble.

259
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,860
I also thought

260
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,140
you wanted my aunt to scold me.

261
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,500
Yangyang is a promising girl,

262
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,020
nurtured by nature,

263
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,180
full of wonderful ideas.

264
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,660
If properly guided,

265
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,920
she will surely achieve

266
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,220
great things in the future.

267
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,060
Really?

268
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
You must be ambitious

269
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,580
and persistent in what you do.

270
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,700
You're not the man I think you are.

271
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,460
How so?

272
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,460
You're a natural educator,

273
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,300
but to be a mentor at Hongwen Academy,

274
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,220
where the Crown Prince studies,

275
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,900
you must be capable
of more than teaching.

276
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,860
Understanding human relationships

277
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,300
is more important.

278
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,500
In this world,

279
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,540
things rarely go as one wishes.

280
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,420
I often pray that my students

281
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,020
can be

282
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,020
the few lucky ones.

283
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,140
Mentor Zhao,

284
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,140
my family runs a diner,

285
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,720
and we wish to express our gratitude
through a meal.

286
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,420
Please do us the honor.

287
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,300
No need to trouble you.

288
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
As a mentor,

289
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,180
guiding students is my duty.

290
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,340
No trouble at all.

291
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,580
Our diner is currently

292
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,940
under renovation and expansion

293
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,140
and is not open to customers.

294
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,860
We truly want to invite you over.

295
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,380
You can meet Yangyang's family,

296
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,620
so you can guide us

297
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,380
on how to raise her in the future.

298
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,980
In that case,

299
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,940
I'll go.

300
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,700
Thanks, Lady Shen.

301
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,540
Thanks for honoring us
with your presence.

302
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,500
Thanks, Mentor.

303
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
(Yunshui Manor)

304
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,420
What kind of man is Zhao Xunzhi?

305
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,500
He betrayed his friends
for personal gain.

306
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,660
You invited a wolf into the house

307
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,620
just for my sake?

308
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,420
I'm sorry,

309
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,500
but inviting Zhao Xunzhi over

310
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,240
for a meal is too risky.

311
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,020
It's already done.

312
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,220
The risk has been taken.

313
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,140
Mr. Lin, don't waste

314
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,300
this opportunity.

315
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,940
How can I ever repay you?

316
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,220
Mr. Lin,

317
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,980
how can you say that?

318
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,820
You've helped us so many times before.

319
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,180
Do we need to repay you for that?

320
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,060
Those don't count.

321
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,860
Why not?

322
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,740
You've helped us so many times.

323
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,060
Can we ever truly repay you?

324
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,600
This time is different.

325
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,300
You're being righteous,

326
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,160
but I...

327
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,380
You want to uncover the truth,

328
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,460
and we want to help you.

329
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,260
Now, we have the perfect chance
to test him.

330
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,100
Isn't that good?

331
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,540
If he has any issues,

332
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,520
it's better to find out

333
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,320
before it affects Yangyang.

334
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,540
But I really like Mentor Zhao.

335
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,580
Whatever I say, he never scolds me,

336
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,940
and he always explains things to me.

337
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,220
I'm starting to like going
to Hongwen Academy.

338
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,340
Can such a good teacher

339
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,020
really be a bad person?

340
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,040
(Miss You in Yong'an)

341
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,800
(Shen's Diner)
Let's all raise our glasses

342
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,220
- to Mentor Zhao.
- To Mentor Zhao.

343
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,280
- To Mentor Zhao.
- Okay?

344
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,240
Come on.

345
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,580
All the words are

346
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,820
in this cup of wine.

347
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,780
I'll toast you again.

348
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,580
Mentor Zhao,

349
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,780
let me serve you some of this.

350
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,310
- Thanks.
- Here.

351
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,820
I'll toast you again.

352
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,660
Alright.

353
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,140
Cheers.

354
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,140
Cheers.

355
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,060
Mentor Zhao, here.

356
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,980
I'll toast you, too.

357
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,220
Thanks for taking care

358
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,180
of Yangyang.

359
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,820
We're truly grateful.

360
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,690
It's nothing, really.

361
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,540
- To you.
- Good.

362
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,340
Good.

363
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,580
- Good drinker.
- Good.

364
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,940
Good wine.

365
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,540
Mentor Zhao, since my parents

366
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,460
have drunk to you,

367
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,780
I have to follow suit.

368
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,620
Here.

369
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,740
Sure.

370
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,300
No need to stand up.

371
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,140
Sit, sit.

372
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,820
Sit.

373
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,260
Good.

374
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,460
Good.

375
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,660
What a great tolerance for alcohol.

376
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,620
With you being Yangyang's mentor,

377
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,660
we're at ease.

378
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,340
- Right.
- I'll toast you again.

379
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,860
Come on.

380
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,280
I've just done
what any mentor should do.

381
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,130
- Please.
- Cheers.

382
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,000
- Come on.
- Cheers.

383
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,500
Yangyang is so mischievous.

384
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,260
You must've spent a lot of effort.

385
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
You're so knowledgeable,

386
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,180
patient, and caring.

387
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,300
We really don't know

388
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,700
- how to thank you.
- Yes.

389
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,980
I'll toast you again.

390
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,820
Sure.

391
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,180
Thanks, thanks.

392
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,020
Who is it?

393
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,940
Mr. Cui?

394
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Mr. Lin,

395
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,060
your clothes resemble

396
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,500
Mr. Cui's.

397
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,820
Mr. Cui?

398
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,020
Who is he?

399
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,140
Is he an old friend

400
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
of yours?

401
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,860
Please sit.

402
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,820
There is a story

403
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,900
I'd like

404
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,540
to ask you about.

405
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,780
Alright.

406
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,060
I'm all ears.

407
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,180
Go ahead.

408
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,900
Li Ji.

409
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
Li Ji betrayed his friend

410
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,380
and has been condemned through the ages.

411
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,720
It's a well-known fact.

412
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,500
I wonder

413
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,460
what you are trying to ask.

414
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,700
Have you ever done the same thing?

415
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,980
Who are you?

416
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,660
I'm the Vice Prefect,

417
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,540
speaking out for an old injustice.

418
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,340
In the post-selling case

419
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,140
17 years ago,

420
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,100
someone changed their testimony,

421
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,540
leading to the conviction.

422
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,540
I want to know

423
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,020
if his betrayal

424
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,820
of his friend

425
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,700
was out of his own wish

426
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,140
or someone's coercion.

427
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,820
(Spirit Tablet of Eldest Son Li Sheng)

428
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,660
Sheng,

429
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,860
Anran is just like you.

430
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,340
He's as smart and perceptive

431
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,100
as you were,

432
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,200
which is why he was able

433
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,920
to uncover all this so fast.

434
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,500
It was too fast

435
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,220
for me to bear.

436
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,940
So,

437
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,980
one day,

438
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,580
I might have to send him

439
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,100
to join you.

440
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,780
I'm sorry for him.

441
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,020
Father, you should pay more attention

442
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,140
to the living.

443
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,260
Lin Yan

444
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,500
has found Zhao Xunzhi.

445
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,100
Zhao Xunzhi

446
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,780
values his reputation above all else.

447
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,380
Once one misses a chance,

448
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,340
there will be no turning back.

449
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,020
What's done is done.

450
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,220
He's serving me.

451
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,580
He won't talk.

452
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,740
What if he changes

453
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,860
his mind and decides

454
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,780
to serve someone else?

455
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,060
What if he's willing

456
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,660
to sacrifice himself

457
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,180
for his friend's only son?

458
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,220
What will you do?

459
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,300
Zhao Xunzhi

460
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,140
entered Shen's Diner

461
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,660
and hasn't returned home yet.

462
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,620
Let the spies

463
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,540
in Juxian Alley move.

466
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,940
Zhao Xunzhi has agreed to testify.

467
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,260
You can rest easy.

468
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,140
I just feel

469
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,420
that it won't go so smoothly.

470
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,980
Mr. Lin, bad news.

471
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,820
Yangyang?

472
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,540
What's wrong?

473
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,140
Mentor Zhao didn't come
to class for no reason.

474
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,340
He's disappeared.

475
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,140
He's disappeared?

(Jingsi Study)

477
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,340
Young Master.

478
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,180
Young Master,

479
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,300
news from Vice Minister Cao:

480
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,340
Zhao Xunzhi

481
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,220
has submitted a document
in Nanming County,

482
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,060
saying that he

483
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,020
is returning home for mourning.

484
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,180
He just disappeared from Yong'an.

485
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,540
It'd take at least three days
to get to Nanming.

486
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,940
How could he have arrived now?

487
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,480
Zhao Xunzhi is already old;

488
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,260
his parents and elders
are no longer alive.

489
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,400
Who is he going to mourn?

490
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,260
Prince Zhao?

491
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,140
Young Master,

492
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,820
you can't say that

493
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,660
for now.

494
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,700
Go to Nanming County

495
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,700
and find Zhao Xunzhi.

496
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,540
We must see him alive

497
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,030
or find his body.

498
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,620
Yes.

499
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,580
Come on, get up.

500
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,550
Come on.

(Jingsi Study)

502
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,780
Auntie,

503
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,980
Grandma said
that since this is so serious,

504
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,610
we should just be ordinary friends

505
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,040
with Mr. Lin.

506
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,020
We're just bringing him food.

507
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,380
Why are you afraid to go in?

508
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,340
Auntie,

509
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,260
my legs are all numb now.

I can't stand properly.

511
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,660
Your legs are numb?

512
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,060
Then let's leave
the food box here and go.

513
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,060
(Shen's Diner)

514
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,460
Thanks.

Sweet and sour pork ribs,

osmanthus sugar lotus root,

and rice tofu.

520
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,620
All these are foods
that can lift one's spirits.

521
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,660
Mr. Lin, my aunt
especially made these for you.

522
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,180
Thanks.

523
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,920
But I really don't have

524
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,100
an appetite.

525
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,020
I'm sorry.

526
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,910
You've run into some trouble,

527
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,340
and you can't even eat?

528
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,180
I know you've been waiting for 17 years

529
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,260
to find Zhao Xunzhi,

530
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,700
the most crucial witness.

531
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,740
The hope was right there,

532
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,580
but he disappeared.

533
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,220
We all understand how you feel,

534
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,600
but you can't just stay indoors

535
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,520
and refuse to eat.

536
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,980
You've only been in this world

537
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,460
for a little over 20 years.

538
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,580
While you're investigating the truth,

539
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,540
you also have to do your job
as the Vice Prefect.

540
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Can you stop being so hard on yourself?

541
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,700
I'm not

542
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,060
that depressed,

543
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,940
and I'm trying to find a way.

544
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,780
Today, I was waiting for your food,

545
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,900
thinking you wouldn't come.

546
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,180
So,

547
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,120
I just ate a little bit.

548
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,780
I really can't eat any more.

549
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,540
Grandma asked Auntie to bring the food,

550
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,420
but Auntie was hesitating at the door,

551
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,860
unwilling to knock,

552
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,340
which delayed things by an hour.

553
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,220
Yangyang.

554
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
I'll leave first.

555
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,420
Thanks.

556
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,940
Still, you don't look very well.

557
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,460
(Confidential)

558
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,540
It arrived last night.

559
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,420
Prince Zhao knows

560
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,460
that Yangyang has entered
Hongwen Academy.

561
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,300
He says Zhao Xunzhi is upright

562
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,340
and can be a good mentor.

563
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,420
He's pretending not to know

564
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,100
Zhao Xunzhi has disappeared,

565
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,300
yet he writes a letter to test me.

566
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,860
How hypocritical.

567
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,140
What on earth does he want?

568
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,020
Young Master!

569
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,220
Young Master!

570
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,860
How is it going?

571
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,020
Zhao Xunzhi has never

572
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,340
shown his face
after returning to Nanming.

573
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,300
He's never been married or had kids,

574
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,100
and he doesn't have any close family.

575
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,500
Those clan members,

576
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,220
for some unknown reason,

577
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,540
insist that he is staying at home,

578
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,180
just unwilling to appear.

579
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,740
I suspect

580
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,420
that he might have met

581
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,380
with some misfortune.

582
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,340
Sure, let's just smash it

583
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,500
to vent our frustration,

584
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,380
as if we're beating that bad old man.

585
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,410
(Uphold Integrity)
Young Master,

586
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,100
why have you started, too?

587
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,820
Uncle Liu Chang, smash it.

588
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,660
Me?

589
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,620
Crazy.

590
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,580
You're crazy.

591
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,660
All crazy.

592
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,420
How satisfying.

593
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,940
Isn't it really relieving?

594
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,200
Do you feel better now?

595
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,140
Much better.

596
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,980
Don't worry.

597
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,460
I'm not worried.

598
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,980
Once your moment of anger passes,

599
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,180
there will always be a way.

600
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,540
Mr. Lin,

601
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,260
you need to eat properly

602
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,420
and get enough sleep.

603
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,180
As long as you are healthy,

604
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,500
everything will get better.

605
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,620
The Chinese New Year's Eve is coming.

606
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,820
Mr. Lin,

607
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,660
Uncle Liu,

608
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,500
why not join us for the celebration

609
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,500
at our diner?

610
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,940
Sure.

611
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,300
That'd be great.

612
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
In previous years,

613
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,420
it was just me and the young master,

614
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,020
which was really boring.

615
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,580
Yangyang,

616
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,060
who'd want to spend the eve

617
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,220
in the yamen,

618
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,180
eating steamed buns and pastries?

619
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,140
It's unbearable.

620
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,300
I just...

621
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,980
Mr. Lin,

622
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,100
you have to go, too.

623
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,460
Auntie,

624
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,500
haven't we prepared new clothes for him?

625
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,900
Alright.

626
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,620

Cabbages...

633
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,340
Auntie,

634
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,140
how could you say that about Mr. Lin?

635
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,100
I was too worried.

636
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,560
How could I have thought

637
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,580
that you were like that?

638
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,940
You can never be like that.

639
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,820
Forget it.

640
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,380
I know what you mean.

641
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,700
Glad that you're not mad at me.

642
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,940
I never could.

643
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,780
Six

645
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,460
Mr. Lin, you have to go, too.

646
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,420
Auntie and I

647
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,420
have made new clothes for you.

648
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,100

653
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,380
I'll pickle his name.

654
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,660
Thinking of it will make me sick.

this is called a couplet.

668
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,220
May you also enjoy

health and prosperity,

670

with a thriving business in your diner.

671
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,220

Auntie, thank you.

What is this?

What is this?

679
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,720
- I'll tell you.
- A copper coin?

680
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,560
Yes.

681
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,660
We'll put this copper coin

682
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,020
into one of the dumplings.

will have a smooth year ahead,

its own special meaning.

689

694
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,940
Why hasn't she come back?

695
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,780
Yes.

696
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,900
Jicai said she'd be back in five days.

697
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,420
Why hasn't she returned?

698
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,540
I was thinking

699
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,060
that if she doesn't come back tomorrow,

700
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,860
I'll ask her father to go look for her.

701
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,780
Yes.

702
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,780
Where did she go?

703
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,140
I'll go look for her now.

704
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,660
There's no need.

705
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,820
Jicai must have a plan.

706
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,220
She might come back tomorrow.

707
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,900
Mother, add another filling.

708
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Look, she's back.

709
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,300
- Lady Shen is back.
- You're back.

710
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,460
You're back.

711
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,140
What filling?

712
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,140
So mysterious.

713
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,980
Let me see.

714
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,460
Isn't this water shield from Qingyang?

715
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,980
You went to Qingyang?

716
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,780
I happened to pass by Qingyang.

717
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,220
People in Qingyang eat dumplings

718
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,140
with water shield filling
during the festival.

719
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,740
We haven't had them for years.

720
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,620
There are still many outside.

721
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,740
Deyuan, help me out.

722
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,100
Lady Shen,

723
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,740
did anyone else know

724
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,100
you went to Qingyang?

725
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,780
Were you stopped and questioned?

726
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,020
Did anyone suspicious follow you?

727
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,380
Don't worry.

728
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,340
I was extremely careful.

729
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,500
I went through mountains,

730
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,860
and I didn't enter Qingyang at all.

731
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,600
I picked them from a wild pond

732
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,340
at the border
between Qingyang and Shi'an.

733
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,440
I didn't give myself away.

734
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,500
That's good.

735
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,740
Thank you so much

736
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,620
for going through so much trouble.

737
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,540
Thanks, Lady Shen.

738
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,740
Well.

739
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
No need to thank her.

740
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
It was on the way.

741
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,980
It's nothing.

742
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,860
Yes, yes.

743
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,340
It's no trouble at all.

744
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,780
But from what Lady Shen said,

745
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,060
it doesn't sound easy.

746
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,100
I'll go get something else first.
