00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,940
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,940
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

4
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Lady Shen,

5
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,880
the biluo you made

6
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,710
is quite interesting.

7
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,730
Biluo originated
from the Western Regions

8
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,010
and became very popular
after it was introduced here.

9
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,160
My family and I

10
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,570
have developed several new flavors.

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,350
Using milk, eggs, and butter,

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,520
we whip it into cream.

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,120
So, the ordinary cherry biluo

14
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,630
has become a cream cherry biluo.

15
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,120
This one that tastes like crab meat

16
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,760
is actually made from fish paste.

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,830
It's molded into shape

18
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,150
to make a crab stick.

19
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,150
From the Western Regions

20
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,550
to the Central Plains.

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,990
We should let them see

22
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,920
that after coming here,

23
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,480
the flavor has become more unique.

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,310
Actually, the idea of improving biluo

25
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,430
was suggested by my father.

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,520
He said that a thousand years later,

27
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,640
people's hearts will change,

28
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,960
and perhaps their tastes will change.

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,200
People might

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,830
forget this delicacy, biluo.

31
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,800
But if we keep innovating,

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,030
maybe this dish

33
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,360
can be passed down.

34
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,800
Innovate?

35
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,030
Create something new?

36
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,830
What an interesting word.

37
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,100
It seems that the reason your father

38
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,600
can make Shen's Diner so successful

39
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,270
is not only because he creates
new dishes

40
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,960
but also because his ideas are unique.

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,750
How can we eat biluo without tea?

42
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,400
Today, I wanted to drink your tea,

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,240
so I had them

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,800
buy it for me.

45
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,200
Your Highness, let me.

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,040
No need.

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,200
Today, I'll do it myself.

48
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,590
Alright.

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,200
(Pei Fei)
Today,

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,150
I ordered

51
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,240
your Slap-the-Heartbreaker Drink.

52
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,710
You always ignore me

53
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,890
and refuse my invitations.

54
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,800
You always ignore me

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,900
and refuse my invitations.

56
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,940
(Pei Fei)

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,340
(Pei Fei)

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,120
Mr. Lin was impeached

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,070
for overstepping his authority.

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,190
He's been suspended by my brother.

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
What?

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,100
(Upright in Speech and Conduct)

63
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,520
Young Master.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,660
Young Master,

65
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,720
Mr. Meng is here.

66
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,030
Mr. Meng.

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,680
I've come to see

68
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,240
how you are.

69
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,430
Still calm.

70
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,750
Don't worry.

71
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,390
I came from the backyard.

72
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,800
No one saw me.

73
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,600
Anran, do you know,

74
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,120
throughout history,

75
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,720
what happened to those

76
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,750
who were demoted
and fell into the abyss?

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,950
Out of ten,

78
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,460
hardly one or two

79
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,500
were able to make a comeback.

80
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,680
Anran, you're alone

81
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,700
with no ties,

82
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,310
so you dare to speak for the people

83
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,600
and not fear the powerful.

84
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,630
But that's also why

85
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,390
they dared to target you.

86
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,310
You want to advise me

87
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,760
to choose a good tree to perch on.

88
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,310
It's just about forming a good alliance.

89
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,630
If you became my grandson-in-law,

90
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,800
you would never be demoted again.

91
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,580
(Capital Prefecture)

92
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,150
Go back.

93
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,560
All of you, go.

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,040
It's not time to leave work.

95
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,640
Yet, you all came to see me off.

96
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,720
Do you think there's too little work?

97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
In recent years,

98
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,840
the head of the Prefecture

99
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,900
has changed too frequently.

100
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,050
It's not good for your promotions.

101
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
If I can't get through this time...

102
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
Mr. Lin,

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
at a time like this,

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,550
stop thinking about us.

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,040
If I can't get through this,

106
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,510
I'll try to help you

107
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,290
get transferred somewhere else.

108
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,880
Cheng Hu,

109
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,220
you'll go to the county

110
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,750
and serve as the Sheriff for a while.

111
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,880
The salary will be higher,

112
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,170
and it will add to your resume.

113
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,430
Second Master Xu,

114
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,270
I'll recommend you
to the Ministry of Justice.

115
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,600
So you can hold your head high at home.

116
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,960
Zhao Jiu...

117
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,080
Mr. Lin.

118
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,390
Stop.

119
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,830
- We'll follow you.
- We'll stay.

120
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,340
- Mr. Lin.
- We want to follow you.

121
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,490
We just want to follow you.

122
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,840
But I can't see you

123
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,720
waste your time here.

124
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,360
We aren't wasting our time.

125
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,030
Mr. Lin.

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,990
With a Vice Prefect like you,

127
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,800
we've never been afraid.

128
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,120
No matter what happens,

129
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
we will stick with you

130
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,780
through thick and thin.

131
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,240
- Right.
- Right.

132
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,500
(Capital Prefecture)

133
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,980
(Yunshui Manor)

134
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,830
Young Master.

135
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,390
Lady Shen is here.

136
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,220
(Yunshui Manor)

137
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,660
Father and I made

138
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,480
(Yunshui Manor)
several new flavors of biluo,

139
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,930
preparing to sell them in the diner.

140
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,750
Please have a try.

141
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,000
You already know?

142
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,990
Your sudden suspension

143
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
must be related to the case, right?

144
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,360
Did Prince Zhao do this?

145
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,590
Does your family

146
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,960
also know about it?

147
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,270
I received the news from the Princess.

148
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,080
I haven't told my family

149
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
so as not to worry them.

150
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,220
Mr. Lin, don't be discouraged.

151
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,560
Think of it from another angle.

152
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,750
It might be a good thing.

153
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,960
The fact that they took action

154
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,090
as soon as you made progress

155
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,720
only proves that you're right.

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,030
I'm fine, actually.

157
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,870
But you and I are cousins.

158
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,420
Everyone in Yong'an has known about it.

159
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,960
My suspension

160
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,670
will inevitably affect you.

161
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,240
You've also helped a lot

162
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,390
with the case.

163
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,990
From now on,

164
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,120
focus on protecting yourselves.

165
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,910
When family is in trouble,

166
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,200
that's the last thing we'd do.

167
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,320
Mr. Lin, I came today

168
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,760
because I have something to tell you.

169
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,870
The trap that Lu Yun set for you
at Yunlai Tavern

170
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,670
happened because someone
leaked the info.

171
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Our newly hired chef, Yu San,

172
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,360
works for Prince Zhao.

173
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,350
Yu San?

174
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,080
Where is he?

175
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,720
Are your family members okay?

176
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,750
Yu San is not a villain.

177
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,600
He was coerced by Prince Zhao.

178
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,150
Prince Zhao held his parents hostage
in Fenglin Town,

179
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,360
so he had to agree
to work for Prince Zhao.

180
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,150
If we can rescue his parents,

181
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,750
he's willing to help us.

182
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,910
Fenglin Town?

183
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,510
Can we

184
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,840
really trust Yu San?

185
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
After years of doing business,

186
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,960
I've developed a good eye for people.

187
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,150
I think we can.

188
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
But it concerns...

189
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,160
I trust you.

190
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,150
Leave the rest to me.

191
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,910
I'll head to Fenglin Town asap.

192
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,380
(Yunshui Manor)

193
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,240
It's raining hard.

194
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,120
Please get into the carriage quickly.

195
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,130
Your sudden suspension

196
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,960
must be related to the case, right?

197
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,740
Did Prince Zhao do this?

198
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,320
Sorry, I have to go back.

199
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,700
I forgot to tell Mr. Lin something.

200
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,080
Lady Shen, take the umbrella.

201
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,920
Thank you.

202
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,300
Don't come any closer.

203
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,700
Father...

204
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,140
Didn't Father die?

205
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,300
Did I...

206
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,340
Did I reincarnate

207
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,460
to see Father once more?

208
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,540
I can see Father again.

209
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,900
Father...

210
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,820
I can see Father again.

211
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,780
Father...

212
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,740
From now on,

213
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,820
you shall be my adopted son.

214
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,740
You'll have one character as your name,

215
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,300
like my sons:

216
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,340
Yan.

217
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,180
Yes.

218
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,060
Good.

219
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,540
Your swordsmanship is getting better.

220
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,380
You asked the masters

221
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,860
to teach me swordsmanship.

222
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,260
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

223
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,620
You will never disappoint me.

224
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,740
Are you tired?

225
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,740
Have a cup of tea.

226
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,980
Here.

227
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

228
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,980
Anran,

229
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,380
I've heard that you want

230
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,340
to be transferred to Yong'an.

231
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,940
I think

232
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,100
that if I can make a name

233
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,140
for myself in the Capital,

234
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,160
it won't be a waste of your cultivation.

235
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,740
Very well.

236
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,020
Anran,

237
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,980
I gave you

238
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,180
your courtesy name.

239
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,220
Do you know

240
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,480
what it means?

241
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,260
You hope that I can live

242
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,440
a peaceful and smooth life.

243
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,700
Now in the Capital,

244
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,020
the situation is full of uncertainties.

245
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,340
How can you

246
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,620
make me feel at ease?

247
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,660
I've already lost

248
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,980
my most beloved eldest son.

249
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,580
I don't want to lose you, either.

250
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,020
Prince Zhao raised you.

251
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,010
He's like a father to you.

252
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,100
You found the evidence

253
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,380
and confirmed that he's the culprit.

254
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,740
Then he managed to get you suspended.

255
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,020
You've been too calm about all that.

256
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,100
If you keep these things inside,

257
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,880
it can make you sick.

258
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,540
So, treat me as a tree hole

259
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,500
and let it out.

260
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,780
He was so concerned

261
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,820
about my studies.

262
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,700
Liu Chang and I escaped death,

263
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,900
wandering outside.

264
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,620
My health weakened.

265
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,220
He was afraid I would die,

266
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,340
so he hired famous masters

267
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,680
to teach me martial arts
to strengthen my body.

268
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,180
He seemed

269
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,820
so upright and sincere,

270
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,740
and he taught me
to be loyal to the state

271
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,740
and uphold righteousness.

272
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,980
I know

273
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,900
the reason he treated me this way

274
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,740
is because I resemble

275
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,540
his deceased eldest son, Li Sheng.

276
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,620
Sheng

277
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,340
and Yan

278
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,940
both mean brightness.

279
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,140
Even the courtesy name Anran

280
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,300
was prepared for Li Sheng.

281
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,740
But I still appreciate him.

282
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,370
He saved me from the flames

283
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,260
and taught me when I was confused.

284
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,080
But I never expected...

285
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,980
I just couldn't imagine

286
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,180
that he had my family's blood
on his hands

287
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,380
and still pretended to be my family.

288
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,740
17 years.

289
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,980
It's been 17 years.

290
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,260
He preached righteousness,

291
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,040
yet exterminated my entire clan.

292
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,210
Who knows how many

293
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,780
nameless and innocent victims he killed?

294
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,340
But I feel it's a good thing

295
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,020
that you resemble
the son he cared about.

296
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,340
It's a good thing
that when you were defenseless,

297
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,140
you gave him your true heart

298
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,540
and survived.

299
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,700
If you had discovered
the truth early on,

300
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,940
even if you could pretend,

301
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,080
your heart would've suffered
too much torment.

302
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,900
Once a person endures too much pain,

303
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,860
they lose the ability to feel joy.

304
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,500
My family,

305
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,860
your family, and I

306
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,520
don't want you to be consumed
by revenge.

307
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,120
Now that you know the truth,

308
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,900
you've had the ability
to protect yourself

309
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,260
and deal with the villains.

310
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,860
This is truly something
to be grateful for.

311
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,660
You do care about me.

312
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,220
Jicai,

313
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,500
I will resolve all of this.

314
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,060
I won't keep your family
worried forever,

315
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,020
nor will I let you suffer
in the slightest.

316
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,580
When all of this is settled,

317
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,080
I'll formally ask for your hand
in marriage,

318
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,100
okay?

319
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,900
It shouldn't be me.

320
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,060
Mr. Pei has said it.

321
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,780
You and Mr. Meng...

322
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,920
Don't believe those rumors.

323
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,460
Believe me.

324
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,900
If you became my grandson-in-law,

325
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,100
you would never be demoted again.

326
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,500
Thank you for your favor,

327
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,740
but your move

328
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,700
only belittles me

329
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,980
and your granddaughter.

330
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,500
The Censorate impeached me,

331
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,220
but I have my way to deal with it.

332
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,100
Otherwise,
how could I control the Prefecture?

333
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,780
As for Lady Shen Jingwen,

334
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,740
she has her own world.

335
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,460
You should ask her

336
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,860
what she

337
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,340
truly wants.

338
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,060
Apart from a fraudster,

339
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,140
I do not

340
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,980
and will not be engaged

341
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,420
to anyone else.

342
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,540
Why?

343
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,980
After all this time,

344
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,980
I can't figure out what you're thinking.

345
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,180
But I know myself.

346
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,100
I know

347
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,660
that if I miss you,

348
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,180
I will never find peace in my life.

349
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,060
What about you?

350
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,060
Lin Yan,

351
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,340
do you still remember?

352
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,740
I told you that I came

353
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,420
from a place called Future Village.

354
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,580
In Future Village, there are dishwashers

355
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,880
and many other things that surpass

356
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
the wonders of this era.

357
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,380
You asked me why

358
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,140
I always say strange things

359
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,780
and do strange things.

360
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,100
It's because

361
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,140
my family and I

362
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
do not belong to this era.

363
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,820
We come from 1,000 in the future.

364
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,700
If you want to reject me,

365
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
you don't need to weave

366
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,900
such a ridiculous excuse.

367
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,340
Yunshui Manor is our ancestral home.

368
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,270
We came here through the ancestral home.

369
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,240
Based on the map we saw

370
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,080
(Yunshui Manor Tourist Map)
at Yunshui Manor,

371
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,980
the manor is in that direction.

372
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,420
Since we came through Yunshui Manor,

373
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,900
(Yunshui Manor)
we need to go there.

374
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,580
Actually, you're my fiancé.

375
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,500
I lied and said I was your fiancée

376
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,220
to live in Yunshui Manor

377
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,820
and find a way back.

378
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,300
But we tried

379
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,380
many times and failed.

380
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,660
There was no way,

381
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,020
so we had to stay here.

382
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,420
And you...

383
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,500
Our relationship...

384
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,660
Yunshui Manor is your place,

385
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,340
and it is our ancestral home,

386
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,420
so you are our...

387
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,700
When my grandfather was alive,

388
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
he told us the stories of our ancestor,

389
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,340
which are your stories.

390
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,860
That's why I know so much about you.

391
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,580
I know your surname is Cui,

392
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,980
and I deceived you,

393
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,420
pretending to be your fiancée.

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,220
Too absurd.

397
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,780
This can't be.

398
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,060
Do you remember the lock

399
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,320
on the secret door in the study?

400
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,540
Why couldn't you crack it,

401
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,980
but I could open it easily?

402
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,340
Because that lock

403
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,020
comes from our era.

Ancestor.

412
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,660
Not again.

413

A place that has yet to arrive.

417
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,500
It just needs
another thousand years or so

418
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,460

(Shen's Diner)

427
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,700
Jicai told Mr. Lin

428
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,180
everything today.

429
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,420
Ever since she came back,

430
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,940
she's been cleaning

431
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,460
nonstop here.

432
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,820
The diner is surprisingly clean.

433
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,900
I mean,

434
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,860
we should try to persuade her.

435
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,220
She just got caught in the rain.

436
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,740
Her health is important.

437
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,860
Or maybe

438
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,340
we should just let her vent.

439
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,500
She was fine
after jumping into the pond.

440
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,460
Jicai is thin,

441
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,420
but she's strong.

442
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,060
She needs this.

443
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,940
When adults are upset,

444
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,500
they tend to punish themselves.

445
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,140
Dad knows this best.

446
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,580
He did this when Mom left.

447
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,300
Yangyang, you're right.

448
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,860
That was the only time
Gongcai ever did any housework.

449
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,060
Dad...

450
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,020
Enough.

451
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,860
Don't worry.

452
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,940
I know my daughter.

453
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,420
Give her some time.

454
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,740
She'll be fine.

455
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,860
That makes sense.

456
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,260
(Jicai)

457
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,820
Oh, my.

458
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,380
Young Master,

459
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,380
what are you looking for here?

460
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,070
It's so dirty. Let me do it.

461
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,820
Found it.

462
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,420
(Jicai)

463
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,900
(Jicai)

464
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,660
Young Master.

465
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,500
Young Master,

466
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,540
I listened to you

467
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,100
and got close with the Jinwu guards

468
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,260
who were on duty
on the night Zhao Xunzhi disappeared.

469
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,100
Guess what?

470
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,620
(Jicai)

471
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,260
Young Master,

472
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,100
are

473
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,180
you okay?

474
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,540
Let's get down to business.

475
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,540
I treated

476
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,700
those Jinwu guards

477
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,860
to wine many times.

478
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,180
Finally, I got some info.

479
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,020
After the city gates
were locked that day,

480
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,640
a grocery cart from Yunlai Tavern

481
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,580
went out.

482
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,180
Opening the city gates at night?

483
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
Even with a bribe,

484
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,680
how dare the Jinwu guards do that?

485
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,900
That's the point.

486
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,020
There was an eunuch

487
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,330
in that cart.

488
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,190
It was related to Noble Consort Dou.

489
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,340
No wonder the Jinwu guards kept quiet.

490
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,980
Zhao Xunzhi

491
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,310
must have been on that cart.

492
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,090
Hurry up with your work.

493
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,940
We were ordered

494
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,440
to deliver these goods
to Fenglin Town by tomorrow.

495
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,700
The Jinwu guards will come later.

496
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,940
Hurry up.

497
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,700
Load the cart. Hurry.

498
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,340
Hurry.

499
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,780
Fenglin Town again.

500
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,180
It seems their base is there.

501
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,780
Why did you say "again"?

502
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,750
Early tomorrow,

503
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,740
I'll go see His Majesty

504
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,980
and head to Fenglin Town afterward.

505
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,660
You stay here

506
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,140
and take care of the Shen family.

507
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,660
Very well.

508
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,380
(Jingsi Study)

509
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,460
Why are you here?

510
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,780
I'm looking for Mr. Lin.

511
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,740
He's not here.

512
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,380
Tell me what you need.

513
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,990
Actually,

514
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,380
Jicai has told us everything.

515
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,820
I know

516
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,820
that after Mr. Lin was suspended,

517
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,220
he was in a bad mood

518
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,940
and had a disagreement

519
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,460
with Jicai.

520
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,860
I can understand all of this.

521
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,820
But that's one thing.

522
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,900
My career as a mole

523
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,820
can't just stop.

524
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,370
What would I do

525
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,240
with all my talents?

526
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,700
So, I'm asking Mr. Lin

527
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,500
if there's anything else
he wants me to do.

528
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,900
Mr. Lin has given instructions.

529
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,700
He will handle things.

530
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,780
You just need
to take care of yourselves.

531
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,940
How can that be?

532
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,260
I need to ask him in person.

533
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,100
Mr. Shen,

534
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,860
Mr. Lin really isn't here.

535
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,580
If he's not here,

536
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,660
I'll wait for him inside.

537
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,290
When we broke

538
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,020
(Jingsi Study)
into Yunlai Tavern at night,

539
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,260
we worked together so well.

540
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,140
Those glances.

541
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,300
Those feelings.

542
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,300
Now, it's the key moment
to solve the case.

543
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,860
How can he be without me by his side?

544
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,300
Mr. Lin is not in Yong'an,

545
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,860
so it's useless for you to wait inside.

546
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,340
Mr. Lin was demoted and left so soon?

547
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,820
He's gone

548
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,820
to Fenglin Town.

549
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,380
Fenglin Town?

550
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,980
That sounds so familiar.

551
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,180
Mr. Lin went to Fenglin Town

552
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,960
to rescue Mentor Zhao
and Yu San's parents.

553
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,860
You don't know.

554
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,420
When I was out working,

555
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,180
I went to Fenglin Town.

556
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,140
Back then,

557
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,540
I was begging there...

558
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,800
Struggling to survive.

559
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,620
I walked

560
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,620
every inch of that land.

561
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,820
So, I know the local customs

562
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,070
and the geography of that place

563
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,060
like the back of my hand.

564
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,900
No one is more suitable
to help him than me.

565
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,620
Before my young master left,

566
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,820
he repeatedly instructed me

567
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,180
to take good care

568
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,460
of you.

569
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,540
How can I just let you go?

570
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,700
How will I explain to him?

571
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,300
Lady Shen.

572
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,660
You must persuade your brother.

573
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,340
I have to go find Lin Yan.

574
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,620
(Dou Residence)

575
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,940
(Dou Residence)

576
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,180
Where is Zhao Xunzhi being held?

577
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,100
It's all here.

578
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,180
Mr. Lin.

579
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,660
Mentor Zhao.

580
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
Are you alright?

581
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,420
I'm fine for now.

582
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,540
Do you know

583
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,420
where they're holding
the other hostages?

584
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,820
The guards said

585
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,620
they're also in Fenglin Town.

586
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,780
Come with me.

587
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,700
You actually found your way here.

588
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,630
Lu Yun, that fool,

589
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,860
even told my father
you hadn't found anything.

590
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,160
It seems I know you better after all.

591
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,940
Lin Yan,

592
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,420
I've been waiting here all along

593
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,780
for you.

594
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,540
It's because you resemble
my eldest brother

595
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,860
that Father spared your life,

596
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,580
letting you live these extra years.

597
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,820
Kill this man

598
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,500
who should've gone

599
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,140
to hell 17 years ago.

600
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,500
Li Ang,

601
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,460
why give so many orders?

602
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,460
Who can hear the key point?

603
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,580
I told you to kill him!

604
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,700
Attack Zhao.

605
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,820
He will surely defend.

606
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,140
Stop it, all of you.

607
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,140
Father watched you learn

608
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,820
your swordsmanship.

609
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,100
He never treated me like this.

610
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,780
Today, I will personally disable you

611
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,460
and bring you before Father,

612
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,580
so he can see

613
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,100
how useless you are.

614
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,700
Scatter.

615
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,060
Slow down.

616
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,860
Mr. Lin,

617
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,840
hold on a little longer,

618
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,910
okay?

619
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,540
Come on.

620
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,730
Be careful.

621
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,260
Someone's coming.

622
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,980
- Lin Yan.
- That...

623
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,420
Mr. Lin!

624
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,940
Lin Yan!

625
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,700
Lin Yan.

626
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,460
Lin Yan.

627
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,980
It's okay now; I'm here.

628
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,820
It's okay.

629
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,500
It's okay now; I'm here.

630
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,340
Yu San's parents

631
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,140
are being held

632
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,260
somewhere else in Fenglin Town.

633
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,580
Mentor Zhao knows.

634
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,900
Let Cheng Hu

635
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,180
take people to rescue them.

636
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,060
Liu Chang will be here soon.

637
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,500
Hold on a little longer.

638
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,060
He's right behind us.

639
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,580
Don't fall asleep. Hold on.
