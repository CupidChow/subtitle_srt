=Episode 20=

3
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,480
(Shen's Diner)
Miss.

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,910
How much is your candied hawthorn?

5
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,430
It's 5 qian per skewer.

6
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,120
The braised chicken feet ones
are special,

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,190
so they're more expensive.

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,990
It's 8 qian each.

9
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,070
Braised chicken feet
in candied hawthorns?

10
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,880
Everything can be in candied hawthorns.

11
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,760
What is that?

12
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,680
I want that.

13
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,470
It's a spicy candied hawthorn.

14
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,470
Inside is spicy gluten.

15
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,120
My niece loves it.

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
Have a try?

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,240
Try it.

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
Is it delicious?

19
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,660
Sweet on the outside,

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,700
spicy on the inside.

21
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,650
It's delicious.

22
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,200
Miss, I'll take this one.

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
Thanks. Let's go home.

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,400
Each jin of cheese candy costs 60 qian.

25
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,200
Why sell your candied hawthorn

26
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,550
at five qian per skewer?

27
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,920
This is not made from cheese candy.

28
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,370
We used sugar from Yangzhou.

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,120
It's not cheap,

30
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,580
but for making candied hawthorns,

31
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,400
only a thin layer is needed

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,430
on the outside.

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,360
Kids love sweets,

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
so candied hawthorns

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
are the cheapest choice

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
for all the little friends in Yong'an.

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Except for Yangyang.

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,920
She's had enough sweets already.

39
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,870
Little friends?

40
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,150
What an interesting phrase.

41
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,430
It sounds like all the guests

42
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,430
in the diner are friends.

43
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,710
Kids are "little friends",

44
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,360
and other guests are "big friends".

45
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,220
You and your family

46
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,700
always have these special words.

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,180
Sometimes I feel

48
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,300
like you and I
are not from the same era,

49
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,740
but

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,900
it's more interesting.

51
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,900
It makes me want
to keep it this way forever

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,500
with you guys,

53
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,300
especially you.

54
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,460
I don't want any changes.

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,180
Let me.

56
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,940
(Candied Hawthorn)

57
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,500
Why are you alone in the diner?

58
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,620
To find a suitable mentor,

59
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,820
my brother took Yangyang out.

60
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,380
My parents were worried,

61
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,620
so they went along as well.

62
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,540
Deyuan caught a cold,

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,220
so I told her to leave the diner

64
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,340
and see a physician.

65
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,660
I'm off to cook.

we can have a snowball fight.

Jicai.

104
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,820
Auntie.

105
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,340
How was it?

106
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,860
- Any luck with the mentor?
- Mother.

107
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,220
I want to make a snowman.

108
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,340
No.

109
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,980
None of them is as good as my dad.

110
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,070
They can't even do maths properly.

111
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,960
I still want to go to Hongwen Academy.

112
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,840
You just don't want to go to school.

113
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,820
You're aiming too high.

114
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Hongwen Academy?

115
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,100
Forget about it.

116
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,220
If I can't go to Hongwen Academy,

117
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,740
I don't want to go to school at all.

118
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,100
Here comes the truth.

119
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,580
You just don't want to study.

120
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,500
Come on.

121
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,540
Do something about this.

122
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,820
Yangyang,

123
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,260
listen to me.

124
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,450
There's one thing bad

125
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,420
about this place:

126
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,820
Girls are not allowed

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,980
in the school.

128
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,420
Hongwen Academy is

129
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,180
where the Crown Prince studies.

130
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,180
Our family doesn't have
any high officials.

131
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,940
You can't even be admitted.

132
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,740
We do have a high official
in our family.

133
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,020
We have Mr. Lin, right?

134
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,300
It's not because of the Crown Prince

135
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,460
that I want to go there.

136
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,300
Auntie asked around.

137
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,800
They teach the six arts there,

138
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,180
including horsemanship and archery.

139
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,140
How wonderful!

140
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,660
Horsemanship and archery?

141
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,740
You just want to play.

142
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,780
That's too dangerous.

143
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,100
I just want to go to Hongwen Academy.

144
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,340
- Hongwen Academy.
- Yangyang.

145
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,100
Hongwen Academy.

146
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,340
I want to go to Hongwen Academy.

147
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,260
Alright.

148
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,460
Let's think of a way to get you

149
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,860
into Hongwen Academy.

150
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,820
Today is our first time

151
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,900
seeing snow in Yong'an.

152
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,620
Why not have your dad make a snowman?

153
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,020
- Okay.
- Sure.

154
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,300
I'll make you a snowman later.

155
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,340
(Shen's Diner)

156
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,570
Whether it's an excuse

157
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,000
or really her wish,

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,500
I think we do need

159
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,380
to think of a way.

160
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,420
Girls are limited in this era,

161
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,840
but I've thought about it.

162
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,020
We still can't have Yangyang

163
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,500
study at home.

164
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,960
Otherwise, she won't know

165
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,520
how to get along with her peers,

166
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,980
and her horizons will narrow.

167
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,660
Hongwen Academy is no ordinary place.

168
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,460
It's frequented by nobility.

169
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,260
Ordinary people simply can't get in.

170
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,980
Besides,

171
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,220
girls aren't allowed in school.

172
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,540
How are you going to solve that?

173
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,820
You can't disguise her as a boy,
can you?

174
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,300
Disguising her as a boy...

175
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,620
It's possible.

176
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,620
Come on.

177
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,580
Disguising her as a boy...

178
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,620
Where...

179
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,020
It's getting cold.

180
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,060
Would you like to warm up?

181
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,340
Try it.

182
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,060
Well.

183
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,340
I'm not sure about this flavor.

184
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,340
Help me taste it.

185
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,860
See if it's okay.

186
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,500
Previously,

187
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,940
I insisted on taking us to Sushui City,

188
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,580
almost leading us

189
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,380
into danger.

190
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,980
It was my fault.

191
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,140
Since we came to Yong'an,

192
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,860
I've realized

193
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,860
that I was indeed

194
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,820
a bit arrogant.

195
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,140
Actually,

196
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,780
it's not just your problem.

197
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,020
You do have your flaws,

198
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,380
but you never let us down
in crucial moments.

199
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,580
Whether it was in Sushui City

200
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,220
or other times,

201
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,340
whenever there was danger,

202
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,020
you stood up and protected us.

203
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,620
I know I have a bad temper;

204
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,260
I can't keep making you endure it.

205
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,940
I should change.

206
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,020
It's my problem.

207
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,820
How can I ask you to change?

208
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,460
It's me who needs to change.

209
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,220
No, it's me who's at fault.

210
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,740
I have a bad temper. I'll change.

211
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,100
No, no.

212
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,940
My problem

213
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,860
is definitely bigger than yours.

214
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,420
I should change first.

215
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
My temper is too bad.

216
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,580
It's almost domestic violence.

217
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,100
I always upset you. Give me it.

218
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,420
No, you're my wife.

219
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,540
Even if you have a problem,

220
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,180
it's my problem.

221
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,020
It'll always be my problem.
I'll change first.

222
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,460
Alright, alright.

223
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,140
It's still your problem.
You change first.

224
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,180
I...

225
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,140
I'll change.

226
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,020
Silly.

227
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,820
So, once I've changed,

228
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,580
can I...

229
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,660
Well...

230
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,340
It's getting cold.

231
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,540
You could catch a cold
sleeping in the diner.

232
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,620
Move back in.

233
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,660
Sure.

234
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,100
My goodness.

235
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,060
Oh, my.

236
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,020
Mr. Lin is just so dexterous.

237
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,740
The first one

238
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,020
made the dishwasher

239
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,500
would be born after over 1,000 years.

240
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,540
He's an ancient man,

241
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,980
and he managed to create this.

242
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,540
I seriously suspect that Mr. Lin

243
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,260
must've also traveled through time.

244
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
It's not that.

245
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,020
I used to complain about washing dishes,

246
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,520
and I mentioned that there's a machine

247
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,680
called a dishwasher in our hometown.

248
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,220
Then I just drew

249
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,860
a simple sketch.

250
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,060
Who would've thought
he actually made it?

251
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,660
Mr. Lin is so good to you.

252
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,820
It's so unfair.

253
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,100
I also find sweeping very tiring,

254
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,860
but he didn't make me a robot cleaner.

255
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,300
- So unique.
- Yes.

256
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,240
I've never seen anything like it.
So beautiful.

257
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,100
Here she is.

258
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,340
Lady Shen.

259
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,180
The snowman in front of your diner

260
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,380
is so unique.

261
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,340
Today, I came here with two ladies

262
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,660
for a meal.

263
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,020
I heard you were in the backyard,

264
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,860
so we came.

265
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,020
What is this big box?

266
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,980
What's this?

267
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,460
Ladies, you may not know.

268
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,140
This is called a dishwasher.

269
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,340
Dishwasher?

270
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,820
It can wash dishes and bowls.

271
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,940
In this cold winter,

272
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,060
our hands won't have
to touch cold water.

273
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,180
So amazing.

274
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,580
Everything you eat and use

275
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,480
is so nice.

276
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,620
You always have some unique

277
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,940
and interesting things.

278
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,780
Exactly.

279
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,220
Handsome Shen,

280
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,100
it must be made by you, right?

281
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,260
Of course.

282
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,140
Mr. Shen,

283
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,220
you're running a diner,

284
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,380
and you're well-educated.

285
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,340
Why not remarry?

286
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,860
I...

287
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
I want to focus on my career.

288
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,100
I'm not in a hurry.

289
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,100
Yangyang is still young.

290
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,620
Mr. Shen is considering his daughter.

291
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,580
But Lady Shen,

292
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,020
are you worried about your marriage?

293
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,860
Yes.

294
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,300
You should think about yourself.

295
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,500
I heard that you refused

296
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,820
the proposal of Mr. Liu
from Guixiang Tavern

297
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,660
a few days ago.

298
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,140
The Liu family is one

299
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,060
of the wealthiest families.

300
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,500
Even Mr. Liu is not good enough?

301
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,740
Lady Shen,

302
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,860
what kind of man do you like?

303
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,980
What kind of man do you like?

304
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,980
I'll introduce someone to you.

305
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,820
Tell us.

306
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,670
Right, Jicai.

307
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,480
Even I don't know
what kind of man you like.

308
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,940
She's shy.

309
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,060
I like someone

310
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,380
who trusts me.

311
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,580
Do you want us to win,

312
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,460
or them to win?

313
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,820
I bet on you winning.

314
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,460
Someone who remembers what I said.

315
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,780
That night, you drew it simply

316
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,820
and didn't explain much.

317
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,140
I've thought it over and over,

318
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,100
but I still don't know

319
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,420
how to make it run by itself.

320
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,180
So, I had to settle

321
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,980
for a hand-pulled rotating box.

322
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,780
Someone who won't abandon me

323
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,540
to protect himself,

324
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,860
no matter how hard it is.

325
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,460
Hold my hand!

326
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,300
Mr. Lin, save me!

327
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,540
I swear on my life

328
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,980
that you will be fine.

329
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,180
- Right.
- That's it?

330
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,300
Anything else?

331
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,580
Mr. Lin, you're off duty...

332
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,540
Your work is done?

333
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,820
Mr. Lin.

334
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,020
Let's go.

335
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,960
Let's go.

336
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,140
I just saw many people

337
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,500
wanting to buy candied hawthorn,

338
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,540
but no one was responding,

339
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,100
so I came here to check.

340
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,140
No one?

341
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,660
I'll go check.

342
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,540
Thanks, Mr. Lin.

343
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,860
Do I really like Lin Yan?

344
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,620
Jicai,

345
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,940
what did you just say?

346
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,420
Nothing.

347
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,580
- Jicai!
- Auntie!

348
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,700
In this freezing weather,

349
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
how could you jump into the pond?

350
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,140
Do you know that catching a cold

351
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,620
could easily be fatal in this era?

352
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,820
What were you thinking?

353
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,940
Here, come on.

354
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,340
Hurry.

355
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,460
Ginger milk.

356
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,660
Come on, Jicai.

357
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,700
Drink it.

358
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,820
This girl...

359
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,460
Slow down.

360
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,540
Sir,

361
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,300
Second Master Zhao is still in Yong'an.

362
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,220
He's Zhao Xunzhi from Hongwen Academy.

363
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,940
It really is him.

364
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,380
He changed his testimony,

365
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,900
slandering his close friend.

366
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,060
How dare he teach here!

367
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,280
(The Case of Heluo Wang Kejiu)

368
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,430
From now on,

369
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,940
try to get close to Zhao Xunzhi.

370
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,500
Oh, Lady Shen fell into the pond

371
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,420
in the garden just now.

372
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,140
Why didn't you say so earlier?

373
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,700
I was talking about Zhao Xunzhi.

374
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,180
Put your clothes on.

375
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,540
Lady Shen?

376
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,540
Are you inside?

377
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,770
Go and stop him.

378
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,620
Don't let him in.

379
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,820
- Hurry.
- Go now.

380
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,940
- Uncle.
- Mr. Lin.

381
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,300
Why are you here?

382
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,140
It's so late.

383
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,440
Shouldn't you be resting?

384
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,920
I heard Lady Shen fell into the water.

385
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,940
I came to check on her.

386
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,860
How is she?

387
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,740
She's fine.

388
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,660
- It was an accident.
- Yes.

389
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,860
Besides, your pond

390
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,940
isn't even up to her knees.

391
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,160
Even if she wanted to get hurt,

392
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,700
she couldn't.

393
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,500
Why would she fall for no reason?

394
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,980
If it's okay,

395
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,300
may I go in and take a look?

396
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,500
It's not okay.

397
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,260
Really not okay.

398
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,520
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

399
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,380
I'll be quick.

400
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,820
No, Mr. Lin.

401
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,700
Control yourself.

402
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,660
Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin.

403
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,740
- Mr. Lin.
- Calm down.

404
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,180
Mr. Lin.

405
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,420
Mr. Lin.

406
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,380
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

407
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,420
How could you come in?

408
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,260
Sorry.

409
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,420
I heard coughing

410
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,540
and got worried.

411
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,420
Lady Shen, how are you?

412
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,740
Thanks for your concern.

413
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,300
It's just a cold, nothing serious.

414
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,740
Please go back.

415
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,260
Let me check on you

416
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,980
and make sure you're okay;
then I'll leave.

417
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,020
I'm really fine.

418
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,140
Don't come any closer.

419
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,460
Please go back.

420
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,860
How did it happen?

421
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,980
Mr. Lin.

422
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,740
Mr. Lin.

423
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,980
Mr. Lin, you mustn't.

424
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,940
Lady Shen...

425
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,060
Young Master.

426
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,260
Young Master,

427
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,380
your cloak...

428
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,460
Shen Jianshe, your ancestor is in love.

429
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,380
He came here without a cloak

430
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,060
because he was worried about Jicai.

431
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,500
The ancients place great emphasis
on proper attire.

432
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,940
So, he's doing this

433
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,140
because of Jicai.

434
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,260
This is a big trouble.

435
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,500
Why is it a big trouble?

436
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,940
Good girl,

437
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
it doesn't concern you.

438
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,280
It's not suitable for kids.

439
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,900
Put on the cloak.

440
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,060
Liu Chang,

441
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,740
go and bring all the charcoal stoves

442
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,300
and bedding.

443
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,580
Yes.

444
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,220
Mr. Lin,

445
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,340
you and Jicai
are both improperly dressed.

446
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,340
Jicai is still

447
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,700
an unmarried lady.

448
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
It's not appropriate for you

449
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,100
to rush in like this.

450
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,340
Exactly.

451
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,820
I'm sorry.

452
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,340
We understand

453
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,580
you were worried about Jicai.

454
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,220
You've seen her.

455
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,540
She's really fine.

456
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,340
She just caught a cold.

457
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,020
Mr. Lin, please go back.

458
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,540
Yes, Mr. Lin.

459
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,140
You've seen that Jicai is fine.

460
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,060
We'll take good care of her, right?

461
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,420
If there's nothing else,

462
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
you might as well...

463
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,660
You should...

464
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,620
I'm really sorry.

465
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,580
I've offended you.

466
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,700
Please forgive me.

467
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,660
If there's anything we can help with,

468
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,540
please let us know.

469
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,580
Sure, we will.

470
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,660
Why not just...

471
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,260
This is too awkward.

472
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,700
Dad,

473
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,220
I just realized.

474
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,540
Why are you here so late at night?

475
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,380
Well, your mom...

476
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,140
When did you start

477
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,820
meddling in my affairs?

478
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,220
In Yunshui Manor,

479
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,460
I come and go

480
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,420
as I please.

481
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,580
Who dares to stop me?

482
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,060
I've told you so many times

483
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,540
that only your mom can stop me.

484
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,540
Who else dares?

485
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,740
Besides,

486
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,180
does my business matter

487
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,060
at this moment?

488
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,980
It's getting late.

489
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,620
Let Jicai rest.

490
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,980
Let's talk outside.

491
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,860
Let's go.

492
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,660
No need to avoid me.

493
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,460
I know what's going on.

494
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,980
Alright, you guys talk here.

495
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,540
I'll take Yangyang back to sleep.

496
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,140
No.

497
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,280
I'm not a child anymore.

498
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,820
I want to join the discussion with you.

499
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,660
Don't be silly.

500
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,020
The topic is not suitable for you.

501
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,500
- Go to sleep.
- I know.

502
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,060
Auntie likes Lin Mr. Lin,

503
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,220
and Lin Mr. Lin likes Auntie.

504
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,100
Don't talk nonsense.

505
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,020
- Don't be so tough.
- Don't talk nonsense.

506
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,900
It's okay that she said that.

507
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,340
Mr. Lin's action just now has shown

508
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,220
how he feels about Jicai.

509
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,860
Otherwise, he wouldn't have done that.

510
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,700
According to history,

511
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,140
Mr. Lin's heart

512
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,820
should be with Ancestor Shen.

513
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,260
Why has it shifted to Jicai now?

514
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,500
Isn't this a mess?

515
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,500
Jicai,

516
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,020
did you say something

517
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,340
or do something

518
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,020
that caused a misunderstanding?

519
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,420
Shen Jianshe,

520
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,100
how can you say that?

521
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,980
What's wrong?

522
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,620
- You can't blame her.
- What did I do?

523
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,980
This must be your ancestor

524
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,180
who is overthinking.

525
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,940
I mean,

526
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,820
we can't blame Jicai for this.

527
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,060
You all saw it just now.

528
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,860
Jicai kept telling Mr. Lin to go back,

529
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,100
saying she was fine,

530
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,580
but he insisted on seeing her.

531
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,980
This shows that Mr. Lin

532
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,260
is not being a proper man.

533
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
Dear,

534
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,180
this has nothing to do with that.

535
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
What am I afraid of?

536
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,620
I'm afraid of changing history.

537
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,940
If history changes,

538
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,100
our whole family will vanish.

539
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,940
Do you understand?

540
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,780
To solve the problem,

541
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,900
we must find out why.

542
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,660
We have to find out

543
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,260
why Mr. Lin likes you.

544
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,300
Once we figure it out, it'll be easy.

545
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,780
Think again.

546
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,620
Did you say

547
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,740
or do something that caused

548
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,900
a misunderstanding?

549
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,780
It's okay.

550
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,540
We can just explain it to him, right?

551
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,660
Everything will get back on track.

552
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,860
Isn't that what you mean?

553
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,220
So, it's Jicai's fault?

554
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,100
Jicai is so excellent.

555
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,780
Does he need a reason to like her?

556
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,020
I just want to solve the problem.

557
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,340
Why so argumentative?

558
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,380
Listen, Shen Jianshe.

559
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,740
It's wrong to blame everything

560
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,900
- on Jicai.
- I didn't.

561
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,780
Your ancestor

562
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,620
started this.

563
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,820
Don't worry.

564
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,060
Why blame her?

565
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,900
Mom.

566
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,300
I grew up
under modern scientific education, okay?

567
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,740
When I went
to Xingjiao Nunnery last time,

568
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,980
I realized my thoughts were not right.

569
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,660
But I've purified my soul
in the prayer hall.

570
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,740
I was just a bit emotional just now,

571
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,780
but I'm fine now.

572
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,460
Jicai,

573
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,580
you...

574
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,900
I'm really fine.

575
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,340
As for the ancestor,

576
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,900
he's just a normal man living
in ancient times.

577
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,180
He hasn't met enough women,

578
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,580
so he might just be curious
about me, a modern person.

579
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,180
But Lady Jingwen showed up,

580
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,620
and she's so excellent.

581
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,420
There's no way the ancestor
would stick with me.

582
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,380
That makes sense.

583
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,460
Indeed.

584
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,170
Lady Jingwen does fit

585
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,220
the requirements of a lady in this era.

586
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,660
She seems quite good.

587
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,700
Right? I think so, too.

588
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,740
Everything will get back on track soon.

589
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,860
No.

590
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
Tomorrow morning,

591
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,780
we need to find a new house

592
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,820
to move out of Yunshui Manor asap.

593
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,460
Physically,

594
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,260
we need to separate from Mr. Lin.

595
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,020
This matter is urgent.

596
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,240
It needs to be done at once.

597
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,580
You do it.

598
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,980
Me?

599
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,140
Your mom and I have to stay
in the diner.

600
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,220
We don't have time.

601
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,460
This is your opportunity.

602
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,780
Can you seize it?

603
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,380
- Me.
- Gongcai.

604
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,020
Try your best.

605
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,340
Dad.

606
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,900
Mom.

607
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,540
This is the first time

608
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,380
in my life

609
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,420
you've given me

610
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,620
a family matter to handle.

611
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,120
You've finally realized

612
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,380
that I am capable.

613
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,340
Trust me.

614
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,300
I'll surely find a house

615
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,860
that everyone will be satisfied with.

616
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,700
I don't trust you.

617
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,180
Why undermine your dad?

618
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,060
Me neither.

619
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,700
Neither do I.

620
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,540
Don't worry.

621
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,380
I'll start making plans right now.

622
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,420
Wait for my good news.

623
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,740
(Address)
No. 5 in Chang'an Alley.

624
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,700
The agent is Ms. Du.

625
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,140
No. 5?

626
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,180
Excuse me,

627
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
are you Mr. Du?

628
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,980
Mei?

629
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,260
Wait a minute.

630
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,380
Hurry up.

631
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,860
Go, go, go.

632
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,900
You're bad at this.

633
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,580
Bye, I'm out.

634
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,700
Alright.

635
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,980
I've said this many times.

636
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,700
I want my soy milk plain.

637
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,820
Plain.

638
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,500
Why do you always put sugar in it?

639
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Sorry, dear.

640
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,060
I'll pay attention next time.

641
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,460
On the left.

642
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,320
And these buns.

643
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,700
We've been married for three years,

644
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,740
and you can never remember

645
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,880
that I don't eat meat buns.

646
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,300
Sorry, dear. I was wrong.

647
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,740
I'll change next time.

648
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,620
Shen Shaojie,

649
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,500
I've been thinking for a long time,

650
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,380
and I have to say it today.

651
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,220
Let's get a divorce.

652
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,260
Yangyang can stay with you.

653
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,700
Sorry, dear. I was wrong.

654
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,780
I'll change next time.

655
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,060
Are you joking with me?

656
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,700
Dear, that's a pretty harsh move.

657
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,580
Who taught you that?

658
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,820
You've scared me
out of playing this game.

659
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,700
(Defeat)

660
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,220
Are you serious?

661
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,420
Are you angry?

662
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,980
The breakfast was wrong, right?

663
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,180
I remember.

664
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,580
You want your soy milk sweet.

665
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,740
No, salty.

666
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
No, plain.

667
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,940
And the buns you want...

668
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,540
I can just buy you another one.

669
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,620
I'll buy you another one.

670
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,700
No need.

671
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,820
Shaojie,

672
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,420
to be honest,

673
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,620
I've fallen for someone else.

674
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,380
Let's just end it here.

675
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,940
Mei,

676
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,580
it really is you.

677
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,260
When did you come?

678
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,460
How have you been here?

679
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,460
Why didn't you tell me?

680
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,500
Why didn't you come to me?

681
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,340
Go away.

682
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,580
Sir,

683
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,300
we've never met before.

684
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,140
If you keep this up,

685
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,500
I'll report you to the yamen.

686
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,340
It's me.

687
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,460
It's me!

688
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,780
Look closely.

689
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,820
Don't you recognize me?

690
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,500
You...

691
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,700
Aren't you Mei?

692
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,980
You've mistaken me for someone else.

693
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,980
My name is not Mei;

694
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,100
I don't know anyone by that name.

695
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,540
How could that be?

696
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,660
Come on.

697
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,340
Sir,

698
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,540
what are you trying to do?

699
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,180
You...

700
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,660
You...

701
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,100
Let's talk this through

702
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,260
calmly.

703
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,060
It's impossible.

704
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,140
You look exactly the same.

705
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,220
Are you pretending

706
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,740
not to recognize me?

707
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,980
Mei,

708
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,420
I've let you go,

709
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,500
and I'm completely different now.

710
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,460
Trust me.

711
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,860
- Wait.
- I just feel

712
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,260
that we can look out for each other

713
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,100
in this unfamiliar environment.

714
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,380
I think letting go...

715
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,540
Shut up!

716
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,340
This is sheer slander.

717
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,060
What a madman.

718
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,020
It's really not her.

719
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,460
Miss, Miss.

720
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,300
Miss, Miss.

721
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
Wait, wait.

722
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,140
Well.

723
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,660
Miss,

724
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,780
I'm sorry.

725
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,340
I just mistook you for someone else.

726
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,020
I am Handsome Shen.

727
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,820
Ms. Pang, Duke Lu's family,

728
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,020
told me you were a house agent.

729
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,260
Handsome Shen?

730
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,220
No way.

731
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,580
Ms. Shen told me

732
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,100
that Handsome Shen

733
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,500
is extremely handsome

734
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,540
and exceptionally wise.

735
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,380
Well,

736
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,940
I am indeed Handsome Shen.

737
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,900
I know your surname is Du,

738
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,860
you're a house agent,

739
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,780
and you're here leasing

740
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,500
the No. 5 house in Chang'an Alley.

741
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,340
Right?

742
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,740
When I suddenly saw you just now,

743
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,900
you looked too much like an old friend.

744
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,020
I hope you won't take offense.

745
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,460
I was wrong about you, sir.

746
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,700
Don't say that.

747
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,300
My behavior was improper just now.

748
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,860
How could I blame you?

749
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,750
By the way,

750
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,620
I heard you say just now

751
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,660
that your old friend is named Mei.

752
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,020
She must be very important to you,

753
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,140
which is why you got so excited.

754
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,340
Yes.

755
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,900
Mei used

756
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,220
to be my wife.

757
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,100
You look

758
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,460
quite similar to her.

759
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,220
You haven't forgotten her.

760
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,220
What an affectionate man.

761
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,900
Not really.

762
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,020
Emotionally,

763
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,100
I have let her go.

764
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,100
But back then,

765
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,580
I didn't give her

766
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,700
a good life.

767
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
Every time I think of it,

768
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,780
I feel a bit guilty.

769
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,560
You're moving out?

770
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,340
It's a bit sudden.

771
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,860
But we've found a house.

772
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,440
Sorry for all the trouble

773
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,140
during this time.

774
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,540
Is it

775
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,860
because of Prince Zhao?

776
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,460
Let me be frank.

777
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,380
Since we've decided to help you,

778
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,660
we're not afraid

779
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,220
that your relationship with Prince Zhao

780
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,620
will cause us any trouble,

781
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,380
and we won't change our minds.

782
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,380
But

783
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,660
we do have to move out.

784
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,620
If we stay any longer,

785
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
the neighbors will start gossiping.

786
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,380
Besides,

787
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,580
if any rumors spread

788
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,980
about you and Shaoguang,

789
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,220
it wouldn't be good for anyone.

790
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,180
What are

791
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,300
rumors?

792
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,540
Rumors are

793
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,380
scandalous news,

794
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,500
saying improper things

795
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,660
about you two.

796
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,500
I don't care.

797
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,540
But we do.

798
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,460
Mr. Lin,

799
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,900
to be honest,

800
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,380
you and Shaoguang

801
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,020
aren't a good match.

802
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,020
We've made up our minds,

803
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,380
and we hope

804
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,020
you'll respect our decision.

805
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,100
Milady, why are you here alone today?

806
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,020
Where are your parents?

807
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,860
Didn't they come?

808
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,180
They're moving.

809
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,340
Moving?

810
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,820
Milady.

811
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,820
Milady,

812
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,780
Mr. Lin is here.

813
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,340
Help me get rid of him.

814
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,900
Mr. Lin.

815
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,180
Well, Mr. Lin.

816
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,340
Are you avoiding me?

817
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,340
(Escaping is shameful and useless.)

818
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,780
(Escaping is useless and shameful.)

819
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,000
(To stop it from getting worse)

820
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,540
(and correct Mr. Lin's misconception,)

821
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,260
(I need him to think I'm crazy.)

822
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,380
Oh, Mr. Lin,

823
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,860
blessings upon you.

824
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,740
My goodness,

825
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,740
how could I be avoiding you?

826
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,180
You must be busy,

827
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,900
yet you came.

828
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,020
May I ask

829
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,500
what you want?

830
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,620
Has your cold

831
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,260
worsened?

832
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,900
Don't worry.

833
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,260
The cold is completely gone.

834
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,980
I'm as strong

835
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,940
as an old workhorse now.

836
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,620
Mr. Lin, there's no need
for extra concern.

837
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,220
You're distancing yourself from me.

838
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,620
Mr. Lin,

839
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,940
of course not.

840
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,740
But superiors and subordinates

841
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,660
should maintain their distinctions.

842
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,260
But you're not my subordinate.

843
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,700
My respected old friend,

844
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,900
I was wrong.

845
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,980
We should observe

846
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,660
the proper order of seniority.

847
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,660
We're of similar age.

848
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,900
My goodness.

849
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,020
I forgot about the rule
between men and women.

850
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,780
The people in our state
have never had that rule.

851
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,540
What's wrong with you?

852
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,100
In any case,

853
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,860
it's better

854
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,780
for you and me

855
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,820
to keep some distance.

856
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,940
Auntie suddenly came and said

857
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,740
that you have to move out,

858
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,820
because she's afraid
people will gossip about us.

859
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,060
When you first moved in,

860
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,420
did you ever consider rumors?

861
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,220
I've never cared about them.

862
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,060
Why the sudden change?

863
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,700
Do you really want to avoid me?

864
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,300
Shen Shaoguang,

865
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,460
I want an answer.

866
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,060
Yes.

867
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,900
I want to avoid you.

868
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,060
What's wrong?

869
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,020
Why?

870
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,100
I just find you annoying.

871
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,940
Is that not allowed?

872
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,740
The previous oversteps

873
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,940
were my fault.

874
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,220
I apologize to you.

875
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,900
From now on,

876
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,060
I will do as you wish

877
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,900
and keep my distance from you.
