00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,550
Fengxia.

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Fengxia.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,760
What are you doing?

7
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,780
All the dishes are served.

8
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,990
I have to cook dumplings.

9
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,680
Previously I bought you a carriage.

10
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,480
You didn't like it.

11
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,400
You scolded me for it.

12
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,960
Before that, I bought you a ring,

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,870
but the size was wrong.

14
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,880
You scolded me again.

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,160
Today,

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,350
I bought you another ring
to make up for it.

17
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,600
I hope you can stop scolding me.

18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,710
Happy Chinese New Year.

19
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,220
(Pavilion of Jade in the Fairy Mountains)

20
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,710
Your Highness,

21
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,590
it's getting late.

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,040
How about

23
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,750
I go back first?

24
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,960
So I won't delay you
entering the palace.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Her Highness understands
that you have no time to return home,

26
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,690
and that spending Chinese New Year's Eve

27
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,200
alone away from home must be difficult,

28
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,910
so Her Highness declined
other invitations

29
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,620
and invited you to be here
for a gathering.

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,140
The news

31
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,670
that I couldn't afford the travel fare

32
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,220
to return home

33
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,540
has somehow reached you.

34
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,420
I just feel

35
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,260
that entering the palace
is even more boring.

36
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,260
It's better to stay here

37
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,540
and enjoy tea and chess
with a close friend.

38
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,220
There are even night outings
during the festival.

39
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,620
I haven't been to a lantern festival
in many years.

40
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,420
How about you come along

41
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,460
with me?

42
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,300
It's a copper coin.

43
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,220
Impressive.

44
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,980
- You got it.
- I got a copper coin.

45
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,340
Does eating a copper coin

46
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
mean

47
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,300
that in the Chinese New Year

48
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,780
I can have whatever I want?

49
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,620
Yes.

50
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,660
So what do you want for the Chinese New Year?

51
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,420
Grandpa,

52
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,420
wishing you prosperity.

53
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,500
Give me money.

54
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,300
Good girl.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,140
Sure.

56
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,500
I've already prepared it for you.

57
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,350
Here, take it.

58
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,260
Thank you, grandpa.

59
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,380
Grandma, wishing you prosperity.

60
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,340
Give me money.

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,140
I forgot today. What should I do?

62
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,500
She feels wronged.

63
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,180
I've already prepared it
for a long time.

64
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,020
Thank you, grandma.

65
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,100
You're welcome.

66
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,340
Happy Chinese New Year, Auntie.

67
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,060
Happy Chinese New Year, Yangyang.

68
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,180
Thank you, Auntie.

69
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,700
Deyuan.

70
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,820
Happy Chinese New Year.

71
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,900
It's mine?

72
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,780
Of course.

73
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,460
You're also part of our family.

74
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,060
Thank you, milady.

75
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,060
Ming, look.

76
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,980
Mr. Lin.

77
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,940
Happy Chinese New Year.

78
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,580
I'm really not prepared.

79
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,780
Take it all.

80
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,500
That's a lot.

81
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,580
Mr. Lin, this is way too much.

82
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,740
Including the share for me
and Liu Chang.

83
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,260
It's not much.

84
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,420
Here, take it.

85
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,740
Yangyang, you should give Mr. Lin
a kowtow for this.

86
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,460
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

87
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,420
May everything go smoothly.

88
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,610
- This kid.
- Go ahead.

89
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,820
Yangyang.

90
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,740
Look, what is this?

91
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,580
This is...

92
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,780
This is the lucky money from my father.

93
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,540
My father even sent a letter.

94
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,570
Here, take it.

95
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,060
Let's open it and read.

96
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,900
This is written by Gongcai.

97
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,100
Let me see.

98
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,940
Here.

99
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,180
This is really written by Gongcai.

100
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,460
Let me read it to everyone.

101
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,020
Family members,

102
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,220
when you read this letter,

103
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,500
I am already on my way

104
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,820
to the peak.

105
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,340
Don't worry.

106
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,860
With my personal charm,

107
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,740
wherever I am,

108
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,020
I will be warmly sought after.

109
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,220
Ladies and gentlemen,

110
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,640
this kind of talk show

111
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,500
is probably something
you haven't heard before.

112
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,900
You shamelessly dragged us here.

113
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,280
Didn't you say you don't want money

114
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,540
and you provide tea and snacks?

115
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,540
Where is the stuff? Where is it?

116
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,180
Where is the stuff you promised?

117
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,740
Everyone, calm down.

118
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,900
I'll definitely provide.

119
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,180
But if

120
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,580
you think I speak quite well,

121
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,300
I still hope everyone can offer me

122
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,180
a couple of coins.

123
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,420
That's him.

124
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,380
I saw him nearby yesterday.

125
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,020
He talked about gender equality;

126
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,880
ladies should be independent
and self-reliant.

127
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,580
He even asked my wife divorce me.

128
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,370
He mislead the public.

129
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,210
- I didn't.
- Is that so?

130
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,740
- Hit him.
- Beat him to death.

131
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,940
Hit him.

132
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,020
Don't run.

133
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,730
Stop!

134
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,520
Stop!

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,430
Don't run.

136
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,340
I'm all good.

137
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,620
I just miss Yangyang.

138
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,900
Yangyang,

139
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,860
you are the daughter
I am most proud of.

140
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,140
In the future you must be like me...

141
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,700
- Become...
- Perform or not?

142
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,820
- Think much.
- Very soon.

143
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,660
Be enterprising.

144
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,020
Innovative.

145
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,980
I once had a large number of fans

146
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,460
in Yong'an,

147
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,380
and achieved some small successes.

148
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,460
But I never became complacent
about it;

149
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,660
instead, I keep seeking

150
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,100
new entrepreneurial directions.

151
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,020
Life is just like this,

152
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,300
full of possibilities.

153
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,020
Yangyang,

154
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,940
you know what?

155
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,980
My current job is very good.

156
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,460
High income,

157
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,860
decent,

158
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,220
stable.

159
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,900
When dealing with colleagues at work,

160
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,900
I have always approached

161
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,960
with an attitude of cooperation
and mutual benefit.

162
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,220
So,

163
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,220
I can easily

164
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,180
get along with everyone.

165
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,580
You don't need to worry about me.

166
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,780
Awesome!

167
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,500
Are you going to fight or not?

168
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,580
- Hurry up.
- Exactly.

169
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,540
Do it quickly.

170
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,420
Do it!

171
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,660
Don't just stand there watching.

172
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,860
Hit him.

173
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,020
Do it.

174
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,860
Didn't you eat?

175
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,300
Didn't you eat?

176
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,500
OK.

177
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,900
I'm telling you,

178
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,500
you can hit me anywhere you want,

179
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,940
just not the face.

180
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,020
Otherwise my female fans

181
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,900
will be unhappy.

182
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,180
Awesome!

183
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,420
It's almost Chinese New Year.

184
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,740
Wish my family a Happy Chinese New Year.

185
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,580
If there are any other developments,

186
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
I will write again to inform you.

187
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,620
May you all be safe and sound.

188
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,500
Do not miss me.

189
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,260
Applause.

190
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,700
- Give him applause.
- Great.

191
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,500
Gongcai has finally grown.

192
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,940
Don't cry, don't cry.

193
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,740
Yangyang, you should be happy.

194
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,580
Isn't it?

195
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,180
Come on.

196
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,220
Let's keep eating.

197
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,700
Let me tell you all.

198
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,900
There are quite a few good omens
in these dumplings.

199
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,540
Let's see what each of you can get.

200
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,990
Come on, start eating.

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,900
Alright, let's eat.

202
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,740
OK.

203
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,340
Come on, Mr. Lin.

204
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,860
Try this filling.

205
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,380
Thank you.

206
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,220
You're welcome.

207
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,440
By the way, there's one more thing
I want to announce.

208
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,460
Our restaurant's renovation

209
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,940
will be finished soon.

210
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,820
It will be ready to open
after the Chinese New Year.

211
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,700
- Great.
- Great.

212
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,820
Come on, everyone, eat up.

213
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,860
Let's eat.

214
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,220
Let's eat.

215
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,740
Auspicious Chinese New Year.

216
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,540
Happy Chinese New Year.

217
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,740
(Miss You in Yong'an)
The Princess has arrived.

218
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,540
Greetings, Your Highness.

219
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,660
Today is Chinese New Year's Eve.

220
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,520
No need to be constrained
by these formalities.

221
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,140
Are you about to go out?

222
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,460
Censor Pei and I

223
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,900
just finished admiring the lanterns.

224
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,740
I was thinking of coming to your place
for some hotpot.

225
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,220
Looks like this is bad timing, huh?

226
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,060
No, Yangyang wants
to go see the lanterns.

227
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,940
My father and mother

228
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,120
have already taken them there.

229
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,460
I'm not interested in those things.

230
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,300
It's alright.

231
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,420
Deyuan.

232
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,480
You've been talking
about Aoshan Lanterns all day.

233
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,580
You catch up with them.

234
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,290
Deyuan, go ahead.

235
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,220
I will stay with your lady.

236
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,900
Liu Chang is here too.

237
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,740
It's OK.

238
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,860
Your Highness,

239
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,780
please take a seat.

240
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,420
Please.

241
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,020
The newly heated Tusu wine.

242
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,660
Drink some first to warm up.

243
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,220
Lady Shen,

244
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,060
the tofu from your restaurant
is quite peculiar.

245
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,580
I have never seen it before.

246
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,020
Why are there so many holes?

247
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,140
Cut the tofu into square cubes,

248
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,340
and blanch with salt,

249
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,820
then holes will form and expand.

250
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,730
After placing it in the ice cellar
to freeze,

251
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,550
it will be like this.

252
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,780
Put it into the soup.

253
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,100
It will be especially flavorful.

254
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,660
Truly delicious.

255
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,660
Delicious.

256
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm glad you like it.

257
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,060
Lady Shen,

258
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,980
today, regardless of status,

259
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,340
why not sit down with us?

260
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,780
Let's drink and sing together,

261
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,420
and have a lively time.

262
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,380
Then thank you, Your Highness.

263
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,460
Here.

264
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,540
Auspicious Chinese New Year.

265
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,900
Mr. Lin,

266
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,220
your alcohol tolerance is poor.

267
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,580
Better drink a little less.

268
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,940
OK.

269
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,780
Lady Shen,

270
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,460
you said Anran

271
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,550
has poor alcohol tolerance?

272
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
His alcohol tolerance...

273
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,580
Anran,

274
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,140
could it be

275
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,300
that you lied to Lady Shen?

276
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,740
Twelfth Master,

277
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,160
what nonsense are you talking about?

278
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,580
Is it nonsense?

279
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,820
I did hear

280
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,380
you can hold your liquor
without getting drunk.

281
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,730
That time, Second Master Huan

282
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,660
somehow offended you.

283
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,500
His uncle hosted a banquet
and invited you.

284
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,580
He said

285
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,940
you drank all of their Jiannan Wine,

286
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,700
still without changing your expression.

287
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,860
It's all old news.

288
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,180
Don't mention it.

289
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,820
Mr. Lin, I'm sorry, I was wrong.

290
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,880
- Lady Shen.
- I dare not.

291
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,340
What happened last night?

292
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,940
I can't remember.

293
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,020
Last night we ate moon cakes together.

294
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,940
I became a listener.

295
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,260
Then we had a drink together.

296
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,980
After that,

297
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,820
I can't remember clearly.

298
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,300
Did something bad happen?

299
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,980
Lady Shen,

300
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,180
this is also Jiannan wine, very strong.

301
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,500
You shouldn't drink like that.

302
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,740
You will be...

303
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,770
Your alcohol tolerance isn't good.

304
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,700
Yes.

305
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,030
I'm not good at holding my liquor.

306
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,380
Unlike you,

307
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,420
you remember everything.

308
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,020
Around the Lantern Festival,

309
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,020
I am going to hold a few banquets.

310
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,300
I'll entrust them to you.

311
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,220
What do you think?

312
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,620
I appreciate it, Your Highness.

313
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,860
Censor Pei,

314
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,020
truly delicious.

315
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,140
Lady Shen, please don't mind.

316
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,460
I'm just curious

317
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,460
about frozen tofu.

318
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,580
I'm curious
about how frozen tofu is made.

319
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,700
I am so happy

320
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,180
that you like it.

321
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
How could I mind?

322
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,540
Please have a look.

323
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,780
So this is frozen tofu.

324
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,860
Where is that?

325
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,020
That's our warehouse,

326
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,060
where some commonly used ingredients
are stored.

327
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,340
May I go and take a look?

328
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,060
Mainly, I just want to see

329
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,940
if there are any suitable ingredients
for the banquet.

330
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,620
Of course.

331
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,180
Your Highness, please.

332
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,420
Light the candles first.

333
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,940
Your Highness.

334
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,540
Your Highness.

335
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,060
What are you looking for?

336
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,140
Crowbar.

337
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't know

338
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,300
if Her Highness misunderstand us.

339
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,160
If we keep staying,

340
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,220
it's not a solution.

341
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,900
You're afraid to stay with me?

342
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,940
I am not.

343
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,950
Her Highness likes to play a trick.

344
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,540
If we go out right now,

345
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
it seems as if we are quite displeased,

346
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,860
hurting her feelings.

347
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,220
Let's wait a while.

348
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,180
Once upon a time in Qingyang,

349
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,100
did your family also eat
water-shield dumplings?

350
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,620
My family actually didn't eat it much.

351
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,460
So you made a special trip?

352
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,780
There's not much I can do.

353
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,620
We're family.

354
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,100
I just made something you like to eat,

355
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,740
so it can cheer you up a bit.

356
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,220
No matter what happens,

357
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,660
as long as there are people
who will always support you,

358
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,180
you will surely get through it.

359
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,420
Very delicious.

360
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,740
I like it very much.

361
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,980
Thank you.

362
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,180
Don't make a sound.

363
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,700
So beautiful!

364
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,340
I didn't mean it.

365
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,420
I didn't mean it.

366
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
Actually, you remember

367
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,500
that night of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

368
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,340
I remember too.

Let me go.

So,

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,500
you understand what I want?

379
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,540
I know.

380
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,860
You want to match Anran with Lady Shen.

381
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,300
Anyone can see

382
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
that they both have feelings
for each other.

383
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,500
Yet not knowing why,

384
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,980
they refuse to make it clear.

385
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,900
They are like this.

386
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,300
What about you?

387
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,860
In fact, ever since the Prince Consort
fell seriously ill,

388
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,900
I have been living each day in a haze.

389
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,740
I have never dared to hope

390
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,380
that there could be someone
in this world

391
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,420
to walk hand in hand with me.

392
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,140
We...

393
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,820
I am flattered,

394
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,820
but unworthy of your favor.

395
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,220
In those years,

396
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,260
you and the Prince Consort got married.

397
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,800
It was a matter of state affairs,

398
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,380
yet not a pleasant matter.

399
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,620
I know this matter has been weighing

400
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,340
on your mind for years.

401
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
But my abilities are limited.

402
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,380
I am by no means the worthy person

403
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,980
who could bring joy to you once again.

404
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,220
So,

405
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
setting aside the chaos of the world,

406
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,300
have you ever,

407
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,940
even for a moment,

408
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,820
had genuine feelings for me?

409
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,780
Please do not make things difficult
for me.

410
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,140
(Lin Yan)

411
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,620
It wasn't written by me.

412
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,820
I didn't ask.

413
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,840
What about these injuries?

414
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,700
It wasn't caused by you yourself?

415
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,940
It wasn't me.

416
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,740
Shen Shaoguang,

417
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,260
are you going to keep enduring

418
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,020
and restraining yourself

419
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,100
in this way?

420
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,980
You obviously have me in your heart.

421
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,460
Why must you do this?

422
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,340
If you are worried

423
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,900
that what I'm doing now
will implicate you all,

424
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,060
I promise,

425
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,900
after the matter is settled,

426
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,060
I will go ask your family.

427
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,940
I will definitely reassure them

428
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,990
and make them agree
for you and me to be together,

429
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,300
alright?

430
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,820
Lin Yan,

431
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,700
you know what?

432
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,480
Actually, I simply

433
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,140
am not someone who is engaged to you.

434
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
My family has never lived in Qingyang.

435
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,660
What are you talking about?

436
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,980
I have been deceiving you all along.

437
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,620
The situation was urgent at the time.

438
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,020
I was afraid you might actually kill us,

439
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,980
so I made up this lie.

440
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,420
Later,

441
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,000
I continued the lie

442
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,640
because I wanted
to take advantage of you

443
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,860
and moved into Yunshui Manor.

444
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,480
I originally thought I could
deceive you for as long as possible.

445
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,020
But this time,

446
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,980
at the border between Qingyang
and Shi'an,

447
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,170
I ran into the person
who truly has been engaged to you,

448
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,380
Lady Zheng.

449
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,860
In the Qingyang accent,

450
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,140
the pronunciation of Shen
and Zheng is similar.

451
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,460
I used this to fool you.

452
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,980
But I am neither blind in heart
nor in eyes.

453
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,100
All along,

454
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,340
how you have treated me

455
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,620
cannot be faked.

456
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,980
Shen Shaoguang,

457
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,700
in your heart, you clearly have...

458
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,540
No.

459
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,980
Never ever.

460
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,140
Mr. Lin,

461
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,780
I impersonated someone else's identity.

462
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,180
I am utterly shameless.

463
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,620
The fiancée your parents hoped

464
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,780
you would take good care of
before they passed away

465
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,100
is someone else.

466
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,780
I am sorry.

467
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,380
I am truly sorry to you.

486
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,780
Shen's Diner reopens after the Chinese New Year

487
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,140
with renovations

488
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,140
and a brand-new menu,

00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,270
Great!

00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,670
That's great.

00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,140

Half price.

496
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,910
Great.

497
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,300
Now I announce

498
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,900

522
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,140
Auspicious Chinese New Year, everyone.

523
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,340
Good luck in the Chinese New Year.

524
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,780
Good luck in the Chinese New Year.

525
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
Lady Shen,

526
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,580
your restaurant is really beautiful.

527
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,180
Thank you. Auspicious Chinese New Year.

528
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,240
Auspicious Chinese New Year.

529
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,420
- So comfortable.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

530
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,620
May everything go as you wish.

531
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,500
Lady Shen,

532
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,560
good luck in the Chinese New Year.

533
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,140
Good luck in the Chinese New Year.

534
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,180
This is modeled
after the palace's Spring Platter,

535
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,780
and is called the Little Spring Platter.

536
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,500
Enjoy your meal.

537
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,260
Lady Shen,

538
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,660
it's just the beginning of spring.

539
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,820
It hasn't warmed up yet.

540
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,700
Where does your restaurant

541
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,420
get so many fresh melons and vegetables?

542
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,100
- Where, Lady Shen?
- Tell us about it.

543
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,770
Temperature control and wind protection.

544
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,020
Only the greenhouse can do it.

545
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,020
Greenhouse?

546
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,780
What is a greenhouse?

547
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,300
Why did she leave?

548
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,260
Manager Liu, Manager Zhao.

549
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,130
Please, please.

550
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,360
- Good fortune
- Good fortune.

551
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,740
Thank you.

552
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,180
- Take your seats.
- Please.

553
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,500
- Take your seats.
- Lady Shen,

554
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,580
we saw the sign outside

555
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,900
listing a specialty dish

556
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,140
called Little Spring Platter.

557
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,990
Could you get us one?

558
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,900
Sure.

559
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,740
Mother,

560
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,370
a portion of Little Spring Platter.

561
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,300
Alright, alright.

562
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,420
Then do it yourselves.

563
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,140
The dishes are coming.

564
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,420
Deyuan, prepare some more vegetables.

565
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,260
Alright.

566
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
The fish for you two.

567
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,990
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks a lot.

568
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,460
Mother, mother, look at me.

569
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,420
Lady Shen.

570
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,100
Happy Chinese New Year.

571
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,500
Your place is really quite unique.

572
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,240
- The kids are willing to play here.
- Yeah.

573
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,020
As long as they like it.

574
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,300
Children,

575
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,460
want to drink soy milk?

576
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,730
- Auntie.
- I want to drink.

577
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,140
I want to drink.

578
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
Yangyang.

579
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,020
I want to drink.

580
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,340
- Line up.
- Be careful.

581
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,380
Look.

582
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,340
These naughty kids

583
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,100
only listen to Yangyang.

584
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,010
Yes.

585
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,380
Come here, children.

586
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,660
Be careful, it's hot.

587
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,860
- Auntie.
- Good girl.

588
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,690
After hearing that I study
in Hongwen Academy,

589
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,860
they all admire me.

590
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,180
Then should you be a good role model

591
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,780
and lead them?

592
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,020
The mentor said
you are a promising talent.

593
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,240
If you can take the right path,

594
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,480
you will achieve great things.

595
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,940
Then next spring,

596
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,020
are you...

597
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,800
I will study hard

598
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,920
and make progress every day.

599
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,940
Be careful, it's hot.

600
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,180
Your master has been busy

601
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,840
for several days with the matter

602
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,220
of relocating the ancestral grave.

603
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,980
It has all been sorted out now, right?

604
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,310
Yes, the Capital Prefecture

605
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,380
issued a new decree stating that

606
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,740
all matters
concerning the common people

607
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,260
- must be resolved in seven days.
- Be careful. So hot.

608
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,350
- In case of dereliction of duty,
- Thank you.

609
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,700
then the people may go beat the drum

610
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,910
to report it to the Prefecture.

611
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,080
This matter in my family

612
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,460
has been delayed for several years.

613
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,180
They all pass the buck to each other.

614
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,220
If it weren't for the decisive actions

615
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,180
of Mr. Lin,

616
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,900
we wouldn't know how it would end.

617
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,500
No wonder everyone praises him.

618
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,940
A rare and admirable official.

619
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,220
Exactly. With him here,

620
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,580
it'll be easier later.

621
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,220
(Capital Prefecture)

622
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,660
- Wait a minute.
- Here.

623
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,700
Mr. Lin will be out soon.

624
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,100
Add some hot water.

625
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,130
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

626
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,060
The Lantern Festival isn't over yet.

627
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,420
Mr. Lin has already dragged me out.

628
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,900
Stop complaining.

629
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,020
I'm telling you,

630
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,860
although I can't read a single word,

631
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,900
I remember clearly

632
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,340
every single word spoken by Mr. Lin.

633
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,100
Matters of the people,
whether big or small,

634
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,990
all should be reported.

635
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,800
Whatever is reported,

636
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,620
it must be resolved.

637
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,460
Look.

638
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,140
All the people of Yong'an praise him.

639
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,990
Even His Majesty speak words
of gold and jade,

640
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,140
praising Mr. Lin as the Zhao Guanghan
of our dynasty.

641
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,110
Think about it.

642
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,500
Since even His Majesty has said so,

643
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,420
from now on,

644
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,900
if anything happens in the Prefecture,

645
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,100
it will be much easier for us

646
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,670
to ask various departments for help.

647
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,980
Well, that's true.

648
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,220
But he hasn't been home

649
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,620
these past few days either,

650
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,000
getting up earlier than the roosters
every day.

651
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,040
It seems to me like

652
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,040
when Wang Laosan divorced his wife,

653
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,120
he could only immerse himself
in official duties.

654
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,350
Don't worry.

655
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,100
Even if it's the Wei family
from Guanzhong,

656
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,860
the Prefecture will never harbor them.

657
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,840
Your farmland

658
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,880
will surely be recovered.

659
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,380
- Thank you, Mr. Lin.
- My pleasure.

660
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,260
Don't talk nonsense.

661
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,420
Indeed.

662
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,300
I haven't seen Mr. Lin's cousin
for a long time.

663
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,200
I'm telling you,

664
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,440
these past few days, Mr. Lin...

665
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,420
Could it be

666
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,740
that...

667
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,380
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

668
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,460
Criticizing your superiors,

669
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,360
what crime should you be charged?

670
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,260
We should be...

671
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,100
Just punish him.

672
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,950
As long as you don't dock my salary,
it's fine.

673
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,540
Mr. Lin, it wasn't me who said that.

674
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,380
Alright.

675
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,820
I'll punish you

676
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,820
to go rest first

677
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,700
and build up strength.

678
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,380
You still have to go with me

679
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,740
to deal with the matter of Mr. Wei
forcibly occupying land.

680
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,620
Really?

681
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,740
Hurry up and go.

682
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

683
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,100
(Candied garlic, Laba garlic)

684
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,500
So beautiful!

685
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,100
Although I still miss my hometown,

686
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,460
after going through so much lately,

687
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,180
I seem to be growing more and more
fond of this place.

688
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,380
There is no curfew
during the Lantern Festival.

689
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,900
It'll be more beautiful
when the city is full of lanterns.

690
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,260
By then,

691
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,060
I'll take you to see it again.

692
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,820
Time really flies.

693
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,620
It's already the Lantern Festival.

694
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,060
Young Master.

695
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,100
Come in.

696
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,060
Young Master.

697
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,340
I found it out.

698
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,180
How is it?

699
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,220
Lady Zheng, as Lady Shen said,

700
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,620
who is truly betrothed to you,

701
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,060
currently resides in Shi'an County.

702
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,140
I went there to inquire.

703
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,990
This Lady Zheng indeed

704
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,540
has moved from Qingyang.

705
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,180
And in the Qingyang dialect,

706
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,700
the pronunciation of Zheng and Shen

707
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,450
is very similar.

708
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,740
That's why the Shen family

709
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,460
could have deceived us for so long.

710
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,380
Young Master,

711
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,780
well...

712
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,340
Let it go.

713
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,820
From now on,

714
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,600
we cut off all dealings
with the Shen family.

715
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,320
We will never fall
for their tricks again.

716
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,860
Today is the Lantern Festival.

717
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,060
It's a holiday.

718
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,660
You have been busy all day.

719
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,740
You haven't eaten, right?

720
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,540
Look what I brought you.

721
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,320
There is no curfew
during the Lantern Festival.

722
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,660
It'll be more beautiful
when the city is full of lanterns.

723
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,340
By then,

724
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,660
I'll take you to see it again.

725
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,580
Look.

726
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,780
It's still warm.

727
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,780
Have a little bite.

728
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,780
Once the official business is done,

729
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,380
let's go to Shi'an first.

730
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,020
Jicai,

731
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,980
why are you still awake?

732
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,060
Did I disturb you?

733
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,820
No, I just got up to use the bathroom.

734
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,380
Have you not been sleeping well

735
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,740
these past few days?

736
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,700
It's fine. I can't sleep anyway.

737
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,620
I'll arrange all the pickles now,

738
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,100
so we can serve it faster tomorrow.

739
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,140
Alright, don't do it.

740
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,460
- It's fine.
- Go back to sleep.

741
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,100
You go to sleep.

742
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:25,980
Give me the knife.

743
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,400
- It's fine.
- Give it to me.

744
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,180
It's fine.

745
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,490
- Hurry up, Jicai.
- Be careful.

746
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,980
Let me have a look.

747
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,980
Jicai,

748
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,500
I can understand you.

749
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,700
As long as you're human,

750
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,300
you'll feel pain

751
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,300
and also need to vent.

752
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,060
But there are many ways to vent.

753
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,540
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

754
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,380
Do you know?

755
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,180
I didn't mean it.

756
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,500
I just thought
of the desensitization method.

757
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,460
When I couldn't let go,

758
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,060
I would just tighten the rope.

759
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,340
People are afraid of pain.

760
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,340
If it hurts, I won't think anymore.

761
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,500
I'm in pain.

762
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,540
I have no backbone.
I still keep thinking about it.

763
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,140
My silly girl.

764
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,220
My silly girl.

765
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,140
Who said you have no backbone?

766
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,100
You like someone so sincerely.

767
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,460
So courageous!

768
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,380
It's a pity.

769
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,660
You have no way.

770
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,740
But you know what,

771
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,580
Jicai?

772
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,740
You are bravely cutting your losses.

773
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,620
You've already done really well.

774
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,380
I'm useless.

775
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,940
Don't cry, don't cry.

776
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,780
Don't cry anymore.

777
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,580
Don't hurt yourself again next time.

778
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,660
Do you know?

779
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,980
Here.

780
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,700
Don't cry, it's OK.

781
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,220
I'm here.

782
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,140
Your crying sounds like water boiling.

783
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,420
Who did you take after?

784
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,740
(Shaoguang's Food Notes)

785
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,920
(Place Yong'an's spring
on the Spring Platter)

786
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,840
(Spring Platter, as the name suggests,
is a platter of spring dishes.)

787
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,330
(Arranging pungent vegetables
in the first lunar month)

788
00:39:43,354 --> 00:39:44,770
(such as scallions and garlic
into a 'Five-Spice Plate')

789
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,680
(is to kill bacteria and detoxify.)

790
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,380
(In Yong'an, at the Beginning of Spring,
there are spring pancakes,)

791
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,970
(along with milder-tasting radishes
and vegetable leaves.)

792
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,180
(As mentioned
in the poem 'Beginning of Spring',)

793
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,510
(the spring platter
features tender fresh greens.)

794
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,210
(As spring begins, the salad
is becoming more and more delicious.)

795
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,180
(By today, the companions
to the spring pancakes have increased.)

796
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,700
(No preference between meat
or vegetables, hot or cold,)

797
00:39:56,724 --> 00:39:58,724
(just wrap whatever tastes good.)
