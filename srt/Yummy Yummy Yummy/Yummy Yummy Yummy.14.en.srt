=Episode 14=

3
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,740
(Yide Hall)

4
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,180
(Li Xu, Crown Prince)

5
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,620
(Not confined to one aspect,
excluding dissenters)

6
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,260
(Zhao Xunzhi, Grand Tutor)

7
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,690
Take a seat.

8
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,660
The Crown Prince started to learn early.

9
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,620
Now, he also has

10
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,980
his own unique insights.

11
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,700
His Majesty must be pleased.

12
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,780
Congratulations.

13
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,830
Today, let's end it here.

14
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,420
Zhao Xunzhi

15
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,220
has long spoken of retiring,

16
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,260
but he still teaches in Hongwen Academy.

17
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,740
When I see him,

18
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,940
I even have to call him Grand Tutor.

19
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Xu,

20
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,900
talk to your father

21
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,220
and let the Vice Prefect teach you.

22
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,580
He is young

23
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,100
and talented.

24
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,300
You'll learn more from him.

25
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,740
Aunt,

26
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,220
Mr. Lin was summoned to the Capital.

27
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,700
Father has his own plans for him.

28
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,100
Mr. Zhao is quite good as a teacher.

29
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,020
But why have you

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,120
been mentioning Mr. Lin so often lately?

31
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,300
In the Capital,

32
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,980
there are only two people

33
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,020
whom I can regard as confidants.

34
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,180
Lin Yan

35
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,100
is one of them.

36
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,900
Father and you

37
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,660
both appreciate him so much.

38
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,300
He must have extraordinary qualities.

39
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,620
(The Princess favors Mr. Lin.)

40
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,820
Have Anran see me asap.

41
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,760
Yes.

42
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,820
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

43
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,820
The Prince is so urgent

44
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,720
in calling me back.

45
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,820
What's wrong?

46
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,060
Please go in quickly.

47
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,740
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

48
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,820
I was worried along the way

49
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,080
and changed horses three times.

50
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,900
Yet you're still drinking tea.

51
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,100
Anran,

52
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,340
I've been brewing this tea for a while,

53
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,500
waiting for you to drink it.

54
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,940
Take a sip first.

55
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,460
Actually, it's not

56
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,860
an urgent matter at all.

57
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,860
I've heard

58
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,780
that the Princess favors you.

59
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,340
Why not become a close attendant

60
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,860
to the Princess?

61
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,400
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

62
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,420
You look so scared.

63
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,380
It's alright.

64
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,100
Why are you so shocked to hear this?

65
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,180
Let me tell you.

66
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,100
When you were a child and sick,

67
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,340
you vomited all over me.

68
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,900
I took care of it myself.

69
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,300
Spitting tea is nothing.

70
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,580
Yes.

71
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,180
You've indeed been a savior

72
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,460
to me.

73
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,940
Don't say that.

74
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,620
You're alone in the Capital now.

75
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,460
I can't help you,

76
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,100
but the Princess can.

77
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,460
If you marry her,

78
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,930
you may not have a promising future,

79
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,380
but you don't have to.

80
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,780
If you two are together,

81
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,940
she can help your career.

82
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,620
I understand your intentions,

83
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,980
but doing this

84
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,580
would belittle both me

85
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,380
and the Princess.

86
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,980
It's not that serious.

87
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,580
Now, many girls in the Capital

88
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,460
want to marry you,

89
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,220
but if you keep refusing,

90
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,740
they won't find you attractive

91
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,380
when you're old.

92
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,700
Here's what I think.

93
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,340
Just go along with the Princess.

94
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,540
If she really likes you...

95
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,020
I've already found out for you

96
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,140
that Wei Xiangqin,
Military Commissioner,

97
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,900
will be the Minister of War,

98
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,780
and Song Fangxu, Imperial Attendant,

99
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,340
will be the Vice Minister of War.

100
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,570
The Princess told you that?

101
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,980
I've said it before.

102
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,460
You're indeed

103
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,700
good-looking.

104
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,060
The Princess...

105
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,660
Why suddenly take an interest

106
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,380
in the appointment
to the Ministry of War?

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,860
Here's the thing.

108
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,740
Guo Pingxu,

109
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,100
the former Minister of War,
is my friend.

110
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,700
He is now on a mission abroad

111
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,900
and is worried about his position
when he returns.

112
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,140
So,

113
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,980
he asked me to find out.

114
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,900
In fact,

115
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,500
the official world is like this.

116
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,820
You know,

117
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,940
His Majesty chose Guo Pingxu,

118
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,140
and now he is dissatisfied,

119
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,780
so he gives him a promotion
that is actually a demotion.

120
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,180
That's why I hope you

121
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,340
can find a patron in the Capital.

122
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,540
The former Minister of War

123
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,140
was chosen by my sixth brother.

124
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,380
The Emperor and I dislike him.

125
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,220
Thank you for your concern.

126
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,540
Since I have to work tomorrow,

127
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,700
I won't stay longer.

128
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,800
Take care of your health.

129
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,740
The water quality in the Capital
is not good.

130
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,540
Come back often to have a cup of tea.

131
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,260
Goodbye.

132
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,900
(Complete and Bright)

133
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,060
(Complete and Bright)

134
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,460
(Capital Prefecture)

135
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,900
Anran.

136
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,740
Mr. Pei, why are you here?

137
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,300
The Shens often send you

138
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,780
delicious food that they make.

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,410
So, I came to share with you,

140
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,700
but unexpectedly...

141
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,080
This...

142
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,340
What do you mean?

143
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,020
Your Highness.

144
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,670
I have just returned from Leyou Plateau.

145
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,140
I passed by the Prefecture

146
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,680
and thought I'd drop by.

147
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,820
Be careful of the steps.

148
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,980
Don't fall.

149
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,340
I've obtained some Jiannan Wine,

150
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,860
and I'd like to share it with Mr. Lin

151
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,860
and Mr. Pei tonight.

152
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,820
Come here.

153
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,180
Yangyang.

154
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,380
We must stop our ancestor

155
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,020
from going.

156
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,180
Why?

157
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,700
Don't ask why.

158
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,340
Have you seen it on TV at home?

159
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,300
Those social news reports.

160
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,380
Can you pretend

161
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,940
to be foolish or sick?

162
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,860
You can? Good. Come on.

163
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,100
- My goodness.
- Help!

164
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,940
It hurts.

165
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,060
- Grandpa.
- Yangyang?

166
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,720
Grandpa.

167
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,200
My leg is broken.

168
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,460
Uncle, Yangyang.

169
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,180
It hurts so much.

170
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,620
- Grandpa, it hurts.
- Uncle.

171
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,700
My goodness.

172
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,660
I can't live like this.

173
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,940
How disgraceful.

174
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,380
Uncle, are you alright?

175
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,230
It hurts too much.

176
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,660
I can't bear it.

177
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,520
Yangyang, Uncle.

178
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,460
Mr. Pei, it's not good.

179
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,420
Come and help.

180
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,940
Uncle, are you alright?

181
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,340
- What's going on?
- Uncle, here.

182
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,100
Come on, slowly.

183
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,920
Where are you hurt?

184
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,220
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

185
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,940
- Where are you hurt?
- Where are you hurt?

186
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,340
This injury is serious.

187
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,260
We need to take them to the clinic asap.

188
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,660
Yes, to the clinic.

189
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,140
Hurry up.

190
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,990
Let's go.

191
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,340
Stop.

192
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,340
Mr. Lin, Mr. Pei,

193
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,020
you don't want to join me,

194
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,900
so you went along

195
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,740
with their act, right?

196
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,740
Of course not.

197
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,980
Your Highness, please calm down.

198
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,340
It's an honor to receive

199
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,660
your invitation.

200
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,180
How could we possibly decline?

201
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,420
How could they know

202
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,020
about tonight's banquet

203
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,680
and thus deceive you?

204
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,540
Yes.

205
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,380
How about this?

206
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,620
Anran will take them

207
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,860
to the clinic for treatment.

208
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,180
I will attend

209
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,220
the banquet tonight

210
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,620
and drink with you as much as you want.

211
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,180
In that case,

212
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,940
it shall be settled.

213
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,740
My goodness.

214
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,980
I was so scared.

215
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,420
You're scared? Really?

216
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,940
After all, it's the Princess.

217
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,620
Moreover, I could tell

218
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,260
you didn't want to go.

219
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,660
Thank you.

220
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,820
Go back.

221
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,980
I'll take the food box back

222
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,980
after I finish.

223
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,620
Alright, let's go.

224
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,770
Yangyang, come on.

225
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,320
Come on.

226
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,460
Your Highness.

227
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,460
How is it?

228
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,840
Mr. Lin's interaction with officials

229
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,960
has been as usual recently,

230
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,820
but he's been particularly close

231
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,220
to Pei Fei, a censor.

232
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,620
I have found out

233
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,620
that he is simple

234
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,860
from a humble background.

235
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,380
Anran always makes friends this way,

236
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,180
treating everyone equally,
regardless of their status.

237
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,540
By the way,

238
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,300
how has his relationship

239
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,580
with the Princess been?

240
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,540
He's been avoiding her.

241
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,700
A few days ago,

242
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,380
Mr. Lin prepared gifts for officials
for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

243
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,740
Even the Vice Minister of Justice,

244
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,600
with whom he had no dealings,
received a gift.

245
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,180
But none for the Princess.

246
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,340
The Vice Minister of Justice.

247
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,780
Is it Cao Rong?

248
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,260
Yes.

249
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,500
(Shen's Diner)

250
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,900
This is the place you talked about?

251
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,260
It's far worse
than your Guixiang Tavern.

252
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,420
Don't underestimate

253
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,900
this place.

254
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,340
It used to be a stall
at the alley entrance,

255
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,340
and even then, business was good.

256
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,980
Now it can even host

257
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,640
the Princess's Qixi Poetry Gathering.

258
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,260
(Second Master Huan, scholar)
Lady Shen

259
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,740
is very ingenious in cooking.

260
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,780
Even the Princess praised her highly.

261
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,380
Is the Princess

262
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,900
someone worth respecting?

263
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,980
A woman,

264
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,220
gathering many attendants.

265
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,690
She's immoral and unprincipled.

266
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,520
Be careful with your words.

267
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,940
Sirs, what would you like to eat?

268
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,260
(Menu)

269
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,340
What is this?

270
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,260
A menu.

271
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,180
Our dishes

272
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,860
are listed on this sheet by category.

273
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,940
So, it's called a menu.

274
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,660
(Agate Meat)

275
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,000
(Everyman's Joy)
How ingenious.

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,020
(Bad smell but good taste)

277
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,060
(Fragrant Crisp)
I'll have

278
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,220
one of each of these dishes.

279
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,420
(Favored by God of Wealth)

280
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,180
What is this?

281
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,920
My notebook.

282
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,660
A good memory is
not as good as a bad pen.

283
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,340
This way, I won't get the dishes wrong.

284
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,380
(Favored by God of Wealth)

285
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,500
You seem a bit frivolous.

286
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,180
The sash around your waist

287
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,580
can even be casually tugged by a man.

288
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,220
(Favored by God of Wealth)

289
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,660
What else would you like?

290
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,620
This menu

291
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,620
seems to lack

292
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,220
(Mountain Delicacies Pot)
wine and pepper-flavored snacks.

293
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,500
The poetry gathering used

294
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,040
to be handled by Guixiang Tavern.

295
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,000
Yet the Princess
entrusted it to you this time.

296
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,930
I was puzzled,

297
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,180
but after tasting your food,

298
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,220
I am truly convinced.

299
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,940
Oh, it was you.

300
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,540
No wonder you looked familiar.

301
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,700
You still remember the snacks you had

302
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,300
at the last poetry gathering?

303
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,140
I'll give you two portions then.

304
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,140
Lady Shen,

305
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,860
what kind of snacks are these?

306
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,420
Give us some, too.

307
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,140
Sure, they'll be out in a bit.

308
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,460
Alright.

309
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,340
You're so good at this.

310
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,300
I am Liu Feng,

311
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,420
the third in my family.

312
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,820
Just call me Feng.

313
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,660
Mr. Liu, nice to meet you.

314
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,620
Please, take a seat.

315
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,540
Are you the owner of this diner?

316
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,140
This diner is run by my family and me.

317
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,100
With family around,

318
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,860
why bother to be a waitress yourself?

319
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,540
Will you still be able to get married?

320
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,660
Mr. Huan,

321
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,680
stop it.

322
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,930
I'm sorry, Lady Shen.

323
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,620
It's alright.

324
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,380
Sir,

325
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,260
marriage,

326
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,300
clothing and food.

327
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,180
If you taste the dishes from my diner,

328
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,700
you'll know I can afford clothes

329
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,540
and enjoy good meals.

330
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,950
I'm not in a hurry to get married.

331
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,020
Your frivolous reputation is set,

332
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,140
yet you're not in a hurry?

333
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,340
Perhaps even your family

334
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,580
will be talked about.

335
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,420
Mr. Huan.

336
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,540
I behave properly
and run my business legitimately.

337
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,820
If someone thinks I'm frivolous,

338
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,260
it's because they have a dirty mind.

339
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,780
Sir, you're so rude,

340
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,260
unlike someone from a noble family

341
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,340
or someone
who can pass the imperial exams.

342
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,820
You should focus on self-cultivation.

343
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,740
Mr. Huan.

344
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,620
You look like a hag,

345
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,640
and your temper is so bad.

346
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,460
I will never step foot
in such a diner again.

347
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,820
- Mr. Huan.
- You're the ugly one.

348
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,720
After a thousand years,

349
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,500
many people will think I'm beautiful.

350
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,580
You have no vision at all.

351
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,500
Lady Shen's mouth

352
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,980
- Lady Shen.
- never spares anyone.

353
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,060
Let's eat.

354
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,020
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,780
Mr. Huan is such a stickler,

356
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,940
but I didn't expect

357
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,940
that he'd say such nonsense.

358
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
From now on,

359
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,920
I will never associate with him again.

360
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,740
I drove away your friend

361
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,220
and put you in an awkward position,

362
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,340
but you don't blame me?

363
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,100
Mr. Huan's rude words

364
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,940
deserved a lesson.

365
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,020
Moreover, I am a businessman.

366
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,000
I understand one thing:

367
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,420
If others have targeted me

368
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,380
and I don't fight back,

369
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
my business

370
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,700
can't go on.

371
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,380
I've heard

372
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,780
about your innovative stir-frying.

373
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,360
Compared to steaming and boiling,

374
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,860
it adds another layer of fragrance.

375
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,020
Stir-frying

376
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,580
can use the high temperature in the oil

377
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,420
to remove the juices

378
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,660
from vegetables and fresh meat,

379
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,260
making the texture crispy,

380
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,400
so it will be more fragrant.

381
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,540
To make stir-fried dishes,

382
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,740
one must use an iron pot.

383
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,460
You have no reservations.

384
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,860
I'm impressed.

385
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
To be honest,

386
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,860
I've also learned from Guixiang Tavern.

387
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,640
Guixiang Tavern is elegant and simple,

388
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,060
quiet amidst the hustle and bustle.

389
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,020
Guests sit around
without appearing disorderly.

390
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,460
It seems you have

391
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,980
a good understanding of the layout.

392
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,140
(Shen's Diner)

393
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,620
I've hosted so many banquets
to invite Mr. Lin,

394
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,780
but he never came.

395
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,620
I was wondering why he came today.

396
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,880
You

397
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,120
failed the exams repeatedly,

398
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
so I wanted to ask Mr. Lin

399
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,100
what the court's criteria are
for officials.

400
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,540
But he told me

401
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,760
the court values scholars

402
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,220
who are cautious

403
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,660
in speech and action.

404
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,620
I went out and found out

405
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,420
that you offended Lady Shen.

406
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,140
Who in the Capital doesn't know

407
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,380
that the Shen family

408
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,700
and Mr. Lin are relatives?

409
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,740
Uncle,

410
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,780
I'm busy studying.

411
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,700
Where would I learn about that?

412
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,420
You're just a distant relative
from Xiangzhou.

413
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,100
If not for your father,

414
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,700
how could you stay here
to take the exams?

415
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,380
How dare you offend the Vice Prefect?

416
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,230
Tomorrow,

417
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,820
go and apologize to Lady Shen.

418
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,020
As a scholar,

419
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,760
how can I apologize to a tavern girl?

420
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,540
Whatever you are,

421
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,340
you must go and apologize.

422
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,020
You look down on tavern girls?

423
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,780
She's more accomplished than you.

424
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,020
She earns everything

425
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,420
on her own.

426
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,320
What about you?

427
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,220
You're still living under my roof.

428
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,060
How could you say that to me?

429
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,340
Isn't it all because of Lin Yan?

430
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,060
Am I afraid of him?

431
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,500
Lady Shen, I'm sorry.

432
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,860
Yesterday, I was drunk

433
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,220
and said that nonsense.

434
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,580
(Shen's Diner)
Please accept

435
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,180
these small gifts.

436
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,420
Please forgive me.

437
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,300
If you're no longer angry,

438
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,620
please send a message to Mr. Lin.

439
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,700
Tell him I'm grateful for his teachings

440
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,820
and will always remember them.

441
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,540
Mr. Lin?

442
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,940
Yes.

443
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,500
That's what I wanted to say.

444
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
You must be busy,

445
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
so I won't disturb you.

446
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,420
(Shen's Diner)

447
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,180
Didn't you come to apologize to me?

448
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,980
You brought so many gifts

449
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,820
and took them away
after showing them to me?

450
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,020
What a cunning and bad man.

451
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,580
Why is it you today?

452
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,980
I want to thank you in person.

453
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,380
Mr. Huan caused trouble,

454
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,180
and you spoke up for me, right?

455
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,740
Yesterday, the food box

456
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,220
was left at the diner's entrance.

457
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,690
You clearly came.

458
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,860
Why didn't you go in?

459
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,460
You were talking happily

460
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,840
with the owner of Guixiang Tavern.

461
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,540
I didn't want to disturb you.

462
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,180
Guixiang Tavern is doing very well,

463
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,180
so I thought I should

464
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,860
take the chance to learn some secrets.

465
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,380
Speaking of which, Mr. Liu

466
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,060
is not quite what I thought.

467
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,040
I originally thought

468
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,320
that a rich boy like him would be

469
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,500
very hard to get along with,

470
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,820
but he is not only kind

471
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,060
but also clear-headed.

472
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,460
A rich boy?

473
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,540
It means his parents are rich

474
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,380
and can protect him,

475
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
so he's a rich boy.

476
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,640
Speaking of which,

477
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,760
the Lius are an old, wealthy family.

478
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,220
Mr. Liu's family is well-off,

479
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,060
and he's handsome.

480
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,260
There must be quite a few young ladies

481
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,600
in Yong'an who like him.

482
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,060
What's wrong with you?

483
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,340
Has the fish meat

484
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,660
gone bad?

485
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,700
Is it sour?

486
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,940
I'm just not used to vinegar.

487
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,990
I forgot to say.

488
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,100
This is Vinegar Cabbage.

489
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,300
Vinegar used to be fine.

490
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,060
Why afraid of sourness today?

491
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,340
What's wrong?

492
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,620
A fish bone got stuck.

493
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,660
I swallowed it.

494
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,020
Lady Shen is trying
to murder her husband.

495
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,980
Mr. Pei,

496
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,380
our engagement has been canceled.

497
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,660
Don't speak nonsense

498
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,970
and tarnish her reputation.

499
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,820
Canceled?

500
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,900
Yes.

501
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,750
Why?

502
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,100
Recently, many censors
have been wondering

503
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,840
why you ordered so many mooncakes

504
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,060
from Shen's Diner

505
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,660
and reprimanded Mr. Huan.

506
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,300
Some even asked me

507
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,100
if you were to marry Lady Shen.

508
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,220
I couldn't say

509
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,940
that you two were engaged,

510
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,060
so I came to ask you

511
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,660
how I should respond,

512
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,100
yet you told me this news.

513
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,180
The censors are just too idle,

514
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,580
gossiping about these things.

515
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,980
You can't say that.

516
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,540
The Censorate is supposed to report
based on hearsay.

517
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,420
Besides,
you are the focus of the censors.

518
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,060
Why?

519
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,140
Of course.

520
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,300
You see,

521
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,340
you are upright,

522
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,620
your career is smooth,

523
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,540
and you're good-looking.

524
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,020
You're just a bit older for marriage.

525
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,420
In the Censorate,

526
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,300
who wouldn't want

527
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,780
to marry their sister to you?

528
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,540
I don't think

529
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,540
you want to break off the engagement.

530
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,580
I told you so.

531
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,900
If you like her,

532
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,260
you should say it.

533
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,380
With your cold attitude,

534
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,660
how would Lady Shen know you like her?

535
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,710
If you say it,

536
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,640
she will understand.

537
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,020
You'd still be engaged then.

538
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,460
Stop. What nonsense.

539
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,220
You're just like this.

540
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,900
You always

541
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,940
overthink everything.

542
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,500
I'm warning you.

543
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,860
If you miss out on Lady Shen,

544
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,620
you'll regret it in the future.

545
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,020
You two

546
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,940
are a good match.

547
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,940
It's mutual affection,

548
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,780
not like a forced marriage,

549
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,940
which is never sweet.

550
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,380
You sound

551
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
like you're being coerced

552
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,900
into a marriage.

553
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,860
Me?

554
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,360
There's no such thing.

555
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,220
No one would like me.

556
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,300
Mr. Lin,

557
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,760
Mr. Pei,

558
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,620
the Princess sent me

559
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,660
to invite you two

560
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,060
to the mansion today

561
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,620
to compose poetry.

562
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,340
Didn't I just go yesterday?

563
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,940
Why are you here again?

564
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,660
Please tell the Princess...

565
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,660
Thank her for her favor,

566
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,260
but I have to write memorials today

567
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,340
and don't have time to go.

568
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,860
The Princess anticipated that

569
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,860
and prepared a banquet
for tomorrow evening,

570
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,060
waiting for you both.

571
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,250
I still...

572
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,420
How considerate.

573
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,100
Yet I have documents to review tomorrow.

574
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,980
As a censor,

575
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,220
I should prioritize public duties.

576
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,540
I can't go.

577
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,820
It's a pity.

578
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,340
I hope the Princess will understand.

579
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,940
Me too.

580
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,500
I hope the Princess will understand.

581
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,940
Since you insist,

582
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,900
I won't disturb you further.

583
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,940
I notice that you seem

584
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,900
particularly afraid to see the Princess.

585
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,980
Did something happen yesterday

586
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,500
when you were drinking?

587
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,380
No.

588
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,260
You don't want to see the Princess.

589
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,660
You don't want to do that,

590
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,620
so I made up an excuse.

591
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,380
It's true.

592
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,180
Your Highness,

593
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,100
Mr. Lin and Mr. Pei claimed to be busy

594
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,060
and couldn't make it today or tomorrow.

595
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,520
It doesn't matter.

596
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,140
The cakes from Guixiang Tavern

597
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,920
are too sweet.

598
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,370
I'm starting to miss

599
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,260
the meals from Shen's Diner.

600
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,700
Go and invite Lady Shen here

601
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,420
to cook a meal for me.

602
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,580
Yes.

603
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,660
Some people don't like

604
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,300
poetry or flowers,

605
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,860
but food and sex

606
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,380
are in human nature.

607
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,980
If I cater to their preferences,

608
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,860
they will come eventually.

609
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,700
You're a guest.

610
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,220
Please.

611
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,980
We are close friends.

612
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,980
No need for this.

613
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,340
Anran,

614
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,620
you

615
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,300
go ahead.

616
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,060
Even among close friends,

617
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,800
there are still rules of hospitality.

618
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,040
Mr. Pei, please.

619
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,900
No, no.

620
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,660
Anran, you go first.

621
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,900
Mr. Pei, you go first.

622
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,740
You go ahead.

623
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,780
You go ahead.

624
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,860
Young Master, Mr. Pei,

625
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,820
the Princess sent a message,

626
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,660
inviting you two to have a meal.

627
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,580
We already declined at noon.

628
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,660
Tell the messenger

629
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,420
that we are discussing official business

630
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,340
and

631
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,740
have already eaten.

632
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,340
Yes, we are eating right now.

633
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,540
But the Princess invited

634
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,100
Lady Shen to prepare the evening meal.

635
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,870
- Prepare the horse.
- Yes.

636
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,660
Mr. Pei, let's go together.

637
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,460
No, I won't go.

638
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,780
I just remembered

639
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,980
I have guests at home.

640
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,180
I have to go back right away.

641
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,020
You have to go.

642
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,140
I won't go.

643
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:08,980
You have to go.

644
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,740
If you want to go, go by yourself.

645
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,300
You won't go?

646
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,740
Do you really not fear the Princess?

647
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,820
I don't want to see her.

648
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,980
I'm not afraid of her.

649
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,140
- Go with me.
- No.

650
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,460
- You have to go.
- I...

651
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,540
I won't go, no matter what.

652
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,580
She won't eat you.

653
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,780
Still, I won't go.

654
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,320
Can you bear to leave me alone

655
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,160
to face the Princess?

656
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,720
Yes.

657
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,220
If you want to go, go by yourself.

658
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,740
I won't go.

659
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,180
Anran, Anran.

660
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,500
Put me down, Anran.

661
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,820
Put me down.

662
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,660
Are you even human?

663
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,300
Are you even human?

664
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,340
(Capital Prefecture)

665
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,300
Lady Shen.

666
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,980
Eating alone is so boring.

667
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,060
Why don't you

668
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,340
stay and have a meal with me?

669
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

670
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,340
I would be delighted.

671
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,620
But I haven't finished

672
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,500
the melon wine yet.

673
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,540
How about I make it here,

674
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,100
so I can talk with you?

675
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,940
That'd be great.

676
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,980
Mr. Lin and Mr. Pei are here.

677
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,980
Mr. Lin and Mr. Pei will join us?

678
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

679
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

680
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,140
Mr. Pei and I couldn't decline anymore

681
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,620
and finished our official duties.

682
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,900
We're here to apologize.

683
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,620
Mr. Pei and I...

684
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,900
Mr. Lin and I

685
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,540
are here to apologize.

686
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,740
Join us for a meal.

687
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,020
Thanks, Your Highness.

688
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,800
Your Highness,

689
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,160
I've already eaten.

690
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,540
Then eat again.

691
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,740
(The Princess asked me to cook)

692
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,180
(because of the ancestor?)

693
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,260
(Wait a minute.)

694
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,820
(What if she knows)

695
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,420
(about the fake engagement between us?)

696
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,020
(Will she target me?)

697
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,580
Lady Shen,

698
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,860
I heard that you are Mr. Lin's cousin,

699
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,060
but you seem

700
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,940
quite a match to me.

701
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,100
You must be joking.

702
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,820
Between Mr. Lin and me,

703
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,660
it's just mutual care among relatives.

704
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,380
I don't deserve Mr. Lin.

705
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,620
That's not true.

706
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,300
I don't think Lin Anran would mind.

707
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,420
He would.

708
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,340
I mean,

709
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,920
Mr. Lin should be with a young lady

710
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,060
who is well-born, well-read,

711
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,060
and good-looking.

712
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,000
If he chose someone not good enough,

713
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,480
I'd mind on his behalf.

714
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,140
So,

715
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,700
what do you think

716
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,820
is good enough

717
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,500
and what is not good enough?

718
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,300
Take me, for example.

719
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,340
How do you see me?

720
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,100
You're a top-notch beauty,

721
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,700
and should be with a man

722
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,840
who is well-born, well-read,

723
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,500
and good-looking.

724
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,540
I am not

725
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,260
a match at all.

726
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,220
Moreover,

727
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,580
I already have someone I admire.

728
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,180
No wonder you

729
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,220
always refuse my invitations.

730
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,320
You think I'm interested...

731
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,580
You all think I'm interested

732
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,260
in Mr. Lin?

733
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,220
Mr. Pei.

734
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,220
Pei,

735
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,140
who do you think

736
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,740
I want to see?

737
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,580
Who?

738
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,700
Then let me tell you again.

739
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,820
At the Qixi Poetry Gathering,

740
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,220
it was the first time I saw Mr. Pei.

741
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,180
That day,

742
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,300
the way he played the guqin

743
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,700
was elegant and unrestrained

744
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,940
like a Wei-Jin scholar.

745
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,580
How charming.

746
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,620
From then on,

747
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,580
my eyes could no longer

748
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,500
tolerate anyone else.

749
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,780
People say Ruan Ji secluded himself

750
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,500
and played Wine Mad

751
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,820
to express his inner distress,

752
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,140
but I think

753
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,580
he was truly willing

754
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,540
to forget his worries in wine.

755
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,260
But this man in front of me

756
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,660
is the one who played Wine Mad

757
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,580
with the right spirit.

758
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,980
You know my feelings,

759
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,020
yet you always avoid me.

760
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,740
My husband is seriously ill,

761
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,420
and I have to take care of him
until the end,

762
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,300
but I don't want to neglect myself.

763
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,420
Yet, Mr. Pei always avoids me.

764
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,980
When he came to drink yesterday,

765
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,820
he was afraid to say anything.

766
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,060
I had no choice

767
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,500
but to try to get close to you

768
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,460
through Mr. Lin.

769
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,740
I even invited Lady Shen here.

770
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,140
I didn't expect

771
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,940
to cause a misunderstanding.

772
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,900
Anran,

773
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,020
from now on,

774
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,500
you should visit me more often.

775
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,500
You can even

776
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,340
bring friends along.

777
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,340
It was my presumption

778
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,620
that caused the misunderstanding.

779
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,540
Yes, it was a misunderstanding.

780
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,220
Your Highness,

781
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,620
you misunderstood me.

782
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,060
Mr. Pei,

783
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,180
my feelings for you

784
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,250
are not a misunderstanding.

785
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,900
One day,

786
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,460
I will make you understand.

787
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,020
(So, the Princess
has her eye on Mr. Pei.)

788
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,940
(The Shen family is safe for now.)

789
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,540
(But the ancestor said
he had someone he admired.)

790
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,700
(Who could it be?)

791
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,380
(The female ancestor
hasn't made an appearance yet.)

792
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,380
Cosmetics and powders!

793
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,420
Thanks to you for relaxing the curfew.

794
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,060
Even though the sun has set,

795
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,380
the market is still bustling.

796
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,660
You've done such a great job.

797
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,620
Why suddenly praise me?

798
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,380
I'm being grateful, okay?

799
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,860
You've been so kind

800
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:03,720
to our family.

801
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,820
I can't do much in return,

802
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,740
but I can at least give you
emotional value.

803
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,580
Emotional value?

804
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,340
You mean to flatter me?

805
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,860
I just want to make you happy.

806
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,180
Besides, in Juxian Alley,

807
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,940
everyone's praising you.

808
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,620
The manager of the clothing shop

809
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,780
says you are
the best capital official in history.

810
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,180
The cloth seller says

811
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,380
you truly consider
the people's interests.

812
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,460
The young man of the bookshop says

813
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,940
you are the best-looking official.

814
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,380
What is all this about?

815
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,700
Have you eaten enough just now?

816
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,300
Do you want to buy some food?

817
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,340
I'm full.

818
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,740
It was so interesting just now.

819
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,700
The drama's made me full.

820
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,220
The drama?

821
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,980
Laugh if you want to.

822
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,140
So, you also have moments of narcissism,

823
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,780
thinking that the Princess likes you.

824
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,140
Narcissism?

825
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,940
It doesn't sound like a good word.

826
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,280
Take a look.

827
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,220
I don't want it.

828
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,580
In the Western Regions,

829
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,180
a man saw his peerless beauty

830
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,180
in the reflection in the water.

831
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,980
Then, he neither ate nor drank,

832
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,620
just admired himself by the shore,

833
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,900
and turned into a narcissus.

834
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,500
That's narcissism.

835
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,220
But just now, you said

836
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,740
that you have someone you admire.

837
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,580
Is it true?

838
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,220
Yes.

839
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,980
Excuse me.

840
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,900
Be careful.

841
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,820
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

842
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,780
Thank you.

843
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,540
You just said you have
someone you admire.

844
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,060
Can I ask who it is?

845
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,820
I didn't finish.

846
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,660
I mean,

847
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,540
I made it up.

848
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,060
Could you not stop there?

849
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,940
It's quite startling.

850
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,980
However,

851
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,300
you were so quick-witted,

852
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,740
finding an excuse so soon.

853
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,700
That way,

854
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,500
the Princess can't force you.

855
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,060
But your narcissism this time

856
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,240
can't be entirely your fault.

857
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,580
What the Princess did

858
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,380
was indeed quite misleading.

859
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,980
Next time, I'll learn my lesson

860
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,620
and won't be narcissistic again.

861
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,100
As long as the other party

862
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,740
hasn't said they like you,

863
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,060
it doesn't count.

864
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,140
Remember that.

865
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,590
When you're out there,

866
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,020
you must take good care of yourself.

00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,150
