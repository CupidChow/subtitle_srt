Councilor Kang

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,520
will announce the winner

5
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,480
of this year's Competition.

Congratulations

(Jinxiu Tavern Shen's Diner)
to Hermit Suxin

00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,450
(Guixiang Tavern Yunlai Tavern)
for

9
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,260
(Yuelai Tavern Laywoman Suxin)
becoming the Winner.

10
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,770
(Ruifu Tavern)
You are well-deserved.

11
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,190
Universally acknowledged.

12
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:13,040
Bravo!

13
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,710
- Grandpa.
- Yangyang.

14
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,990
Grandpa.

15
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,120
Gently, gently.

16
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,990
Sorry, Grandpa.

17
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,800
It's OK.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,440
I knew it wouldn't be so easy
to become the Culinary Master.

19
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,700
But Grandpa,

20
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,310
you are the Culinary Master in my heart.

21
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,660
The Culinary Master in our hearts.

22
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,920
Really?

23
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,440
I am the Culinary Master in your heart?

24
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,310
Yeah.

25
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,850
It's the same in Grandma's heart, right?

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,920
Yes, you're the smartest one.

27
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,550
Let's quickly tidy up

28
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,710
and go to the clinic.

29
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
We don't have to.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,960
I mean it. It will still cost money.

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,200
I'm fine.

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
We have to go.

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
Listen to me.

34
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,710
OK.

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,040
Listen to you.

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,270
(Culinary Master Competition)
Prince Zhao

37
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,590
insisted on appointing that Li Ang
as the heir apparent.

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,530
My brother also asked me
to return to the palace,

39
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,580
causing me to miss the chance
to watch the Competition.

40
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,030
Stop right there.

41
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,640
Didn't you come here

42
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,120
to watch the Competition?

43
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,150
Why

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
did you hide whenever you see me?

45
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,990
If you want to avoid me, that's fine.

46
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,400
You don't need to run.

47
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,710
I order you

48
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,430
to get lost.

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,800
Useless!

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,400
I don't even know

51
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,520
what I saw in you.

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,990
I have never had anything

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,500
worthy of your attention.

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,030
Now you finally understand

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,360
and have completely lost regard for me.

56
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,150
Pretty good.

57
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,840
You two couples

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
are really quite a perfect match.

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,640
Grandfather,

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,990
eat more food.

61
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,590
Alright.

62
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,070
(My grandfather wants to match me
with Mr. Lin,)

63
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,090
(and still insists on keeping us
for a meal.)

64
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,510
(What a pain!)

65
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,720
(Shen Shaoguang, why did you walk
so slowly?)

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,360
(What a sin!)

67
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,920
(This calamity)

68
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,120
(is destined to occur in my life.)

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,120
(Why aren't they saying anything?)

70
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,660
(Lin Anran, how did you manage
in the official circles?)

71
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,280
(Show off your eloquence.)

72
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,270
Lady Shen,

73
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
how is your father's hand?

74
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,750
It's fine, he has already seen a doctor.

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,640
That's good.

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
Feng,

77
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
you care about Lady Shen like this,

78
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,750
yet you don't let your grandfather

79
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,550
go propose marriage as soon as possible.

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,750
(Quick, slap me in my face.)

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,990
(How on earth did this man
become the chancellor?)

82
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,310
(The world really)

83
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,600
(is a huge makeshift troupe.)

84
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,240
(Oh, my grandfather...)

85
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,350
You all...

86
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,070
Father.

87
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,440
Yangyang.

88
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,150
Yangyang.

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,160
I miss you so much.

90
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,880
Yangyang.

91
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,870
It hurts.

92
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,630
If you don't come back,

93
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,040
I just won't want you anymore.

94
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,950
Yangyang,

95
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,800
I was wrong.

96
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,030
I was wrong.

97
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,270
I was wrong.

98
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,960
Don't cry anymore.

99
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,550
I won't leave.

100
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,590
Mother.

101
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Father.

102
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,960
Shaojie,

103
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,070
how did you end up looking like this?

104
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,870
- I...
- You finally come back.

105
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,310
Do you know these past days

106
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,120
how your mother and I have been living?

107
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,990
- Father...
- You little brat, I...

108
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,770
- Alright, alright
- You little brat.

109
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Father, your hand...

110
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,310
Shaojie just comes back.

111
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,190
Your hand...

112
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,550
I am back anyway.

113
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,680
Be careful with that.

114
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,280
Jicai, thank you, Jicai.

115
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,510
Look at our father.

116
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,500
Do you know how worried
I was about you?

117
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,990
Do you know how worried our father is?

118
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,490
Do you know how worried our mother is?

119
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,240
Do you know how worried I am about you?

120
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,550
I'm back. I'm back.

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm back.

122
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,790
Alright, alright.

123
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,750
Alright, it's OK now.

124
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,590
I'm back.

125
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,250
I'm not leaving anymore.

126
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,520
Who is it?

127
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,990
Who is it?

128
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,470
It's so late. Who is it?

129
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,190
- Go take a look.
- I'll go take a look.

130
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,680
Mr. Lin.

131
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,520
Auntie Li.

132
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,910
It's Mr. Lin.

133
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,270
It's fine.

134
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,870
- Mr. Lin.
- Uncle Shen.

135
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,600
Mr. Lin.

136
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,480
It's really you.

137
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,800
Did Lu Yun send you here?

138
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,360
Am I that obvious?

139
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,310
Even you noticed it.

140
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,720
What exactly has happened to you lately?

141
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,480
You even got involved with Lu Yun.

142
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
Hurry up and make it clear.

143
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
I...

144
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,510
(Shen's Diner)
That day,

145
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,720
I left home,

146
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,040
wanting to reach the pinnacle of life

147
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,280
to prove my own strength.

148
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,120
Thus

149
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,160
I arrived in a strange city,

150
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,040
Fenglin Town.

151
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,920
There

152
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,150
I encountered the first challenge
of my life.

153
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,610
So...

154
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,150
Although my journey
had been smooth,

155
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,990
overcoming obstacles,

156
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,800
fate was unfortunately not on my side,

157
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,500
and I have not yet

158
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,810
reached the pinnacle of life.

159
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,890
I can only hide away
in the Yunlai Tavern,

160
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,030
biding my time and enduring hardships.

161
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,200
What a pity...

162
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,870
I see you are getting carried away.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,490
Just now, that whole rambling you said

164
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,380
was obviously nonsense

165
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,460
and sounds like a lie.

166
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,920
Do you think I don't know you,

167
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,660
Shen Gongcai?

168
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,300
Hurry up and tell the truth.

169
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,500
What I said is the truth.

170
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,380
I count to three.

171
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,190
No matter how,
what I said is still the truth.

172
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,900
One.

173
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,220
- Two.
- Wait.

174
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,720
I was wrong.

175
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,780
I never made a name for myself at all.

176
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,650
After unemployment,

177
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,580
I just kept wandering the streets.

178
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,770
I really don't have the face
to come back.

179
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,980
So I took an alias

180
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,660
and went to work at the Yunlai Tavern.

181
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,100
They didn't recognize me at all.

182
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,140
Nor do I know why they

183
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,060
just, just chose me

184
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,860
and let me stir up trouble
for our family,

185
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,500
but I didn't intend to do anything

186
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,800
and there's no way I could do it.

187
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,820
I didn't expect,

188
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,100
because of me

189
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,330
that father's hand got injured.

190
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,550
So those letters that you wrote

191
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,020
were all fake?

192
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,900
How did you

193
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,300
end up in the enemy army?

194
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,740
You might as well go beg for food.

195
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,340
I did, but didn't get any.

196
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,800
- Father.
- Father, Father, Father.

197
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,620
Be careful.

198
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,420
Don't hurt your hand again.

199
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,620
These past days,

200
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,900
have you noticed anything unusual
in Yunlai?

201
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,740
Unusual?

202
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,020
That place is a den of evil.

203
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,100
Only one meal a day.

204
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,760
All the dirty and exhausting work
is mine.

205
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,690
Everything is abnormal.

206
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,700
Nothing is normal.

207
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,180
I'm not talking about this.

208
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,180
Lu Yun opening a tavern
might just be a cover.

209
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,280
In fact, he's helping Prince Zhao
accumulate wealth and transport goods.

210
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,460
Did you notice anything?

211
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,780
If you put it that way...

212
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,620
Come here.

213
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,900
There is indeed a large amount of goods

214
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,380
going in and out every day
at Lu Yun's place.

215
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,660
So many that it's abnormal.

216
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,880
And in every batch of boxes,

217
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,820
there are always a few

218
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,940
that are nailed very firmly.

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,420
They are definitely not ingredients.

220
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,140
Otherwise, they've all gotten stuffy.

221
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,540
What's more,

222
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,500
on the boxes, there's also something

223
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,340
like a totem.

224
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,590
Let me draw it for you.

225
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,180
Look.

226
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
It's roughly like this.

227
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,540
Is that so?

228
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,740
Yes, that's it.

229
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,580
Exactly the same.

230
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,020
It's my duty

231
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,220
to ensure the safety of Juxian Alley.

232
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,670
Could their hideout in Juxian Alley

233
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,480
be related to you reversing the case?

234
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,500
The hideout you mentioned earlier

235
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,180
you mentioned earlier

236
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,740
is the Yunlai Tavern.

237
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,780
You also mentioned Prince Zhao.

238
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,960
It seems that this Prince Zhao

239
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,900
is related to the case of your family.

240
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,420
Could it be

241
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,940
that Prince Zhao did it?

242
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,780
Mr. Lin,

243
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,820
are you going

244
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,780
to investigate Yunlai Tavern next?

245
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,580
With me as an undercover agent
already in place,

246
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,260
wouldn't that be very convenient?

247
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,260
Great.

248
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,000
I never expected

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,660
that after muddling
through half my life,

250
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,060
I, Shen Shaojie,
would still have the chance

251
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,890
to punish the wicked,
giving back to society.

252
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,020
Well, this is a good thing.

253
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,860
Right?

254
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,500
Mr. Lin,

255
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,740
if I truly help your family
clear your injustice,

256
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,690
wouldn't the descendants

257
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,870
also remember my name?

258
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,420
Handsome Shen.

259
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,020
My father is just too cool!

260
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,620
Shaojie, please assist me
in entering Yunlai tomorrow.

261
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,180
I need to find out exactly

262
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,780
what is in those boxes.

263
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
Once it's done,

264
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,300
you'll completely cut ties with Yunlai.

265
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,260
That's all?

266
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,180
That's all.

267
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,380
You don't have any other tasks

268
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,340
for me to do?

269
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,780
Shaojie,

270
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,820
this matter should not be taken lightly.

271
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,840
These are all today's specials
at our place.

272
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,500
(Yunlai Tavern)
Ladies.

273
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,100
So many bowls.

274
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,580
And leave me to wash them alone.

275
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,110
Just wait.

276
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,940
Tonight I, Shen Shaojie,

277
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,580
is about to join the ancestor

278
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,260
to eliminate harm for the people.

279
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,140
Come on, brothers.

280
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,340
Alright, alright.

281
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,580
Bring that over here.

282
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,660
OK.

283
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,740
What are they doing?

284
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,900
Here.

285
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,940
Give it to me.

286
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,100
Tie it tight.

287
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,220
OK.

288
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,020
Another bag.

289
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,940
Washing dishes is really tiring.

290
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,300
Come out and get some sun.

291
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,340
Bro. Bro. Bro.

292
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,580
Moving, right?

293
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,500
Yeah, moving.

294
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,140
Leave this physical work to me.

295
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,300
I'm full of strength.

296
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,380
- Can you do it?
- Come on.

297
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,020
Leave it to me.

298
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,060
It's a piece of cake.

299
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,620
So heavy!

300
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,340
Shen Shaojie.

301
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,900
Come on.

302
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,380
Take care.

303
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,820
Who is it?

304
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,900
Who is called Shen Shaojie?

305
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
At least respond with a yes.

306
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,140
That's way too impolite.

307
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,980
Well.

308
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,020
Don't you know?

309
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,550
You've already given yourself away.

310
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,700
No, no, no.

311
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,540
It's real.

312
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,740
It's real.

313
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,620
This is more real.

314
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,540
Don't pull it.

315
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,500
It hurts.

316
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,860
(Yunlai)

317
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,940
Mr. Lin, you have impressive skills.

318
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,900
Mr. Lu, you set a trap for me.

319
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,060
You're always well-prepared, aren't you?

320
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,620
Where is Shen Shaojie?

321
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,300
No, no, no.

322
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,940
Be careful.

323
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,300
Be sure to pay attention!

324
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,620
Be careful, be careful!

325
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,560
Well,

326
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,860
let's talk it over calmly.

327
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,560
If we end up with mutual destruction,

328
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,940
that's really not worth it, right?

329
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,780
Scared?

330
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,500
Then let Mr. Lin put down the sword.

331
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,870
Speak properly.

332
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,020
No, no, no.

333
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,940
Put down your sword.

334
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,020
Bro, you should put the knife down too,
right?

335
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,990
Let's talk it out calmly.

336
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,980
This looks really bad.

337
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,500
Everyone, calm down.

338
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,620
Let him go.

339
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,980
I will take his place.

340
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,180
Yes, yes.

341
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,020
Let me go first.

342
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,880
Whether you want him
can be discussed later.

343
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,780
Keeping me is useless.

344
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,860
It's completely useless.

345
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,140
Bro, bro,

346
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,060
please, move the knife away a bit.

347
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,100
Mr. Lin's life

348
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,580
is naturally more valuable
than Shen Shaojie's.

349
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,180
OK.

350
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,990
You abandon the sword

351
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,580
and walk over here yourself.

352
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,760
Have to abandon the sword?

353
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,940
Bro, be careful.

354
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,260
Blades have no eyes.

355
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,500
Be careful.

356
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,460
Be careful.

357
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,620
Great!

358
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,140
Mr. Lin, speak nicely.

359
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,980
D-d-don't move.

360
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,820
Don't move.

361
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,220
Back off, back off, back off.

362
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,520
Quick, back off, don't come over.

363
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,260
Step back.

364
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,700
Don't move.

365
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,660
Now you're scared too.

366
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,500
Scared, huh?

367
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,100
Mr. Lin,

368
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,500
let's talk this out calmly.

369
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,940
Young Master, here.

370
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,780
Quick.

371
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,900
It's OK now.

372
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,140
- Quick.
- Still running?

373
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,660
Mr. Lin.

374
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,580
Mr. Lin.

375
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,420
There's no one.

376
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,420
There's no one.

377
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,660
In my opinion,

378
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,360
we should have shaken them off.

379
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
There are Jinwu Guards everywhere here.

380
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,560
Lu Yun wouldn't dare
to chase us anymore.

381
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,540
Mr. Lin,

382
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
they transferred

383
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,820
all the goods from the box

384
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,940
with the totem printed on it.

385
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,420
But maybe

386
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,980
I can help you find those things.

387
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,520
It's just that we need to be quick.

388
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,970
Because the duration of that scent

389
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,710
is limited.

390
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,580
Scent?

391
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,100
Yes.

392
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,940
I saw them suddenly start moving things.

393
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,620
I was worried these bad people

394
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,080
would move these pieces of evidence,

395
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,860
so I stole some strong-smelling spices

396
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,940
from the kitchen

397
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,180
and made them into sachets.

398
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,520
Then I put some lime

399
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,220
inside the sachets

400
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,540
and soaked them in water.

401
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,350
Isn't this basically
a self-heating hotpot?

402
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,500
Moving, huh?

403
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,460
Yeah, moving.

404
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,940
Leave this physical work to me.

405
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,340
I'm full of strength.

406
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,220
- Can you do it?
- Come on.

407
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,760
Leave it to me. This is a little case.

408
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,180
Self-heating pot?

409
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,260
What I mean is,

410
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,060
lime gives off heat

411
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,320
when mixed with water,

412
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,200
which is essentially
like cooking those spices.

413
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,240
Then we follow the scent,

414
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,980
just like recognizing a horse
by its smell.

415
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,880
Then it might be possible
to find those things.

416
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,840
There are 108 alleys in Yong'an City.

417
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,080
Only a few places are suitable
for building warehouses.

418
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,280
No one lights a fire at night.

419
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,490
Spices from the Western Regions

420
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,620
become pungent after cooking.

421
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,890
It's easy to tell the direction.

422
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,660
Yeah.

423
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,660
Shen,

424
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,030
you're truly wise appearing simple.

425
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,420
Well...

426
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,460
I'll go find it right away.

427
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,350
Liu Chang,

428
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,370
you escort Shen back.

429
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,720
- Watch out for the guards.
- Got it.

430
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,940
Mr. Lin praised me

431
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,700
as being wise yet appearing simple.

432
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,060
It's kind of embarrassing.

433
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,060
Being wise...

434
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,660
Wise.

435
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,700
Yet appearing simple.

436
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,620
Mr. Shen, hurry up and leave.

437
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,020
Do I... do I look very foolish?

438
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,460
What's that smell?

439
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,620
Why does it smell so good?

440
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,580
It's already nighttime.

441
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,420
Who's cooking?

442
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,100
Yeah, this job is making me

443
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,140
almost starve.

444
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,540
- Get something to eat.
- Let's go.

445
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,380
Eat some.

446
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,460
I'm telling you,

447
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,700
I simply didn't find the field

448
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,820
I was good at before.

449
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,120
In fact,

450
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,220
I am very likely a naturally gifted
undercover agent

451
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,380
who can act

452
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,900
on behalf of justice and punish evil.

453
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,020
Applause.

454
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,020
Father,

455
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,060
are you really telling the truth?

456
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,260
Of course what I'm saying

457
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,380
is really true.

458
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,860
When have I ever lied to you?

459
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,780
- Mr. Lin.
- Young Master.

460
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,840
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

461
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,550
- Mr. Lin, you're back.
- Are you alright?

462
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,940
- Mr. Lin, are you OK?
- I'm fine.

463
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,420
Did my father really help you?

464
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,820
This time we truly have to thank him.

465
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,940
If he hadn't used spices
as guiding markers,

466
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,900
I couldn't find the warehouse at all.

467
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,190
- Really?
- Really.

468
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,740
Shaojie, you really nailed it this time.

469
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,340
Well done, Shen Gongcai.

470
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,260
You've really amazing this time.

471
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,780
Our ancestral tomb
is emitting auspicious smoke.

472
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,440
Look, I told you from the very beginning

473
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,940
that I achieved something remarkable,

474
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,040
yet none of you believed me

475
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,830
and even wronged me.

476
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,930
This is simply unreasonable.

477
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,860
Father, I'm sorry.

478
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,620
We shouldn't have said that
to you just now.

479
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,220
My father is a great hero.

480
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,140
My father is an amazing great hero.

481
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,660
That's right.

482
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,740
Your father is indeed a great hero.

483
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,580
Here comes the great hero.

484
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,420
Here I come.

485
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,780
You have to shave layer by layer.

486
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,180
- You don't have to.
- Shut up.

487
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,120
Why don't you shave it?

488
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,340
My hand is injured.

489
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,900
Stop arguing, Father.

490
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,060
Listen to my mother.

491
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,900
San.

492
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,020
San.

493
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,160
You go to the toilet, huh?

494
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,260
As soon as Mr. Shen returned,

495
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,340
none of you went to sleep.

496
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,180
Let me introduce him to you.

497
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,060
This is Yu San,

498
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,460
the newly hired head chef
of our diner.

499
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
He's impressive.

500
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,780
Nice to meet you, San.

501
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,740
San,

502
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,100
this is our son.

503
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,940
Shen...

504
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,860
Go ahead.

505
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,220
Shaojie.

506
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,940
San,

507
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,340
you just said,

508
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,100
as soon as Mr. Shen returned,

509
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,260
you know my elder brother?

510
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,340
I'm not stupid.

511
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,820
It's so late,
and you're in your own yard

512
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,770
doing something as intimate
as shaving his beard,

513
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,260
it's obvious he can't be anyone else.

514
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,260
Right?

515
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,340
See, he's a born chef,

516
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,580
so smart.

517
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,100
He spotted it right away.

518
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,100
Alright then, you guys carry on.

519
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,200
I'll go back and rest first.

520
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,700
All right, you go to sleep.

521
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,140
Take care.

522
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,060
I'm telling you,

523
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,340
that guy's very nice.

524
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,580
Yeah, he looks pretty good.

525
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,580
- What, Mother?
- Keep shaving.

526
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,250
There's something wrong

527
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,170
with Yu San.

528
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,380
What's wrong?

529
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,740
Lu Yun can catch my brother on the spot,

530
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,750
but it's very likely that it wasn't
my brother giving himself away.

531
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,140
My brother is dumb.

532
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,060
Are Lu Yun's people really that smart?

533
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,260
Watch your wording.

534
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,570
What I mean is

535
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,830
that it's very likely
there's a mole passing on message.

536
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,740
Wait.

537
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
I remember now.

538
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,400
That day when we were discussing

539
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,420
the undercover plan,

540
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,180
could he have overheard us?

541
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,160
Freshly cooked fish and lamb delicacy.

542
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,480
You've been busy for half the day.

543
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,770
Taste it while it's hot.

544
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,700
San,

545
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,020
you fish

546
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,900
is only superficially refined;

547
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,260
take a look inside,

548
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,100
it's full of a fishy, rank stench.

549
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,500
San, the fish you cooked...

550
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,460
I don't even know what to say.

551
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,100
Quick, take it away.

552
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,940
It's too smelly.

553
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,180
Milady.

554
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,020
Deyuan.

555
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,200
- Want candied hawthorn?
- The vow was spoken sincerely

556
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,990
yet I never expected him
to change his heart.

557
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,380
Since he has broken his vow,

558
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,220
then let it go.

559
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,940
Yangyang, what does this mean?

560
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,860
The meaning of this poem is

561
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,260
if someone betrays,

562
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,300
we part ways immediately

563
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,740
and cut all ties completely.

564
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,180
Let's go.

565
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,300
I know you love spicy food.

566
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,900
I picked the newly grown smartweed

567
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,260
and made this spicy smartweed dessert.

568
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,340
Have a taste.

569
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,180
This is a dessert.

570
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,460
You can even make it spicy.

571
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,540
Are you from Misty City?

572
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
Yu San, you suddenly
became so enthusiastic.

573
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,700
I'm not used to it.

574
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,860
Milady,

575
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,100
don't you

576
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,620
like me anymore?

577
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,180
How could you think that?

578
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,520
Recently, Mr. Shen and Mrs. Shen
have always spoken to me

579
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,940
with sarcasm and hostility.

580
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,340
They were too tired

581
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,700
and spoke without thinking.

582
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,180
Well, yangyang

583
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,420
ran away as soon as she saw me.

584
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,990
It's because studying is too tiring?

585
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,100
Lately, there have been many beggars.

586
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,060
We teach her

587
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,100
not to talk to strangers.

588
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,540
She's probably rehearsing with you.

589
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,400
I have been a slave for many years.

590
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,220
Only you regard me as a human being.

591
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,990
On the day of the Competition,

592
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,060
you even allowed me

593
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,480
to take time off to go and watch.

594
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,550
Whatever you have to eat,

595
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,980
you always save a portion for me.

596
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,420
I'm nothing more than a slave.

597
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,500
In this world, apart from my mother,

598
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,980
no one will ever treat me so well again.

599
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,740
This is actually the first time

600
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,220
I've heard you talk about your family.

601
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,780
I didn't know

602
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,900
where you are from.

603
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,210
My home is not far from Yong'an.

604
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,080
How about going home for a visit?

605
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,100
Take another two days...

606
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,940
No need.

607
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
There is someone at home.

608
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,160
It's inconvenient to visit.

609
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,320
I'm also worried
that the diner may be short on staff.

610
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,140
Let's talk about it later.

611
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,160
Well,

612
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,140
I'll get busy first.

613
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,220
Have a taste.

614
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
There is someone at home.

615
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,860
It's inconvenient to visit.

616
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,180
Yu San is truly a born chef.

617
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,620
This kind of mixed dessert

618
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,060
actually tastes pretty good.

619
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,740
He was ignored by us.

620
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,140
He really looked sad.

621
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,620
Such poor mental resilience.

622
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,860
How could he possibly
be a professional undercover agent?

623
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,060
From my professional perspective

624
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,140
as a chef,

625
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,380
I can tell this guy's cooking skills

626
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,100
have been practiced for many years.

627
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,310
Who do you think

628
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,340
would teach a spy this kind
of cooking skill?

629
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,300
What was his exact original wording?

630
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,860
There is someone at home.

631
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,060
It's inconvenient to visit.

632
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,380
Let me tell you,

633
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,900
based on my professional analysis

634
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,050
as a genius undercover agent,

635
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,460
there's definitely something wrong

636
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,420
with this sentence.

637
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,390
Think about it carefully.

638
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,300
Isn't it?

639
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,300
Indeed.

640
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,590
If it's just the kind of family matters
that are hard to talk about,

641
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,900
he could simply say
it's inconvenient to visit.

642
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,340
There is someone at home.

643
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,060
This sentence sounds odd.

644
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,300
It's like someone is keeping watch
over his family.

645
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,020
Did Prince Zhao kidnap his family

646
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,660
and force him to be an undercover agent?

647
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,680
My grandmother and I watched it
in the drama.

648
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,880
It was always played like that.

649
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,540
Yes.

650
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,820
Lady Shen, you're looking for me.

651
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,420
Lady Shen.

652
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,020
Lady Shen.

653
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,940
It's so dark.

654
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,860
Why don't you turn on the light?

655
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,620
Happy Birthday!

656
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,460
Who is it?

657
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,500
What's in his hand?

658
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,020
It's a knife.

659
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,380
It's a knife.

660
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,620
Oh no!

661
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,740
It's getting worse.

662
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,300
He is driven to a dead end.

663
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,940
Grandpa, Grandma,

664
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,460
Father, Auntie,

665
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,340
I'm scared.

666
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,000
Don't be afraid, Yangyang.

667
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,150
You close your eyes
before blowing out the candles.

668
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,780
Close your eyes.

669
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,190
Then you will not be afraid anymore.

670
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,540
Yu San, you are really thoughtful.

671
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,820
You guessed that we were going
to celebrate your birthday

672
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,990
and even specially prepared a knife
to cut the cake.

673
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,740
That's amazing.

674
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,580
Here.

675
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,660
Come on, cut the cake.

676
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,580
Time to cut the cake.

677
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,620
Come cut the cake, cut the cake.

678
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,540
Yes.

679
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,380
OK.

680
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,780
- Happy Birthday.
- Happy Birthday.

681
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,600
San, do you still remember

682
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,730
you filled in your birthday
on your first day at work.

683
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,800
It's just today, isn't it?

684
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,660
Your parents aren't around.

685
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,240
And there's no one helping you with it.

686
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,660
So we took the liberty

687
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,240
to celebrated your birthday for you.

688
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,660
That's right.

689
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,780
Yu San,

690
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,380
actually,

691
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,580
your age is about the same

692
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
as Gongcai and Jicai.

693
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
In our eyes,

694
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,380
you are just a child.

695
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,820
A child of our own family.

696
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,140
- Yes.
- That's right.

697
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,580
This birthday cake

698
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,740
is a custom from our hometown.

699
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,700
So, Yu San,

700
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,900
don't despise it.

701
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,800
- Don't mind.
- Yeah.

702
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,500
Don't despise it.

703
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,620
Actually, you've known about it, right?

704
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,440
That's why your behavior
has been so strange lately.

705
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,140
Isn't it?

706
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,390
- Don't be impulsive.
- Speak.

707
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,060
Isn't it?

708
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,220
Isn't it? Isn't it?

709
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,180
Don't...

710
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,880
- Don't be impulsive.
- Don't be impulsive.

711
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,500
Don't be impulsive. Don't.

712
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,260
Yu San, don't be impulsive.

713
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,980
- Don't be impulsive.
- Don't be afraid, Deyuan.

714
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,980
Deyuan is just a servant girl.

715
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,460
You're masters.

716
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,180
You protect her like this?

717
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,740
Deyuan is not a servant.

718
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,580
She's our family.

719
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,140
We went to great lengths

720
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,260
to retrieve her slave deed,

721
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,740
just so she could be a real person.

722
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,820
That's just your way

723
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,300
of winning people's hearts.

724
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,760
Someone once said they wanted
to redeem me.

725
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,380
But in the end,

726
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,620
they still held my slave deed

727
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,820
and used my family to threaten me.

728
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,460
- Mother.
- Grandma.

729
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,300
Grandma.

730
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,300
Feng...

731
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,220
San,

732
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,260
no matter who has deceived you,

733
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,660
but we are just ourselves.

734
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,220
If you've been deceived once,

735
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,740
you should walk away immediately,

736
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,820
rather than doubt

737
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,980
those around you.

738
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,860
Do you know?

739
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
You don't kill me?

740
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,310
I...

741
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,380
I am just a slave.

742
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,540
Even though you kill me,

743
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,260
nothing will happen to you.

744
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,180
Yu San,

745
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,020
you were holding this knife just now.

746
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,700
I can see

747
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,820
that you didn't truly intend to harm us.

748
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,780
This shows that your conscience
has not been extinguished.

749
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,140
If someone is truly behind you
trying to threaten you,

750
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,980
you should choose

751
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
to stand with us to deal with him,

752
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,340
instead

753
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,380
of risking your young life.

754
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,680
You were the one who told them

755
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,400
about the plan to infiltrate Yunlai,
right?

756
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,180
Who's threatening you?

757
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,500
Is it Prince Zhao?

758
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,380
Yu San.

759
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,420
Yu San.

760
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,540
I used to work at Yunlai before.

761
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,780
I know what kind of people they are.

762
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,860
It must have been very tough, right?

763
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,220
Look at me.

764
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,460
Me.

765
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,100
I am Handsome Shen.

766
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,900
You must have heard of my name, right?

767
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,240
This person

768
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,780
is the top chef of Juxian Alley.

769
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,100
You've heard of this title, huh?

770
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,200
And Mr. Lin.

771
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,580
Vice Prefect Lin.

772
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,180
He is the upright magistrate.

773
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,880
You've surely heard
of his title even more.

774
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,960
Can he still not resolve the matter
behind you?

775
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,000
Sticking with us

776
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,690
is definitely better
than being with them.

777
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,350
Isn't it?

778
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,300
I remember you once said

779
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,580
you're a slave.

780
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,700
But you have to trust us

781
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,100
that we will surely find a way

782
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,420
to help you solve this problem.

783
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,200
If money can solve this problem,

784
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,320
we'll spend whatever it takes

785
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,440
and exert our utmost effort;

786
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,860
if money can't solve it,

787
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,260
we'll still find a way.

788
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,660
Can you trust us?

789
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,340
Can you

790
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,360
swear?

791
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,860
We can.

792
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,410
- We can.
- We can.

793
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,220
We swear.

794
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,260
We swear.

795
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,260
It was I who betrayed Mr. Lin
and Mr. Shen.

796
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,340
I'm afraid that if I make no progress,

797
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,140
they will kill my father and mother.

798
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,500
I have wronged you.

799
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,900
I am a spy from Prince Zhao.

800
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,700
I don't deserve...

801
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,340
I don't deserve to be treated
like this by you.

802
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,220
Sorry.

803
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,300
Sorry.

804
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,420
San.

805
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,260
It's fine.

806
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,020
It's all in the past now.

807
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,620
It's over. It's fine now.

808
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,740
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

809
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,250
What are you still standing there for?

810
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,300
Drink it.

811
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,300
You've had your tea.

812
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,340
Say

813
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,260
what you want directly.

814
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,300
Lu Yun has already transferred out

815
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,480
all the salt and iron
we were going to use in advance.

816
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,820
Lin Anran hasn't found anything either.

817
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,460
But

818
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,220
Yunlai

819
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,180
is no longer safe.

820
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,100
However, rather than abandoning Yunlai,

821
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,260
it would be better to kill Lin Yan.

822
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,120
One finished, all is finished.

823
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,780
Lin Yan would even oppose us
for the Shen family.

824
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,360
If he finds out about the Cui family...

825
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,620
Since you can't make up your mind,

826
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,820
I'll make the decision for you.

827
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,980
Stop.

828
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,220
Why are you still acting so impulsively?

829
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,260
It's easy to do.

830
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,180
What about wrapping up?

831
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,540
He's a Rank III official

832
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
in Yong'an.

833
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,980
You think you can easily kill him?

834
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,420
In the final analysis,

835
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,620
you misjudged Lin Yan.

836
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,740
You thought he had long since
let go of the past,

837
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,060
and that as long as he could live well,
it would be fine.

838
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,980
But little do you know
he has his own plans.

839
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,820
It was precisely because you projected

840
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,260
your longing for my brother
onto him

841
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,300
and insisted on keeping him

842
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,840
that today's disaster was brought about.

843
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,580
Shut up!

844
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,660
I was worried too much,

845
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,980
so I spoke out of turn.

846
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,580
Please forgive me, Father.

847
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,620
I tell you,

848
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,820
killing would cause unnecessary trouble.

849
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,700
His current location

850
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,940
is too close to His Majesty.

851
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,260
What we can do is to make him fall,

852
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,780
falling into a position

853
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,420
where his words don't count.

854
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,500
Only then

855
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,420
can you do whatever you want.

856
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,140
Rein in your temper.

857
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,860
Think more.

858
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,740
Yes.

859
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,580
(Xuanzheng Gate)

860
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,820
Mr. Lin, you probably never expected

861
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,820
that one day the Appeal Drum

862
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,780
would be sounded against yourself.

863
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,780
Your Majesty,

864
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,550
a good citizen from the Western Market,
Feng Li,

865
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,300
has accused Lin Yan, the Vice Prefect,

866
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,550
of colluding with Cao Rong,
the Vice Minister of Justice,

867
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,070
to coerce a confession through torture

868
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,260
and render an unjust judgment.

869
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,700
Feng Li, willing to offend the superior,

870
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,040
subjected to corporal punishment,

871
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,720
still seeks to redress the injustice.

872
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,660
(Submitted by Censor Luo Zhi)

873
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,490
How do you

874
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,900
explain this?

875
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,500
Your Majesty,

876
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,330
Feng Li poisoned the Shen family's
restaurant

877
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,620
on Juxian Alley last year.

878
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,220
The Shen family and I are cousins.

879
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,200
Thus, upon hearing this,

880
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,780
in strict accordance with the Six Codes,

881
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,260
and submitted it
to the Ministry of Justice for judgment.

882
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,080
How could I join hands
with Vice Minister Cao?

883
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,500
Your Majesty,

884
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,300
in this case, both testimonial

885
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,630
and physical evidence are present,

886
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,020
and the judgment is rendered
strictly according to the law.

887
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,080
Therefore,

888
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,860
Feng Li fled in fear of punishment.

889
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,300
Since Feng Li has retreated to Yong'an

890
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,600
and has connected with you,

891
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,260
why have you not
handed over the criminal

892
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,460
to the authorities,

893
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,020
but instead allowed him
to falsely accuse Vice Prefect Lin?

894
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,540
What is your true intention?

895
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,220
It's a minor dispute between merchants
in the Western Market.

896
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,580
If it weren't for Mr. Lin mediating
between them,

897
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,220
how could it bypass the Market Office

898
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,140
and reach the Ministry of Justice?

899
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,220
Could it be that you are protecting them

900
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,500
just because the person involved
is a relative?

901
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,500
Western Market is a prime location.

902
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,680
Poisoning is a serious matter.

903
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,280
How could it be considered a minor case?

904
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,220
It used to be under the jurisdiction
of the Market Office.

905
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,300
The Western Market was a complete mess.

906
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,980
After this case was heavily sentenced,

907
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,700
those merchants

908
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
became much more orderly.

909
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,140
How many errands

910
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,100
has Capital Prefecture handled
beyond the Market Office?

911
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,460
So mighty.

912
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,460
I also heard

913
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,500
the Lantern Festival had not yet ended

914
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,860
when the Prefecture ordered people
to be on duty

915
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,340
and even encouraged the people
to beat the Appeal Drum.

916
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,760
The common people in the capital

917
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,140
now

918
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,900
only trust the Capital Prefecture.

919
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,420
Perhaps, in their eyes,

920
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,540
even if it were personally judged
by His Majesty,

921
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,580
it would not compare

922
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,920
to a single word from Mr. Lin.
