00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,990
=Yummy Yummy Yummy=

2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 31=

3
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,780
Whose wedding procession
is so magnificent?

4
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,470
It's really impressive.

5
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,400
Such a grand array.

6
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,320
Mr. Lin is off to fetch his bride.

7
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,910
What Mr. Lin?

8
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,070
It's Mr. Cui.

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,240
The Emperor helped the Cui family,

10
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,830
so Mr. Lin changed his name back

11
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,990
to Cui Che.

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,990
He gave a grand gift at the first step,

13
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,350
and he's brought so much more now.

14
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,190
She's just a merchant's daughter.

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,830
Nonsense.

16
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,960
Mr. Cui hasn't taken a wife in 26 years.

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,520
It's good enough that a lady

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,500
is willing to marry him.

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,550
With so many gifts,

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
Mr. Cui must

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,690
truly cherish Lady Shen.

22
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,670
Indeed.

23
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,240
Congratulations, Mr. Cui.

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Congratulations.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,120
Congratulations, Mr. Cui.

26
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,960
Congratulations.

27
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,700
(Joy)

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,620
(Yunshui Manor)

29
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,400
That's quite a spectacle.

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,870
Isn't it?

31
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,060
Congratulations.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,900
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,670
Great.

34
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,710
Wait, Mr. Cui.

35
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,080
To marry my sister,

36
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,080
you must first pass my test.

37
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,680
Our young master

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,830
is well-versed

39
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,870
in poetry, music,

40
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,270
history, and debate.

41
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,800
Go ahead.

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,080
Bring it on.

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Ask away.

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,560
Question.

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,510
(Question 1)
Chickens and rabbits are in a cage.

46
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,360
You can see 35 heads

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,270
and 94 feet.

48
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,830
How many chickens

49
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,030
and rabbits are there?

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,520
Who blocks the door

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,170
and tests with arithmetic at a wedding?

52
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,520
- This is intentional.
- Exactly.

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,650
You're making it hard for us.

54
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,030
We're a family of merchants.

55
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,200
Naturally, to join our family,

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,490
one must be tested in arithmetic.

57
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,270
Right?

58
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,360
23 chickens.

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,800
12 rabbits.

60
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,430
I've read

61
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,520
the Sunzi Suanjing.

62
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,920
No need to set up variables?

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,700
Is that right?

64
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,030
- Is it right?
- Is it correct?

65
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,870
Is it correct?

66
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,120
It's correct.

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,520
There's more.

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Question.

69
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,550
(Question 2)
When candlelight passes

70
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,120
through a small hole,

71
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,550
what will it form on the wall

72
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,920
on the other side?

73
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
An inverted image.

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,440
It's recorded in the Mohist Canon.

75
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,990
Is it?

76
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,080
I don't know.

77
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,710
Our Vice Prefect

78
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,270
is so brilliant.

79
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,150
Next question.

80
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,240
One faces south; the other faces north.

81
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,290
Without turning around,
moving, or using a mirror,

82
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,540
can they see

83
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,750
each other's faces?

84
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,790
Yes.

85
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,510
Because they're facing each other.

86
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,800
Facing each other.

87
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,530
Facing each other.

88
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,950
Mr. Cui knows everything.

89
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,990
Next question.

90
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,730
Question.

91
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,190
(Question 4)
I was eating hot pot

92
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,950
and accidentally overcooked
the beef tripe.

93
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,000
I wanted to throw it away,

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,560
but why didn't I?

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,550
This answer

96
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,600
might offend you

97
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,590
because

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,920
you're not young either.

99
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,390
Shen Shaojie,

100
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,840
you're not young either.

101
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,910
Did Shen Shaoguang
leak the answers to you?

102
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,990
How could she do this?

103
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,920
Next question.

104
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,750
What does the bride want you to fetch?

105
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,600
What

106
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,640
is it?

107
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,200
Fetch her.

108
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,240
Fetch her!

109
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,720
You even know cheesy pickup lines?

110
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
You...

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,440
I don't believe it.

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,440
One more.

113
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,390
You'll never get this one.

114
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,060
(Joy)

115
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,540
(Clear and Bright)

116
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,310
How is it? Look.

117
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,190
Is it symmetrical?

118
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,660
- Auntie.
- So pretty.

119
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,150
Auntie,

120
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,870
Uncle

121
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,190
answered all those questions.

122
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,070
Dad is making him recite

123
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,720
tongue twisters.

124
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,360
Milady, you mustn't go soft.

125
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,510
Let them block the door a bit longer.

126
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,390
We can't let them in so easily.

127
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,480
No.

128
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,550
I want to hear him recite

129
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,040
tongue twisters.

130
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,480
I know,

131
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,750
but you have to wait.

132
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,310
Sit and wait.

133
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,390
Auntie,

134
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,680
Uncle was right.

135
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,200
He anticipated that you'd want

136
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,410
to see his embarrassment,

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,510
so he asked me to secretly

138
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,780
(Joy)
bring you a letter.

139
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,360
This must be a marriage poem
from Mr. Cui.

140
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,430
They all do this,

141
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,840
write some sweet nothings

142
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,970
to urge the bride to leave.

143
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,550
You mustn't fall for it.

144
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,480
It's just a poem.

145
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,040
I won't fall for it.

146
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,360
What's this?

147
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
A deed.

148
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,390
A marriage deed.

149
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,920
This shop is gifted to you.

150
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,950
Please help me.

151
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
This is the right way to urge the bride.

152
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,780
(Joy in our family)

153
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,500
(We're getting married)

154
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,780
(Happy marriage)

155
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,840
Greetings, Your Highness.

156
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,430
- This way.
- Please.

157
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,800
Come here, Your Highness.

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,750
Please sit here.

159
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,320
Your Highness, please be seated.

160
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,270
Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

161
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,990
Please sit first.

162
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,430
What's the matter, Vice Minister Cao?

163
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,840
I've never seen the wording

164
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,840
of this wedding ceremony before.

165
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,600
And there are requirements
for the intonation.

166
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,840
Shall I read it aloud

167
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,360
for you two to listen?

168
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,310
- Sure.
- Sure.

169
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,280
You go ahead.

170
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,750
Distinguished guests,

171
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,870
friends, and relatives,

172
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,750
- you...
- Vice Minister Cao.

173
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,390
You're so professional.

174
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,720
Amazing.

175
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
You don't seem like someone

176
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,370
who was just trained last night.

177
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:52,990
Yeah.

178
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,800
You look like you've been hosting

179
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,120
for over a decade.

180
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,630
Extremely professional.

181
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,710
Host?

182
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,600
Is the term from monasteries?

183
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,430
No, no.

184
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,630
There must be some connection

185
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,720
between a host and an abbot.

186
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,560
- No.
- No.

187
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,870
I haven't taken monastic vows.

188
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,040
How could I be a host?

189
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,510
- No.
- Vice Minister Cao.

190
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,510
Listen.

191
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,430
- This has nothing to do with that.
- Yes.

192
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,720
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

193
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,630
May I make a small suggestion?

194
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,510
Go ahead.

195
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,480
For the atmosphere,

196
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
could we all

197
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
smile,

198
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,680
showing

199
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,310
at least eight teeth?

200
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,840
Let me demonstrate.

201
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,920
Look at this.

202
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
Look.

203
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
Like this.

204
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,360
Distinguished guests,

205
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,320
friends, and relatives,

206
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,830
you...

207
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,390
I've found the feeling.

208
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,960
- Right?
- I'll practice more.

209
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,150
- Go ahead.
- Sure.

210
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,960
- How nice,
- Friends...

211
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,390
Come, sit down.

212
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,680
Fengxia,

213
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,720
should I sit like this

214
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,830
or

215
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,390
like this?

216
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,750
Why? Are you nervous?

217
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,590
Not exactly.

218
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,390
Just sit however you feel comfortable.

219
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,560
Like me.

220
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,840
Isn't it fine?

221
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,960
Okay, I'll adjust it.

222
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
I'll adjust it.

223
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
Fengxia.

224
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,750
Mr. Pei.

225
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,960
- He can't sit there.
- Exactly.

226
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,800
- Mr. Pei.
- Hurry.

227
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,480
Mr. Pei.

228
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,560
I'm so sorry.

229
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,080
How could you sit here?

230
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,600
I'm so busy.

231
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
You should sit over there.

232
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,270
- You should sit there.
- Come.

233
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,150
- Where?
- Come.

234
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,200
Over there.

235
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,990
How could I sit there?

236
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,390
That's for the elders.

237
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,270
You two are the elders

238
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,510
of the bride and groom.

239
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,240
How could I sit there?

240
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
You are an elder.

241
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,630
Yes, you are an elder.

242
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,790
Hurry up.

243
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,630
Now,

244
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,510
I am

245
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,990
already the Vice Censor-in-Chief.

246
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,840
Yes.

247
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,090
A Rank V official.

248
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,980
A full rank.

249
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,050
Yes, yes.

250
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,670
Still inappropriate for me to sit there.

251
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,080
It's appropriate.

252
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,240
- Inappropriate.
- Sit.

253
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,750
I insist.

254
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,390
- I can't.
- I insist.

255
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,360
Please go attend

256
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,600
to the other guests, okay?

257
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,630
I'll sit here.

258
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,750
It's fine.

259
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,390
This isn't right.

260
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,230
Alright.

261
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,600
Go, go.

262
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,960
You sit here.

263
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,560
Have some tea or something.

264
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,080
Okay, okay.

265
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,080
Stop crying.

266
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,390
Stop crying.

267
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,150
This one's all wet.

268
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,990
Use this one.

269
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,440
Mr. Cui and Lady Shen
are getting married.

270
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,720
Why are you crying here?

271
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,200
You heartless chef.

272
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,120
What do you know?

273
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,360
Getting married in the diner

274
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,120
and spending the night at Yunshui Manor?

275
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,870
This place is limited.

276
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,440
Yunshui Manor is spacious.

277
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,090
Besides, I've thought of that place

278
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,320
as my home.

279
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,440
I've grown attached to it.

280
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,680
Mr. Shen,

281
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,870
how much did you get from Mr. Cui?

282
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,990
Oh, you mean this?

283
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,030
Let me tell you.

284
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,680
If a man is willing

285
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,750
to spend money on you,

286
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,590
it doesn't mean he loves you so much.

287
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,870
But if a man

288
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,360
isn't willing to spend money on you,

289
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,090
he definitely thinks of you as a fool.

290
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I'm testing Mr. Cui for my sister.

291
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,510
You used to want

292
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,990
to be my brother-in-law, right?

293
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,270
Look at Mr. Cui.

294
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,600
Look at his initiative.

295
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,240
Look at you.

296
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,360
Listen. With you like this,

297
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
forget about marrying my sister.

298
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,200
Which lady

299
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,390
would marry you?

300
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,230
You must be kidding.

301
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,080
I don't think it's easier for you.

302
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,230
It's not?

303
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,630
What's wrong with me?

304
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,600
You don't know the value of money.

305
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,210
When I heard that the Prefecture

306
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,990
was helping the Cui family
clear their name,

307
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,670
I told them everything I knew.

308
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,720
Who would've known he was Cui Che?

309
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,440
I always suspected Cui Che wasn't dead.

310
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,720
He loved making handicrafts
when he was a child.

311
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,120
Knowing he was betrothed,

312
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,510
he asked what use a wife would be

313
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,560
and if she could make his gadgets spin.

314
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,600
Such a pesky kid couldn't die.

315
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,270
I forgot to ask just now.

316
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,510
Who are you?

317
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,480
I'm Jingwen.

318
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,030
Try some; it's very sweet.

319
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,400
No, thank you.

320
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,960
Distinguished guests,

321
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,960
friends, and relatives,

322
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,150
it's a joyous occasion today.

323
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,510
We have all gathered here

324
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,270
to witness the union of Mr. Cui

325
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,270
and Lady Shen.

326
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,390
Now, let us give the warmest applause

327
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,200
to welcome

328
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,510
the newlyweds.

329
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,920
Good, good.

330

Water has its source;

331

children never forget
their parents' kindness.

333
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,440
Newlyweds,

00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440

It's from the Princess.

382
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,280
Shouldn't you learn it first?

383
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,710
No need.

384
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,630
You are really...

385
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,750
Actually,

386
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,470
we suddenly got married

387
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,360
because of me.

388
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,810
We haven't had a chance
to spend any time together.

389
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
How about

390
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,230
tonight we just...

391
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,120
Are you making excuses?

392
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,630
Indeed.

393
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,520
You should take some time to learn.

394
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,700
(Capital Prefecture)

395
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,360
Dear, let me.

396
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,470
Dear.

397
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,230
Come on.

398
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,120
Congratulations, Mr. Cui,

399
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,000
on your marriage

400
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,520
and your restoration to office.

401
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,350
- Congrats.
- Congrats.

402
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,020
It's all thanks to all of you.

403
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,420
Congratulations

404
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,140
on a 20% increase in your salaries

405
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,020
and merits in the Merit Office.

406
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,060
Your future promotions

407
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,460
are boundless.

408
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,420
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

409
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,340
Please, have a seat.

410
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,380
Sit.

411
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,460
This is our new dish,

412
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,340
the Ten-Flavor Crab.

413
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,560
Everyone, please taste it.

414
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,140
Thank you, Mrs. Cui.

415
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,580
The Ten-Flavor Crab,

416
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,700
as the name suggests,

417
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,540
is crab prepared in ten flavors?

418
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,100
Traditional marinated, steamed,

419
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,140
and pepper crab.

420
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,020
Also, stir-fried, deep-fried, pickled,
scallion oil, and drunken crab.

421
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
This one is baked crab

422
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,820
made with cheese extracted from milk.

423
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,900
This one is my father's creation,

424
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,980
crab steamed with rice wine
and cinnamon.

425
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,700
But it's only available now.

426
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,100
Everyone, please taste it.

427
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,540
- Eat up.
- Yes.

428
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,580
- Taste it.
- Here.

429
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,400
It seems quite good.

430
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,720
It looks fresh.

431
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
But Lady Shen...

432
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,780
Mrs. Cui.

433
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,180
What did you mean by saying

434
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,700
it's only available now?

435
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,720
My parents had

436
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,500
a quarrel recently,

437
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,460
but they've made up.

438
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,840
My father said that in a few days,

439
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,140
he'll take my mother to Jiangnan
to explore new cuisines,

440
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,320
and no one will be making it.

441
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,420
That's true.

442
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,380
Oh, it's been a long time
since we've seen

443
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,220
Shen Shaojie.

444
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,300
Yes.

445
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,900
Where has he gone?

446
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,660
My brother and Mr. Liu

447
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,540
have gone to open a branch of our diner.

448
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,260
Your brother.

449
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,820
What else?

450
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,900
Their diner.

451
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,020
Dear, taste this.

452
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,140
Look at them.

453
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,420
Focused on eating.

454
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,180
Everyone, take a look.

455
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,780
Today,

456
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,730
Shen's Diner Third Branch

457
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,400
(Shen's Diner Third Branch)
is launching

458
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,060
a children's nutritious lunch box.

459
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,180
We hope everyone passing by

460
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,100
won't miss out.

461
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,020
Okay?

462
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,060
Feel free to look.

463
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,980
In the past,
when I prepared lunch for my son,

464
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,700
by the time he went to eat at noon,

465
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,560
the food was all cold.

466
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,500
I have the same trouble.

467
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,620
Thanks to Handsome Shen,

468
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,540
who came up with the idea
of a lunch box,

469
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,820
my son finally

470
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,940
got to eat hot meals.

471
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,460
Yes, the children's meal he made

472
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,060
is colorful, fragrant, and delicious,

473
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,780
and the design is adorable.

474
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,060
My child is craving this.

475
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,020
You flatter me.

476
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,260
Your praise

477
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,660
is too kind.

478
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,740
I dare not accept it.

479
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,620
We're not flattering you.

480
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,620
You deserve it.

481
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,220
At Hongwen Academy,

482
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,860
Yangyang often tells my son

483
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,620
that in her heart,

484
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,420
you're the most reliable father.

485
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,820
Yes, I know.

486
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,780
Does Yangyang truly say so?

487
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,380
- Yes.
- I know, too.

488
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,380
(Fatherly love is like a mountain)

489
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,020
Ladies,

490
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,900
I dare not accept

491
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,820
other praises,

492
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,140
but becoming a father Yangyang can trust

493
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,300
has indeed been

494
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,540
my constant pursuit.

495
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,420
So, let's get down

496
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,260
to business.

497
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,420
Don't worry, everyone.

498
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,460
Today, our children's lunch box

499
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,540
is only 3 qian each.

500
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,780
I hope you...

501
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,340
Handsome Shen.

502
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,380
Alright.

503
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,260
Don't rush.

504
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,120
Alright, everyone.

505
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,460
Everyone will get one.

506
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,440
I want one.

507
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,550
I want one, too.

508
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,860
(Hongwen Academy)

509
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,160
The top performer

510
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,370
in this school exam is

511
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,340
Shen Yangyang.

512
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,490
Thank you.

513
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,100
Thank you, everyone.

514
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,700
Shen Yangyang,

515
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,900
you used to be unfamiliar
with the Four Books and Five Classics,

516
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,140
but today you can answer fluently

517
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,420
and even be flexible in your essays.

518
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,900
How did you manage that?

519
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,220
Is it hard?

520
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,300
Just don't study rigidly.

521
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,660
When the mentor explains,

522
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,340
he always focuses on the wording.

523
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,020
Although it's correct,

524
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,540
it stifles creativity

525
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,100
and limits perspectives.

526
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,840
We should understand
the principles ourselves

527
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,310
and not always think
that the authorities are right.

528
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,450
Shen Yangyang, you...

529
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,580
I think

530
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,780
Yangyang has a point.

531
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
Thank you, everyone.

532
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,500
Censor Pei, congrats on your promotion.

533
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,500
You've focused on working.

534
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,140
Now, you've finally achieved your wish.

535
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,220
With the increased salary,

536
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,860
you can bring your mother

537
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,340
to live in Yong'an.

538
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,980
The carriage is all arranged.

539
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,020
Mother will arrive soon.

540
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,300
Thank you for your care.

541
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,420
Now, you're willing to call me

542
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,180
Censor Pei today.

543
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,220
Actually, I understand

544
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,460
your intentions.

545
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,700
My clan is prominent.

546
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,540
In the clan,

547
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,100
I am the 47th.

548
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,020
I'm embarrassed to mention it to others.

549
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,100
In our branch,

550
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,380
I am already the 12th.

551
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,660
I can't benefit from the clan's glory.

552
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,740
With the successive deaths
of the elders,

553
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,400
I've delayed entering the Capital
due to mourning.

554
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,620
I am already old

555
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,620
and have only just entered
the Censorate.

556
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,300
I have never proposed to anyone

557
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,740
because I come from a prominent clan,

558
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,740
but I'm from a humble background.

559
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,060
How could I

560
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,940
burden a good lady?

561
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,060
My father passed away early;

562
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,180
my mother has been the one to carry on.

563
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,260
I'll definitely live with my mother.

564
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,180
It is I who has received
my mother's grace,

565
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,780
not my future wife.

566
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,100
How could I force someone else
to be filial?

567
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,260
With my meager salary,

568
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,260
how could I support two women

569
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,980
and future children?

570
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,260
If you had accepted me,

571
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,300
all of this would've been solved easily.

572
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,580
Why bother?

573
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,740
You're precious and noble.

574
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,020
In my eyes,

575
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,020
you are like a deity.

576
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,540
Why go through the trouble

577
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,500
of stooping down

578
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,900
into my mire?

579
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,620
I live alone,

580
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,800
supporting my widowed mother,

581
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,500
and I feel quite at ease in my heart.

582
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,540
But if someone else were to join me,

583
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,900
it'd reveal the hardships of my life.

584
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,460
I can afford it.

585
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,500
But I can't accept it.

586
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,380
Also,

587
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,860
I'm not willing to accept it.

588
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
All along,

589
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,500
I have only known

590
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,100
how to live clumsily.

591
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,780
That's why I am suited

592
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,460
to be an official in the Censorate.

593
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,980
I believe

594
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,020
that I can do more

595
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,620
for you,

596
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,060
for His Majesty's court,

597
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,860
and for this vast land.

598
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,820
But if I were to marry you

599
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,700
or a close lover of yours,

600
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,660
I wouldn't be able to be a good censor.

601
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,300
With myself entangled with you,

602
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,940
how could I have to criticize others?

603
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,220
I am filled with trepidation.

604
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,500
Please forgive me.

605
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,220
In that case,

606
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,820
I shall ask you one last question.

607
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,420
I've loved you.

608
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,580
That day,

609
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,220
you asked me

610
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,660
if I'd ever been sincere for a moment.

611
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,100
At that time,

612
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,540
I lied.

613
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,540
In truth,

614
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,180
it was more than just a moment
of sincerity.

615
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,980
I dare to admit

616
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,060
that I have fallen in love

617
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,140
with you.

618
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,900
What are you thinking?

619
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,380
I just wanted to ask you

620
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,300
how we should interact

621
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,300
when we meet again.

622
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,700
Your Highness,

623
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,780
you're the Princess.

624
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,140
I am

625
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,060
but a subordinate.

626
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,940
Lin Yan.

627
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,060
Cui Che.

628
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,460
I want you to suffer as well.

629
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,060
Mr. Cui,

630
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,340
please listen to the question.

631
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,700
Go ahead.

632
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,580
What is this?

633
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,020
This is called

634
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,100
ice skin mooncake.

635
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,900
Correct.

636
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,360
I remember everything you said.

637
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,660
In your place,

638
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,700
mooncakes, cucumbers,

639
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,700
and eggplants

640
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,460
have different names.

641
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,820
Father is called Dad.

642
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,220
Mother is called Mom.

643
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,180
Gongcai is your brother.

644
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,340
What do you call me?

645
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,540
Well.

646
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,460
Sweetie.

647
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,140
When you said that,

648
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,660
you sounded like someone from our era.

649
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,340
Thanks for your work.

650
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,100
Mom and Dad just got back from Jiangnan.

651
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,780
I wanted them to rest.

652
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,060
Gongcai is busy with the branch.

653
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,140
Yang Yang is preparing for exams.

654
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
Yu San and Deyuan are too tired
during the day.

655
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,180
I had no choice but to trouble you.

656
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,580
The Mid-Autumn banquet

657
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,460
is a gathering for our friends
and relatives.

658
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,140
It is only natural

659
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,260
for me to contribute.

660
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,920
The apron came undone.

661
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,860
Last year, on the Qixi Festival,

662
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,060
when you helped me make flower cakes

663
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,480
and I tied the apron for you,

664
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,960
your ears turned red.

665
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,940
Could it be that

666
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,780
you had lustful thoughts for me then?

667
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,540
Me?

668
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,060
Lustful thoughts?

669
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,540
That was too early.

670
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,700
No, no.

671
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,260
Don't you dare say it again.

672
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,140
It's not lust.

673
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,460
Then what is it?

674
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,780
It's

675
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,620
sincerity.

676
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,340
How cheesy.

677
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,260
What do you mean?

678
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,590
It's a compliment.

679
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,060
From your expression,

680
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,480
it doesn't seem like it.

681
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,140
(Shen's Diner)

682
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,340
Pour the wine.

683
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,240
Come on.

684
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,340
Don't be a sore loser.

685
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,380
Don't be a sore loser.

686
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,460
- Here.
- This is tasty.

687
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,040
- Two little bees.
- I'll get you this.

688
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,380
Flying into the flower garden.

689
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,540
Flying.

690
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,660
I'll drink.

691
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,080
Have you learned it yet?

692
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,860
I don't believe it.

693
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,860
One more time.

694
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,780
- Again.
- Again.

695
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,060
Come on, try one.

696
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,660
Delicious, right?

697
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Yes.

698
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,230
Did you have a good time in Jiangnan?

699
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,080
I did.

700
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,220
We'll go again next month.

701
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
Gongcai and Jicai can watch the diner.

702
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,300
You don't even feel sorry for the kids.

703
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,620
They've all grown up.

704
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,300
Where should we go next time?

705
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,260
I knew you wanted to go.

706
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,420
You're pretending not to.

707
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,780
Liu Feng,

708
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,300
you're celebrating the festival here.

709
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,580
Won't your grandfather scold you?

710
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,560
You're having a moon-viewing banquet.

711
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,800
How could I miss the fun?

712
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,960
Lady Jingwen, you made

713
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,300
these vegetarian meatballs, right?

714
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,180
They're so good.

715
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
Hasn't your grandfather

716
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,340
been urging you to get married?

717
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,780
Mr. Liu, you flatter me.

718
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,500
I've become the Yong'an Culinary Master.

719
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,220
He won't force me anymore.

720
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,700
The mooncakes are here.

721
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,100
Each layer has a different flavor.

722
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,380
Please choose for yourselves.

723
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,220
Mooncakes.

724
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,480
The mooncakes are here.

725
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,780
My wife and I

726
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,180
made all of them.

727
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,140
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

728
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,180
One for each person.

729
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,220
Don't take more than one.

730
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,460
Please sit down and eat.

731
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,180
Deyuan.

732
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,460
Someone's coming.

733
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,020
Gentlemen.

734
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,340
We've informed the Palace.

735
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,780
We're having a lively gathering

736
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,540
with our neighbors in Juxian Alley.

737
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,660
We'll end before the Xu hour.

738
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,020
Mr. Cui and Lady Shen prepared

739
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,100
some mooncakes for you.

740
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,940
Please accept them.

741
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,220
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

742
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,380
Thank you.

743
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,740
Everyone.

744
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,940
May you all always be as perfect

745
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,540
and complete as this moon.

746
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,100
Good.

747
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,260
Dad, you made the Spring Water Lamb?

748
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,100
Of course.

749
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,900
For some reason,

750
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,700
I suddenly wanted

751
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,860
to make it again.

752
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,700
It's absolutely delicious.

753
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,060
You must all try it.

754
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,700
My skills have definitely improved.

755
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,740
Sweetheart, try it.

756
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,300
Father.

757
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,540
What does that mean?

758
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,700
Don't call me that

759
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,740
in front of the children.

760
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,580
It's okay.

761
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,460
- Try some.
- Let them try.

762
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,820
Everyone, please try.

763
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,780
San, eat.

764
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,700
Here I go.

765
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,540
I'll try.

766
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,380
Come on, everyone.

767
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,500
Come on.

768
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,960
- This is delicious.
- Sure.

769
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,960
Won't you have a piece?

770
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,080
I've had several pieces.

771
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,540
Delicious.

772
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,620
See? Tasty, right?

773
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,500
Fire!

774
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,860
Fire!

775
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,020
Fire!

776
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,960
Fire!

777
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Fire!

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,220
Fire!

779
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,500
Make way.

780
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,460
Put out the fire.

781
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,380
Put out the fire!

782
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,620
Fire!

783
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,140
Fire!

784
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,900

to us modern people.)

794
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,220
(and drink from the same gourd.)

795
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,220
