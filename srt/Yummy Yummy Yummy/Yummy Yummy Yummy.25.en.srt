2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 25=

3
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,120
Fengxia,

4
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,430
please believe me.

5
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,270
I really didn't do anything.

6
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,620
My only mistake is

7
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,990
that when I entered this tavern,

8
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,400
I should have gone in to see

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,680
if this is a legitimate one.

10
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,430
If not, then I shouldn't go in.

11
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,950
All these years,

12
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,430
don't you trust my character?

13
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
Come here.

14
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
Sit here.

15
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,800
Then let's make a deal.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,270
You can't hit me.

17
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,520
Sit down.

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,270
Shen Jianshe,

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,150
do you still remember

20
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,400
how many years we've been married.

21
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,590
It should be...

22
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
About 20...

23
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,080
33 years.

24
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,480
The two of us,

25
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,120
from modern times to Yong'an,

26
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,220
have gone through all the ups and downs
over the years.

27
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,750
I originally thought our days
would keep getting better,

28
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,170
and the feelings between us

29
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,520
would also grow deeper and deeper.

30
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,030
But now

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm finding it harder to recognize you.

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,310
Fengxia,

33
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,710
this is what I want to tell you.

34
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,640
I'm also torn about this matter.

35
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,310
That day Yangyang told me,

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,800
saying, look, after we came to Yong'an,

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,960
Grandpa, you've become a top chef;

38
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,310
Gongcai

39
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,830
has a lot of fans;

40
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,680
Jicai is pretty good in every aspect;

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
only grandma seems unhappy,

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
and didn't make any progress.

43
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,920
I felt really sad when I heard it.

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,870
Why did I say that day

45
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,270
you need to get to know us again?

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,520
That is, you need to see our progress

47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,710
and you have to see the good in us.

48
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,870
You told me yourself

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,150
that I have a bad temper,

50
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,870
I just hit you,

51
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,110
scold you,

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,760
pinch you, and kick you.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,360
Do you know why?

54
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
Money, I guess.

55
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,270
Without money,

56
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,480
life was hard.

57
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,990
How could you be in a good mood?

58
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,200
What I don't understand is

59
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,310
that we have money now,

60
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
why do you still...

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,550
I don't understand.

62
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,280
Ever since coming to Yong'an

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,280
you have all improved.

64
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,900
Only I

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,900
is still busy with pointless things
every day.

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,070
I don't have a life of my own.

67
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,360
When I get anxious,

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,240
I just can't help but shout

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,070
and lose my temper.

70
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,480
I really haven't changed at all.

71
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,080
I'm so pathetic, right?

72
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,550
Well, you...

73
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,160
Shen Jianshe,

74
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,920
do you still remember
what I looked like when I was young?

75
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,470
I do.

76
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
You look nice.

77
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,150
Beautiful.

78
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
But you have always been like this,

79
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,680
always hitting and scolding me.

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,430
Seems like you really
have forgotten everything.

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,240
When we first got together,

82
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,550
you said you like my gentleness.

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,630
Because you can never make money,

84
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,900
and I've always had to work hard,

85
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,990
so I've developed this temper today.

86
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,550
After coming to Yong'an,

87
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,680
whatever you do is always right,

88
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,070
no flaws.

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,070
Everything you do is perfect,

90
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,360
including the food you cook.

91
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,280
It's all first-class as well.

92
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,600
Do you believe it?

93
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,360
Forget it, let's leave it at that.

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,870
I misjudged you.

95
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,430
(Divorce Letter: Shen Jianshe
is heartless and unjust,)

96
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,280
(unworthy of being a father
and grandfather.)

97
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,180
(Li Fengxia divorces Shen Jianshe today.
This is to certify.)

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,560
This...

99
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,040
Divorce letter?!

100
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,380
(Capital Prefecture)

101
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,680
Young Master.

102
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,680
Young Master.

103
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,920
According to information provided
by Lady Zheng's husband,

104
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,590
Vice Minister Cao

105
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,440
captured a group of people
from the Dou family.

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,120
The Dou family?

107
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,160
People from the Ministry of Justice

108
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,310
said there was suspicion about my
and my brother's household registration.

109
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,070
They detained us.

110
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
It was you who instigated it, right?

111
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,680
You are also an official.

112
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Illegal detention,

113
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,190
abuse of torture.

114
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,390
Aren't you afraid

115
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,750
of losing your official hat?

116
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,680
There isn't a single wound on your body.

117
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,360
Who can prove that I used lynching?

118
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,440
You...!

119
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,630
Dou Shiba,

120
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,600
native of Fenglin Town,

121
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,870
six years ago,

122
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,630
administrative officer
of the Jinwu Guards,

123
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,600
reported dead from illness later.

124
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,160
In the registry,

125
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,680
you are a dead man.

126
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,120
Who will investigate

127
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,800
the whereabouts of a dead man?

128
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,330
Could it be

129
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,550
that it's the person behind you?

130
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,240
That's truly something
I couldn't wish for more.

131
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,630
I understand now.

132
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,630
Your purpose

133
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,040
is to find the person behind me.

134
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,680
Alright.

135
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,160
I can tell you.

136
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,360
The person behind me

137
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,070
is myself.

138
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,950
You petty coward,

139
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,480
I will never confess.

140
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,360
You've used the water drip torture,

141
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,840
and also steamed me.

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,190
Bring it on.

143
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,600
I can handle it.

144
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,200
You don't dare to see blood.

145
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,870
What can you do with me?

146
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,870
Those people under you

147
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,990
have all been beheaded
and submitted to the law.

148
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,200
These are the precious heads
of the brothers

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,870
who have gone through life and death
with you.

150
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,750
If they can't stay with you,

151
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,510
wouldn't that be a pity?

152
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,910
You... what are you going to do?

153
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,990
What are you going to do?

154
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,030
You... how dare you?

155
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,670
How dare you?

156
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,480
The man behind me

157
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,390
will never let you go.

158
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,200
You petty coward!

159
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,840
You bunch of corrupt officials!

160
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,630
You bunch of corrupt officials!

161
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,360
You bunch of corrupt officials!

162
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,630
Don't!

163
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,680
Don't!

164
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,080
The man behind me

165
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,870
will never let you go.

166
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,360
Don't!

167
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,060
(Upright in Speech and Conduct)

168
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,240
He confessed all.

169
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,750
You've already read the confession?

170
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,840
It really is him?

171
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,960
A few wooden balls,

172
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,360
painted with some paint

173
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,600
and disguised as bloodied human heads,

174
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,560
were enough to scare Dou Shiba
out of his wits.

175
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
But how many people

176
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,270
have died in vain

177
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
because of him and that prince?

178
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,420
(Testimony)

179
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,940
(...falsely reported dead from illness
but actually worked for Prince Zhao.)

180
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,900
(Dou Shiba)

181
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,440
The Dou family continually
amassed wealth

182
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,990
and then delivered them to his hands.

183
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,360
They wanted so much money

184
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,960
just to support these people

185
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,030
and strengthen their own power.

186
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Both salt

187
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,920
and iron

188
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,320
are controlled.

189
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,840
Prince Zhao needs these

190
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,270
and also provisions.

191
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,710
Dou Shiba

192
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,720
is responsible for delivering money
and goods.

193
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,200
According to him,

194
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,960
things from everywhere

195
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,600
will be assigned

196
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,830
by a liaison.

197
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,960
They were very cautious.

198
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Dou Shiba couldn't meet the liaison.

199
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,960
They chose to meet at the ghost market.

200
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
That liaison

201
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,360
only sent his own attendant there.

202
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,390
The market fears being caught
by the Jinwu Guards.

203
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,550
So the location is not fixed.

204
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,910
It's hard for us to stake out.

205
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,200
However, Dou Shiba was quite cautious.

206
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,030
He followed that attendant

207
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,390
and knew that person

208
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,430
has business in Juxian Alley.

209
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,870
Juxian Alley?

210
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,820
(Juxian Alley)

211
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,660
(Shen's Diner)

212
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,960
The Ministry of Justice
caught a group of thieves.

213
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,120
They have a hideout in Juxian Alley.

214
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,440
I just came

215
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,240
to remind you

216
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,200
to be extra careful in everything.

217
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,630
That's all.

218
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,350
You can go back.

219
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,710
OK.

220
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,990
Many thanks, Mr. Lin.

221
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,320
It's the matter
of the Ministry of Justice.

222
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,030
You found out so quickly

223
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,510
and even came specifically
to remind us to be careful.

224
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,720
It's my duty

225
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,750
to ensure the safety of Juxian Alley.

226
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,200
Could their hideout in Juxian Alley

227
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,960
be related to you reversing the case?

228
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,840
We are more familiar with here.

229
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,690
We can help you.

230
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,580
None of your business.

231
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,720
I understand now.

232
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,390
Then I'll take my leave first.

233
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,390
Mr. Lin, please wait a minute.

234
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,790
You're getting busy.

235
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,360
Did you forget to eat again?

236
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,720
This is called a boxed meal,

237
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,870
easy to eat.

238
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,780
(Try it with chopsticks)

239
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,790
It's your idea again?

240
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,560
This is the takeaway box I made.

241
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,030
The meaning of 'takeaway' is,

242
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,080
no need to worry
about wasting leftover food,

243
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,910
you can take it away in a box.

244
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,940
(Shen's takeout is really fast)

245
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,200
You bore no grudge

246
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,150
and personally came to deliver the news.

247
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,720
We are extremely grateful.

248
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,960
If you are willing,

249
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,880
we can still deliver meals to you
in the future.

250
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,920
Thank you.

251
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,670
You don't have to.

252
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,080
Just take good care of yourselves.

253
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,120
Lady Shen.

254
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,440
Young Master,

255
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,200
I wasn't eavesdropping.

256
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,750
I overheard it by accident.

257
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,990
Why do you refuse

258
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,720
them to bring you food?

259
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,200
I see

260
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,670
you're not angry anymore.

261
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,860
(Try it with chopsticks)

262
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,780
(Shen's Diner)

263
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,960
We're back.

264
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,480
You're back.

265
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
Deyuan, thank you

266
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,600
for picking up Yangyang.

267
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
Later we'll quickly hire another person.

268
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,160
Not at all.

269
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,440
You taught me, charge me up.

270
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,150
Yangyang seemed a bit unhappy.

271
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,870
She didn't say anything all the way.

272
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,320
Your pout is so exaggerated
it could hang an oil bottle.

273
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,670
Talk to me

274
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,270
who upset you.

275
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,200
During recess today,

276
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,510
everyone started talking
about their fathers.

277
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,790
I said my father is especially amazing;

278
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,990
he works alone outside to earn money;

279
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,200
it's just that he hasn't come back
for a long time.

280
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,840
But they all said

281
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,440
my father doesn't want me anymore.

282
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,630
Which child talked so carelessly?

283
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,740
It's fine.

284
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,010
They didn't understand anything.

285
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,750
- Auntie.
- Don't cry.

286
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,360
You told me before,

287
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
although my father is quite silly,

288
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,840
and also unreliable,

289
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,270
he loves me very much.

290
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,750
He... he would never abandon me.

291
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,560
But

292
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,960
he hasn't written since the New Year.

293
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,360
He's so stupid

294
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,720
and so unreliable.

295
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,270
I'm afraid something really happened
to him.

296
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,390
No, that won't happen.

297
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,790
Your father is a fool blessed with luck.

298
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,840
He will definitely be fine.

299
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,680
Excuse me, a letter for you.

300
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,840
Give it to me.

301
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,120
- See? Don't cry.
- Thank you.

302
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,870
It must be a letter from your father.

303
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,160
Milady.

304
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,840
It's father.

305
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,800
Family members,

306
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,560
this letter arrived a bit late.

307
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,360
Because it took some time

308
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,710
to bravely climb to the peak.

309
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,000
My acting career has begun
to take shape.

310
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,320
I have the principal,

311
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
and plan

312
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,190
(Divine Pancake - Jianbing Guozi)
to run a branch of Shen's Diner.

313
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,040
Hello, everyone.

314
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,040
Everyone, look at me.

315
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,520
Everyone, don't miss out

316
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,670
as you pass by.

317
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,080
Everyone, come

318
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,920
and take a look.

319
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,230
Everyone,

320
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,630
I am the founder of Shen's Diner,

321
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,430
a famous restaurant in Yong'an.

322
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,870
Have you heard of it?

323
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,730
- No.
- No.

324
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,610
Never.

325
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,450
It's fine.

326
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,000
Shen's Diner

327
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
is practically the second cafeteria

328
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,760
for the Vice Prefect.

329
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,870
We have also prepared meals

330
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,360
at the poetry gathering

331
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
of Princess Fuhui.

332
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,520
So what I bring today

333
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,840
is the signature dish of Shen's Diner,

334
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,320
Jianbing Guozi.

335
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,870
Our Jianbing Guozi

336
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,800
are in limited quantity.

337
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,840
First come, first served.

338
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,320
Only ten qian each.

339
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,180
Isn't it very cheap?

340
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,630
Ten qian?!

341
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,800
No, no, no.

342
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,870
Jianbing Guozi?

343
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,230
I heard that it has been popular
in Yong'an for a while.

344
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,760
But it is too expensive.

345
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

346
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,080
You get what you pay for.

347
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,280
Today, in front of everyone present,

348
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,080
I will give you all a demonstration.

349
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,360
Is... is this pancake burnt?

350
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,870
No, as for our Jianbing Guozi,

351
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,900
the key is to first lightly
scorch the pancake

352
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,910
and then brush with oil.

353
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,760
That way, it will be
both fragrant and crispy.

354
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,120
How did it get burnt?

355
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,120
This is exactly

356
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,430
the Divine Pancake.

357
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,030
Have a taste.

358
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,950
Try it, try it.

359
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,870
Family members,

360
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,120
I didn't expect

361
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,950
the dishes of the Shen Diner's
are so popular.

362
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,470
Everyone's enthusiasm is unstoppable.

363
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,780
This flavor is indeed...

364
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,420
(Pancake)

365
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,760
(Tea)
Thus

366
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,710
I have decided
to promote the franchise model

367
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,760
and let everyone get involved,

368
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,150
so that Shen's Diner become famous
across the country.

369
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,630
I believe everyone present here

370
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,390
is a business elite,

371
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,040
all looking for high-quality

372
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,560
and promising projects.

373
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,730
I,

374
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,280
as the founder of Shen's Diner,

375
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,670
can confidently tell you

376
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,600
that as long as you

377
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,870
join us,

378
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,650
you are guaranteed to make a fortune.

379
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,520
Join?

380
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,440
What does joining mean?

381
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,920
Sir, what are you talking about?

382
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,490
We can't understand a word of it.

383
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,150
Joining us,

384
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,080
that is to say,

385
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,520
if you all wish to open a restaurant,

386
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,430
you can

387
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,080
use the name of Shen's Diner.

388
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,040
In this way,

389
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,900
every month,

390
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,320
I only charge you

391
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,360
500 qian.

392
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,840
- 500 qian?
- 500 qian?

393
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,950
Don't believe him.

394
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,040
He's just a fraud.

395
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,390
How could I be a fraud?

396
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,000
You run around the streets all day long.

397
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,570
I've spotted you several times already.

398
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,950
Aren't you the one who makes,

399
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,120
makes pancakes?

400
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,870
Yes, I've seen him too.

401
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,800
- Right?
- His pancake

402
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,470
is terrible, totally inedible.

403
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,430
What's wrong with that?

404
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,490
Can't I do something else?

405
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,430
As a talent like me,

406
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,950
can't I have a diversified development?

407
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,190
You perform for a living today.

408
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,270
You sell pancakes tomorrow.

409
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,650
Do you have a single truthful word?

410
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,830
Why do I never have the truth?

411
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,120
Yes, yes, I remembered too.

412
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,760
He's truly a fraud.

413
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,320
See? I told you I wasn't mistaken.

414
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,120
Report to the authorities
and arrest him!

415
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,460
- Stop.
- Arrest him, arrest him!

416
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,120
Don't let him get away.

417
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,520
Don't run, don't run.

418
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,600
Don't let him get away.

419
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,770
Don't run.

420
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,360
The franchise business is booming.

421
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,630
I have also made many friends

422
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,560
because of this,

423
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,670
which allowed me to smoothly step

424
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,190
(Groceries)

425
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,520
into calligraphy community,

426
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,280
embarking on a new stage

427
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,360
of life.

428
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,610
(My current situation requires me
to seek help from others.)

429
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,690
(I encountered some challenges
in my life)

430
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,560
(that temporarily put me
in a difficult situation,)

431
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,900
(and I am grateful for your help
or encouragement.)

432
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,950
Who doesn't have a child?

433
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,150
I'm really ashamed

434
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,190
going back to face Yangyang again.

435
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,470
I miss Yangyang very much.

436
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,950
Hope she enjoys going to school.

437
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,100
(Recruitment)

438
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Let's take a look.

439
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,000
What is posted?

440
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,230
What is this?

441
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,870
Recruitment?

442
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,190
I never heard of this before.

443
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,910
Please take a look.

444
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,230
(Shen's Diner)

445
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,630
What is it for?

446
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,080
Thanks to everyone's support,

447
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,430
the business of our diner

448
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,320
is becoming more and more prosperous.

449
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,470
But nowadays,

450
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,220
we really are too busy
to handle everything,

451
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,840
so we are posting a job advertisement

452
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
to find a helper.

453
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,840
We are currently hiring a chef

454
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,600
who is skilled in cooking local dishes

455
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,120
and is also kind-hearted.

456
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
Looking for slaves?

457
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,470
Then just find a broker to buy one.

458
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,180
- Yes.
- Yeah, why make it so complicated?

459
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,330
We don't buy or sell people.

460
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,040
And you don't need to sign a slave deed.

461
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,870
A labor contract is Ok.

462
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,150
Labor contract?

463
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,000
Then you can get paid monthly.

464
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,440
If you're not happy with the work,

465
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,800
give one month's notice in advance,

466
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,120
and you can quit your boss.

467
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,910
Quit the boss?

468
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,710
What is this labor contract?

469
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,000
Quit the boss?

470
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,080
This must be a scam, right?

471
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,670
It's really not a scam.

472
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,470
I just signed the labor contract.

473
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,000
I can take eight days off each month.

474
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,280
And I eat my meals at the diner.

475
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,040
- Yes.
- I can even keep a cat.

476
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Sometimes I get up later than the boss.

477
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,840
Really?

478
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,840
It's true.

479
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,950
Isn't this a restaurant?

480
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,390
Why does it feel like a charity hall?

481
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,550
Exactly.

482
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
I can't believe it.

483
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,800
What are you doing?

484
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,690
Why are you pushing me?

485
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,370
No.

486
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,230
Why did you tear it?

487
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,560
Others still want to see it.

488
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,000
A low-grade eatery like this

489
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,630
only needs me

490
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
alone.

491
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,040
What does this person mean?

492
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,820
(Shen's Diner)

493
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,120
Young man,

494
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,670
you know cooking skills?

495
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,880
No.

496
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,850
No?

497
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,630
Then why did you tear it?

498
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,190
Why do you ask me such nonsense?

499
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,330
If I don't know how to cook,

500
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,330
what do I come here for?

501
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,960
Young man,

502
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,950
don't just know how to talk big.

503
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,560
Do you have real skills?

504
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,160
Have a taste.

505
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,960
It's you.

506
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,390
This fish is really good.

507
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,230
Mr. Pei,

508
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,740
this dish, Peacock Spreading Its Tail,

509
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,910
is made by Yu San

510
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,120
whom we newly hired.

511
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,710
Not satisfied?

512
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,760
No, no.

513
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,600
Delicious.

514
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,630
Very delicious.

515
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,000
Lady Shen,

516
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,360
you introduce your chef to the public
in such a way.

517
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,560
Aren't you afraid
that after he becomes famous,

518
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,710
he will ran away?

519
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,760
That's because he's highly capable.

520
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,710
Being able to hire him
is my good fortune.

521
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,000
Being able to keep him

522
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,270
is my real skill.

523
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,630
During the festival,

524
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,840
you had a quarrel with the Princess.

525
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,150
Haven't you made up yet?

526
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,360
The entire court is talking

527
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,910
about that she has dismissed

528
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,280
all the men around her.

529
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,150
How could I

530
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,230
let go?

531
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,230
Mr. Pei,

532
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,550
you're confident.

533
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,190
Maybe Her Highness has grown tired
of them

534
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,190
or perhaps those people made a mistake.

535
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,470
It may not have anything to do with you.

536
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,200
Yes,

537
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,000
maybe it's like this.

538
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,360
So...

539
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,000
So it still has nothing to do with me,

540
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,230
right?

541
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,760
Mr. Pei,

542
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,320
you clearly have Her Highness
in your heart.

543
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,190
Otherwise, you wouldn't think this way.

544
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,840
But what's the use?

545
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,430
It's just like...

546
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,150
It's like you and Anran.

547
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,040
Even I can see

548
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,390
that you like each other.

549
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,230
But now,

550
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,520
no one is looking for each other
anymore.

551
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,510
Forget it.

552
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,800
Anyway,

553
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,670
he's about to get engaged
to another Lady Shen.

554
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,910
Why bring that up?

555
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,360
During the court's adjournment,

556
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,770
Chancellor Meng admitted it himself.

557
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,840
He said that Anran is about

558
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,350
to become his granddaughter's husband.

559
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,230
In fact,

560
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,280
we are both the same,

561
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,230
both pitiful people

562
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,710
whose beloved

563
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,430
is far beyond our reach.

564
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,430
What did you say?

565
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,870
You clearly heard it all.

566
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,910
Why make me say it again?

567
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,600
♪You smile so sweetly♪

568
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:20,230
♪Like flowers blooming
in the spring breeze♪

569
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,000
♪Today is a good day♪

570
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,840
Morning, Zhao.

571
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,160
Morning.

572
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,120
Hello, Ms. Li.

573
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,670
Hello, Mr. He.

574
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,560
I often see you busy working
in the diner.

575
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,040
How come you have time
to hang out today?

576
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,840
Well, we just hired a new worker.

577
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,000
He is capable.

578
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,040
So I can free up my hands
from the kitchen.

579
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
That's good.

580
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,710
Take a look at the new jewelry
I just got.

581
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,670
I also left one for my wife.

582
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,670
- Really?
- Take a look.

583
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,150
It looks really nice.

584
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,800
The quality is indeed excellent.

585
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,340
Let me tell you,

586
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,620
when I first arrived in Yong'an,

587
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,390
I sold my gold bracelet.

588
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,240
I kept saying

589
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,840
that I want to buy one I like again.

590
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,430
Let me give it a try.

591
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,190
This one seems small.

592
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,360
I can't put it on.

593
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,560
My hands

594
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,120
have become rough

595
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,520
from all these years of hard work.

596
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,120
Let me tell you,

597
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,430
I was very beautiful when I was young.

598
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,150
A woman should complement the jewelry,

599
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,650
not the jewelry complements the woman.

600
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,710
That's not the case now, I'm old.

601
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,870
It's OK.

602
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,440
I

603
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,150
have prettier ones.

604
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,870
Try this.

605
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,120
The quality is better.

606
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,320
You're familiar with my wife.

607
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,710
She also often says
she's not good-looking anymore.

608
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,670
Then I'm thinking

609
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,860
if she has gotten thin from being tired,

610
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,080
no longer plump.

611
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,190
Isn't it all my fault?

612
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,630
She likes jewelry.

613
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,560
I just went into this business.

614
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,910
If she is well dressed,

615
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,080
she'll be happy.

616
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,040
When a woman

617
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,120
is happy,

618
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,600
she looks beautiful.

619
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,190
Look at you.

620
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,360
Mr. He, you're really good with words.

621
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,120
Just for that,

622
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll take everything

623
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,120
you have here today.

624
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,880
Everything?

625
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,230
I can make money now too.

626
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,760
Why should I still wrong myself?

627
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,630
I'll just buy whatever I like.

628
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,120
If I buy it, I will be happy, won't I?

629
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,230
When I'm happy,
I look good no matter what.

630
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,070
Isn't it?

631
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,390
That's right.

632
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,670
Alright.

633
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,670
I'll wrap it up for you.

634
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,510
Alright.

635
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,230
Here.

636
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,230
Take it.

637
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,230
Wrap all of these up for me.

638
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,070
All of them.

639
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,560
Make yourself clear.

640
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,760
Why exactly do I have such a bad temper?

641
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,800
How would I know

642
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,600
why you have such a bad temper?

643
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,910
When we were dating,
your temper was like this.

644
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,000
When we got married,
your temper was also like this.

645
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,280
From our wedding day until today,

646
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,670
hasn't your temper stayed the same?

647
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,400
Except hitting me,

648
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,040
pinching me, scolding me,
and kicking me,

649
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,120
what else can you do?

650
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,230
I am a man.

651
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,800
I also have dignity.

652
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,120
Can't you feel a little sorry for me?

653
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,950
Why can't you be a bit more tolerant
with me?

654
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,840
Why can't you treat me a little better?

655
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,390
Ever since coming to Yong'an,

656
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,190
you have all improved.

657
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,900
Only I

658
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,840
am still busy with pointless things
every day.

659
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,910
I don't have a life of my own.

660
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,230
When I get anxious,

661
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,190
I just can't help but shout

662
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,870
and lose my temper.

663
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,360
I really haven't changed at all.

664
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,150
How is it? Does it look good?

665
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,080
Very good!
I think every piece suits you.

666
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,270
Alright.

667
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,990
Wrap this up for me.

668
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,360
- OK.
- I'll take this one too.

669
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,870
These two, wrap them both up.

670
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,840
- Come on.
- Alright.

671
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,800
I'll take them all.

672
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,870
Wrap them all up for me.

673
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,840
OK.

674
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,510
Here, take it.

675
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,590
- Lady Li.
- OK.

676
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,460
All wrapped up.

677
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,190
Let me know when new goods arrive.

678
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,120
Alright.

679
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,000
Take care.

680
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,910
I'm off.

681
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,840
Nice.

682
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,600
I'm really having a great time today.

683
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,510
Nice.

684
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,600
Father, where are you going?

685
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,760
You haven't been in the diner much
lately.

686
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,220
My mother is not in the diner either.

687
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,150
What have you all been busy with?

688
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,040
Your mother has been going out
alone a lot recently.

689
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
I'm just worried
something might happen to her.

690
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,870
I have to ensure her safety.

691
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,710
So I just...

692
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,870
I... I followed her.

693
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,390
No, she... she always goes out alone.

694
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,870
Now she has money.

695
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,230
When people have money,
they might turn bad.

696
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,630
She is now rich.

697
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,910
She might have...

698
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,060
Have what?

699
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,990
No, no.

700
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,710
What I mean is...

701
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,550
Have what?

702
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,470
Well, what if, you know.

703
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,670
What if...?

704
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,390
What did you find?

705
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,920
I...

706
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,230
I just...

707
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,550
I followed her for a whole day,

708
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,520
and watched your mother

709
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,800
buy, buy, buy.

710
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,670
And nothing else.

711
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,040
I'm really speechless.

712
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,710
My mother caught you
going to the tavern.

713
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,670
She never suspected you.

714
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,630
You suspected her?

715
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,230
She even told you about this.

716
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,230
Whatever.

717
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,840
Anyway, I've got no dignity left.

718
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,470
What else did she say?

719
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,510
My mother said she knows you're not

720
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,120
the kind of person with a wandering eye.

721
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,430
I think so too.

722
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,940
Father, you don't have any money
in modern times.

723
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,670
You can't even tell
which place is a club.

724
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,120
That's simply a mistake.

725
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,630
That's true.

726
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,040
That's just a misunderstanding.

727
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
That's a mistake.

728
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,950
Sit down.

729
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,080
Well,

730
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,310
am I your father

731
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,480
or are you my mother?

732
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,000
Listen to me first.

733
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,270
Go ahead.

734
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,270
Although you didn't
make a fundamental mistake,

735
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,190
you really made my mother sad.

736
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,750
I know it wasn't easy for you
to raise Gongcai and me.

737
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,920
Especially my mother.

738
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,400
She has been working so hard.

739
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,230
I've seen old photos
of my mother before.

740
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,440
She was very beautiful.

741
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,890
When I was a child,
she also loved to dress up.

742
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,700
But later, our family situation
got worse,

743
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,520
and she sold all her jewelry,

744
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,000
keeping only a gold ring

745
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,120
and a gold bracelet.

746
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,440
After we came to ancient times,

747
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,480
she sold these two

748
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,230
for us.

749
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,310
Actually, after the diner was opened,

750
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,880
I also bought gold for her.

751
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,800
But things like the ring

752
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,640
and bracelets

753
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,270
should be bought by you.

754
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,440
So what did you end up buying?

755
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,080
A big carriage.

756
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,480
Your performance completely
missed the point.

757
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,350
My mother must be heartbroken.

758
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,590
My dear daughter,

759
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,310
you don't know.

760
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,480
Your mother has truly given up on me.

761
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,920
She doesn't want me anymore.

762
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,000
She wrote me a divorce letter.

763
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,440
When we were poor before

764
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,350
and had no money,

765
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,080
she never said she wanted to leave me.

766
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,960
But now...

767
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,270
(Divorce Letter)
We finally have some money now.

768
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,960
She easily gave up on me.

769
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,790
It's all my fault

770
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,310
for having a stupid head.

771
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,350
I shouldn't have said those words.

772
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,270
What did you say?

773
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,960
I said that she has a bad temper;

774
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,980
that she still dislikes me
for not having money.

775
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,190
Then I also said she just knows
how to kick me,

776
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,470
hit me and scold me.

777
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,880
She has always been like this.

778
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,080
Was my mother like this
when she was young?

779
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,600
Your mother was quite gentle
when she was young.

780
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,000
It's indeed my lack of drive.

781
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,350
I have to rely on her for everything.

782
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,560
This... this... Gradually...

783
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,710
How could I just forget it?

784
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,800
Shaoguang,

785
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,710
let's not talk about it.

786
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,550
Just tell me

787
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,800
whether your mother

788
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,600
really wants to divorce me.

789
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,960
If my mother really decides
to divorce you,

790
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,880
I will support her.

791
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,520
How can you support her?

792
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,350
If you support her, you will lose me.

793
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,000
But think about it.

794
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,340
My mother has money now.

795
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,680
Why is she still living here?

796
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,850
Why didn't she buy a big house

797
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,880
to live in?

798
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,150
So what you mean is...

799
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,750
I still have a chance.

800
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,830
That depends on you.

801
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,410
You need to stay humble and grounded.

802
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,150
Maybe her attitude can be changed.

803
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,000
I can definitely stay humble
and grounded.

804
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,880
By the way,

805
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,520
in a few days,

806
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,390
the Culinary Master Competition
will be held.

807
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,350
Can you bring her here?

808
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,750
Let her see that I'm not as lazy
as before.

809
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,630
I have reflected.

810
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,520
I have improved.

811
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,150
Is it OK?

812
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,750
Do your best.

813
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,920
Shaoguang,

814
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,330
you've done quite a lot of work.

815
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,270
You... you are tired.

816
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,440
You're tired.

817
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,710
I'll handle

818
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,550
the whole job.

819
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,600
You take a rest.

820
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,500
(Li Fengxia divorces Shen Jianshe
today.)

821
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,440
What are you doing?

822
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,310
I...

823
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,940
I accidentally got lost.

824
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,230
I accidentally walked into the study,

825
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,480
accidentally came into this room,

826
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,880
accidentally unlocked this lock

827
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,520
and then came in.

828
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,590
Mr. Lin,

829
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,960
my father said it would never happen.

830
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,480
But there probably won't be a next time.

831
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,990
Young Master.

832
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,520
That Ms. Du you asked me to find,

833
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,480
the one who previously
deceived Mr. Shen.

834
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,920
I did as you taught me.

835
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,700
I told her

836
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,530
that she carries quite a lot
on her shoulders,

837
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,790
and it's all very subtle.

838
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,120
To judge or not to judge,

839
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,290
it's just a matter of a word.

840
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,840
Sure enough,

841
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,440
she immediately agreed to help us

842
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,040
and dare not let any word slip.

843
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,650
She trades in mansions,

844
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,040
taking both open and secret routes,

845
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,580
and has a wider network
of information.

846
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,790
She should be able

847
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,040
to find out whether,
in Juxian Alley or elsewhere,

848
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,000
anyone has rented a private warehouse.

849
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,310
She actually mentioned someone,

850
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,150
who is clearly involved
in the food business

851
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,880
yet possesses a warehouse that can store

852
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,400
a lot of military equipment.

853
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,350
Who is it?

854
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,480
Yunlai Tavern.

855
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:32,870
Lu Yun.

856
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,150
Yunlai Tavern?

857
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,120
This Lu Yun

858
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,040
is very cautious.

859
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,350
He found quite a few people.

860
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,080
These warehouses are not under his name.

861
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,990
It doesn't matter.

862
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,310
Over time,

863
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,960
there are always traces.

864
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,830
Ms. Du

865
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,190
also asked me about Zhao Xunzhi
from the Hongwen Academy,

866
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,000
saying that he rented her house,

867
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
but owed the rent.

868
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,270
She said that previously Zhao Xunzhi

869
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,040
always liked to go to the Yunlai Tavern

870
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,940
for a couple of drinks.

871
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,440
One more thing.

872
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,520
This is sent over

873
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,830
by Chancellor Meng before dinner.

874
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,180
(On the Shangsi Festival, invite you
to join the Competition)

875
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,400
Is there something important?

876
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,790
The Culinary Master Competition.

877
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,500
Mr. Meng invites me to go together.

878
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,190
His granddaughter will also participate.

879
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,630
Well,

880
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,960
better refuse.

881
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,040
But Yunlai Tavern will also participate.

882
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,190
We can take the opportunity

883
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,540
to see if any clues can be found.

884
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,390
And...

885
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,270
Recently, my grandfather

886
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,560
has been busily making arrangements
for me.

887
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,440
It's truly overwhelming.

888
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,790
If you

889
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,670
can turn him down after this period,

890
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,560
then I can take advantage of these days

891
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,520
to handle the matter properly.

892
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,680
(Shaoguang's Food Notes)

893
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
(One more drink in Yong'an)

894
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
(At that time, the most common
was grain-fermented wine.)

895
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
(Without distillation technology,
it can only be just over ten degrees,)

896
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
(about the same level
as today's wine or yellow wine.)

897
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
(The most popular turbid wine
had an even shorter brewing time,)

898
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
(sweeter taste,
and lower alcohol content.)

899
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
(By today's standards,
it would be considered 'sweet water'.)

900
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,040

from drinking sweet water.)
