00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,990
=Yummy Yummy Yummy=

2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
The Censorate impeaches the Vice Prefect

4
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,480
for turning a blind eye to those
who set up temple music

5
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,970
on the streets at night.

6
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,860
Is this true?

7
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,650
Your Majesty,

8
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,050
I did consult with the Jinwu Guards

9
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
to occasionally allow
some flexibility for night travelers.

10
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,620
Your Majesty,

11
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,660
Mr. Lin did more than that.

12
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,910
After nightfall,

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,940
merchants are still
doing their business.

14
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,180
What should the Prefecture do?

15
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,060
Travel is prohibited
after the evening drum

16
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,600
and allowed after the morning bell.

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,380
But for example,
on the Mid-Autumn Festival,

18
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,200
the Market Director
needs to admire the moon.

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,840
No one beats the evening drum,

20
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,480
and the commoners don't know
that the night curfew has started.

21
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,060
Should we blame them?

22
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,300
Lin Anran,

23
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,740
during the festival,

24
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,820
it was you

25
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,900
who let the market officials
go home early,

26
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,700
causing the evening drum
not to be beaten.

27
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,740
At the festival,

28
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,940
isn't it right to let people

29
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,260
go home and reunite?

30
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,300
You are leading the violation
of the night curfew

31
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,500
and condoning bandits.

32
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,620
What are your intentions?

33
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,500
It's strange that since I took office,

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,260
not a single thief has been caught,

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,060
but ordinary people
who violate the curfew

36
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,740
are increasing day by day.

37
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,900
Mr. Lin,

38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,020
what do you mean by this?

39
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,540
Isn't this your dereliction of duty?

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,980
Vice Prefect,

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,140
why do the commoners
repeatedly violate the night curfew?

42
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,100
Under your rule,

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,380
the world is peaceful and clear,

44
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,640
and bandits are becoming fewer.

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
Take Juxian Alley as an example.

46
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,540
If the diners

47
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,500
are not careful,

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,540
merchants and customers

49
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,380
will travel home at night.

50
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,660
Over time,

51
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,380
the ghost market will naturally emerge.

52
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,340
If we prohibit it,

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,220
the people will inevitably complain.

54
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,580
But if we loosen up a bit

55
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,020
and nothing goes wrong,

56
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,100
it'll be more beneficial
to the people's livelihood.

57
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,500
This is the first time I've heard

58
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,580
of the ghost market.

59
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,780
It's a market set up at night, right?

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,860
Has the Ministry of Revenue
investigated it?

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,210
Your Majesty,

62
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,070
I...

63
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,660
Your Majesty,

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,340
these are the results of the discussions

65
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,140
between the Revenue and the Prefecture.

66
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,540
It's better to guide than to block.

67
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,980
Slightly relaxing the night curfew

68
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,740
will be more beneficial to market taxes.

69
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,860
Yes, yes.

70
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,740
Your Majesty,

71
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,980
secretly relaxing the curfew...

72
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,940
I know the Rites values
the ancestral system.

73
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,220
However, the world
is not governed in one way;

74
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,740
the state is not bound by ancient laws.

75
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,380
Relaxing a bit

76
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,180
is allowable.

77
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,220
The fever has subsided.

78
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,020
The punishment from the heavens

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,420
has finally ended.

80
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,140
Just forget all those things.

81
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,300
You often say things

82
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,820
that others don't understand.

83
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,780
It's nothing serious.

84
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,020
However,

85
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,420
in some word choices,

86
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,860
you should

87
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,780
be more cautious.

88
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,540
Drink the medicine.

89
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,540
If you feel unwell,

90
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,900
just call out.

91
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,340
(The ancestor claims
he doesn't remember,)

92
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,220
(but recently,)

93
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,940
(why has he become so gentle?)

94
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,380
You look like a demon.

95
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,540
Looking like this,

96
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,840
you must've scared the ancestor.

97
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,220
(Xuanzheng Gate)

98
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,860
Don't blame me for not covering for you.

99
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,380
In the Censorate,

100
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,660
I'm nothing.

101
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,540
No one told me
we were going to impeach you.

102
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,100
I was really worried

103
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,780
that you'd be punished,

104
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,980
but I didn't expect

105
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,500
that you'd remain calm

106
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,740
and even tease them.

107
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,860
Wait a minute.

108
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,140
Did you anticipate this?

109
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,100
So,

110
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,820
you're going with the flow.

111
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,740
Good for you.

112
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,020
If only I could be

113
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,380
as clever as you.

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,340
Alright.

115
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,580
Goodbye.

116
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,740
Mr. Lin,

117
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,700
please wait.

118
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,300
Mr. Cao.

119
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,940
Thank you

120
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,300
for your mooncake.

121
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,260
Could you come to my home for a chat?

122
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,300
Please.

123
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,460
(Cao Mansion)

124
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,420
(Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.
May you sail far)

125
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,820
(and come home to true friends
with aspirations unchanged.)

126
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,340
May you sail far

127
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,260
and come home

128
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,100
to true friends

129
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,900
with aspirations unchanged.

130
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,340
Mr. Lin,

131
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,180
when I came

132
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,340
to Yong'an to take office,

133
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,260
I stayed at a close friend's house.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,420
He wrote the Ode to Friends for me,

135
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,610
(Happy Mid-Autumn Festival)
which includes these lines.

136
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,220
I didn't expect

137
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,540
to see them again

138
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,540
in the handwriting attached

139
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,460
to the mooncake from you.

140
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,580
Your running script is

141
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,540
also similar to the handwriting
of my friend.

142
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,660
The running script
is connected in meaning,

143
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,460
so it's common

144
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,660
to be similar.

145
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,740
Yunlai Tavern's case could've been

146
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,460
handed over to the Judicial Review

147
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,980
since we have to recuse ourselves

148
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,740
due to the Shen family.

149
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,100
Why give it to the Justice?

150
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,580
Cao Rong from the Justice

151
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,140
is still just a Vice Minister

152
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,300
because

153
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,260
he is too upright and impartial,

154
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,460
making too many enemies.

155
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,080
There must be connections

156
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,780
in court behind Yunlai.

157
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,460
Let's use this case to test

158
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,900
whether Cao Rong

159
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,300
is truly upright

160
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,620
or just pretending.

161
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Didn't Cao Rong use

162
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,220
to be friends with your father?

163
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,500
Do you want to deal with him?

164
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,860
When your family got into trouble,

165
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,300
he didn't say a word.

166
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,460
Is it dangerous

167
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,540
to approach him rashly?

168
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,420
I didn't find anyone

169
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,340
speaking up for my family back then.

170
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,220
But I managed to look

171
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,700
at the documents from the Personnel.

172
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,460
After the Cui case,

173
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,260
Cao Rong was demoted for five years

174
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,620
without a clear reason.

175
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,820
I guess

176
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,940
he might have been punished

177
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,340
for speaking up

178
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,020
for Father.

179
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,500
Pardon my rudeness.

180
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,260
Your appearance

181
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,340
resembles

182
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,820
the wife of my old friend.

183
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,740
My old friend

184
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,660
was Cui Rangzhi from Qingyang.

185
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,580
His wife came

186
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,860
from the Lu family in Xiuzhou.

187
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,940
Have you ever known them?

188
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,940
The Cui family from Qingyang?

189
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,340
They were criminals

190
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,100
selling official positions 17 years ago.

191
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,660
And you were once their friend?

192
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,540
17 years ago,

193
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,780
you were just a young student.

194
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,380
How could you know about that case?

195
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,020
Cui was the Prefect back then,

196
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,100
but his crimes were obvious

197
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,340
and shocking.

198
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,580
Now, I am the Vice Prefect.

199
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,620
It's only natural for me to know

200
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,540
an old case with solid evidence.

201
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,100
What nonsense.

202
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,420
Rangzhi would never do such a thing.

203
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,340
Before the Judicial Review

204
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,180
could review the case,

205
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,300
Rangzhi died miserably in prison.

206
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,220
He must be innocent.

207
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,780
If that's true,

208
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,020
why didn't you speak up

209
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,940
for the Cui family back then?

210
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,620
You've just touched upon my sore spot.

211
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,980
Back then,

212
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,500
I was just a clerk in the Chancellery.

213
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
No one listened to me.

214
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,380
I kept petitioning

215
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,060
and was eventually demoted to Lingnan,

216
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,380
ending up with a broken family.

217
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,700
Living alone,

218
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,540
I now have nothing to lose.

219
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,300
Seven years.

220
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,780
It took me seven years

221
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,460
to return to the Capital.

222
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,660
I did everything I could
to get into the Justice,

223
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,980
and now I've reached this position.

224
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,900
I want to wait for the right moment.

225
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,100
One day,

226
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,980
I will clear the names

227
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,860
of Rangzhi's family.

228
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,180
It seems that you were indeed

229
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,120
a close friend of Cui Ning.

230
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,420
If there was new evidence

231
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,340
that could clear Cui Ning's name,

232
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,300
but it'd risk your life and fortune,

233
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,780
what would you do?

234
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,220
My life and fortune

235
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,180
are long gone.

236
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,100
Why ask me that?

237
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,540
You must be related to the Cui family.

238
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,780
Do you have any new evidence?

239
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,060
What would you do?

240
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,460
Hurry.

241
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,340
Let's go see His Majesty.

242
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,300
Mr. Cao,

243
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,980
calm down.

244
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,300
You just need to go with me

245
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,620
to clarify things before His Majesty.

246
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,860
Whatever happens,

247
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,260
I will take full responsibility.

248
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,540
I am no longer the clerk I used to be.

249
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,340
If I demonstrated my resolve
by hitting a pillar,

250
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,500
His Majesty

251
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,420
would not ignore this.

252
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,380
Mr. Cao,

253
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,020
calm down.

254
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,260
Why should I?

255
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
It's been 17 years.

256
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,780
My head should have shattered

257
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,620
for the Cui family long ago.

258
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,660
Mr. Cao, you mustn't.

259
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,860
Mr. Cao.

260
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,500
I have nothing to lose.

261
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,460
I...

262
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,940
Why hold me?

263
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,060
Mr. Cao.

264
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
Milord.

265
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,860
- Pastries are ready...
- Let go.

266
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,420
I'm Cui Che.

267
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,060
Greetings, Uncle.

268
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,790
Che.

269
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,860
Are you really Che?

270
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,580
I never expected

271
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,500
that in my lifetime,

272
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,700
I'd see Rangzhi's son again.

273
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,980
Sit.

274
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,140
Sit down.

275
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,100
Sorry

276
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,580
for all the tests just now.

277
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,380
It's alright.

278
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,700
It's good

279
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,860
that you're cautious.

280
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,460
Child,

281
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
you must've suffered a lot.

282
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
How did you survive?

283
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,660
When I was young,

284
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,660
Prince Zhao saved me.

285
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,620
Prince Zhao?

286
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,220
Why would he help you?

287
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,260
Prince Zhao used to correspond
with my father,

288
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,500
regarding him as a confidant.

289
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,900
When that case broke out,

290
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,380
he sent people to look for me.

291
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,580
At that time, his eldest son, Li Sheng,

292
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,780
was about to be made the heir,

293
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,060
but he died of illness.

294
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,980
And I

295
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,780
bore a resemblance to Li Sheng

296
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,660
and could comfort Prince Zhao.

297
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,100
So, he adopted me.

298
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,220
Luckily, it was Prince Zhao.

299
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,260
If it had been me back then,

300
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,930
even if I had saved you,

301
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,980
I couldn't have given you

302
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,900
an identity to move around freely.

303
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,180
Uncle, don't say that.

304
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,420
After that case,

305
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,260
your house in the Capital was sealed

306
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,100
and later demolished.

307
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,020
I even went to Qingyang,

308
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,380
but your house there

309
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,130
was also razed to the ground.

310
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,820
I really thought you were...

311
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,540
Good.

312
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,260
You've grown up.

313
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,730
I didn't intend to disturb you,

314
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,820
but now,

315
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,500
I don't have any evidence.

316
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,160
I really need your guidance

317
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,130
for the road ahead.

318
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,620
Child,

319
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,540
I only learned the details

320
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,580
after I returned to the Capital.

321
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,930
This case involved

322
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,400
the Ministry of War
and the Sixteen Guards.

323
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,860
It seemed to shake the foundation,

324
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,500
so it was dealt with severely.

325
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,380
The evidence
in the hands of the official

326
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,740
who reported the case

327
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,460
directly pointed to your father,

328
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,420
and it couldn't be overturned.

329
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,820
I've seen all this

330
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,460
in the case files.

331
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,780
He claimed that he tried to buy

332
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,520
an official position from my father,

333
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,800
but failed and was even ambushed.

334
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,100
He had to protect himself.

335
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,140
The evidence he had
was extremely detailed.

336
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,100
My father was immediately stripped
of his position and imprisoned.

337
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,500
Later,

338
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,080
he committed suicide in prison.

339
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,580
Everyone outside said

340
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,060
that he died of fear of punishment.

341
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,940
The official also died from drowning.

342
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,220
Even Fifth Master Xiao,

343
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,380
who was in charge of the case,

344
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,860
fell off his horse and fell into a coma,

345
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,540
lying in bed for years.

346
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,140
Fifth Master Xiao?

347
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,220
Princess Fuhui's husband?

348
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,340
Yes.

349
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,780
The case file erased

350
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,580
the names of all the case handlers.

351
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,980
I had to inquire around

352
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,420
to finally confirm it was him.

353
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,260
(Yunshui Manor)

354
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,500
Young Master.

355
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,620
Young Master,

356
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,860
a secret letter from Prince Zhao.

357
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,130
(You've been close to Princess Fuhui.)

358
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,570
(Get more info about the candidates)

359
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,700
(of the Ministry of War.)

360
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,580
He wants me

361
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,100
to find out from Princess Fuhui

362
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,300
who the candidates are
in the Ministry of War.

363
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,660
When you wanted to come to the Capital,

364
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,020
he was very anxious

365
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,300
because he couldn't find anyone

366
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,260
to help you.

367
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,460
How come he's already

368
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,540
made acquaintances in the Capital now

369
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,780
and found out about the Ministry of War?

370
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,980
Mr. Cao said

371
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,420
that the person
in charge of the old case

372
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,700
was the Princess's husband.

373
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,180
Fifth Master Xiao,

374
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,860
who has been in a coma for years?

375
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,820
Yes.

376
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,820
Since he could find out,

377
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,300
it's not a secret.

378
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,860
Given His Highness's age,

379
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,380
he must've witnessed that case.

380
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,780
He should know about this.

381
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,940
Though he doesn't know
I want to overturn the case,

382
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,020
why has he never

383
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,180
mentioned Fifth Master Xiao?

384
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,660
I think...

385
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,180
I think...

386
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,740
I can't think of a reason.

387
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,340
I'm not asking you.

388
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,220
By the way,

389
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,100
the Princess appreciates
the Shen siblings.

390
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,060
Ask them

391
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,900
to make some dishes later.

392
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,300
I'll send them to the Princess

393
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,620
and ask about her husband.

394
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,140
Has the fever subsided?

395
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,260
I'm fine now.

396
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,820
I'm as strong as an ox.

397
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,480
What do you need?

398
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,300
It's a bit embarrassing.

399
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,020
The Prefecture didn't prepare

400
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,300
any mooncakes for the Princess.

401
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,820
The festival has just passed,

402
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,940
and I need to visit her.

403
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,460
It's inevitably awkward.

404
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,020
You ordered so many mooncakes

405
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,780
from our diner.

406
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,700
Why didn't you send some to her?

407
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,700
You couldn't have forgotten it,
could you?

408
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,300
No wonder.

409
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,500
The Princess sent so many invitations

410
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,700
to Yunshui Manor

411
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
for poetry gatherings or flower shows.

412
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,660
So, they were all dates.

413
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,540
The Princess has many close attendants.

414
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,220
If you send mooncakes to her,

415
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,740
maybe what she really wants is...

416
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,700
Shen Shaoguang.

417
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,540
Well.

418
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,100
I'll make

419
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,580
a savory ham mooncake for you.

420
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,300
You can say
that the ham needs time to cure,

421
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,780
which is why it's late.

422
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,620
The Princess is so unconventional.

423
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,340
She'd definitely prefer

424
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,180
the rare savory mooncake.

425
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,300
Though the festival is over,

426
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,170
showing enough respect

427
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,020
should be fine.

428
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,180
Thanks.

429
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,660
Your talent for turning black into white

430
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,620
might make you

431
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,500
a better official than me.

432
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,180
I'll take that as a compliment.

433
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,860
This is made specifically

434
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,780
from a good hind leg of a pig.

435
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,500
After shaping,

436
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,580
it went through repeated salting

437
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,220
and was air-dried for a month.

438
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,500
After that, it was washed,

439
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,140
dried, fermented,

440
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,900
and stacked.

441
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,700
This is the simplified version.

442
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
The more elaborate ones

443
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,420
are cured in the fall of one year

444
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,140
and are ready by the following summer.

445
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,660
Some people even prefer

446
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,820
two-year-old

447
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,740
or three-year-old legs.

448
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,140
Let me try it.

449
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,820
This ham is so delicious.

450
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,020
It's even better than fresh meat.

451
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,500
If this is so good,

452
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,820
just imagine how delicious

453
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,700
those two-year-old

454
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,000
or three-year-old legs would be.

455
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Of course.

456
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,180
The cured ham has a mellow aroma

457
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,460
after years of fermentation,

458
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,460
which fresh meat can't compare to.

459
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,540
Mellow aroma after years
of fermentation?

460
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,140
What does that mean?

461
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,260
Fresh meat

462
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,060
is like a young man,

463
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,040
tender

464
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,980
but too straightforward,

465
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,220
lacking a bit of soul.

466
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,740
When cooking with fresh meat,

467
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,340
it's easy for the flavors

468
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,400
of the seasonings or other dishes
to overpower it.

469
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,980
But an aged ham

470
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,820
is like a mature man,

471
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,780
experienced

472
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,100
and settled.

473
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,140
When cooking with it,

474
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,220
its flavor will dominate

475
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,620
and cover other dishes,

476
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,340
without shaking the foundation.

477
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,420
But I think

478
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,600
the older the ham gets,

479
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,820
the more flavorful it becomes.

480
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,340
But for a man,

481
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,820
it's not necessarily true.

482
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,500
Of course.

483
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,460
Look at my brother.

484
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,540
He's old enough

485
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,820
but not settled at all.

486
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,020
Send it to Sushui City.

487
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,900
But I think

488
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,460
Mr. Lin is different.

489
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,060
He's young,

490
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,260
but he's experienced,

491
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,320
steady, and sophisticated.

492
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,220
What's wrong?

493
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,340
Indeed.

494
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,220
Mr. Lin

495
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,140
is experienced,

496
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,380
steady, and sophisticated.

497
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,220
He just can't hold his liquor.

498
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,740
But it's a good thing.

499
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,340
Is it good for an official?

500
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,740
Just eat.

501
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,420
I'm eating.

502
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,620
So delicious.

503
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,140
They...

504
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,180
Lady Shen is talking nonsense.

505
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,540
You can surely hold your liquor.

506
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,460
Besides, how would she know?

507
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,820
I don't care.

508
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,380
But she is right.

509
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,780
You're experienced,

510
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,220
steady, and sophisticated.

511
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,380
But she just agreed

512
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,780
to break off the engagement,

513
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,100
yet now she's praising you.

514
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,180
Has she changed her mind?

515
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,580
She doesn't like me at all.

516
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,660
That's good.

517
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,300
We can't repeat the same mistake.

518
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
But when you say that,

519
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,420
why does it sound

520
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,340
like you're grinding your teeth?

521
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,740
Stop overthinking things.

522
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,220
Just send the letter.

523
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,060
Young Master,

524
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,300
you didn't mention Mr. Cao

525
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,140
in this reply to Sushui City, did you?

526
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,100
No.

527
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,300
Prince Zhao is a benefactor,

528
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,900
but he is also a vassal.

529
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,580
In the past, I thought

530
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,140
he loved the people,

531
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,660
but lately,

532
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,420
I've had some doubts.

533
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,820
Let's use these pieces
of wood and leather

534
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,180
to make a box.

535
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,300
It can hold mooncakes

536
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,700
and can be used daily.

537
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,860
The Princess

538
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,140
has everything good.

539
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,100
We need to be creative.

540
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,220
You're so smart.

541
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,620
I'll follow your advice.

542
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,020
Since you appreciate me so much,

543
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,540
how about giving me a few gold bricks

544
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,500
as a reward?

545
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,020
Then I'll have to write an IOU.

546
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,330
Here's a pen; write it.

547
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,540
I'm just joking.

548
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,980
How could I ask you for money

549
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,620
when I already owe you so much?

550
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,060
Glad that you remember.

551
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,020
Actually, I have a question

552
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,140
I want to ask you.

553
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,820
Alright, go ahead.

554
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,940
Your family is

555
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,980
the most harmonious I've ever seen.

556
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,300
Even if there have been conflicts,

557
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,260
you ultimately care about each other.

558
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,660
I wonder

559
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,220
if you've ever

560
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,460
deceived your family.

561
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,940
That's happened so many times.

562
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,820
Yangyang would sneak sweets.

563
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,660
When my grandparents were alive,

564
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,260
my grandfather would hide some money.

565
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,340
He shared half with me,

566
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,060
and I helped him deceive my grandmother.

567
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,620
And my brother.

568
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,660
He's deceived our family even more.

569
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,820
He even

570
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,180
kept his divorce

571
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,820
from his ex-wife a secret.

572
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,540
But eventually,

573
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,060
you all found out.

574
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,620
We tried to pretend

575
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,860
we didn't know at first.

576
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,300
We even lied to Yangyang,

577
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,060
saying her mother
had gone on a long trip.

578
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
But one day,

579
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,900
Yangyang came back and said

580
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,580
she knew her parents had separated.

581
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,220
I also know something

582
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,620
that my family doesn't know.

583
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,780
My sister-in-law has a new lover.

584
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,100
That new lover

585
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,540
has quite a bit of wealth.

586
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,780
So, my brother felt inferior

587
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,300
and didn't even try to stop her.

588
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,980
He even helped her move

589
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,020
to be with her new love.

590
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,060
He told me this when he was drunk.

591
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,660
I wouldn't dare tell my parents,

592
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,180
or he'd get beaten again.

593
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,100
You must have something on your mind,

594
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,900
which is why you're asking me

595
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
if I've ever deceived my family.

596
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,940
If you want to talk, I'm your tree hole.

597
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,980
If you don't want to talk,

598
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,040
I'm still your tree hole.

599
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,020
I have

600
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,380
a trusted elder,

601
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,940
but I suddenly realized

602
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,060
that he seems
to be hiding something from me.

603
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,300
And I'm also

604
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,340
hiding many things from him.

605
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,300
I don't know why that elder

606
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,740
is doing this.

607
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,260
But I know you're kind.

608
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,140
You wouldn't hurt others.

609
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,660
If you decide to lie,

610
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,300
it must be for a reason.

611
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,940
Or it's a white lie.

612
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,100
Lies

613
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,220
can be white?

614
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,140
You'd only lie

615
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,420
for a good reason.

616
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,780
You once told me

617
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,180
we judge actions, not intentions.

618
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,860
You haven't hurt others yet,

619
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,420
so there's no need to judge yourself.

620
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,300
Almost done.

621
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,260
How is it?

622
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,940
Lady Shen is so dexterous

623
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,420
that she even made such a bag.

624
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,620
Mr. Lin,

625
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,100
take a look at this.

626
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,460
Is it for carrying on the back?

627
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,740
Does it look good?

628
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,380
How nice.

629
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,180
What a clever girl.

630
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,620
Lady Shen

631
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,220
made these mooncakes too, right?

632
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,180
Yes.

633
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,020
I've heard

634
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,460
that Shen's Diner makes these.

635
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,100
The filling is pork.

636
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
Why isn't it greasy at all?

637
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,460
It's especially

638
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,860
savory,

639
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,780
fresh,

640
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,820
and mellow.

641
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,020
Lady Shen especially cured these

642
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,380
for you.

643
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,460
I really like Lady Shen.

644
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,740
I don't even know

645
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,620
what kind of man

646
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,180
would be worthy of her.

647
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,460
I hope she won't end up

648
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,300
all alone

649
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,340
like me.

650
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,500
You're alone?

651
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,100
I have a question,

652
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,420
but I'm afraid it might upset you.

653
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,900
Is it about my husband?

654
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,890
Are you curious about me?

655
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,300
I have no taboos.

656
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,980
I had no feelings

657
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,780
for Fifth Master Xiao.

658
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,740
My father told me to marry him,

659
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,140
so I did.

660
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,340
After the wedding,

661
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,700
we lived

662
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,100
separate lives.

663
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,540
One day,

664
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,380
a man who wasn't good at riding

665
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,300
somehow insisted on riding.

666
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,580
The horse threw him off a cliff,

667
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,220
and he never woke up again.

668
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,500
I was actually quite relieved.

669
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,100
He wasn't good at riding,

670
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,620
yet he insisted on riding a horse?

671
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,060
The horse threw him off a cliff?

672
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,220
Yes.

673
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,380
Everyone outside says

674
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,700
that I trained that horse

675
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,500
and made him fall ill.

676
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,460
If you wanted to kill someone,

677
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,260
you'd prefer to do it openly.

678
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,580
If you wanted to tame a horse,

679
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,900
it'd only be

680
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,420
because you wanted to be
the master of that wild horse.

681
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,500
It'd never be
because of some conspiracy.

682
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,540
Even my brother,

683
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,140
the current Emperor,

684
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,620
once questioned

685
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,060
and doubted me.

686
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,420
I didn't expect you

687
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,140
to understand me in the Capital.

688
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,860
Recently, those visitors with gifts

689
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,100
are all trying to find out

690
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,260
about the arrangements
for the Ministry of War next year.

691
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,420
You're quite patient.

692
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,740
You haven't even asked yet.

693
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,860
But

694
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,340
I like you,

695
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,940
so I'll tell you.

696
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,740
Thanks for your info.

697
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,820
The former Minister of War

698
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,420
was chosen by my sixth brother.

699
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,540
The Emperor and I dislike him.

700
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,740
Now,

701
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,420
he's been sent as an envoy to Tubo.

702
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,580
We won't have to see him
for a long time.

703
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,940
Though it hasn't been declared,

704
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,020
if you want to prepare a gift,

705
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,860
the Military Commissioner
and Imperial Attendant's families

706
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,060
are visiting friends
and relatives in Yong'an.

707
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,620
Your sixth brother...

708
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,060
Prince Zhao?

709
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,940
He's always had connections
with the court

710
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,420
and even recommended officials?

711
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,940
These are all bestowed by the Princess.

712
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,420
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)
She said

713
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,940
these fish badges

714
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,420
will be your entrance permit.

715
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,740
You'll be able to enter and leave

716
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,300
the Princess's mansion freely.

717
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,540
Thanks for her kindness,

718
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,580
but I can go back on my own.

719
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,740
Mr. Lin,

720
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,460
please understand us.

721
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,540
These are the orders of the Princess.

722
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,420
Please get in the carriage.

723
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,940
You're not yet 30, right?

724
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,220
So young,

725
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,820
yet already the Vice Prefect.

726
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,300
This is truly a mark of great promise.

727
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,980
You're upright,

728
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,140
handsome,

729
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,100
and elegant.

730
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,140
The Princess appreciates
those qualities the most.

731
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,020
The Princess has invited you
several times before,

732
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,060
showing great favor.

733
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,540
If you're willing,

734
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,860
you can even become
one of the Three Lords.

735
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,900
(Yunshui Manor)

736
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,620
Mr. Lin.

737
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,220
Mr. Lin,

738
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,310
please consider

739
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,860
what I said.

740
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,860
After all,
it's the wish of the Princess.

741
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,460
With the Princess's support

742
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,660
and your character,

743
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,020
you'll have a bright future.

744
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,660
You flatter me.

745
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,740
You flatter me.

746
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,660
Mr. Lin, goodbye.

747
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,100
Grandpa, I don't understand

748
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,700
what they're saying at all.

749
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,860
Let's go.

750
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,720
Let's go to the diner.

751
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,040
Something big is going to happen.

752
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,100
- Hurry.
- What's wrong?

753
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,760
Hurry, hurry up.

754
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,100
(Temporarily Closed)
Handsome, Handsome.

755
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,660
Don't be so quiet inside.

756
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,140
Come out and let us see you.

757
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,320
Handsome, let us see if you're okay,

758
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,020
(Handsome Shen's Sayings)
and we'll leave.

759
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,940
- Handsome.
- Handsome.

760
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,420
- Handsome.
- Handsome.

761
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,660
Come out and meet us.

762
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,020
Are all the women in ancient times

763
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,340
so crazy?

764
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,780
Deyuan,

765
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
hang in there.

766
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,580
What to do?

767
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,540
Come on.

768
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,340
This is too crazy.

769
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,220
Come on.

770
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,780
After that poetry gathering,

771
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,380
as the Princess ordered,

772
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,300
someone collected what I said

773
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,740
and made it into a collection.

774
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,780
And recently,

775
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,060
many bookshops have started

776
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,780
using the woodblock printing technology.

777
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,660
It's less time-consuming
than manual copying.

778
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,740
So, its dissemination speed

779
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,180
just shoots up.

780
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,260
Plus,

781
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,500
my personal image

782
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,980
is indeed

783
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,580
quite acceptable,

784
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,660
isn't it?

785
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,260
Nowadays, these women

786
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,620
are really not picky about men.

787
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,860
(Handsome Shen)
But you have to persuade them

788
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,260
not to block the entrance.

789
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,340
This affects our business.

790
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,220
Mom, what do you mean?

791
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
What's lacking now

792
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,700
is an understanding of aesthetics.

793
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,020
How tasteful they are.

794
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,020
Don't worry.

795
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,300
I will definitely manage

796
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,220
my Gongcai Fan.

797
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,740
Gongcai Fan?

798
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,660
Let me warn you:

799
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,620
Shen Shaojie,

800
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,220
the one these women like

801
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,820
is the fake you,

802
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,220
not the real you.

803
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,760
You mustn't do

804
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,140
something inappropriate with them.

805
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,060
Do you hear me?

806
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,100
Our family forbids deceiving feelings.

807
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Am I that kind of man?

808
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Am I?

809
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,460
Mom.

810
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,980
I won't be like those stars.

811
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,220
Besides,

812
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,780
I mean those words I say.

813
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,660
Don't worry, Mom.

814
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,140
I'll keep my distance from my fans.

815
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,300
I belong to everyone.

816
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,820
I can't be possessed by just one woman.

817
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,060
Just give it a rest.

818
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,280
You don't look like an idol,

819
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,940
but you've already got
the idol's burden.

820
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,340
I thought you might get better,

821
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,580
but instead, you've regressed.

822
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,380
What do you mean by this?

823
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,140
You're all here.

824
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,240
Something big has happened.

825
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,740
You simply can't believe it.

826
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,340
Why are there so many people in front?

827
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,620
Why is the shop closed?

828
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,020
Are we not doing business anymore?

829
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,300
It's all because of Shen Gongcai's fans.

830
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,420
They're all his fans?

831
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,060
What about mine?

832
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,500
Dad, get to the point.

833
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,460
Yes, yes.

834
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,780
Yangyang and I

835
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,540
just saw

836
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,300
that the Princess's servants

837
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,660
sent Mr. Lin

838
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,700
back to his mansion.

839
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,100
From what we overheard,

840
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,220
it seems the Princess likes Mr. Lin.

841
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,180
What?

842
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,480
Grandpa, what does that mean?

843
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,720
Let's have an emergency meeting.

844
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,700
A meeting.

845
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,880
Let's have a meeting.

846
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
Speak up, everyone.

847
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,860
Folks, listen to me first.

848
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,660
Actually, I think

849
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,860
this might not be a bad thing.

850
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,100
Think about it.

851
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,290
If our ancestor gets together
with the Princess,

852
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,140
his status

853
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,140
would immediately be elevated, right?

854
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,180
Then we'd become descendants
of the Princess.

855
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,660
That's a blessing
for his descendants, right?

856
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,660
Gongcai,

857
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,100
is your mind just a mess?

858
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,060
What's the matter?

859
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,260
Who are we?

860
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,100
We are the descendants
of Mr. Lin and Lady Shen.

861
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,220
If Mr. Lin gets together
with the Princess,

862
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,100
can he still be good with Lady Shen?

863
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,820
If not,

864
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,220
the past would change.

865
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,780
And the future would change too.

866
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,020
Would there even be us then?

867
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,100
Yes, yes.

868
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,820
I forgot about that.
That's not acceptable.

869
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,460
They can't be good together.

870
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,300
If they are,

871
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,300
we'll all cease to exist.

872
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,900
If I'm gone,

873
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,740
what about my fans?

874
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,300
They would be so pitiful.

875
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,260
You must've been deluded

876
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,420
by your fans.

877
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,620
It's indeed like this.

878
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,700
But according to the theories
in sci-fi movies,

879
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,300
history can't be changed.

880
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,060
Since we already exist in the future,

881
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,100
it means our ancestor

882
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,980
will meet another Lady Shen

883
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,140
and marry her.

884
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,700
Jicai,

885
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,980
she is the Princess after all.

886
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,550
Her status is there.

887
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,450
Moreover,

888
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,220
she wouldn't marry him

889
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,380
or limit his career development.

890
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,900
All these benefits.

891
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,820
The nature of humans...

892
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,940
Listen.

893
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,500
It's hard to say.

894
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,940
Our ancestor is not that kind of man.

895
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,140
But what if

896
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,380
the Princess takes him by force?

897
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,860
By force?

898
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,500
Folks, I think

899
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,660
we are now at a critical moment.

900
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,100
Everything that happens now

901
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,820
could affect the future.

902
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,820
First,

903
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,700
we must put aside internal conflicts

904
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,860
and unite against the outside.

905
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,020
We must resolutely prevent

906
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,660
our ancestor from going to the Princess.

907
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,220
We must prevent him

908
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,700
from flying to a place
of greater happiness.

909
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,820
Good point.
