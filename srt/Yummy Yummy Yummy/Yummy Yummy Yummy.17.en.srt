00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,070
This family

4
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,270
really have a lot of sly ideas.

5
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,620
Your Highness,

6
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,740
Mr. Lin has already gone
to look for them.

7
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,340
What should we plan to do?

8
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,740
Not eating?

9
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,300
Shame on you!

10
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,660
Send someone to pursue immediately.

11
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,440
Make sure to bring the Shen family back

12
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,900
before him.

13
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,860
Yes.

14
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,420
For the sake of this family,

15
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,460
Lin Yan actually disregarded his dignity

16
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,660
to come to me and ask for them.

17
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,580
They are far more influential

18
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,300
than I imagined.

19
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,580
But this family is so cunning.

20
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,380
They actually managed to escape.

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,590
Otherwise, we would have pried the truth
out of them.

22
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,980
Rather than using the Shen family
to manipulate Lin Yan,

23
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,100
there is actually a simpler method.

24
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,460
Go ahead.

25
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,090
Get rid of him.

26
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,100
I know

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,660
you've raised him for many years

28
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,700
and cannot bear to do it.

29
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,340
But raising a tiger invites disaster.

30
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,370
We'll talk about it later.

31
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,660
Run quickly!

32
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,620
Run!

33
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,730
Yangyang.

34
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,700
Yangyang.

35
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,100
Are you OK, Yangyang?

36
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,940
Get up quickly.

37
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,900
What's wrong with you?

38
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,660
Can't you walk carefully?

39
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,020
If my baby gets injured,

40
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,260
I won't let this go with you.

41
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,100
My fault. My fault.

42
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,620
Yangyang, did you get injured?

43
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,060
We've been running for a long time.

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,520
And this road is hard for both people
and horses to travel.

45
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,060
How about we take a break?

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,760
They won't be able to catch up
for a while.

47
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,500
Take a break.

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,030
I really can't run anymore.

49
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,260
Have a break.
They don't catch up.

50
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,130
Let me check on you.

51
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,020
Are you OK?

52
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,060
Did you hurt yourself?

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,260
I'm sorry, Yangyang, I'm sorry.

54
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,180
Be careful, Jicai.

55
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,100
We found the fruit!

56
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,620
Auntie, grandma,

57
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,420
do you think this grass is edible?

58
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,820
Let me go over and take a look.

59
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,940
Father.

60
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,610
OK.

61
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,860
Let me take a look.

62
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,220
Look at this.

63
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,590
- What did you pick, Yangyang?
- Shaojie.

64
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,700
Get up and work.

65
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,220
Why are you always lying here?

66
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,780
What's it?

67
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,460
Jicai, look.

68
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,780
Yangyang, where did you pick this?

69
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,940
Right in here.

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,060
Look, there's plenty of them.

71
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,540
This... this seems to be smartweed.

72
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,780
Is it spicy?

73
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,340
What is it? Is it edible?

74
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,620
We have to taste it.

75
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,460
If it is smartweed,

76
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,460
then it is edible.

77
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,180
But then, who will taste it?

78
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,780
Do we have to learn from Shennong
and taste all kinds of herbs?

79
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,550
Yangyang, you even know
how to use allusions.

80
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,820
Better than your father.

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,890
You found something to eat?

82
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,460
What's this?

83
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,020
Father, why did you eat it?

84
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,500
- Gongcai...
- Father!

85
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,090
Father!

86
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,060
- Father!
- Gongcai!

87
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,900
Gongcai, come on.

88
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,950
Spit it out! Hurry up.

89
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,500
- Hurry up.
- Spit it out.

90
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,940
Spit it out.

91
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,980
- Come on.
- Father,

92
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,360
- Spit it out.
- Spit, spit, spit.

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,860
- Father...
- Spit it out.

94
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,060
Spit, spit.

95
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,900
Alright, alright.

96
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,380
Alright.

97
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,780
Did you spit it out?

98
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,700
Father, you're choking me to death.

99
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,180
- Feel better?
- It's fine.

100
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,220
This thing

101
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,460
is so spicy.

102
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,140
- It's spicy?
- It's spicy.

103
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,340
It means that it is edible.

104
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,540
Then we can cook spicy dishes.

105
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,660
Hot and sour noodles.

106
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,940
Boiled fish in spicy soup.

107
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,460
Mapo tofu.

108
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,460
Spicy chicken cubes.

109
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,020
Spicy boiled blood curd.

110
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,940
Auntie,

111
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,740
can we bring back more smartweed?

112
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,900
I want to eat spicy strips.

113
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,540
Yangyang, you want to eat,

114
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,940
why not let me make it for you?

115
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,020
You definitely don't know
how to make it.

116
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,660
Don't worry.

117
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,980
I just dug up several plants
of smartweed.

118
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,360
Maybe I can even set up
a special section for spicy dishes.

119
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,740
Spicy chicken, spicy fried duck,
Mapo tofu.

120
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,040
Much more useful than the dogwood
they like to use here.

121
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,510
That's why we still have
to be in the human world;

122
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,560
hell won't do,

123
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,950
we can't even get spicy food there.

124
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,060
The last one.
You all aren't eating it, huh?

125
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,160
If you don't, I'll take it.

126
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,300
Father, I want it too.

127
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,100
Yangyang,

128
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,660
let's play rock-paper-scissors.

129
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,650
Whoever wins gets to eat.

130
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
I'll count to three.

131
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,900
I'll play paper, OK?

132
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,220
Come on, one,

133
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,190
two,

134
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,100
three.

135
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,140
I win!

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,280
- Shen Shaojie, you cheat?
- Shen Gongcai.

137
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,140
You naughty boy!

138
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,180
Just for something to eat,

139
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,580
you even lied to your own daughter.

140
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,180
Mother, how come you don't know
how to joke either?

141
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,300
I'm just teasing her.

142
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,000
She can't even trust her own father.

143
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,100
When she grows up, she won't

144
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,620
be deceived by another man, right?

145
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,460
Well,

146
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,740
you're always in the right.

147
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,440
Yangyang, don't be angry.
I'm kidding.

148
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,380
Let me take it for you.

149
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,300
Grandma.

150
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,300
Don't move.

151
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,460
Don't... don't move.

152
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,300
You're hiding here.

153
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,700
We finally found you.

154
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,750
Did they put

155
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,710
a tracking system on us?

156
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,660
They actually found us.

157
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,300
Stop that. Take Yangyang away quickly.

158
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,780
Yes, Jicai,

159
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,860
you go with Yangyang.

160
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,980
I want to let them know

161
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,700
what it means to be a heroine.

162
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,900
Mother, can you handle this?

163
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,980
You don't understand her.

164
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,990
She is absolutely capable.

165
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,160
When I was young,

166
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,290
I trained in discus throwing.

167
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,020
Hear that? This is why it hurts so much

168
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,260
every time she pinches me.

169
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,660
You've got quite some guts,
even started chatting.

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,100
Jicai, hurry up and go.

171
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,140
Hurry, take Yangyang away.

172
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,860
Let's go!

173
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,860
Catch them!

174
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,460
Yangyang.

175
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,100
I really can't run anymore.

176
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,580
Go, quickly.

177
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,600
Auntie.

178
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,480
Here.

179
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,340
Come. Quick.

180
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,540
Here, hide inside.

181
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,980
OK. Auntie, you come in too.

182
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,980
Auntie.

183
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,180
You can't get away.

184
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,140
Yangyang, just hide here.

185
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,980
Don't make a sound.

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,950
I'll make spicy strips for you
after I come back.

187
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't make a sound.

188
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,990
Auntie...

189
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,220
You little brat, come here.

190
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,220
Come catch me.

191
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,780
Weren't you acting tough just now?

192
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,420
Discus throwing or something.

193
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,270
Let me...

194
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,580
What are you doing?

195
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,750
Father!

196
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,660
Fengxia.

197
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,020
Jianshe...

198
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,380
You're courting death.

199
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,700
You're the ones courting death.

200
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,880
- Mr. Lin.
- Are you alright?

201
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,820
Take this message back.

202
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,780
If you lay a hand
on the Shen family again,

203
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,980
I will never let it slide.

204
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,500
Let's go.

205
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,740
Get lost.

206
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,140
Just wait and see.

207
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,460
- Mr. Lin.
- Where are Jicai and Yangyang?

208
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,900
They ran in that direction.

209
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,500
Let's go.

210
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,640
- Go.
- Go.

211
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,780
Take care.

212
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,960
Yangyang.

213
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,280
- Lady Shen.
- Be careful!

214
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,580
- Jicai.
- Yangyang.

215
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,740
Be careful, be careful.

216
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,780
Yangyang.

217
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,100
- Yangyang.
- Lady Shen.

218
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,820
Jicai.

219
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,210
Yangyang.

220
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,310
Yangyang.

221
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,540
- Jicai.
- Shen Shaoguang.

222
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,530
Yangyang.

223
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,180
Be careful.

224
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,960
Yangyang.

225
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,140
Yangyang.

226
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,980
Answer me.

227
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
Jicai.

228
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,300
- Mr. Lin.
- Shen Shao...

229
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,140
Mr. Lin, I'm here.

230
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,460
Yangyang.

231
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,430
- Over there.
- Hurry.

232
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
- Coming.
- I'm here.

233
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,660
- Yangyang.
- Mr. Lin, I'm here.

234
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,980
I'm here.

235
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,180
- Father.
- Yangyang.

236
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,780
- Grandpa, grandma.
- Yangyang.

237
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,620
Yangyang, are you OK?

238
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,990
- Did you hurt?
- Are you injured?

239
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,580
Are you OK?

240
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,860
- Yangyang.
- Where is your auntie?

241
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,700
Where is Jicai?

242
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,580
Yangyang, was auntie running with you?

243
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,380
My auntie diverted the bad guys

244
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,580
to save me.

245
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,140
She hasn't come back.

246
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,100
Yangyang, which way did your auntie go?

247
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,500
That direction.

248
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,060
Stop going further.

249
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,420
Come back with me obediently.

250
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,540
I promise not to take your life.

251
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,620
Mr. Lin.

252
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,340
If it weren't useful to keep you alive,

253
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,840
you wouldn't have the chance
to play tricks with me here.

254
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,180
Since you're so good at causing trouble,

255
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,170
I'll cut off your hands and feet

256
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,470
and mutilate you.

257
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,420
No, no, no.

258
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,540
If so, it's meaningless

259
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,600
to take me as the hostage.

260
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,620
It's better to have four limbs intact.

261
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,340
I will never lie to you again.

262
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,420
Mr. Lin.

263
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,260
Do you think I will believe you
a second time?

264
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,900
She told you the truth,

265
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,140
but you don't believe it.

266
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,740
Mr. Lin.

267
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,590
Are you OK?

268
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,020
It's dangerous here.

269
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,860
Let's go first.

270
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,580

271
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,260
Hold on to me.

272
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Mr. Lin, save me. Save me.

273
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,940
Don't worry.

274
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,900
I will definitely get you up.

275
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,860
Mr. Lin, do not let go.

It's OK now.

376
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,660
- I thought I would never see you again.
- Mr. Lin.

377
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,820
Come on.

378
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,300
It's OK. It's OK.

379
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,620
Mr. Lin.

380
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,820
I thought, I thought...

381
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,260
I thought I wouldn't be able
to save you.

382
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,860
Shaoguang.

383
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,460
If because of me,

384
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,260
you are...

385
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,900
It's alright.

386
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,340
It's alright.

387
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,060
It's alright.

388
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm fine.

389
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,500
You still have an arrow stuck in you.

390
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,340
It hurts, right?

391
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,260
- Mr. Lin...
- Yeah, what about this arrow wound?

392
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,300
It's alright.

393
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,700
I'll be fine after dealing with it.

394
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,580
The top priority right now

395
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,180
is to leave here

396
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,620
and return to Yong'an.

397
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,140
Alright, alright.

398
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,900
Come on.

399
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,780
Take care.

400
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,620
Come on.

401
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,620
What about him?

402
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,260
In this situation,

403
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,740
we can't report it to the authorities.

404
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,140
What if we leave him here

405
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,700
and he gets eaten by beasts?

406
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,180
His identity is so special.

407
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,660
Why bother with him?

408
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,700
If beasts don't mind,

409
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,240
it could be considered his good fortune.

410
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,060
Someone will find him soon.

411
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,260
Let's go.

412
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,690
Liu Chang will come to meet us soon.

413
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,700
- Stay close together.
- Hurry.

415
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,060
I don't want to stay here any longer.

416
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,020
- Quick.
- Quick, Yangyang.

417
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,860
Go, go, go.

418
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,820
Speed up.

419
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,820
(Virtue and Fragrance)

420
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,660
It's just a minor injury.

421
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,260
I can recover without taking medicine.

422
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,020
Take the medicine first.

423
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,220
Wait a minute.

424
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,820
Your hand isn't convenient to use.

425
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,380
Let me help you.

426
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,340
I can do it myself.

427
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,340
My father and mother couldn't
bear it anymore.

428
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,900
They have to rest first.

429
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,340
Yangyang was frightened.

430
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,740
My brother must stay with her.

431
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,140
If you need something, just let me know.

432
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,540
Does it hurt?

433
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,900
No, it doesn't.

434
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,660
Sorry.

435
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,940
Let me do it.

436
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,180
(Qingyang Cui Case)

437
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,900
No idea who wrote this file.

438
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,040
This person must be good
at writing compositions.

439
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,690
He can get full marks for presentation.

440
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,530
Composing and writing
mean the same thing.

441
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,500
Writing compositions?

442
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,060
Isn't the meaning

443
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,700
repeated?

444
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,860
Ignore it.

445
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,900
The point is

446
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,820
his presentation is very neat.

447
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,900
Ordinary people don't write articles
that carefully.

448
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,740
There will be some signs
of modification.

449
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
But he didn't.

450
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,540
As if it had been recopied.

451
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,300
(Qingyang Cui Case)

452
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,460
(To be punished by the death penalty.)

453
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,180
(Cao Mansion)

454
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,900
(Qingyang Cui Case)

455
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,540
(Harboring ill intentions)

456
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,700
Just as you said,

457
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,500
this file has no errors or omissions.

458
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,540
This is obviously a recopy.

459
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,060
I was blinded by a single leaf.

460
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,240
I had been delving
into the contents of the file,

461
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,100
yet I never expected

462
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,860
that the key information lay
beyond the words themselves.

463
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,740
The case was so urgent back then.

464
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,110
Yet Master Xiao still took the time

465
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,180
to copy it out deliberately

466
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,040
and submit it to the Capital Prefecture
and the Court of Judicial Review.

467
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,880
He must have secrets
that must be kept hidden.

468
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,950
Unfortunately,

469
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Master Xiao is now in a coma.

470
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,490
We can't get anything out of him.

471
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,380
Fifth Master Xiao

472
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,300
is a taciturn person
who won't say a word.

473
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,340
However, he was very diligent
in writing.

474
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,140
Not only would he carry a tablet
when attending court meetings,

475
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,830
but even while eating or walking,

476
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,850
he would bring different kinds of slips

477
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,260
to record events that occurred.

478
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,100
So some people made fun of him,

479
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,220
saying he was no different
from those attendants

480
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,220
who constantly recorded the daily life
of His Majesty.

481
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,380
They gave him a nickname,

482
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,220
Attendant Prince Consort.

483
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,900
So I suppose

484
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,740
when he was investigating the case,

485
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,420
he would also carry a slip
to record events.

486
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,820
If Prince Consort Xiao

487
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,620
left behind that slip,

488
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,700
perhaps there will be new clues.

489
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,100
By the way,

490
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,850
(Secret letter)
Prince Zhao sent a letter,

491
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,580
saying that the hunt for the Shen family
was all Li Ang's nonsense.

492
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,190
He has already been taught a lesson.

493
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,820
When I was young,

494
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,820
even as a feudal prince,

495
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,460
if he felt he was wrong,

496
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,340
he would apologize to me.

497
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,660
I assumed that since he was reasonable

498
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,820
and free of airs,

499
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,740
he must be a fair-minded person.

500
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,990
Now he shifts all the responsibility
onto Li Ang.

501
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,540
This is just a tactic,

502
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,020
the same as when he showed sincerity

503
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,940
toward me.

504
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,480
In the case
of selling official positions,

505
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,620
many of the traded posts
were in the Ministry of War.

506
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,900
Perhaps,

507
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,420
they are not after money at all.

508
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,140
If the ears, tongues, mouths, and eyes
in the court

509
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,700
are all replaced by others,

510
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,580
that person

511
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,620
would become a true 'lonely ruler'.

512
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,900
Young Master,

513
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,180
I don't quite understand

514
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,380
what you mean by that.

515
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,540
I mean

516
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,940
Prince Zhao

517
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,900
may be related to all of this.

518
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,620
His Majesty is aged

519
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,100
and still has a few brothers
in their prime.

520
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,460
Who could benefit from the case?

521
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,820
If that were really the case,

522
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,510
Prince Zhao would certainly not want us

523
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,070
to continue investigating.

524
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,880
Even if there are many suspicious points

525
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,140
about Prince Zhao,

526
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,560
that is still not enough to conclude

527
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,980
that he was involved
in that incident back then.

528
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,420
Forget it for now.

529
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,700
At present,

530
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,990
Prince Zhao also dared not rashly

531
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,260
extend his reach into Yong'an.

532
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,820
He wrote this letter

533
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,660
to keep us steady.

534
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,060
Both sides have their concerns.

535
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,790
The other party got anxious first.

536
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,940
Naturally, they'll lose their composure.

537
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,220
Then would it be more appropriate for us

538
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,740
to send the Shen family away first?

539
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,500
Greetings, Mr. Lin.

540
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,580
We came to see

541
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,620
if your injury has gotten any better.

542
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,940
No major issues remain.

543
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,420
Thanks for your concern.

544
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,900
Come in and sit.

545
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,920
We are here not only to visit you,

546
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,460
but also to tell you something.

547
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,420
That day in Sushui City,

548
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,560
Prince Zhao's youngest son
who was hunting down Jicai

549
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,960
came specifically to the dungeon
to interrogate us

550
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,220
and asked us if we knew

551
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,420
your secrets.

552
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,260
There are things about you
that can be said,

553
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,500
and things that cannot be said.

554
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,900
We didn't know what should be said

555
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,060
and what should not be said.

556
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,220
I just thought

557
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,180
you told me

558
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,460
that Prince Zhao knows

559
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,540
your true identity.

560
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,260
That day when you took off clothes

561
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,260
in the carriage...

562
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,740
It's not that.

563
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,160
That day, Mr. Lin was wearing
his official uniform.

564
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,340
He couldn't go to a restaurant

565
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,460
wearing his official uniform.

566
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,740
He could only change temporarily.

567
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,540
Is she really so unconcerned about it?

568
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,940
So

569
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,660
you said you know my identity?

570
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,380
Well,

571
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,180
just to save my life,

572
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,540
I still had to say something
they don't know,

573
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,620
without affecting you.

574
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,500
So I said

575
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,540
you and the Princess
have an ambiguous relationship.

576
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,220
Sorry for affecting your reputation.

577
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
It's just reputation.

578
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,400
It's better than letting them
hurt you...

579
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,420
And you.

580
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,100
It doesn't matter.

581
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,980
After all, it's because of me

582
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,660
that you had to suffer this calamity.

583
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,300
Mr. Lin,

584
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,500
we are all one family.

585
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,820
No need to say such things.

586
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,060
Actually, we all know in our hearts

587
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,460
that you're trying to reverse the case
for the Cui family.

588
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,190
- Yeah.
- Well,

589
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,100
does Prince Zhao taking us as hostages

590
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,820
have anything to do with it?

591
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,720
Alright. If Mr. Lin doesn't want
to talk about it,

592
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,780
we won't ask then.

593
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,060
Don't worry.

594
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,540
I will risk my life

595
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,940
to protect you all.

596
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,500
I know

597
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,700
people's perception of life and death
is very different.

598
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,730
They think many things
are more important than life.

599
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,660
But you are like family to us.

600
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,300
We only hope that our family

601
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,700
can live well.

602
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,620
Mr. Lin, let me say a few words too.

603
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,900
As the head of this family...

604
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,140
The head's husband.

605
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,460
I make a statement.

606
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,660
First of all,

607
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,980
reversing the case
is extremely important.

608
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,060
Secondly, Prince Zhao has been secretly
setting you up.

609
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,980
Before we came here,

610
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,460
we've discussed it in meetings.

611
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,300
We decided

612
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,140
to stand firmly by your side

613
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,740
and help you to reverse the case.

614
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,780
You can't.

615
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,100
Why not?

616
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,020
Well,

617
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,820
ever since we arrived in Yong'an City,

618
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,540
we've received a lot of help from you.

619
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,410
And I can also tell

620
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,500
all of this

621
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,460
comes from the bottom of your heart.

622
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,740
So we definitely won't

623
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,980
leave you behind and ignore you.

624
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,940
Exactly.

625
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,980
Mr. Lin,

626
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,600
there's one more thing
I want to ask you.

627
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,620
Logically speaking,

628
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,060
we should have moved out long ago.

629
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,020
But if we move out now,

630
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,380
then it will be much easier

631
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,340
for others to harm us.

632
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,900
As for this matter,

633
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,340
you still have to make a decision.

634
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,820
Sorry for implicating all of you.

635
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,590
Although the engagement is called off,

636
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,620
you all

637
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,420
are my only family in the world.

638
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,700
I'm thinking

639
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,380
I feel at ease only when I keep you
by my side.

640
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,020
The road ahead won't be easy.

641
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,260
Listen.

642
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,420
Mr. Lin has already

643
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,700
made so many plans for us.

644
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,820
Mr. Lin,

645
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,380
actually, in our eyes,

646
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,100
you are just a child after all.

647
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,980
How did you manage

648
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,740
to shoulder so much all by yourself?

649
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,740
Didn't Mr. Lin say

650
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,340
he also wants us to stay?

651
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,820
Mr. Lin, from now on,

652
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,090
you no longer need to be afraid.

653
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:51,900
If something happens,

654
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,500
we adults will stand up for you.

655
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,660
We will stand up for you.

656
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,340
Come on, father...

657
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
In this situation,

658
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,140
'adults' means parents.

659
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,860
Whatever.

660
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,100
In my eyes,

661
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,260
Mr. Lin is just like you and Gongcai.

662
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,540
You are all children of our family.

663
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,380
Right?

664
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,300
Mr. Lin,

665
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,380
as long as you are willing,

666
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,260
from now on,

667
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,400
you can feel free to treat us

668
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,740
as your own parents.

669
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,100
It's not appropriate.

670
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,500
What's inappropriate about it?

671
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,340
It's appropriate.

672
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,060
I think it's very appropriate.

673
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,140
From this day forward,

674
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,060
just treat us like your parents.

675
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,980
Yeah.

676
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,860
It's appropriate?

677
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,260
Then according to that,

678
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,860
from now on, you're my little brother.

679
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,020
Brother,

680
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,980
don't worry.

681
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,780
No matter how difficult
the road ahead is,

682
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,140
the two of us

683
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,420
will face it together.

684
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,020
What's going on?

685
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,860
What's wrong, Mr. Liu?

686
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,380
Something got into my eyes.

687
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,260
I... I'll rub it.

688
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
I'm so touched.

689
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,620
From now on, we are all your family.

690
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,860
We're all one family now.

691
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,990
- We are all one family.
- Come on.

692
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,380
- Come on.
- We're family.

693
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,740
(Shen's Diner)

694
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,420
(Distracted while eating,
being a laid-back person)

695
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,060
Isn't a restaurant
just like a teahouse?

696
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,640
Since ancient times, all kinds of people

697
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,680
all liked to come to such places
to discuss matters.

698
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,740
We keep our eyes on all sides

699
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,160
and our ears open in all directions,

700
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,100
and maybe we can pick up

701
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,300
some useful information

702
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,580
to help Mr. Lin.

703
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,420
Why are you standing here

704
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,270
instead of cooking?

705
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,100
Didn't we say we need
to gather intelligence?

706
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,940
I have to do it.

707
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,780
This is a man's job.

708
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,820
You women can't do it.

709
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,860
It's dangerous.

710
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,140
Listen to your words.

711
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,700
I think you should be taught a lesson.

712
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,820
Go cook. Go.

713
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,060
Dear. Dear.

714
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,700
Look at Shaojie.

715
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,500
Speak louder.

716
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,340
What're you doing?
Not going to let us eat?

717
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,190
What's wrong with you?

718
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,880
- You do business like this?
- Quick, go.

719
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,290
- It's OK. Go ahead.
- Owner?

720
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,130
Where's the owner?

721
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,500
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

722
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,780
Sorry.

723
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,380
His brain, you know,

724
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,900
there's something wrong with it.

725
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,100
This Agate Meat

726
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,060
is free of charge.

727
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,490
Enjoy yourself.

728
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,860
- The customers
- What would you like?

729
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,290
- or the passersby,
- Some of this.

730
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,590
- might be the spies.
- Chicken wings, got it.

731
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,380
OK.

732
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,620
Thank you.

733
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,740
Shaojie went out.

734
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,860
Step aside.

735
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,100
Come on.

736
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,080
What are you looking at?

737
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,950
I'm following someone.

738
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,420
Who are you following?

739
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,580
Well, that person.

740
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,430
Did you see him?

741
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,580
He definitely has a problem.

742
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,420
What's the problem?

743
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,100
It's not even winter yet.

744
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,660
He sneezed four times in a row.

745
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,600
What does this indicate?

746
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,780
He must have used the sneezing

747
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,820
to send a signal.

748
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,980
Well, who did he inherit
such low IQ from?

749
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,820
From you.

750
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,820
From whom?

751
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,150
Come on. He's gone away.

752
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,070
- Come on.
- Trust me.

753
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,470
Do you have a problem with your eyes

754
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,180
or your brain?

755
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,700
(Shen's Diner)

756
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,740
He really has a problem.

757
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,620
Help him reverse the case?

758
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,860
I think you're just trying
to get attention.

759
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,700
I... Well...

760
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,220
You're so jumpy and overreacting.

761
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,500
You want to gather information?

762
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,080
The information you found out

763
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,890
may be deliberately revealed
by someone else.

764
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,790
- I...
- Gongcai,

765
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,980
Mr. Lin is having a hard time.

766
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,120
Even though we couldn't help,

767
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,350
don't make things worse either.

768
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,100
- Father,
- I...

769
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,140
what exactly can you do well?

770
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,660
I...

771
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,900
(Clear and Bright)

772
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,750
Mr. Lin,

773
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,640
I

774
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,020
have one piece of news.

775
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,540
Third Master Wen,

776
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,420
who has a big mole on his face,

777
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,890
has a cousin who works
in the Imperial Kitchen.

778
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,100
According to him,

779
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,420
His Majesty

780
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,220
doesn't have a good appetite.

781
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,260
Later, I made more inquiries
in various ways.

782
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,610
This did happen.

783
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,380
This is definitely big news.

784
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,820
Yes, I also tried.

785
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,020
After my extensive inquiries,

786
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,940
I discovered

787
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,140
the sworn brother of the son

788
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,480
of the second aunt of the cousin

789
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,740
of the wife of the third brother

790
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,270
of that Aunt Ge who delivers fish to us

791
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,780
is a member

792
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,260
of the Jinwu Guards.

793
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,580
They've been

794
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,260
investigating the cat theft case.

795
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,300
Why are you looking at me like that?

796
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,700
His Majesty lost his cat.

797
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,900
That's a cat, after all.

798
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,700
Isn't this already big news?

799
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,900
This cat has already been found.

800
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,980
The Crown Prince liked it,

801
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,960
so he secretly took it away
for a few days.

802
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,790
His Majesty has already
given him a lesson.

803
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,460
By the way, Mr. Lin,

804
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,940
I found out

805
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,140
Mr. Meng, Left Supervisor,

806
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,940
is quite worried
about his granddaughter's marriage.

807
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,340
I heard his daughter's marriage
was not very good,

808
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,540
and she died in depression.

809
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,260
He doesn't want his granddaughter
to repeat the same mistake.

810
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,340
Mr. Meng also mentioned it to me.

811
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,180
Marriage?

812
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,620
Did you agree?

813
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,980
Did you agree?

814
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,300
No, no, no.

815
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,180
If Mr. Lin agreed,

816
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,520
then the whole Yong'an would know.

817
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,980
Yeah, you can't agree.

818
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,220
You're moved?

819
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,580
You're moved?

820
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Father, mother,

821
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,940
this is a private matter.

822
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,100
Let's not interfere anymore.

823
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,540
Yes.

824
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,300
Thank you all

825
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,060
for helping me discover

826
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,940
so many secrets of the capital.

827
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,140
Actually, recently we've been

828
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,120
studying the matter
of Yangyang going to school.

829
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,930
For most girls,
their families would invite

830
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,330
a teacher to come and give lessons.

831
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,380
We've met with some people.

832
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,580
But we were not very satisfied.

833
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,060
After some inquiries,

834
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,780
we learned that the best academy
is Hongwen Academy.

835
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,180
Grand Tutor Zhao Xunzhi
is also teaching here.

836
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,540
I inquired...

837
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,020
Well, when did you inquire?

838
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,220
You're quite a competent auntie.

839
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,700
I found out from this person,

840
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,560
the sworn brother of the son
of the second aunt

841
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,440
of the cousin of the wife
of the third brother

842
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,790
of that Aunt Ge, who delivers fish.

843
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,920
The one who is a Jinwu guard.

844
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,260
He said that 20 years ago,

845
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,300
Zhao Xunzhi was a disciple
of the Capital Prefect.

846
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,660
Why didn't he tell me?

847
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,540
He really was my father's disciple.

848
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,260
But after something happened
in my family,

849
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,390
he wanted to avoid suspicion,

850
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,720
so he never mentioned it again.

851
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,980
(Benefiting and Helping the People)

852
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,700
Sachets. Sachets.

853
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,660
Sachets with various scents.

854
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,700
Lady, take a look.

855
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,560
I found out

856
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,220
Mr. Meng, Left Supervisor,

857
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,900
is quite worried
about his granddaughter's marriage.

858
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,780
Mr. Meng also mentioned it to me.

859
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,060
- What's wrong, milady?
- Take a look.

860
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,420
Do you have something on your mind?

861
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,700
No.

862
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,020
Not really.

863
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,540
Why do you ask like that?

864
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,240
You seem absent-minded today.

865
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,270
It's fragrant.

866
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,590
Lady, take a look.

867
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,940
Alright, actually I read a novel.

868
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,900
It's quite cruel.

869
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,340
Why are you reading that for no reason?

870
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,380
That stuff is so difficult.

871
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,160
Can it not be cruel?

872
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,540
What are you saying?

873
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,580
I mean, I read

874
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,860
a sad story.

875
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,360
What story?

876
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
In the story,

877
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,060
that lady

878
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,460
accidentally fell off a cliff.

879
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,540
At this time,

880
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,580
a handsome young man came to rescue her.

881
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,620
She thought, 'better you than me'.

882
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,180
She didn't care if his arm was broken,

883
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,780
as long as he could save her.

884
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,680
This young lady is really heartless.

885
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,340
Yes.

886
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,460
Despite being such a heartless person,

887
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,500
she was actually willing
to let herself fall

888
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,240
to save the life of the one
who rescued her.

889
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,940
Then she must really love that person.

890
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,140
No way, how could that be?

891
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,140
It's not important.

892
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,580
Anyway,

893
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,060
this lifesaver will eventually
marry someone else.

894
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,340
How can the story be like this?

895
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,940
That young lady will be sad.

896
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,140
No, she is not sad.

897
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,180
How could she be sad?

898
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,380
This is too perverse.

899
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,300
Milady, why are you so excited?

900
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,550
What exactly do you want to say?

901
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,540
Why can't I understand?

902
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,220
It's nothing.

903
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,020
Really, it's nothing.

904
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,740
(Yunshui Manor)

905
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,980
We're friends.

906
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,420
How could you say you serve me?

907
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,540
Didn't you say before

908
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,220
that you don't plan to make friends?

909
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,860
People change.

910
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,860
Then we are friends now.

911
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,380
In Future Village,

912
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,700
friends should shake hands.

913
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,740
Hold on to me.

914
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,180
Don't let go.

915
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,100
(Shaoguang's Food Notes.
So hard.)

916

we risked our lives.)

917
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,960
