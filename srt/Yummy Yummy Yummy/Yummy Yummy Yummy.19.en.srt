2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,340
(Windfall)

4
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,580
(Longevity and Prosperity,
Promotion and Salary Increase)

5
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,860
Young Master.

6
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,940
Young Master.

7
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,500
Young Master.

8
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,980
Third Master Liu has come to visit.

9
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,390
(Windfall)
He is currently talking

10
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,620
with Lady Shen in the garden.

11
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,020
I see.

12
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,180
That's it?

13
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,420
Why don't you go eavesdrop?

14
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,860
Why should I go?

15
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,940
Stop carving that.

16
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,340
Anyway, the Princess will

17
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,980
give us Prince Consort Xiao's box.

18
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,140
It's very easy

19
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,100
to pick its lock.

20
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,900
The current emergency

21
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,820
is Third Master Liu
coming to pursue love.

22
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,900
Lady Shen decides entirely on her own

23
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,800
whom she wishes to meet

24
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,020
or not meet.

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,350
It's none of my business.

26
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,460
Young Master,

27
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,460
can you stop pretending?

28
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,660
Your thoughts are completely
transparent.

29
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,620
The clothes that Lady Shen gave you

30
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
are folded so preciously like that.

31
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,490
And this cushion that she gave you.

32
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,420
Look.

33
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,900
You won't even let me touch it.

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,380
And that cup.

35
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,260
You hold it carefully all day long.

36
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,550
(Eat on time)
Even if I'm dull,

37
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,580
I can still tell

38
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,580
you like her.

39
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,460
I'm so anxious.

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,960
I am the only grandson in the family.

41
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,500
And I'm still not married.

42
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,860
Only then would my grandpa be so abrupt

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,640
as to come to propose marriage
uninvited.

44
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,140
He was anxious

45
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,580
and misunderstood your intentions.

46
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,980
I won't take it to heart.

47
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,580
Although

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,680
the matter of my grandpa
coming to propose marriage

49
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
was not within my expectations,

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,060
well,

51
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,020
I hope you could

52
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,380
keep this proposal in mind.

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,540
These words

54
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,220
should have been spoken
by an official matchmaker

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,940
only after everything was prepared.

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,140
But now

57
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,390
I have no choice
but to shamelessly speak for myself.

58
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,840
I am 25 years old this year.

59
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,990
My ancestors have been people of Yong'an
for generations.

60
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,180
My family is in business.

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,020
Apart from the Guixiang Tavern
on Juxian Alley,

62
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,540
there are also 75 estates,

63
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,780
98 residential compounds,

64
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,340
and 632 shops.

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,980
You are so rich.

66
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,500
(Wait!)

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,900
(That smile?)

68
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,840
(Could it mean...)

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
(Lady,)

70
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,660
(are you satisfied
with everything you see?)

71
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,820
What I'm saying

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
is by no means a momentary impulse.

73
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,580
I hope

74
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,020
you

75
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,060
can consider carefully

76
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,260
the matter between you and me.

77
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,700
Why do you want to marry me?

78
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,060
You are naturally intelligent.

79
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,460
And your business skills

80
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,100
are the best I have ever seen
in my life.

81
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,740
You and I were meant to join forces.

82
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,940
If we get married,

83
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,460
the alliance will be
even more lasting and stable.

84
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,980
We are a good fit.

85
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,140
That's it?

86
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,980
You should be able to see

87
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,460
that I am not a pedantic person.

88
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,940
In ordinary families,
the husband works outside

89
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,000
and the wife stays at home.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,180
I just want to face the storms

91
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,740
together with my wife.

92
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,540
You are eloquent

93
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,380
and tactful.

94
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,980
Of course we are a perfect match.

95
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,420
The bond between you and me

96
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,980
is the alliance between Guixiang Tavern

97
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,180
and your family's eatery.

98
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,340
Shaoguang,

99
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,500
when we graduate,

100
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,620
you won't have to go back

101
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,100
to your family's restaurant every day.

102
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,820
In the future,

103
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,770
I'll earn money to support the family

104
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,460
and you find a stable job

105
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,500
to take care of the family.

106
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,780
I will treat you well.

107
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,980
Shen Shaoguang,

108
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,060
I have a good job now.

109
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,780
We are not compatible.

110
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,620
If you leave on your own,

111
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,290
you can still leave a good impression.

112
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,490
It's you who force me to say it,
making it look so bad.

113
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,220
You're too immature.

114
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,460
Mr. Liu,

115
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,620
sorry, I cannot agree.

116
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,020
You come from a distinguished family

117
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,140
and have upright conduct.

118
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,900
You are really a rare
and excellent person.

119
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,200
But my view on marriage

120
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,180
is quite different from yours.

121
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,300
Lady Shen,

122
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,420
no need to look for excuses so quickly.

123
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,620
I understand.

124
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,660
It happened suddenly.

125
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,580
But you and I are indeed a good match.

126
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,620
How about this?

127
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,860
You take a few more days
to think it over.

128
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,660
Sorry, I've already made up my mind.

129
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,900
Mr. Liu, wait a moment.

130
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,550
Last time, your grandpa left
in a hurry.

131
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,190
didn't have time
to return the pastries.

132
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,550
I will go and fetch it right away.

133
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,620
Mr. Lin.

134
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,820
Why are you here, Mr. Lin?

135
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,980
This is my home.

136
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
It's quite normal for me

137
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,020
to passed by, I guess.

138
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,500
Mr. Liu,

139
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,060
it was already late.

140
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,100
The garden is also large.

141
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,140
The road is hard to find.

142
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,620
I'll see you out.

143
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,580
See you.

144
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,620
This way.

145
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,860
Please.

146
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,940
Let's go.

147
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,780
This way.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,860
- I just turned him down.
- I'm taking a walk.

149
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,570
- Nothing else.
- Nothing else.

150
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,420
A walk?

151
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,780
A walk?

152
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,620
It's good.

153
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,020
OK, take a walk.

154
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,820
Wait a minute.

155
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,140
Mr. Lin.

156
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,740
What's wrong with your hands?

157
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,140
Winter is coming soon.

158
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,500
I wash dishes with cold water.

159
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,990
It's inevitable for hands to turn red.

160
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,480
Unfortunately, this is Yong'an.

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,360
It would be great if we were
in Future Village.

162
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,420
There is a machine called a dishwasher.

163
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,760
It can wash dishes automatically.

164
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,180
In this way, when winter comes,

165
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,420
I don't need to touch cold water

166
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,060
and my hands won't get frostbite.

167
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,980
Dishwasher?

168
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,780
What is it like?

169
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,420
It's just a square-shaped metal one.

170
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,260
And...

171
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,820
Let me draw it for you.

172
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,340
Like this.

173
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,940
It's roughly like this.

174
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,180
Here,

175
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,140
there is a pipe that can draw water
by itself.

176
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,180
There's also a pipe here.

177
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,340
It's for drainage.

178
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,420
There's water flowing here.

179
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,020
It can flush automatically.

180
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,300
Just like that, it washes the dishes
by itself.

181
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,860
This thing is really amazing.

182
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,340
But

183
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,420
how does it work on its own?

184
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,500
This thought from you

185
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,780
drives people toward the Future Village.

186
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,900
Yong'an does not have this condition.

187
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,380
It still requires manual operation.

188
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,820
Do you really like this dishwasher?

189
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,140
We didn't have money at home before.

190
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,500
We couldn't afford a dishwasher.

191
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,860
I thought I need to grow up quickly

192
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,980
and earn money to buy one.

193
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,380
Then I finally grew up
and started making money.

194
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,980
I bought a dishwasher.

195
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,940
But I came to Yong'an,

196
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,880
and ended up never being able to use it.

197
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,100
I feel quite upset about it.

198
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,660
However, my family all think

199
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,260
it's just a dishwasher.

200
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,020
How could I stay unhappy for so long?

201
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,770
You always wanted it
when you were little,

202
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,440
but never got it.

203
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,500
It will lead to particularly
deep obsession.

204
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,860
And

205
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,520
it's not that you've never had it;

206
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,760
it's that you once possessed it

207
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,700
and then lost it.

208
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,360
Of course you would feel sadder.

I have figured it out.

I am fond of Shen Shaoguang.

250
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,620
After I uncover the truth

251
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,020
and clear the Cui family's name,

252

254
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,620
you have finally figured it out.

255
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,980
That's great.

256
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,020
But what if Lady Shen

257
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,380
does not like you?

258
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,060
Then

259
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,900
let her find what she likes.

- I just turned him down.
- I'm taking a walk.

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,990
- Nothing else.
- Nothing else.

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,460
I have to eat breakfast
tomorrow morning.

263
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,900

264
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,780
Maybe

265
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,340
I can make her keep me in her heart.

267
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,740

268
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,740
please enjoy it.

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,460

by the Shen family.

270
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,300
Eat while it's hot.

271
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,140
I've always said I want to treat you.

272
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,140
But it's always been you treating me.

273
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,580
I really feel bad about this.

274
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,340
Delicious!

275
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,820
To be honest with you,

276
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,600
I invited you to dinner today

277
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,300
because I have a favor to ask.

278
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,660
Anran, just speak your mind.

279
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,300
I want you to arrange a meeting

280
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,860
with the Princess.

281
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,060
You are making things difficult for me.

282
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,860
You should know the Princess and I...

283
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,580
I am your friend.

284
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,820
Why do you help the Princess instead?

285
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,540
In fact,

286
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,660
I also feel very sorry.

287
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,900
I have something important

288
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,300
to ask the Princess for help.

289
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,100
But only by asking for your help

290
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,760
can this matter be handled smoothly.

291
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,150
I truly have no other way.

292
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,500
If you are willing to lend a hand,

293
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,090
I will do my utmost to repay you.

294
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,230
Please.

295
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,340
Alright.

296
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,240
In fact,

297
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,620
since we got to know each other,

298
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
you have truly

299
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,660
helped me a lot.

300
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,700
I owe you this.

301
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,190
Sorry to trouble you.

302
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,260
Anran,

303
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,700
although we haven't known each other
for long,

304
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,500
I can vaguely sense

305
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,260
that you seem to have some secrets.

306
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,420
But Anran, rest assured.

307
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,760
I won't press you with questions.

308
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
If you need help in the future,

309
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,180
please feel free to speak.

310
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,380
Though I am mediocre,

311
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,900
I am willing to risk my life

312
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,860
and draw my sword

313
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,830
to help you.

314
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,170
Many thanks.

315
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,460
You don't have to be like this.

Your Highness.

322
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,460
Here you are. Please have a seat.

323
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,100
Are you proficient in chess games?

324
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,580
Slightly knowledgeable.

325
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,980
But not skilled in it.

326
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,950
Your Highness,

327
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,890
you are asking me to play chess.

328
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,100
Then let's have a game.

329
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,180
The winner can ask the loser a question.

330
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,020
How about it?

331
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,780
I lost.

332

According to the rules,

333
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,340
I will ask you a question.

334
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,240
Your Highness, please.

335
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,660
Listen.

336
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,860
Do you like

337
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,580
cats or dogs?

338
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,940
Maybe cats.

339
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,580
Next round.

340
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,170
That's it?

341
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,380
Only this?

342
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,340
Actually, when I was little,

343
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,860
I raised a cat

344
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
named Erliang.

345
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,260
Later, my cousin lost it.

346
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,380
But my cousin

347
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,780
was unwilling to apologize to me for it.

348
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,060
In his eyes,

349
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,980
that cat is just as insignificant

350
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,180
as I am.

351
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,180
From then,

352
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,820
I studied hard.

353
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,660
I must stand out and succeed.

354
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,540
But I am far too mediocre

355
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,860
by nature,

356
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,860
and gradually

357
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,220
I have also accepted my mediocrity.

358
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,380
But...

359
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,140
But I was never able

360
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,580
to find my cat.

361
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,300
I lost.

362
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,740
Your Highness, please ask.

363
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,660
May I ask

364
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,420
who is the person you cherish the most
in the world?

365
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,540
It is my mother.

366
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,260
My father died young.

367
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,220
My mother raised me alone.

368
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,520
From the very first day
I arrived in the capital,

369
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,620
I swore

370
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,660
that once my salary increases,

371
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,260
I'll bring her to the capital

372
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,260
and live with me.

373
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,340
But it's been all these years.

374
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,340
They have never given me a raise.

375
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,420
I admit defeat.

376
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,940
Your Highness, please ask.

377
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,580
Who is the person you hate the most?

378
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,140
That's a lot more.

379
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,940
For example, my cousin who lost Erliang.

380
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,860
The uncle who said that my mother
restrained her husband.

381
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,420
And...

382
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,380
Anyway, there are so many

383
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,980
that I can't even list them all.

384
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,220
From small matters to big ones,

385
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,180
I know everything

386
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,740
about you.

387
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,420
I just want to ask

388
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,500
if you have ever had any regrets.

389
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,420
Of course there is.

390
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,860
For example,

391
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,100
the Qixi poetry gathering.

392
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,900
No, no.

393
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,980
No, no, no.

394
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,420
Your Highness, please forgive me.

395
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,480
Your Highness, forgive me.

396
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,980
Could it be that I win?

397
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,700
I win, don't I?

398
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,300
Congratulations.

399
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,900
According to the rules,

400
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,740
you may ask me a question.

401
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,580
Then I shall ask the question

402
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,460
that you just asked me.

403
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,220
Is there anything

404
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,580
that makes you feel regret?

405
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,180
I

406
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,660
regret marrying Fifth Master Xiao.

407
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,540
Since then, nothing has gone
as I wished.

408
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,980
As a princess,

409
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,980
I have no regrets.

410
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,060
But as Li Ruxin,

411
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,580
I am not happy.

412
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,460
My father, for the sake
of his own sense of loyalty

413
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,220
and also so that Mr. Xiao

414
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,300
could better assist my brother,

415
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,860
married me to Fifth Master Xiao.

416
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,180
Fifth Master Xiao had his own lover.

417
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,260
We are just a pair of pitiable people.

418
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,140
Less than half a month
after our marriage,

419
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,860
he fell from his horse by accident.

420
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,900
I could have poisoned him to death.

421
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,300
But I think he's a poor guy.

422
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,180
From then, I have to waste
the good years

423
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,140
wasting in taking care

424
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,220
of a person who is in deep sleep,

425
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,380
never to be free
for the rest of my life.

426
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,340
I didn't expect it to be this late.

427
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,060
Mr. Pei,

428
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,780
why not leave after having the meal?

429
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,220
Forget it.

430
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,500
I overstepped.

431
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,780
It's enough to confine me alone.

432
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,420
Why trouble you to accompany me?

433
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,620
Your Highness,

434
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,340
I'd better leave after having the meal.

435
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,740
We're friends.

436
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,340
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

437
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,780
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

438
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,540
Last night,

439
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,940
I had a delightful conversation

440
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,220
with Mr. Pei.

441
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,780
Last... last night?

442
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,740
Mr. Lin,

443
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,860
the belongings of the Prince Consort

444
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,260
(Pure and Noble)
are all stored here.

445
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,140
The wooden slips you are looking for

446
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,460
to settle the case are right in here.

447
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,620
But

448
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,180
the lock on that box is rather peculiar.

449
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,020
I don't have the key either.

450
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,900
See if you can open it.

451
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,220
How could this be?

452
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,380
This...

453
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,580
Your Highness,

454
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,460
the edges of the palm print

455
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,160
on the lid of this box
are extremely clear

456
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,760
and have not been covered by new dust.

457
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,780
It seems the thief

458
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,860
has just stolen the slips.

459
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,340
The residence is heavily guarded.

460
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,100
It is difficult for thieves to sneak in.

461
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,860
At that time, the Prince Consort
always carried the key with him.

462
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,460
After he had an accident,

463
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,020
the key also went missing.

464
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,420
Could it be that the Prince Consort Xiao
has woken up?

465
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,780
You freak me out.

466
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,180
I thought you had really woken up.

467
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,900
I didn't mean it that way.

468
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,540
I also hope

469
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,020
that he will recover soon.

470
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,820
Your Highness,

471
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,460
in my opinion,

472
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,100
there may be a traitor in the mansion.

473
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
They even dare to cause trouble
in my place.

474
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,820
Once caught, I'll strip them.

475
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,740
Someone.
Report to the Capital Prefecture.

476
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,100
Your Highness,

477
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,940
I am already here.

478
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,260
No need for that.

479
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,500
Indeed.

480
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,340
Your Highness,

481
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,860
since there is a traitor...

482
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,220
Why did this traitor

483
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,820
not steal gold, silver, or jewels,

484
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,260
only took away
the Prince Consort's slips?

485
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,860
Why did he take that useless thing?

486
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,700
It's useless to you,

487
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,260
but not necessarily for others.

488
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,360
Lately,

489
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,280
are there any unfamiliar faces
in your mansion?

490
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,000
Ever since I met with Mr. Pei,

491
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,990
it's been a long time
since any newcomers joined.

492
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,360
Even quite a few of the original ones
have been dismissed.

493
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,740
They are all official servants.

494
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,190
Even when establishing the residence,

495
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,480
the military must be registered.

496
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,280
It's impossible to leave
without permission.

497
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,860
The thief just acted.

498
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,180
Most likely, former subordinates
have taken bribes

499
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,460
and betrayed to do this.

500
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,420
Your Highness,

501
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,140
better to find an excuse

502
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,540
to temporarily seal off the gates.

503
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,940
OK.

504
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,540
Are you concerned

505
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,060
that suddenly sealing off the residence

506
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,700
might cause public criticism?

507
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,900
That's not the case.

508
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
It's just that

509
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,780
the Shen family introduced a hotpot
with dregs vinegar.

510
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,780
I was planning to go eat it.

511
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,700
Now I can't have it.

512
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
The attendant Liu beside you

513
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,000
should be trustworthy, right?

514
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,380
Why not send him out of the mansion

515
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,660
and invite Lady Shen?

516
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,500
What's this new thing?

517
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,980
How interesting!

518
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,100
Your Highness,

519
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,320
this is a newly developed snack

520
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,460
by my family,

521
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,860
called candied hawthorn.

522
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,580
Candied hawthorn?

523
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,300
This... this is sugar?

524
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,100
It is syrup made by boiling sugar.

525
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,660
You can actually make sugar

526
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,500
as thin and crisp as ice,

527
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,740
still wrapped with hawthorn.

528
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,020
Glad you like it.

529
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,560
Hawthorn aids digestion and the spleen.

530
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,050
Rock sugar promotes saliva production.

531
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,500
We also plan to make more varieties

532
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,480
and sell them at the stall
outside the restaurant.

533
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,220
If you like it,

534
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,460
I will send some more later.

535
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,460
Alright, alright.

536
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,300
Your Highness.

537
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,060
Have you found out anything?

538
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,460
The fingerprint on the box

539
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,500
is about seven inches long,

540
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,430
about three inches wide.

541
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,270
It can be calculated

542
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,300
the thief is likely a man,

543
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,540
standing over six feet tall.

544
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,990
There are at least a dozen people

545
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,700
in the mansion

546
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,300
who are six feet tall.

547
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,100
Lady Shen, don't panic.

548
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,340
There was a burglary
in the mansion today.

549
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,420
One of the Prince Consort's boxes
was damaged.

550
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,940
The things inside were stolen.

551
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,900
In order to catch the thief,

552
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,860
I've ordered the gate to be locked

553
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,020
and gathered everyone together.

554
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,620
As a result, no one is serving me now.

555
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,900
I'm afraid you couldn't leave for now.

556
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,780
It doesn't matter.

557
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,620
You enjoy the food from our family.

558
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,220
We couldn't be happier.

559
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,180
But I just heard you say

560
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,860
there are more than a dozen suspects.

561
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,980
This is hard to find him out.

562
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,780
Apart from the handprint on the box,

563
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,120
were there any fingerprints left?

564
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Fingerprint?

565
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,860
What are you doing?

566
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,900
Your Highness,

567
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,380
I'm taking fingerprints.

568
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,260
It was discovered
in the previous dynasty

569
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,060
that the patterns
on each person's fingers

570
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,000
are divided into whorls and loops.

571
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,830
Contracts and documents often

572
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,390
use fingerprint stamps for endorsement.

573
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,620
Those patterns can thus be used

574
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,990
to distinguish everyone's identity.

575
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,700
You just said

576
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,550
this box has not been touched
for a long time.

577
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,660
After discovering the theft,

578
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,620
none of you have touched the lock on it.

579
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,820
Then these fingerprints on it

580
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,140
must belong to the same person.

581
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,900
I got it.

582
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
Here they are.

583
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,180
Today, the Crown Prince
paid a sudden visit.

584
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,500
For the sake of his safety,

585
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,380
the mansion will be temporarily closed.

586
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,820
Her Highness considers
the inconveniences for you,

587
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,920
so she grants each person
one string of coins.

588
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,020
Come on.

589
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,480
Line up one by one to take the money.

590
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,240
(List)
Put a fingerprint after receiving it.

591
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,890
So I can give an account
to Her Highness.

592
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,660
Li Sheng.

593
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,500
Here.

594
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,060
(Clerk: Li Sheng)

595
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,380
Pei Dalang.

596
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,220
Here.

597
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,260
(Registrar: Pei Dalang)

598
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,580
(Operational staff: Liu Shier)

599
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,340
(Operational staff: Meng Tie)

600
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,540
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

601
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,550
His Highness has other official duties.

602
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,900
He can't come today.

603
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,280
The mansion gate is already open.

604
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,380
Everyone, please feel free.

605
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,700
Hurry, hurry.

606
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,580
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

607
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,580
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

608
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,780
Your Highness,

609
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,620
please review.

610
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,380
(Conduct oneself with great elegance)

611
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,400
(Associate with gentlemen)

612
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,300
This handwriting is different.

613
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,820
The wooden slips are fake.

614
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,500
I...

615
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,300
I personally took them from the box

616
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,540
where Prince Consort Xiao

617
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
kept wooden slips.

618
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,900
After you stole them,

619
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,140
did you immediately left the mansion?

620
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,180
I was worried about arousing suspicion,

621
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,200
so I planned to take advantage
of the shift change

622
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,990
to leave there.

623
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,860
Who would have thought

624
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,820
Her Highness,
due to the Crown Prince's visit,

625
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,240
closed the gates in the afternoon.

626
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,980
I have kept the slips hidden
in the room all along.

627
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,820
When the gate opens,

628
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,620
I hurried back to Sushui City.

629
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,580
The Crown Prince has truly gone there?

630
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,540
No.

631
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,780
But...

632
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,660
But the Crown Prince is close
to the Princess.

633
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,600
He comes if he wants to,

634
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,150
and doesn't come if he doesn't want to.

635
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,380
It doesn't seem unusual at all.

636
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,340
It seems

637
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,940
Anran has already found out.

638
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,460
Young Master, you truly
have remarkable foresight.

639
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,180
You used that excuse
to send away that servant.

640
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,700
(The Case of Fan Lüe)
I went into his room to search.

641
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,760
(The facts are clear and undeniable)
I really found these slips.

642
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,180
And then I followed what you said

643
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,380
and swapped them with forged ones.

644
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,660
There're many doubts about the case

645
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,020
of selling official positions.

646
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,100
Liu Chang,

647
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,840
Fifth Master Xiao really recorded it.

648
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,940
No wonder they wanted to steal them.

649
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,900
They have been sending people
to watch us.

650
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,460
Because I am close to the Princess.

651
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,760
They are afraid of being exposed.

652
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So they had to act rashly

653
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,440
to steal from the Princess's mansion.

654
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,780
So that means

655
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,540
there must be other clues here.

656
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,620
Keep looking.

657
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,980
(... injured someone.
Prefect Cui...)

658
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,370
(The Case of Heluo Wang Kejiu)

659
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,620
Young Master,

660
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,460
why is there nothing written here?

661
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,640
Fifth Master Xiao had originally
written something here.

662
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,660
It seems he wiped it off.

663
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,980
But he was very hesitant,

664
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,580
so it wasn't wiped clean.

665
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,100
The outlines of the characters

666
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,300
can still be vaguely seen.

667
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,460
Cui Yong...

668
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,580
The friend...

669
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,980
Of...

670
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,060
What...

671
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,860
Actually...

672
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,380
This is all crooked and messy.

673
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,340
I can't make out anything at all.

674
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,540
Cui Ning's old friend, Second Master,

675
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,560
had originally argued strongly for him,

676
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,100
but after one night,

677
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,580
he suddenly changed his stance.

678
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
Your eyesight is amazing.

679
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,700
Second Master?

680
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,020
Does Mr. Cui have a friend
ranked second?

681
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,620
Is there?

682
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,460
Among the disciples of my father,

683
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,100
there is indeed one who ranks second.

684
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,860
I found out from this person,

685
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,760
the sworn brother of the son
of the second aunt

686
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,600
of the cousin of the wife
of the third brother

687
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,990
of that Aunt Ge, who delivers fish.

688
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,980
The one who is a guard.

689
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,020
He said that 20 years ago,

690
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,300
Zhao Xunzhi was a disciple
of the Capital Prefect.

691
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,780
Zhao Xunzhi?

692
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,580
(Second Master suddenly
changed his stance overnight.)

693
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,700
This is a dishwasher?

694
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,740
(Shen's Diner)

695
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,560
If you hadn't helped me
verify the fingerprint,

696
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,400
and find the culprit,

697
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,500
I definitely can't

698
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,780
retrieve the things in that box.

699
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,600
To express my gratitude,

700
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,860
I want to give you a gift.

701
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,240
A dishwasher?

702
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,860
What is it like?

703
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,100
How about this?

704
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,140
Let me draw it for you.

705
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,900
Here, it has a tube.

706
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,100
It can draw water on its own.

707
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,220
There's also a pipe here.

708
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,220
It's for drainage.

709
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,340
There's water flowing here.

710
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,900
It can flush automatically.

711
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,140
You really made it.

712
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,260
I was just speaking casually.

713
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,820
That night,

714
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,740
you drew simply,

715
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,800
and didn't say much either.

716
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,300
I thought it over and over,

717
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,330
but I still don't know how

718
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,680
to make it operate automatically.

719
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,460
I had to settle for the next best thing,

720
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,380
and made a hand-cranked drum.

721
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Want to give it a try?

722
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,100
I just got a few plates

723
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,100
from the lobby.

724
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,220
This is the water valve.

725
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,780
Give it a try.

726
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,850
It really can wash dishes.

727
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,020
Of course.

728
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,620
It must take you a long time

729
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,780
to make this machine.

730
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,740
It didn't delay your proper work, right?

731
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,740
No.

732
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,900
It's easy.

733
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,350
It didn't cause any delay.

734
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,220
Was this injury

735
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,220
caused by using the dishwasher?

736
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,980
It's not.

737
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,140
I got scratched accidentally

738
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,740
while fixing a chair
in Capital Prefecture.

739
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,660
It has nothing to do
with the dishwasher.

740
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,540
As a Capital Prefect,

741
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,500
you even have to fix the chair yourself?

742
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,860
Yes.

743
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,180
I just

744
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,220
don't want to trouble others.

745
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,340
(Restricted Warehouse Area,
No Unauthorized Entry)

746
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,060
Shaoguang,

747
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,140
do you care about me

748
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,820
at least a little in your heart?

749
