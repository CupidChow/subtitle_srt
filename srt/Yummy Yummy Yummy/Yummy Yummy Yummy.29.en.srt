=Episode 29=

3
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,960
Faster, faster.

4
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,930
He's running out of time.

5
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,760
- OK.
- Quick.

6
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,190
Mr. Lin,

7
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,910
wake up, wake up.

8
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,750
Mr. Lin.

9
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,390
Wake up.

10
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
Lin Yan.

11
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,520
Look at me.

12
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,670
Lin Yan.

13
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,920
Don't sleep.

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,830
Look at me.

15
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,670
Don't sleep.

16
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,110
Don't fall asleep.

17
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,150
Lin Yan.

18
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
Lin Yan.

19
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,630
Hurry up.

20
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,150
Hurry up.

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,990
Young Master, hang in there.

22
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,870
Young Master, we're almost home.

23
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,710
Hurry up.

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Quick.

25
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,040
Young Master!

26
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,060
(Gentle and Calm)

27
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,150
Lin Yan.

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,520
Lin Yan.

29
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,270
Lin Yan.

30
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
Lin Yan.

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,920
You promised me

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,990
that you wouldn't sleep.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
Wake up.

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,590
Wake up.

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,960
Don't sleep.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,550
Don't sleep, don't sleep.

37
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,920
I promise you

38
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,710
I won't sleep.

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,050
This wound is too deep

40
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,150
that the organs are visible.

41
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,250
I'm afraid he can't survive.

42
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,080
Don't say that.

43
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,590
Don't.

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,720
As it is written in the book,

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,270
there is already a suture technique.

46
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,270
Didn't Hua Tuo use Mafeisan
to relieve pain?

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,240
Doctor,

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,840
you stitched up his wound
with a needle.

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
No, no.

50
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,680
I've only read about these in books,

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,270
I've never seen anyone actually do this.

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,750
I... I don't know how.

53
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,750
I don't have Mafeisan either.

54
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,530
At this moment, what are you afraid of?

55
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,590
You sew like you stitch clothes.

56
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,870
This is the Vice Prefect.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,340
I can't control the strength well.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,350
If something goes wrong,

59
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,470
I can't take responsibility.

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,200
Lady, you go find Hua Tuo instead.

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm begging you.

62
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,990
Doctor,

63
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,030
please save our master.

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,150
Doctor, I'm begging you.

65
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,800
Doctor, I beg you.

66
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,990
Please save our master.

67
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,830
I beg you.

68
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,710
You can do it, doctor.

69
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,960
Please save...

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
You do it.

71
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,110
You do it.

72
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,550
I, I...

73
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,990
Young Master...

74
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,200
Jicai, you can do it.

75
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,870
No, no, no.

76
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,150
Jicai,

77
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,520
you are flustered now.

78
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,700
If you stitch it yourself,

79
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,750
you'll definitely tremble.

80
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,110
How about this?

81
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,110
Let me do it.

82
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,080
It's just stitching.

83
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,270
I can sew clothes too.

84
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,120
If something happens,

85
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,290
just put all the blame on me.

86
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,270
Let me do it.

87
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,020
Let me do it.

88
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,980
Lady, you use this strong liquor

89
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,220
and burn it.

90
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,300
Are you going to...

91
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,340
Disinfect.

92
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,340

All rubbish!

128
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,340
Lin Yan,

129
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,260
we'll see.

130
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,060
(Yunshui Manor)

131
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,380
Let go.

132
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,180
Lin Yan, you are an official.

133
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,240
You knowingly break the law

134
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,320
and imprison a good citizen.

135
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,380
Let go of my hand.

136
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,380
I don't understand what you're saying.

137
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,220
I only know,

138
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,760
as long as you harden your heart
and break free forcefully,

139
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,100
you clearly can walk away.

140
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,120
So,

141
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,180
this is your choice.

142
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,300
Lin Yan,

143
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,900
yes, this is my choice.

144
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,140
So what?

145
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,300
Can we cross the boundaries of morality

146
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,920
and step into the forbidden zone
of love?

147
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,340
Are you out of your mind?

148
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,880
You don't choose a healthy relationship,

149
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,160
but a forbidden romance with me,

150
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,900
is that so?

151
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,660
I don't understand what you're saying.

152
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,940
I don't want to understand either.

153
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,140
Lin Yan,

154
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,020
you are the Vice Prefect.

155
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,740
As long as you don't choose me,

156
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,660
you will live a very good life.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,580
You will rise quickly through the ranks.

158
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,220
You will be promoted and ennobled.

159
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,340
In the future, a gentle and kind lady

160
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,140
from a distinguished family
with the surname Shen

161
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,940
will appear by your side.

162
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,260
You will have countless descendants,

163
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,460
including me as well.

164
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,540
If that person is not you,

165
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,940
I just wouldn't choose.

166
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,300
You can't decide for me.

167
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,620
Shaoguang,

168
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,700
is this matter

169
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,940
so serious

170
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,100
in your era?

171
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,540
Sure.

172
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,700
For me,

173
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,500
this is a disregard
for moral principles,

174
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,880
destroying ancestors
and being disrespectful,

175
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,900
obscene and immoral,

176
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,820
and unfilial and disobedient.

177
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,420
If the Cui family knew in the afterlife,

178
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,660
there will be no rest.

179
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,380
And I

180
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,020
cannot atone for the crime.

181
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,340
Clan law,

182
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,740
rules,

183
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,740
Heaven and Earth,

184
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,140
no one will tolerate a shameless sinner
like me.

185
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,220
But I

186
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,700
am still unwilling to let go.

187
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,820
(Yunshui Manor)

188
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,660
Hu.

189
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,780
Hu.

190
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,780
Here.

191
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,580
Mr. Shen.

192
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,740
(Yunshui Manor)
Please stop.

193
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,580
Well,

194
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,140
what is this?

195
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,980
What's going on here?

196
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,220
Mr. Lin

197
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,620
asked us to keep watch at this door

198
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,420
these few days.

199
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,850
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

200
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,780
Is there another assassin again?

201
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,860
Has the enemy arrived?

202
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,100
Well, not really.

203
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,040
However, he just ordered

204
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,660
that no one is allowed
to enter or leave.

205
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,780
Come back another day.

206
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,180
I am the most shameful coward

207
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,020
under this sky,

208
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
only daring to secretly
worship you father here.

209
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,460
I don't even dare to write his name.

210
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,860
I guess

211
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,020
my father

212
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,740
truly regarded you as a close friend.

213
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,620
You too.

214
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,260
Otherwise,

215
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,020
you wouldn't be standing here with me.

216
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,860
Without you overturning the testimony,

217
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,740
I could never clear my father's name.

218
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,580
After falsely accusing your father
that day,

219
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,820
I was then forced
to become a lackey of Prince Zhao.

220
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,660
I served as the Grand Tutor,

221
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,820
recruiting students.

222
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,500
He would then bring them
under his command

223
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,660
and send them into the court.

224
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,860
Ministry of War, Ministry of Revenue,
Ministry of Personnel, Censorate.

225
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,780
His hand

226
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,620
has reached too far.

227
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,460
This habit of recording matters in slips

228
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,780
was taught to your father
by Fifth Master Xiao back then.

229
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,660
Your father then taught it to me.

230
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,540
I have included the entire sequence
of events

231
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,940
and all the evidence

232
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,300
within it.

233
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,780
You present it all to His Majesty.

234
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,820
According to the law,

235
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,460
even if I testify against the sinner,

236
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,980
I will also be put to death.

237
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,900
Could you consider this

238
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,860
my repayment?

239
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,860
Your countless deaths
cannot redeem the crime,

240
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,980
unable to repay even a fraction.

241
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,380
However, I think,

242
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,540
with the disposition of my father,

243
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,020
if you go to keep him company

244
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,740
he is still willing

245
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,140
to talk about books
and philosophy

246
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,900
together with you in the netherworld.

247
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,140
Is your body made of iron?

248
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,990
Where have you been these past few days?

249
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,580
Go see Mentor Zhao

250
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,100
and pay respects to my father with him.

251
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,790
With this reason,

252
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,500
I can't hold anything against you yet.

253
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,200
I thought

254
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,140
you will ask me immediately

255
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,700
when I will let you go.

256
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,060
But you

257
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,740
care more about me.

258
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,860
Lin Yan,

259
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,220
I've told you I don't like the story
of the weaving maiden.

260
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,540
Her clothes were hidden away

261
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,860
and she was trapped.

262
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,580
Sorry.

263
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,780
Lin Yan,

264
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
by trapping me like this,

265
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,360
you're only making things difficult
for yourself.

266
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,940
You originally only liked me a little.

267
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,220
But by locking me up,

268
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,540
you're forcing yourself

269
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,380
to keep increasing your investment
and burden.

270
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,800
The more you try to trap me,

271
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,980
the more you trap yourself.

272
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,420
Is it necessary?

273
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,540
We can always manage to

274
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,980
to forget each other.

275
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,580
I can't.

276
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,300
Then give it a try.

277
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,380
It's not that hard.

278
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,880
Let's pretend nothing ever happened

279
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,460
between us from now on.

280
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,380
(Shen's Diner)

281
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,020
He locked her up for so many days.

282
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,060
Mr. Lin

283
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,460
was messing around.

284
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,140
Well, this...

285
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,580
I don't know. The key thing now
is that we don't know anything.

286
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,180
Our ancestor was the Vice Prefect.

287
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,100
What can we do?

288
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,380
File a complaint to the Emperor?

289
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,060
We can't.

290
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,500
After all, he is our ancestor.

291
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,180
If we sue him,
we will be punished by God.

292
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,380
She is Jicai.

293
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,300
I'm telling you if it really happens,

294
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,220
I will kill your ancestor.

295
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,100
If this really happened,

296
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,820
I would kill him myself, OK?

297
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,660
But

298
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,900
I think our ancestor

299
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,780
would never do such a thing.

300
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,260
Come on.

301
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,620
How could we do?

302
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,580
A man and a woman alone in a room.

303
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,540
Oh my god.

304
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,860
Jicai. Jicai.

305
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,790
- Jicai.
- Jicai.

306
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,660
Are you alright?

307
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,500
Jicai,

308
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,580
has something happened?

309
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Jicai, how are you?

310
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,750
Is everything alright?

311
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,420
- Is everything alright?
- No.

312
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,660
Do you want me
to make you something tasty?

313
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,340
Jicai, just tell me

314
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,300
what you need me to do right now.

315
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,340
Jicai, no matter what happens,
you should tell us.

316
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,380
I'm fine.

317
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,900
Nothing has happened.

318
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,180
Mr. Lin just got injured.

319
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,620
I took care of him for a few days.

320
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,740
That's it.

321
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,500
I'll go rest first.

322
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,660
Have a rest.

323
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,300
Father.

324
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,300
Mother.

325
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,660
I told you so.

326
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,820
That kind of thing won't happen.
You're all too...

327
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,140
I just said that such a thing

328
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,420
is simply impossible to happen.

329
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,380
Your mother's just read too many novels.

330
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,540
Why do you pinch me again?

331
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,580
As long as she's fine.

332
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,780
That's right.

333
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,820
Bear with it.

334
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,740
Father,

335
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,860
all that I am today

336
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,380
is caused by Lin Yan.

337
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,820
If my elder brother were still alive,

338
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,640
he would cut Lin Yan into pieces

339
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,800
to revenge me.

340
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,500
Take action.

341
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,340
Yes.

342
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,100
(Zichen Hall)

343
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,100
The palace is celebrating the festival.

344
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,760
His Majesty is inconvenient
to summon you.

345
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,740
I have important matters.

346
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,230
I've previously sent people to report.

347
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,090
I must see His Majesty
as soon as possible.

348
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,380
Wait.

349
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,100
Why is it not Eunuch Qin

350
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,450
conveying His Majesty's intentions?

351
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,660
Eunuch Qin is ill.

352
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,340
Your expression is not good.

353
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,580
Things didn't go smoothly, huh?

354
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,060
I failed to see His Majesty.

355
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,980
The one who came out to see me today

356
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,700
was a young eunuch
I had never seen before.

357
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,140
He said that Eunuch Qin was ill.

358
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,420
But how could there be
an unfamiliar face

359
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,900
around His Majesty?

360
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,180
Yeah.

361
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,620
That's exactly the problem.

362
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,980
Eunuch Qin has asked us

363
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,100
to meet his people.

364
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,460
Even if he is sick,

365
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,760
it will still be them coming out
to deliver the message.

366
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
It shouldn't be

367
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,580
a strange young eunuch.

368
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,500
Yes.

369
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,070
Is Mr. Lin in the carriage?

370
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,910
Mr. Pei.

371
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,770
He is.

372
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,500
Twelfth Master.

373
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,340
Anran.

374
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,380
I'm planning to go
to Yunshui Manor to find you.

375
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,580
Fortunately, I came across you.

376
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,180
Why in such a hurry?
What's the matter?

377
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,260
Let's talk in the carriage.

378
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,220
What's the matter?

379
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,500
It's like this.

380
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,020
Today,

381
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,060
I passed by the Princess Mansion
by chance.

382
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
Then...

383
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,580
Well, maybe not entirely by chance.

384
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,300
My mother

385
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,020
had someone bring me
some rice dumplings.

386
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,980
It's quite tasty.

387
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
I... I just want

388
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
to deliver them for her to try.

389
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,960
But that's not the point.

390
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,930
The point is

391
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,330
that people in this mansion said

392
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,380
the Princess went to the palace
early in the morning

393
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,140
to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival.

394
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,700
Early in the morning?

395
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,220
Yes, early in the morning.

396
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,900
This time can be said to be strange

397
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,980
but also reasonable,

398
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,500
and if you say it's reasonable,

399
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,540
it's still somewhat strange.

400
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,220
After all, she only entered the palace
at noon in the past.

401
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,120
In the morning, the Crown Prince

402
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,060
always goes to the Hongwen Academy

403
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,260
for half a day.

404
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,940
Go to the Hongwen Academy.

405
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,580
Go to Hongwen Academy.

406
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
(Shen's Diner)

407
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,250
Something would happen
in the palace.

408
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,780
Yangyang is still in the palace.

409
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,700
Around 8 o'clock in the morning,

410
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,140
the Crown Prince was invited
to the palace for the festival.

411
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,020
Yangyang was curious,

412
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,260
so the Crown Prince then took her along.

413
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,060
What is there for her
to be curious about?

414
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,300
She didn't study properly.

415
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,620
Why did she go to the palace?

416
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,500
What will happen in the palace?

417
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,300
Is there really going to be an accident?

418
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,140
History textbooks

419
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,400
never recorded this rebellion.

420
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,560
When my grandpa told stories,

421
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,780
he never mentioned it at all.

422
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,100
That means Prince Zhao

423
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,740
didn't cause much of a stir this time.

424
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,060
It's not even worth noting down.

425
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,060
Yes, yes, yes.

426
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,180
Before going to Fenglin Town,

427
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,720
I entered the palace
to meet His Majesty.

428
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,020
Your playing chess today actually

429
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,780
incite me to pursue dominance.

430
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,660
I have suspended your post

431
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,460
and ordered you to rest at home.

432
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,900
But you should be clear in your heart

433
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,460
that you are the aide
I intend to keep for Xu.

434
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,080
I trust you without doubt.

435
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,580
You insisted on seeing me today.

436
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,100
It's not just to accompany me
in playing chess, right?

437
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,460
Why I came here,

438
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,940
I'm sure

439
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,540
you already know.

440
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,140
Prince Zhao.

441
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,220
His Majesty got 16.

442
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,260
Complete victory.

443
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,460
No, what do you mean by that?

444
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,740
I really don't understand at all.

445
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,700
The key now is Yangyang.

446
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,700
What can she do?

447
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,820
What Lin Yan means is

448
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,300
His Majesty has long been aware

449
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,660
of Prince Zhao's wolfish ambitions.

450
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,900
Although he doesn't know
when he will take action,

451
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,980
it means that the palace

452
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,200
has been prepared at all times.

453
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,280
Be careful with your words.

454
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,660
Due to my position,

455
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,700
I shouldn't say too much.

456
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,420
But I have to reassure you.

457
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,100
I promise

458
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,900
Yangyang will be fine.

459
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,100
I have to leave first.

460
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,140
You stay here

461
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,060
to wait for my news.

462
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,220
Mr. Lin, hurry up.

463
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,460
Well...

464
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,300
(Xuanzheng Gate)

465
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,340
Brother,

466
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,740
at this Dragon Boat Festival,

467
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,380
we will shoot glutinous rice balls.

468
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,860
So today,

469
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,460
I invite some sons and nephews of us

470
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,100
to the palace to play.

471
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,740
These little princes

472
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,940
have all grown dull in peaceful times.

473
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,460
They don't expect

474
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,550
they also have the possibility
of taking over the throne.

475
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,540
So much fun!

476
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,380
Take it.

477
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,980
Even if you kill them all,

478
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,500
you may not necessarily

479
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,460
firmly hold this position.

480
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,980
That's why

481
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,380
I ask for rightful justification.

482
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,620
You've been gravely ill for many days.

483
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,060
The Crown Prince was unfilial

484
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,260
and never attended to illness.

485
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,900
He actually planned this palace coup

486
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,340
at the Dragon Boat Festival

487
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,900
to force you to abdicate.

488
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,540
I truly have no choice

489
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,900
but purge the Emperor's close aides.

490
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,260
So,

491
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,640
about the imperial edict
to depose the Crown Prince,

492
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,140
have you thought

493
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,860
how it should be written?

494
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,420
Well,

495
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,060
I want to know how Yangyang is now.

496
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
Is she cold or hungry?

497
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,220
Is she scared or not?

498
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,200
Yangyang has been blessed
since she was a child.

499
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,290
She can definitely turn misfortune
into blessing.

500
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,100
Definitely.

501
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,780
Definitely.

502
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,660
Gongcai,

503
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,820
can you stop walking around?

504
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,340
It has made me dizzy.

505
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,740
The ancestor knows what's going on.

506
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,820
Yangyang will be fine.

507
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,180
Father, Mother,

508
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,410
I'd better go to the palace.

509
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,000
It's not that I don't trust him.

510
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,420
But Yangyang is my daughter.

511
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,500
I can't just stand here

512
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,020
and don't do anything at all.

513
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,080
Alright, alright, alright.

514
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,580
Don't rush.

515
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,340
If you go, we'll definitely go together.

516
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,500
But I'm just worried

517
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,740
if we go there,

518
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,090
we will make things worse instead.

519
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,020
- At this moment...
- How could it be worse?

520
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,020
They have rebelled.

521
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,460
Is there anything worse than this?

522
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,960
Three ordinary people together

523
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,120
can be as wise as a great man.

524
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,020
We are four people.

525
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,020
I want to enter the palace
to rescue them.

526
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,540
Yeah, enter the palace.

527
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,500
Rescue them.

528
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,630
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

529
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,180
(Xiande Hall)

530
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,540
Xu,

531
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,660
write a confession letter,

532
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,780
saying that you deliberately
injured your father

533
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,380
during the Dragon Boat Festival banquet,

534
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
which caused his death.

535
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,540
This is considered infidelity,

536
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,260
being unfilial,

537
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,540
and ingratitude.

538
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,000
What have you done to my father?

539
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,300
Li Ang,

540
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,940
your father is obstinately refusing
to change.

541
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,220
You still have a chance to repent.

542
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,500
Aunt,

543
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,100
no matter who holds the Imperial Seal,

544
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,540
you are still the Princess.

545
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,820
If you side with Li Xu,

546
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,380
you can only be posthumously
awarded a title after death.

547
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,660
You better think it over.

548
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,620
As long as you write this,

549
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,460
I will immediately take you
to see your father.

550
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,980
You can't write.

551
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,360
Once you write it, you're done for.

552
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,100
Do you think he will let us go?

553
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,460
Courting death!

554
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,700
Let them go.

555
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,820
Otherwise, I would rather die

556
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,860
that comply with your wishes.

557
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,740
You are not qualified
to negotiate with me.

558
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,660
Uncle Liu Chang.

559
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,900
Yangyang, are you OK?

560
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,660
Are you OK?

561
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,740
Yangyang, don't be afraid.

562
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,220
I came late.

563
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,660
Stop crying, stop crying.

564
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,500
You go first.

565
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,340
I'll cover the rear.

566
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,980
No, no, no.

567
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,260
You are not Lin Yan.

568
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,980
Hurry.

569
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,660
Yu San,

570
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,700
you dare betray us.

571
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,820
Do you and your family not want
to live anymore?

572
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,260
You probably still don't know

573
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,740
how many hostages have gone missing
in Fenglin Town.

574
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,940
Mr. Lin has already sent someone
to rescue my parents.

575
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,040
You're courting death.

576
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,570
What are you hiding here for?

577
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,060
You're really skilled!

578
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,330
Why didn't you do it earlier?

579
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,410
I almost died!

580
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,900
Stop nonsense. Come with me quickly.

581
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,580
Mount it.

582
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,460
What's wrong?

583
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,620
How did you ride your horse just now?

584
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,620
Just now I...

585
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,180
I'm doing this
for the sake of national interests,

586
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,060
for the sake of Anran.

587
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,940
Anran and I have also been

588
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,660
through life-and-death situations now.

589
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,040
You first meet up with the Princess

590
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,880
later in the palace.

591
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,270
I will hold off Prince Zhao's men.

(Edict of Abdication)

593
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,220
If you're unwilling to write,

594
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,660
then I will write it for you.

595
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,780
As long as you sign and seal it,

596
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,030
hand over the Imperial Seal
and the Military Tally,

597
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,220
I shall honor you
as the Emperor Emeritus.

598
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,660
How about it?

599
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,340
Li,

600
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,940
you kill your brother and nephew.

601
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,450
How could you be worthy

602
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,140
of this Heaven-mandated Imperial Seal?

603
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,460
Kill my brother and nephew?

604
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,060
Who knows?

605
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,780
The palace is locked.

606
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,860
Not a single bit of news has leaked.

607
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,300
The world will only know

608
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,220
that the one who committed regicide
was the Crown Prince, Li Xu.

609
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,380
I,

610
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,980
forced by circumstances,

611
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,550
will only then take over the throne.

612
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,740
I will ask you one last time.

613
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,380
Where exactly are the Military Tally
and the Imperial Seal?
