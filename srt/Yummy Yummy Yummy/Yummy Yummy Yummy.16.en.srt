=Episode 16=

3
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,700
(Start Near to Go Far)

4
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,910
Why are you still here?

5
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,630
I've been working all day.

6
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,830
I'm tired.

7
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
Tired?

8
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,190
If so, go sleep at the diner.

9
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,550
Fengxia.

10
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,430
Can we stop this?

11
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,710
Let me sleep here.

12
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,360
That diner is

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,990
cold and quiet.

14
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,150
Moreover, it's not warm

15
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,360
without you.

16
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,270
Dear.

17
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,830
You want to sleep here, huh?

18
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,150
Fine.

19
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,150
Really?

20
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,430
I have two conditions.

21
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,590
Go ahead.

22
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,030
Give me all your money from now on,

23
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,590
and I'll give you 10 qian every month.

24
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,150
Besides,

25
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,480
if you ever show off

26
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,400
because of your chef titles,

27
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,750
I'll dock your pay.

28
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,240
You'll only give me 10 qian,

29
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,400
and you'll dock my pay?

30
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,520
This is outrageous.

31
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,640
Our diner is doing so well.

32
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,120
Ten qian is too little.

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,430
Can I have a little more?

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,990
If you don't agree,

35
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,270
I won't force you.

36
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,590
We'll just stick to the tradition

37
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,480
and split

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,830
the profits evenly.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,080
You can go to sleep at the diner.

40
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,760
I...

41
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,200
I don't want to sleep at the diner.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,400
It's getting late.

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Go and sleep.

44
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,030
I'm not sleepy.

45
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,990
Go, go.

46
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,120
Just 10 qian.

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,480
This is too little.

48
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,640
Bye.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,240
It's too little.

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,080
Young Master.

51
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,040
Young Master.

52
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,870
I've searched everywhere for you.

53
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,960
What's going on?

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
Why are you sneaking

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,270
into Lady Shen's chamber so late?

56
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,270
Nonsense.

57
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,360
I came to ask her about the Prince.

58
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,080
I need to find out

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
what he told Uncle Shen

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,200
behind my back.

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
This is urgent.

62
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,740
A messenger from Chengzhou is here,

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,360
reporting a tragedy of 32 deaths.

64
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,680
Chengzhou used to be
under your jurisdiction.

65
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,800
You should go and see.

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,200
The messenger is waiting outside.

67
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,830
Let's go.

68
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,910
Milady.

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,800
You invited me here to keep you company.

70
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,050
Is there something on your mind?

71
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,380
Do you want to talk?

72
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,840
I can't understand why Prince Zhao

73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,510
insists on sending us to Sushui City.

74
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,920
Prince Zhao?

75
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,310
It's not about Mr. Lin?

76
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,920
I saw you two

77
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,840
doing that

78
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,160
in the carriage today.

79
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,040
What do you mean?

80
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
We did nothing.

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,630
I saw everything.

82
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,680
No, no.

83
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,600
You're mistaken.

84
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,550
I have the utmost respect for Mr. Lin.

85
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,690
I regard him as an ancestor,

86
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,780
a deity.

87
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,360
Don't say such blasphemous words.

88
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,720
I might be struck by lightning.

89
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,950
I'm thinking about Prince Zhao.

90
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,380
If he simply thinks

91
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,340
we're a burden to Mr. Lin,

92
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,340
why not just give us money?

93
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,860
Why dangle the carrot of Sushui City,

94
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,460
as if we have to go there?

95
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,620
Am I oversimplifying

96
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,020
the relationship between him
and Mr. Lin?

97
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,740
Is he going

98
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,460
to hold us hostage?

99
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,620
(Gentle and Calm)

100
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,060
Mr. Lin.

101
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,540
Mr. Lin?

102
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,700
The study is dark,

103
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,940
and he's not in the bedroom.

104
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,340
Where else could he be?

105
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,700
Perhaps he has official business.

106
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,260
Doesn't he often go
to the Prefecture at night?

107
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,100
Let's come back tomorrow.

108
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
Let's go.

109
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,420
(Capital Prefecture)

110
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,500
Mr. Lin left for Chengzhou

111
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,900
on official business last night.

112
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,340
Why so suddenly?

113
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,340
I'm not quite clear

114
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,480
on the official matters.

115
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,280
Thank you.

116
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,380
(Capital Prefecture)

117
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,260
Who is it?

118
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,900
Who climbed into my bed?

119
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,460
Me.

120
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,460
Your dad.

121
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,540
Dad.

122
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,300
Oh, Dad.

123
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,500
Are you alright?

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Come on.

125
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,360
Here.

126
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,980
I just fell asleep,

127
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,260
and you kicked me out of bed.

128
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,660
You almost killed me.

129
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,820
How could I know it was you?

130
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,980
I thought someone was trying
to take advantage of me.

131
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,340
Why did you climb into my bed?

132
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,260
It was late last night,

133
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,300
so I didn't go to the diner

134
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,660
and decided to tough it out here.

135
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,740
Forget it.

136
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,020
My mom didn't let you in, right?

137
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,860
Go away.

138
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,660
Mind your own business.

139
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Sure.

140
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,500
Twenty.

141
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,740
Who's here so early?

142
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,580
I'll check.

143
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,700
You wait here.

144
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,180
Coming.

145
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,540
Who is it?

146
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,460
What's that called?

147
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,240
- Eunuch.
- Eunuch.

148
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,020
Aren't you serving Prince Zhao?

149
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,580
Why are you here?

150
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,220
Indeed, why are you here?

151
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,380
The Prince is busy

152
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,500
and set off last night.

153
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,860
He ordered me to wait for you two.

154
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,730
The Prince said

155
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,480
you should be cautious about moving.

156
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,100
The ladies can stay for now.

157
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,500
How about you two go

158
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,900
to Sushui City first?

159
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,680
I...

160
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,260
Eunuch,

161
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,580
you see.

162
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,740
This is sudden.

163
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,980
- We're not prepared yet.
- Yes.

164
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,780
Our family hasn't decided it.

165
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,620
Why not

166
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,700
wait for a while?

167
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,940
Yes.

168
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,340
So, you haven't decided.

169
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,700
It's not about being unprepared.

170
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
You two just don't want to go.

171
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,060
Forget it.

172
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
The Prince never likes to force anyone.

173
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,340
I'll go and report back.

174
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,420
No, it's not that.

175
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,180
Say something!

176
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,140
We can't let Prince Zhao

177
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,140
think we're ungrateful.

178
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,980
Why not...?

179
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,420
Eunuch.

180
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,660
Please wait.

181
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,460
(Start Near to Go Far)

182
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,700
Put some effort into it.

183
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,100
I'm putting in all the effort.

184
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,420
I'm trying, okay?

185
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,460
What are you two doing?

186
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,940
Well.

187
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,860
Let's go.

188
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,420
Dad, you...

189
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,260
Mom, Prince Zhao wants us
to go to Sushui City.

190
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,960
Dad thinks that if all of us go
and don't want to stay there,

191
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,700
it'll be troublesome.

192
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,460
So, we'll go first.

193
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,180
Alright, let's go.

194
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,340
We'll go first.

195
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,220
Always making trouble.

196
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,500
(Yunshui Manor)

197
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,700
Slow down.

198
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,600
Be careful.

199
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,460
- Here.
- Careful.

200
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,500
Wait, wait.

201
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,460
- You're so impulsive.
- Put them on.

202
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,100
We should at least discuss this

203
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,060
with Jicai and Mr. Lin.

204
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,900
What's there to discuss?

205
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,340
It's a great opportunity.

206
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,180
Besides, they're leaving soon.

207
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,620
There's no time to discuss.

208
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,180
Why leave in such a hurry?

209
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,620
No one is going with you.

210
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,710
What if

211
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,100
you cause trouble there?

212
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,580
What trouble could there be?

213
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,780
Even if there is trouble,

214
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,620
can't I handle it?

215
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,340
Sorry.

216
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,220
I must report asap

217
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,940
whether you'll go.

218
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
It's getting late.

219
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,620
I can't afford to delay.

220
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,260
It's getting late.

221
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,180
Let's go.

222
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
Shen Jianshe.

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,060
You want to go, right?

224
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,420
Then go by yourself.

225
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,420
You stay.

226
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,100
Don't, Mom...

227
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,340
Dad...

228
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,540
Mom,

229
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,000
you can't let Dad go alone.

230
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,140
What if something happens?

231
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,540
Besides,

232
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,580
I really want to go.

233
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,180
Look at how hospitable

234
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,340
they are.

235
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,860
Look at the carriage they prepared.

236
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,780
In the future,

237
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,460
this will be like a Bentley.

238
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,580
Think about it.

239
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,900
Prince Zhao invited us,

240
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,140
sent a Bentley to pick us up,

241
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,220
and covered the expenses.

242
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,500
If we don't go,

243
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,980
wouldn't that be disrespectful
to Bentley?

244
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,380
Let's go. He starts with a Bentley.

245
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,820
There must be something better.

246
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,680
Let's go.

247
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,560
Wait.

248
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,300
What about Yangyang?

249
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,500
We can't leave Jicai to look after her.

250
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Running the diner is tiring enough.

251
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,180
Indeed.

252
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,180
I took our parents and Yangyang

253
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,460
to Sushui City for a look.

254
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,340
Once it's settled,
I'll come back for you.

255
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,020
They all left?

256
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,140
Why didn't you stop them?

257
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,780
(Yunshui Manor)
They're your family.

258
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,140
How could we stop them?

259
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,180
Sorry, I was too hasty.

260
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,540
Where are you going?

261
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,560
Take care of the diner.

262
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,640
I'll bring them back soon.

263
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,300
Alright, go ahead.

264
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,180
I'll take care of it.

265
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,340
Your Highness,

266
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,380
the Shen family has set off.

267
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,420
By now, Lin Yan

268
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,020
should have arrived in Chengzhou.

269
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,300
(Chengzhou Yamen)
So,

270
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,380
it was actually 32 oxen

271
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,660
that died?

272
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,140
These were not ordinary oxen.

273
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,070
They were the plowing oxen revered here.

274
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,660
Oxen are highly respected now.

275
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,900
Slaughtering oxen is considered

276
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,620
one of the ten great evils.

277
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,860
Oxen are our reliance.

278
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,820
With the death of 32 oxen,

279
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,660
several families will be
in dire straits.

280
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,740
(Chengzhou Yamen)
This is huge.

281
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,500
I can't handle this.

282
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,500
What should we do about this?

283
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,470
Mr. Lin,

284
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,140
this is about the death of 32 oxen.

285
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,140
The culprit must be caught.

286
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,940
First, investigate
the water sources and feed,

287
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,100
and you'll know
if someone has poisoned them.

288
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,800
But with 32 oxen dying suddenly,

289
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,100
it's likely a livestock disease.

290
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,180
Take preventive measures

291
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,380
and consult experienced farmers.

292
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,460
Finally,

293
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,590
conduct a ritual for the oxen.

294
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,580
I see.

295
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,460
No wonder, despite your youth,

296
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,140
you've risen so swiftly in the Capital.

297
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,020
You're truly wise,

298
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,740
thinking so thoroughly.

299
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,820
What's so hard about it?

300
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,660
Are you

301
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
stupid?

302
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,220
For such a minor issue,

303
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,660
how dare you summon the Vice Prefect

304
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,940
all the way from Yong'an?

305
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,230
Perhaps someone

306
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,090
has tipped you off,

307
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,220
saying that in such cases,

308
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,270
you can seek help from the Capital?

309
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,310
Yes, yes.

310
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,050
How did you know?

311
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,940
A few days ago,

312
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,420
I didn't know what to do.

313
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,420
Someone wrote to me,

314
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,420
advising me to seek you out.

315
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,430
They said you're very kind

316
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,180
and can be approached for any matter.

317
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,140
Who was it?

318
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,620
Did they leave a name?

319
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,180
No.

320
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,260
What's going on?

321
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,710
Auntie.

322
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,710
Jicai.

323
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,780
Please wait for me.

324
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,820
Why are you here?

325
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,020
- Attendant Xu.
- Lady Shen.

326
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,940
Are you also going to Sushui City?

327
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,140
Please get in the carriage.

328
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,450
That doesn't matter.

329
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,100
Let me speak with my family first.

330
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,380
Lady Shen, please.

331
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,220
Jicai.

332
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,780
Get down.

333
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,100
Get on.

334
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,900
Mom, let me talk to her.

335
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,180
Jicai, get on.

336
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,620
In broad daylight,

337
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,560
what are you afraid of?

338
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,260
Get on, come on.

339
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,860
Get on.

340
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,240
You're really bold,

341
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,420
leaving with them like this.

342
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,900
Aren't you worried about your kidneys?

343
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,420
You're overthinking.

344
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,300
The ancients wouldn't know

345
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,500
about such a profitable scheme.

346
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,500
- You...
- Everyone.

347
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,580
If we delay the journey,

348
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,500
the Prince will blame me.

349
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,580
Come out now.

350
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,940
Why?

351
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,980
We'll just take a look.

352
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,300
What could happen?

353
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,140
Besides, we've come halfway.

354
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,580
It'd be embarrassing to go back now.

355
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,060
We're not getting out.

356
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,500
Come on.

357
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,820
I've told them,

358
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,760
but they won't listen.

359
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,460
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

360
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,740
- Be careful.
- I won't.

361
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,860
Gongcai, help me.

362
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,340
- No, it's dangerous.
- Let's go.

363
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,500
Attendant Xu, let's go.

364
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,540
- Hurry up.
- Dad.

365
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,740
Dad.

366
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,540
- Jicai.
- Jicai.

367
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,760
- Are you okay?
- I told you

368
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,980
- to be careful.
- Slow down.

369
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,620
- Are you okay?
- Auntie, are you okay?

370
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,470
- How nice.
- Auntie.

371
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,720
Let's go together.

372
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,700
- It'll be fine.
- Hurry up.

373
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,020
This...

374
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,820
(Sushui City)

375
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,140
This place is huge.

376
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,300
Do you think they cleared it out

377
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,980
just to welcome us?

378
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,380
It's possible.

379
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,140
There's no one around; it's so grand.

380
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,980
(Sushui City)

381
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,970
- What's wrong?
- Right.

382
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,460
Why is the gate closed?

383
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,830
I...

384
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,980
This...

385
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,180
Help!

386
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,020
Anyone there?

387
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,740
Do you know who I am?

388
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm the best brother

389
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,580
of Prince Zhao.

390
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,740
Alright, stop shouting.

391
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,460
Can't you see?

392
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,000
It's your so-called good brother

393
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,400
who wants your kidneys.

394
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,620
How could such a good thing be true?

395
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,460
A prince

396
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,300
offers to fund your diner?

397
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,660
Have you

398
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,100
lost your mind?

399
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,180
Dad.

400
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,140
And you, Shen Gongcai.

401
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,180
You're an adult now.

402
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,140
Have you thought about your kid?

403
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,420
Yangyang.

404
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
I'm wrong.

405
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,020
Sorry.

406
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,980
Since you've made a mistake,

407
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,820
what should you do now

408
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,620
according to our family rules?

409
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,140
Admit the mistake.

410
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,740
Reflect deeply.

411
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,940
So, who do you think

412
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,140
is most responsible this time?

413
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,780
- Well.
- This time...

414
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,740
About this...

415
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,460
Dad, this is not the time
for your usual routine.

416
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,500
Mom, did you see that?

417
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,380
Dad was trying to bribe me,
but I caught him.

418
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,320
- Shen Jianshe.
- Mom.

419
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,980
I've criticized him severely.

420
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,940
Anyway,

421
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,380
this time,

422
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,380
it really is your fault.

423
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,060
What do you mean?

424
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,000
Come on.

425
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,300
Am I still your father?

426
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Stop denying it.

427
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,340
It's partly my fault,

428
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,220
but Gongcai is also at fault.

429
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,060
Dad.

430
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,260
You were also very eager

431
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,700
- to go with them.
- Exactly.

432
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,860
Look.

433
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,660
Even Yangyang can't stand it.

434
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,180
Can't you two

435
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,340
do something useful for once?

436
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,580
Always messing around.

437
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,580
What will you do?

438
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,020
Turn over a new leaf.

439
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,260
Start anew.

440
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,340
Can you do that?

441
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,460
Yes.

442
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,740
Alright, sit down.

443
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,980
Think about it.

444
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,420
They gave us the best along the road,

445
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,780
without raising any suspicions.

446
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,540
It was only after we entered
Sushui City

447
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,660
that Prince Zhao turned on us

448
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,180
and imprisoned us here.

449
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,420
So, I might be right before.

450
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,980
The relationship between Prince Zhao
and Lin Yan is not simple.

451
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Prince Zhao

452
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,380
wants to use us as hostages.

453
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,020
Hostages?

454
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,940
No way.

455
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,140
I have an idea.

456
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,940
If someone wants to use us,

457
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,860
the simplest way is

458
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,540
to make ourselves useless.

459
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,540
Who'd want to use good-for-nothings?

460
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,540
So, why don't we just confess

461
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,860
that Jicai was not the lady

462
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,980
who was engaged to the ancestor?

463
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,860
At most, we're freeloaders,

464
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,300
and Mr. Lin is an unlucky landlord.

465
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,780
We're not close at all.

466
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,460
How can Prince Zhao use us then?

467
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,380
Forget it.

468
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,900
Would Prince Zhao believe that?

469
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,020
We've lived with the ancestor

470
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,780
for so long.

471
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,420
This reflection is working.

472
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,580
Your mind is working

473
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,860
better than your son's.

474
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,620
- I'll continue.
- Shut up.

475
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,300
Mr. Lin has been so kind to us.

476
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,640
You can't distance yourself

477
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,980
when trouble comes.

478
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,420
- No.
- You can't do this.

479
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,380
Exactly.

480
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,740
I'll keep reflecting.

481
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,620
Yes, Mr. Lin is family.

482
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,060
Grandpa and Grandma said

483
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,620
that family members should bear
everything together.

484
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,860
See? Yangyang is so sensible.

485
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,180
Before I came to find you,

486
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,220
I went to the Prefecture first.

487
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,980
They said that Mr. Lin had happened
to leave for work.

488
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,980
Isn't that too coincidental?

489
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,340
It's not normal.

490
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,380
Someone's coming.

491
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,620
Who are they?

492
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,620
Why does this scene

493
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,900
look familiar?

494
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,220
Mr. Lin

495
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,420
was just scaring us.

496
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,860
But these people

497
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,420
look like they're serious.

498
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,860
My goodness.

499
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,540
It's alright.

500
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,660
It's fine.

501
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,060
Judging by your clothes and appearance,

502
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,620
you must be the young prince.

503
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,300
The young prince?

504
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,620
Sir, you have us now.

505
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,300
We can be useful to you.

506
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,220
But if you harm us now,

507
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,900
the benefits will be too small.

508
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,580
You're clever.

509
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,660
I won't beat around the bush.

510
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,700
I have some questions,

511
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,300
but asking directly

512
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,140
is too boring.

513
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,540
How about

514
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,500
we play a game?

515
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,500
I'll spin this spoon.

516
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,820
Whoever the handle points to

517
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,460
will answer the question.

518
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,780
If you answer well,

519
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,500
you can choose a torture device.

520
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,780
If not,

521
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,780
you'll drink this poisoned soup.

522
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,580
How about that?

523
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,220
Isn't it fun?

524
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,820
- Not fun at all.
- Dad.

525
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,420
- Are you giving us a choice?
- Exactly.

526
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,180
You're making us choose how to die.

527
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,860
That's not fair at all.

528
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,540
I'll play with you.

529
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,100
- Jicai.
- No way.

530
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,340
- Absolutely not.
- Auntie.

531
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,220
You can't.

532
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,620
We have to follow the game rules.

533
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,340
Dad.

534
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,060
You're cheating.

535
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,420
Dad.

536
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,860
It's you.

537
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,340
No.

538
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,180
No way.

539
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,260
She's just a child; what does she know?

540
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,540
Shaojie.

541
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,740
I'll play with you.

542
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,720
- Dad.
- Tell me.

543
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,620
Gongcai.

544
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,660
Tell me everything you know.

545
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,780
What do you want to know?

546
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,020
Ask away.

547
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,100
Why do you always

548
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,340
beat around the bush?

549
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,460
How could I know what you want to know?

550
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,390
How could you not know

551
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,660
what I want to know?

552
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,700
I want to know

553
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,300
your secrets.

554
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,300
Yes.

555
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,140
I have secrets.

556
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,540
Let me think.

557
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,580
My wife later found a better man.

558
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,430
I didn't stop her.

559
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,360
I even encouraged her
to embrace a better life.

560
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,900
When she moved into that big villa,

561
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,260
- What?
- I even drove her there.

562
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
You brat.

563
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,020
How could you say that?

564
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,220
You've disgraced our family name.

565
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,180
Grandpa.

566
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,810
Grandpa.

567
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,300
Calm down.

568
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
How can I stay calm?

569
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,620
What were you thinking?

570
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,900
Your wife ran off with someone.

571
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,100
Instead of killing
that adulterous couple,

572
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,220
you said something like that?

573
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,440
Are you even a man?

574
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,020
Are you a man at all?

575
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,780
I completely agree with you.

576
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,300
Why are you so agitated?

577
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:58,740
Besides,

578
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,120
just because my wife cheated on me,

579
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,340
does that mean I'm not a man

580
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,500
if I don't shout for revenge?

581
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,380
The key is,

582
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,780
I really am a loser.

583
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,340
She found something better.

584
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,380
What's wrong with that?

585
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,540
Isn't that just human nature?

586
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,420
What nonsense.

587
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,180
Isn't that nonsense?

588
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,470
- I...
- We have work to do.

589
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,180
What do I have?

590
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,380
I...

591
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,580
Stop playing tricks.

592
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,900
Just confess.

593
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,820
- Don't.
- Grandpa.

594
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
Weren't we having a good chat just now?

595
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,540
Come out.

596
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,820
- Come out.
- Let her go.

597
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,860
What are you doing?

598
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,700
Come out.

599
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,020
Yangyang.

600
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,980
Yangyang!

601
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,920
- Confess.
- Yangyang.

602
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,060
Let her go.

603
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,900
If you don't talk,

604
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,380
she'll die.

605
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,820
Don't, don't.

606
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,220
Sir, I beg you.

607
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,060
Don't hurt her.

608
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,100
Kill me instead, sir.

609
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,440
- Dad.
- She's just a child.

610
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,330
Sir.

611
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,180
Yangyang.

612
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,340
Kill me.

613
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,500
Just kill me.

614
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,340
Is that okay?

615
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,100
Shen.

616
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,380
I know about Lin Yan.

617
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,700
Jicai.

618
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,620
He cares about me,

619
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,780
but official matters

620
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,580
can't be discussed with him.

621
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,500
(Not official matters.)

622
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,140
(So, I can tell him something personal.)

623
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,340
Tell me then.

624
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,500
Lin Yan

625
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,980
is actually Cui Che.

626
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,500
His clan committed grave crimes

627
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,740
and was exterminated.

628
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,140
Lin Yan changed his name
and household registration

629
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,300
to survive.

630
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,700
You harbored a wanted criminal.

631
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,260
Why tell me that?

632
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,940
You're so calm after hearing this.

633
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,180
It seems you know more about that.

634
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,380
I'll tell you something you don't know.

635
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,540
Lin Yan

636
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,100
broke off the engagement

637
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,300
to get close to the Princess.

638
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,660
He wanted the Princess

639
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,880
to help him hide his identity.

640
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,060
- Yangyang.
- Lin Yan abandoned us.

641
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,100
Why should we be loyal to him?

642
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,300
Sir,

643
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,860
we are on your side.

644
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

645
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,530
We are on your side.

646
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,500
We are on the same side.

647
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,100
Indeed, I feel the same way.

648
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,580
Did you notice

649
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,580
something wrong with Lin Yan?

650
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,500
Everything's wrong with him.

651
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,780
As the son of an executed prisoner,

652
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,260
he became the Vice Prefect.

653
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,820
How could that be right?

654
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,940
Sir,

655
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,340
let us go.

656
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,740
We'll help you investigate him.

657
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,430
We'll assist you.

658
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,580
We'll investigate together.

659
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,860
I thought the same thing.

660
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,500
I just couldn't find
the words to say it.

661
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,540
(Complete and Bright)

662
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,460
Lin Yan wanted to get close
to the Princess

663
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,960
and broke off the engagement.

664
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,820
The Shen family claims

665
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,500
they want to take revenge on him.

666
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,940
You asked me
to find out more about them,

667
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,060
so I did.

668
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,100
The Qingyang dialect
is hard to understand,

669
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
but I managed to get the gist of it.

670
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,300
Cui Che's fiancée is indeed a Shen,

671
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,820
but they moved away
from Qingyang long ago.

672
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,300
After the Cui family's downfall,

673
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,820
they cut off all contact.

674
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,900
They did abandon them.

675
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,340
With the betrothal being canceled,

676
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,140
they harbor resentment.

677
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,900
I've dealt with the Shen family.

678
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,060
In fact,

679
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,260
they do have feelings

680
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,820
for Anran.

681
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,500
It's not just about climbing up.

682
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,620
As for Anran and the Princess,

683
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,180
that's even less believable.

684
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,860
How about this?

685
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,260
Let's starve them for now,

686
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,620
and then

687
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,060
I will question them myself.

688
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,300
You care about Lin Yan,

689
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,660
so I can't torture them,

690
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,220
yet you're dissatisfied with my results.

691
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,460
What exactly do you want?

692
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,660
Lin Yan is not on our side.

693
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,090
After over a decade,

694
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,980
are you going soft for him?

695
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,860
Sometimes, I don't even understand

696
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,300
which one of us is your son,

697
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,500
me or Lin Yan.

698
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,740
How dare you!

699
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Let me tell you.

700
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,380
If you had Anran's abilities,

701
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,940
I'd look up to you, too.

702
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,540
Let me analyze this for you.

703
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,500
Even without the betrothal,

704
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,080
Anran still kept them

705
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,240
in his house.

706
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,120
Why?

707
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:43,980
This means

708
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,820
they're Anran's weakness.

709
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,140
Can't you see that?

710
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,540
Lin Yan sensed something amiss

711
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,800
and set off back to the Capital.

712
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,420
(Capital Prefecture)

713
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,900
- Mr. Lin.
- What's wrong?

714
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,500
While you were away,

715
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,740
Lady Shen has come for you.

716
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,840
I heard about it

717
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,900
and went to Yunshui Manor.

718
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,940
Then I heard from the guards

719
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,500
that the Shen family had left

720
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,860
following the same carriage.

721
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,100
I was told

722
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,900
they went to Sushui City.

723
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,700
Was the Governor of Chengzhou

724
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,740
truly misled?

725
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,100
- They wanted...
- Mr. Lin.

726
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,060
Young Master.

727
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,100
Slow down, Mr. Lin.

728
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,500
Mr. Lin.

729
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,460
Slow down, Mr. Lin.

730
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,180
(Capital Prefecture)
Where is he going?

731
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,780
His Majesty heard Mr. Lin was back

732
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
and sent me to bring him to the Palace.

733
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,940
This...

734
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,260
Thank you for the trouble..

735
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,060
Before Mr. Lin went to Chengzhou,

736
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,360
he suffered from heart disease.

737
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,240
When he was in Chengzhou,

738
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,360
he worked without rest,

739
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,340
never closing his eyes.

740
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,460
He rushed back to the Capital nonstop,

741
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,020
so he couldn't see the Emperor now.

742
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,140
Heart disease?

743
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,620
Didn't he just ride off on horseback?

744
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,460
He...

745
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,500
Well.

746
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,980
He's in a hurry to see a physician.

747
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,340
That's faster.

748
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,940
This mutton soup is so good.

749
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,340
Yes, delicious.

750
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,940
This pastry is nice too. Try some.

751
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,640
- Sure.
- Here.

752
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,010
Eat the big marrow bones.

753
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,300
Hurry up.

754
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
I'm hungry, too.

755
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,500
Eat up, there's plenty.

756
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,660
Smells good, right?

757
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,780
Is it good?

758
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,980
I can't stand it.

759
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,380
What are you doing?

760
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,820
It's been two days.

761
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,700
We've had no food

762
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,500
or water.

763
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,740
Trying to starve us to death?

764
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,800
Do you have any humanity?

765
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,520
Can't you see there's a child here?

766
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,820
Even when hungry,
you can still shout so loudly.

767
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,760
If you bark like a dog,

768
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,180
I'll reward you.

769
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,220
How about that?

770
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,660
I'll fight you.

771
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,660
Gongcai.

772
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,540
Dad.

773
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,420
Find the keys.

774
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,260
Hurry, hurry.

775
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,500
What keys?

776
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,820
Who'd carry keys on them?

777
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,060
You lot, hurry up.

778
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,900
Search lower down.

779
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,740
Hurry.

780
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
Let go, let go.

781
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,220
Let go.

782
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,620
I'll kill you.

783
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,580
We were ordered not to harm them.

784
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,660
Alright, let's leave.

785
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,500
Let's go.

786
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,860
Behave yourselves.

787
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,000
You'll be starved to death.

788
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,380
Enough.

789
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,040
- Let's go.
- Bad luck.

790
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,700
Let's go.

791
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,680
Go.

792
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,980
Everything in dramas is fake.

793
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,980
Which jailer would hide
the keys on their waist,

794
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,160
waiting for them to be stolen?

795
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,340
Why is there moss here?

796
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,890
Moss?

797
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
These ancient prisons

798
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,420
are really poorly made.

799
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,180
No waterproofing?

800
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,860
An official prison

801
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,620
shouldn't be so careless.

802
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,340
It's done so casually.

803
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,980
Was it converted from a residence, Dad?

804
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,940
(Sushui City)

805
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,380
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

806
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,700
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

807
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,060
Have you forgotten
the rules Prince Zhao set

808
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,020
when he taught us swordsmanship?

809
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,580
Everyone is equal.

810
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,380
Only the capable deserve respect.

811
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,580
I defeated you all.

812
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,340
You shouldn't even stand before me.

813
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,740
Are you going to fight me now?

814
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,620
You misled Chengzhou

815
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,220
into summoning me.

816
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,020
Where is the Shen family now?

817
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,260
Anran,

818
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,740
listen to me.

819
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,300
Your engagement has been canceled.

820
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,900
If they continue to live with you,

821
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,180
what should you do

822
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,500
if someone finds out?

823
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,540
Leave

824
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,220
this matter to me.

825
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,180
I will deal with it properly.

826
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,820
Where is the Shen family now?

827
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,980
Why are you so stubborn?

828
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,580
Everything I've done

829
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,820
is for your good.

830
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,100
Your Highness,

831
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,060
please let them go.

832
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,060
Stop.

833
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,180
Anran,

834
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,820
since you've made up your mind,

835
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,420
I won't stop you.

836
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,060
You,

837
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,500
take him there.

838
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,380
Yes.

839
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,860
You're indulging Lin Yan again.

840
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,100
Didn't you say the Shens
would be useful?

841
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,300
And now Lin Yan is taking them away.

842
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,420
Why are you

843
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,220
still so impatient?

844
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,980
Do you

845
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,860
have other plans?

846
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,220
Don't worry.

847
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,540
That man

848
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,420
will buy us some time.

849
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,940
Go now

850
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,860
and move the Shen family

851
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,860
to the annex.

852
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,340
Yes.

853
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,660
You've never defied the Prince before.

854
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,460
This is the first time.

855
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,900
When you first arrived at Fuyi Manor,

856
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,280
the Prince's eldest son
had just passed away.

857
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,560
Your demeanor and speech
were strikingly similar to his,

858
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,100
which comforted the Prince's grief
over losing a child.

859
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,660
What are you trying to say?

860
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,660
I'm just thinking

861
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,860
maybe we've misjudged you.

862
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,980
Perhaps, despite your young age,

863
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,270
you have a strong will.

864
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,550
You planned to imitate the young master

865
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,480
to get close to the Prince.

866
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,300
Don't think

867
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,790
that you can delay me

868
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,180
by bringing up the past.

869
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,860
Lead the way.

870
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,100
Why are you in such a panic?

871
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,260
Young Master.

872
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,300
The Shen family has escaped.

873
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,140
What?

874
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,100
Listen.

875
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,340
Look at this window.

876
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,300
It's very poorly made.

877
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,700
And these bars

878
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,080
are mortise-and-tenon joints.

879
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,140
If I can find

880
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,620
the key joint,

881
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,060
I can open it.

882
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,740
Really?

883
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,180
Dad, when did you learn this?

884
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,660
- Well.
- In the countryside,

885
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,340
everyone knew
how to build a house before.

886
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,420
Your dad hasn't lost

887
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,580
this good old tradition.

888
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,380
Alright, go up there.

889
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
Go and check.

890
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,020
Hurry up.

891
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,220
Be careful. Hurry.
