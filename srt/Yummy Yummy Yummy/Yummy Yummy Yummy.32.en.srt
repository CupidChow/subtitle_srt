00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 32=

3
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,000
Make way.

4
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,110
How could this be?

5
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,520
Oh, no.

6
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,470
Fire!

7
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,550
How could this happen?

8
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,240
Fire! Fire!

9
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,910
Fire!

10
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,210
Fire!

11
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,680
The houses are too close together,

12
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,760
and they are made of wood.

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,810
We must put out the fire,

14
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,670
or they'll all be consumed
one after another.

15
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,930
- Liu Chang, Cheng Hu.
- Yes.

16
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,170
Evacuate the people here.

17
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,710
- Yes.
- Yes.

18
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,510
The rest of you,

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,820
borrow water and fire extinguishers
to put out the fire

20
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,680
and save the people.

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Yes.

22
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,270
- Let's go.
- Go with Liu Chang.

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,950
Take care of yourself and your family.

24
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,080
Stay safe.

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,870
How to deal with this?

26
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,430
We are all neighbors.

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,200
We can't just stand by and do nothing.

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,870
How could we just stand by?

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,760
Hurry up.

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,530
- Put out the fire.
- Hurry.

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,480
Watch over Yangyang.

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,810
- We will go, too.
- Be careful.

33
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,750
Ming is still in the diner.

34
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,360
Deyuan, take care of Yangyang.

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,710
Fire!

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,590
Put out the fire!

37
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,800
Help!

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,870
Help!

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,680
Anyone there?

40
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,480
Help!

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,520
Don't worry; we are here to save you.

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,830
Help!

43
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,870
Be careful.

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,150
Get out of the way.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
Lady Yun.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,200
Come with me.

47
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,550
- Careful.
- Hurry up.

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
Be careful.

49
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,550
Go, go.

50
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,710
You must always remember

51
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,800
the stories of our ancestors.

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Later,

53
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,430
a fire broke out

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,640
at Shen's Diner.

55
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,640
Lady Shen and her family

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,680
all perished in the fire.

57
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,590
Mr. Shen.

58
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,710
Mr. Shen.

59
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,270
I remember now.

60
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,630
This is the big fire.

61
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,040
This is the big fire!

62
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,440
Let's go.

63
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,060
It should be safe now.

64
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,480
I'll go inside and check again.

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,510
Be careful.

66
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,550
Yangyang.

67
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,350
Here.

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,440
Jicai!

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,620
Jicai!

70
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
Jicai!

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,680
Listen.

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,750
I just saw Li Ang.

73
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,560
He is likely the one who set this fire.

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
He was holding Ming.

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,510
I chased him all the way here.

76
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,120
He must've hidden in our diner.

77
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,430
I'll keep following him.

78
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,720
You go and inform the Prefecture.

79
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
Jicai, listen to me.

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,780
In the stories Grandpa told,

81
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,530
this fire is our end.

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,600
It's too late.

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Yangyang is in danger.

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,420
- Yangyang!
- Yangyang!

85
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,590
Yangyang!

86
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,470
Yangyang!

87
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,470
Deyuan.

88
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,470
Yangyang.

89
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,710
Deyuan.

90
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,550
You set the fire.

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,840
Are you happy to burn down Juxian Alley?

92
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Jicai.

93
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,710
Yangyang.

94
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,880
- Jicai.
- Lady Shen.

95
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,800
- Dad, Mom.
- Jicai.

96
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
Get up.

97
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,750
Jicai.

98
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,590
Jicai.

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,950
- Yangyang.
- Jicai.

100
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,800
Yangyang.

101
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,720
Yangyang.

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,560
Are you alright?

103
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,790
Listen to me.

104
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,720
Let go of my daughter.

105
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,240
- Have you gone mad?
- Jicai.

106
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,080
Yes.

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,840
I've gone mad.

108
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,430
My father and brothers...

109
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,120
All my siblings were implicated.

110
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,430
How could I not have gone mad?

111
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,950
Who can you blame?

112
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,120
You started the rebellion!

113
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,310
I blame you all.

114
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,160
I want you all to die with me.

115
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,750
How about this?

116
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,240
You can kill me.

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,880
Let go of my daughter, okay?

118
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,920
No, no.

119
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,040
Why kill my father

120
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,390
and sister? Come for me.

121
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,480
You can just kill me.

122
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,280
What a family.

123
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,390
What's the point of killing you all?

124
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,630
I want Shen Shaoguang to die.

125
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,600
I want Lin Yan
to watch Shen Shaoguang die.

126
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,500
Go and get him now.

127
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,510
Don't hurt her.

128
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,910
Father, Mother, go!

129
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,070
Li Ang,

130
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,430
don't you only want my life?

131
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,990
Why bother with the others?

132
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,630
It's more trouble, isn't it?

133
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,800
Jicai, I beg of you.

134
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,740
Don't say anything.

135
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,240
Don't provoke him, alright?

136
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,320
Go.

137
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,920
Li Ang, kill me.

138
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,760
I beg of you.

139
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,630
Kill me.

140
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,480
Don't move forward.

141
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,120
Go and get Lin Yan.

142
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,940
Don't hurt her.

143
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,990
- Calm down.
- I beg you.

144
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,310
Or I will kill her.

145
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,190
- Hurry.
- Go.

146
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,310
Don't be impulsive.

147
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
Don't hurt her.

148
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
Go and get Lin Yan.

149
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Don't hurt her.

150
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,160
Or I'll fight you to the death.

151
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,000
Go!

152
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,080
Jicai!

153
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,300
Be careful.

154
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,550
- Go!
- Go.

155
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,960
- Jicai.
- Be careful.

156
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,990
Lady Shen.

157
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,240
- Jicai.
- Jicai.

158
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,950
- Be careful.
- Jicai.

159
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,330
- Go!
- Go!

160
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
Jicai!

161
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,840
What to do?

162
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,920
Jicai!

163
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,790
Li Ang,

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,560
listen to me.

165
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,960
Listen to me.

166
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,390
I truly understand how you feel.

167
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,240
You hate Lin Yan

168
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,280
because he exposed Prince Zhao,

169
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,800
and Prince Zhao

170
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,160
had always favored him.

171
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,120
What you long for the most

172
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,070
is your father's approval,

173
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,270
isn't it?

174
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
But your brother Li Sheng

175
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,800
outshone you.

176
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Lin Yan

177
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,390
looked like your brother

178
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,160
and caught your father's attention.

179
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,280
It's not fair.

180
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,310
Lin Yan is nothing.

181
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,510
Your father loves you the most.

182
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,390
Why compare yourself to an adopted son?

183
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,430
You are so smart; you don't need me

184
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,800
to tell you that.

185
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,960
You don't need to be jealous of Lin Yan.

186
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,790
You are the one

187
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,120
your father loves the most.

188
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,480
Stop trying to confuse me.

189
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,390
If not for you and Lin Yan,

190
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,030
I wouldn't be in this situation.

191
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,320
You conspired with Prince Zhao,

192
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,060
harming the people.

193
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,600
Your father set up Lin Yan's family,

194
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,760
causing their wrongful deaths.

195
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,720
You all deserve

196
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,660
to die.

197
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,710
I'm too late.

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,040
Lin Yan.

199
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,240
I want you to die.

200
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,280
Be careful.

201
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,350
What?

202
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,990
You remember growing up with me,

203
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,630
so you can't do this?

204
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,320
Lin Yan,

205
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,080
you are too emotional.

206
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,480
Let's die together.

207
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
Lin Yan!

208
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
It hurts so much.

209
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,750
When you saved me in Sushui City,

210
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,990
you were more seriously injured,

211
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,150
but you never let go of my hand.

212
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Jicai.

213
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,400
Jicai.

214
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,560
Your injury.

215
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,400
It's okay.

216
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,160
Come on.

217
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,600
I'll take you out of here.

218
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,040
Let's go.

219
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,270
Jicai, listen to me.

220
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,360
In the stories Grandpa told,

221
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,150
this fire is our end.

222
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,320
(This is the end.)

223
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,360
(We've been walking
in the predetermined history.)

224
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,120
(A thousand years later,
our family still exists.)

225
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,910
(So, history will not change.)

226
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,030
(We will not die.)

227
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,560
(We will disappear.)

228
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,110
We will

229
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,910
go back to the modern era.

230
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,920
Hurry up.

231
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,200
Hurry.

232
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
This way, this way.

233
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480

Jicai.

240
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,400
Here.

241
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,480
It really is today.

242
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,990
What?

243
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
What's wrong?

244
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,150
We have to say goodbye.

245
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,750
I truly

246
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,120

Take a rest.

How can there be nothing left?

271
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,830
Young Master,

272
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,810
you started searching
once the fire was out.

273
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,670
What are you looking for? Tell me.

274
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,670
I'll help you, okay?

275
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,510
No matter what,

276
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,280
there should at least be some remains.

277
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,800
Remains?

278
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,510
Mr. Cui, greetings.

279
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,960
Thank you for saving us last night.

280
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,800
Last night,

281
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,440
it was Lady Shen who saved you.

282
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,750
Don't you remember?

283
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,840
Lady Shen?

284
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,870
It was you and the Prefecture officials

285
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,150
who saved us.

286
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,710
What about the family

287
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,500
that ran the diner here?

288
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,820
This house has been abandoned for years.

289
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,200
We've never seen

290
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,360
any diner.

291
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,870
You're wrong.

292
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,720
Young Master,

293
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,240
I've told you many times.

294
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,670
We don't know any Shen family.

295
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,990
You must be confused

296
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,310
from putting out the fire.

297
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,830
It's impossible.

298
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,710
Impossible.

299
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,960
It's impossible.

300
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,240
Impossible.

301
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,670
The Shen family of five.

and...

306
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,990
and...

307
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,510
and...

308
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,960
And who else?

309
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,990
I remembered this morning
when I talked to Liu Chang.

310
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,320
(The Shen family of five,
Shen Shaoguang, Shen Jian She)

Shen...

313
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,790
Young Master,

314
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,000
the Shen family never existed.

315
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,520
Forget about them.

316
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,390
Don't make yourself feel bad.

317
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,280
They did exist.

318
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,920
Liu Chang,

319
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,000
if even you don't believe me...

320
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,840
I believe you.

321
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,800
I believe you.

322
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,080
She was once

323
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,000
my wife.

324
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,000
They were once

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,360
my family.

326
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,740
(The Shen family of five,
Shen Shaoguang, Shen Jian She)

327
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,840
But every day,

328
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,630
I forget a little more.

329
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,680
If this continues,

330
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,190
I will forget her one day.

331
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,150
Then, in this world,

332
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,760
who will remember them?

333
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,360
And what can I remember?

334
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,360
Young Master,

335
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,470
what's this?

336
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,680
This is the diner

337
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,470
she ran with her family.

338
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,320
Before I forget,

339
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,520
I must draw what it looks like.

340
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,560
It was the place

341
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,800
where we spent every day together.

342
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,630
If I look at it every day,

343
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,520
I won't forget.

344
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,670
If she ever comes back

345
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,870
and sees the diner

346
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
is still there,

347
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,280

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,070
Are you okay, Auntie?

384
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,470
Jicai, you've finally woken up.

385
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,910
You scared us to death.

386
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,520
What happened?

387
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,390
Jicai.

388
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,560
- Are you okay?
- Auntie.

389
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,900
You've scared us.

390
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,230
Do you feel unwell anywhere?

391
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,610
Talk to us.

392
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,530
- What's going on?
- Auntie, are you okay?

393
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,280
Is this Yunshui Manor?

394
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,400
What?

395
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,120
This is the modern era.

396
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,520
We really came back.

397
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,760
Yunshui Manor?

398
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,360
What do you mean?

399
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,950
We haven't gone home yet.

400
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,710
Did you hit your head and go silly?

401
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,610
Do you remember?

402
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,960
You said you wanted to find someone
to play our ancestor.

403
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,150
You've been gone for so long.

404
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,170
We came to look for you,

405
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,670
and we found you fainted here.

406
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,040
Don't scare us like this.

407
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,160
Auntie,

408
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,360
did you faint from heatstroke?

409
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,230
Grandma has called the hospital.

410
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,670
The ambulance will be here soon.

411
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,520
Yes, the ambulance will be here soon.

412
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,040
Auntie.

413
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,150
Why is she crying?

414
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,430
What's the matter?

415
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,190
- Don't cry.
- What's wrong?

416
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,600
- She's gone silly.
- Are you okay?

417
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,320
She's gone silly.

418
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,520
Don't talk nonsense.

419
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,620
- Stop it.
- Jicai.

420
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,110
It's okay, it's okay.

421
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,980
What should we do?

422
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,950
Your mom is here.

423
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,280
Jicai.

424
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,430

(Shen's Diner)

438
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,270
Excuse me.

439
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,440
Anyone here?

00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,880
Anyone?

00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,630
Courier.

442
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,920
Just put it there.

443
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,750
- Thanks.
- So popular.

444
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,080
Come by and have a meal.

445
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,630
I won't be able to get a table.

446
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,870
Of course, you can.

447
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,630
- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

448
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,720
I'll have the Perfect Spring Water Lamb

449
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,390
on the night of the full moon.

450
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,280
Sure.

451
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,360
And

452
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,950

453
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,790
Okay.

454
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,430
It seems you also came

455
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,230
after watching our short videos, right?

456
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,070
You bet.

457
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,230
Your diner's account

458
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,300

459
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,950
Thank you.

460
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,590
Time-traveling to our ancestors' dynasty

461
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,870
to enjoy the food.

462
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,840
It's so interesting.

463
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,230
The food in there

464
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,390
makes my mouth drool.

465
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,390
Would you like to order anything else?

466
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,000
Just this for now.

467
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Okay, it will be quick.

468
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,280
I promise it will be delicious.

469
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,520
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

470
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,360
Sure.

471
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,640
Inside, please.

472
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,040
Which table am I at?

473
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,880
Let me see.

474
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,670
- The 2nd table
- Okay.

475
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,000
Just go to the 2nd table inside.

476
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,570
Mom.

477
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,390
- The order for Table 2
- Okay.

478
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,250
Hurry up with this.

479
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,120
Okay, okay.

480
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,840
Lately, your cooking skills

481
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,080
have really improved.

482
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,860
Did you practice behind my back?

483
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,280
Listen.

484
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,800
Ever since Jicai's video

485
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,670
made our diner

486
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,870
popular,

487
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,560
I've somehow felt more

488
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,630
and more inspired while working.

489
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,600
I seem to have

490
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,670
more energy.

491
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,140
That's great.

492
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,050
The Agate Meat is ready, here.

493
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,910
Dad, you've got to keep trying.

494
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,630
You're now the No. 1 trending chef

495
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,670
in Yong'an.

496
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,950
So many eyes are on you.

497
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,840
Got it. Stay humble and focused.

498
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,320
Here comes the Agate Meat
that took down the villain.

499
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Keep it up,

500
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,280
Trending Chef.

501
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,150
Go for it.

502
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,090
Go for it.

503
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,030
Miss,

504
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,170
the bill for Table 3, please.

505
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,080
Sure.

506
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,920
Over here.

507
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,440
Yangyang, Table 3.

508
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,560
128.

509
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,820
What a genius.

510
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,800
You did the math just by looking at it?

511
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,040
So adorable.

512
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,270
So cute.

513
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,600
Thank you.

514
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,790
- Goodbye.
- Come again.

515
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,870
Auntie,

516
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,230
thanks to your short videos

517
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,460
and the new dishes you created,

518
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,430
our diner has become
an internet sensation.

519
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,230
My classmates all want to come.

520
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,000
I didn't invent the new dishes.

521
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,600
I just brought over the dishes

522
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,040
we made in ancient times.

523
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,600
Auntie,

524
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,950
are you still thinking about that dream

525
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,470
where you met our ancestor?

526
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,230
But didn't Grandpa and Grandma

527
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,800
ask you to forget about it?

528
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,360
(If it really was a dream,)

529
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,600
(why did Dad suddenly)

530
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,070
(start cooking such delicious food?)

531
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,710
(Why did Gongcai suddenly become
so diligent?)

532
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,320
(And Yangyang,)

533
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,240
(who just started elementary school,)

534
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,520
(can do math so well?)

535
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,750
(Lin Yan,)

536
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,240
(with a courtesy name Anran,)

537
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,470
(is from Qingyang.)

538
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,320
(He later became
the Vice Prefect in Yong'an.)

539
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,600
(After we left,)

540
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,360
(the dream continued.)

541
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,710
(I was no longer there,)

542
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
(yet I seemed to have watched)

543
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,870
(Lin Yan's entire life as a bystander.)

544
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,470
(He ended up)

545
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,040
(all alone...)

546
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,960
(Yong'an Diner)

547
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:12,840
Come in.

548
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,160
Jicai,

549
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
these cherries your dad bought online

550
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,270
are really fresh. Try some.

551
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,980
(Yong'an Diner)

552
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,950
We've told you

553
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,760
that what you write is your privacy,

554
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,040
and we won't snoop.

555
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,120
But you've been

556
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,000
absent-minded

557
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,840
and upset lately.

558
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,190
We're worried about you.

559
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,040
I'm fine.

560
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,950
I just...

561
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,560
You're still thinking about that dream.

562
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,400
Right?

563
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,320
Silly girl.

564
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,120
I told you.

565
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,710
Dreams don't come true.

566
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,630
The ancestor

567
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,000
is from a thousand years ago.

568
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,320
Even if you met them,

569
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,710
once you wake up from the dream,

570
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,560
you should live

571
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,040
