00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 30=

3
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,700
(Xuanzheng Hall)

4
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,910
Who are you?

5
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
I am Grand Princess Fuhui of Protection,

6
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,910
sent by His Majesty,

7
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,120
bearing the Imperial Seal,

8
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,080
(Xuanzheng Hall)
to denounce Prince Zhao's treason.

9
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,900
Prince Zhao has committed high treason.

10
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,920
All of the Li clan

11
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,710
have the right to punish him.

12
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,030
If you continue to obstruct,

13
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,920
you will share his guilt.

14
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,800
You will be executed,

15
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,120
and all your clans will be exterminated.

16
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,400
If you lay down your weapons now,

17
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,990
His Majesty will deal
with you leniently.

18
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,870
Lin Yan,

19
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,920
you're not dead.

20
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,480
The Li clan's target for punishment

21
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,270
is probably someone else.

22
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
The people will only know

23
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,640
that the Grand Princess
and the Crown Prince

24
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,120
conspired to commit treason.

25
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,310
Guards,

26
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,100
kill Princess Fuhui

27
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,290
and seize the seal.

28
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,270
Yes.

29
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,550
Lin Yan,

30
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,670
I raised you

31
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,990
for 17 years.

32
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,590
17 years.

33
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,310
Yet you're so ungrateful

34
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,080
and go against me.

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,710
You have trapped yourself

36
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,080
in this deadly situation.

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,960
Well,

38
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
you somewhat resemble

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,960
my eldest son,

40
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,830
so I'll grant you

41
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,710
a whole body in death.

42
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,960
You are not Lin Yan.

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Where is Lin Yan?

44
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,020
So,

45
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,940
your father was

46
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,580
the celebrated Prefect back then?

47
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,740
Yes.

48
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,170
Prince Zhao exterminated

49
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,700
your entire clan.

50
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,860
Prince Zhao is plotting treason,

51
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,770
and you'll stand against him?

52
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,700
Yes.

53
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,460
Why do you trust me so much?

54
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,700
Such a shocking secret.

55
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,180
If I reported it to Prince Zhao

56
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,840
and he succeeded,

57
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,580
I could rise to power easily.

58
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,180
Would you?

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,260
Li Ji betrayed his friend

60
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,620
and was despised by the world.

61
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,660
I would never do such a thing.

62
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,460
In this life,

63
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,700
to have a true friend,

64
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,220
to kill a traitor,

65
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,540
to live and sing,

66
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,980
that is enough.

67
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,700
He's on the road

68
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
to send you to the netherworld to atone.

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,060
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

70
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,180
Mr. Lu,

71
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,380
Prince Zhao has succeeded.

72
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,660
Do you think

73
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,300
he will consider you a threat?

74
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,620
Noble Consort Dou is related to you,

75
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,180
but she won't protect you.

76
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,340
You should know

77
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,260
that today,
Prince Zhao is trying to kill

78
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,580
his own siblings.

79
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,020
You're familiar
with the Yong'an Code, right?

80
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,220
You only know
that treason is a capital offense,

81
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,260
but Article 13 of the Yong'an Code

82
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,900
clearly states

83
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,260
that those who report treason

84
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,420
may have their sentences reduced,

85
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,820
depending on the info they provide.

86
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,620
You mean,

87
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,220
I have a chance to survive?

88
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,020
I only want
to bring Prince Zhao to justice.

89
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,260
Prince Zhao will besiege the Palace.

90
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,260
To prevent news from leaking,

91
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,340
after he succeeds,

92
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,640
he will claim that the Crown Prince
committed treason,

93
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,230
and he has to kill him.

94
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,620
The Noble Consort
will support this claim.

95
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,700
But to control the Noble Consort,

96
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Prince Zhao
has kept their correspondence

97
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,460
hidden in the study of Fuyi Manor.

98
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,060
Thank you.

99
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,980
By the way,

100
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,580
the Yong'an Code

101
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,140
only has 12 articles.

102
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,500
12 articles?

103
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,940
Lin Yan,

104
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,660
how dare you trick me?

105
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,300
You will not die a good death.

106
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,740
(Complete and Bright)

107
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,500
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

108
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,300
Mr. Lin and I

109
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,020
anticipated today's events.

110
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,220
We had the Sixteen Guards ready.

111
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,820
I risked my life

112
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,180
to make you let your guard down

113
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,340
and send all your men out.

114
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,180
Otherwise,

115
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,580
if you still had

116
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,340
one or two men left,

117
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,180
they'd harm the commoners.

118
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,340
Mr. Lin has gone to Suishui City.

119
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,580
He must've obtained

120
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,940
the evidence of your communication
with Noble Consort Dou.

121
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,700
You cannot escape

122
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,860
the charge of treason.

123
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,020
The military tally is in my hands.

124
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,140
All generals, listen.

125
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,820
Today, Prince Zhao
must be brought to justice.

126
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,900
(Xuanzheng Gate)

127
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,780
Save the Prince!

128
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,460
Kill!

129
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,940
Let's go.

130
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,060
Go.

131
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,540
Oh, no.

132
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,020
Hurry, hurry.

133
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,860
Finally, I've rescued all of you.

134
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,660
Or my young master would be anxious.

135
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,140
You'll be out of the Palace soon.

136
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,260
I have to go back.

137
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,380
I can only take you this far.

138
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

139
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,640
Take care of yourselves.

140
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,260
- Go.
- Hurry, go.

141
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,100
Yangyang.

142
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,900
Prince Zhao, Li Ang.

143
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,860
Run! Hurry!

144
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,980
Yangyang, Yangyang.

145
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,140
Dad, Mom.

146
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,540
Jicai, hurry up.

147
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,460
Dad, Mom, we can't let them go.

148
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,860
Hurry, hurry.

149
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,750
Hurry.

150
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,300
Hurry, Jicai.

151
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,460
Let's go, Li Ang.

152
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,780
How dare you stop me?

153
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,540
Don't come any closer.

154
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,020
Dad, take care of Yangyang.

155
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,500
Run!

156
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,340
Gongcai!

157
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,980
- Shaojie!
- Dad!

158
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,200
- I'll fight you!
- Mom.

159
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,100
Li Ang, let's go.

160
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Lin Yan disfigured me.

161
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,100
You shall pay

162
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,020
for his crime.

163
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,780
- Lin Yan.
- Jicai.

164
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,020
Let Li Ang go,

165
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,420
or I'll kill her.

166
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,290
No.

167
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,140
Let her go.

168
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,980
Let him go.

169
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,700
Release him.

170
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,180
Mr. Lin.

171
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,940
Let her go.

172
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,820
Don't move.

173
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,940
I'll take her place.

174
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,140
Cui Che,

175
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,940
I was soft-hearted back then

176
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,980
and spared your life.

177
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,020
Today,

178
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,060
I'll give you my life.

179
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,580
Let him go.

180
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,820
Father.

181
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,790
Don't move.

182
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,340
Let him go.

183
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,740
Let him go!

184
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,100
- No.
- Leave.

185
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
Father.

186
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,060
Go!

187
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,980
Leave now.

188
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,140
Let go of Jicai.

189
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,300
Release her.

190
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,180
- Auntie.
- I'll take her place.

191
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,260
Don't move.

192
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,980
Today,

193
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,020

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

Your Majesty,

282
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,020
the Cui case is truly lamentable,

283
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,300
but it is my duty

284
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,570
to impeach the Vice Prefect
of the Prefecture,

285
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,420
Lin Yan.

286
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,300
Lin Yan is actually Cui Che.

287
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,740
When he achieved merit

288
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,020
and governed the Capital,

289
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,900
he was still a criminal.

290
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,220
He pretended

291
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,100
to be someone else

292
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,820
and deceived you, Your Majesty.

293
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,740
It cannot be overlooked.

294
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,740
How absurd.

295
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,460
Your Majesty,

296
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,100
Mr. Lin changed his identity

297
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,260
out of necessity

298
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,540
to clear his father's name.

299
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,460
This is an act of filial piety.

300
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,860
If we trace it back,

301
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,550
isn't the Censorate also responsible

302
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,960
for the Cui family's injustice?

303
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,460
Prince Zhao's treason

304
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,590
had signs early on.

305
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,700
The Censorate used to be so evasive.

306
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,100
Why so persistent

307
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,180
with Mr. Lin now?

308
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,000
In suppressing Prince Zhao's rebellion,

309
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,820
Mr. Lin deserves the greatest credit.

310
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,820
To pursue past grievances now

311
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,420
would discourage
the loyal and righteous.

312
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,660
Your Majesty,

313
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,660
a ruler must be clear
in rewards and punishments

314
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,100
to establish the law

315
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,940
and the foundation.

316
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,380
We should reward good deeds

317
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,900
and punish bad ones.

318
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,060
Otherwise,

319
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,480
the law will not be established,

320
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,940
and the foundation will be shaken.

321
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,380
If everyone follows Mr. Lin's example,

322
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,740
changing their names

323
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,780
and entering the court as a criminal,

324
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,220
how shall we govern?

325
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,780
Your Majesty, please punish him
to uphold the law.

326
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,100
Your Majesty, please punish him.

327
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,560
Your Majesty, please punish him

328
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,660
to uphold the law.

329
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,920
Your Majesty, please punish him

330
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,080
to uphold the law.

331
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,700
To uphold the law.

332
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,900
Don't sneak a bite.

333
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,420
- Here come the dishes.
- Get the spoons ready.

334
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,980
There are two dishes left.

335
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,940
Be good, Ming.

336
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,740
It's quite a feast today.

337
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,020
Come on.

338
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,380
Here, here.

339
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,100
- What's wrong?
- My head hurts.

340
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,940
Dad,

341
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,940
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

342
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,220
- Gongcai.
- What's going on?

343
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,060
Dad.

344
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,260
- Gongcai.
- I'm fine.

345
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,380
Ever since Li Ang

346
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,100
hit my head with something,

347
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,540
I've been feeling headaches.

348
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,860
There are always

349
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,220
all kinds of strange things
flashing in my head.

350
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,260
Hurry up and see a doctor.

351
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,100
Yeah.

352
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,140
Should we see a doctor?

353
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,180
No need.

354
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,020
With his skills,

355
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,760
is it worth spending money
on a physician?

356
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,280
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

357
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,270
- This child.
- Right.

358
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,660
His Majesty said we have merits,

359
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,980
and he will reward us.

360
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,140
What should we ask for?

361
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,380
Yeah, I've been thinking about this.

362
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,260
How about 10,000 taels of gold?

363
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,860
- Good.
- That's too vulgar.

364
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,660
Not vulgar at all.

365
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,340
Let's just ask for a few tens
of thousands of carts

366
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,500
of pepper, silk, or something like that.

367
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,180
- You...
- Thousands of carts?

368
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,380
Jicai, you're like a lion,

369
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,420
asking for so much.

370
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,460
We've done something so important.

371
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,300
I think

372
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,140
we shouldn't trouble His Majesty.

373
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,700
How about I ask for a post,

374
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,300
like the head of Juxian Alley?

375
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,140
Good.

376
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,540
That works.

377
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,620
From now on...

378
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,980
Bad news!

379
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,540
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Lin has been imprisoned.

380
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,440
He's been charged
with deceiving the Emperor

381
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,660
and is to be executed.

382
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,300
This...

383
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,980
Thank you.

384
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,020
It's past curfew,

385
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,220
yet you still managed to come in.

386
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,620
Yes.

387
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,620
I spent a lot of money

388
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,080
just to bring you this meal.

389
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,340
Father made the Four-Joy Meatballs.

390
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,820
Mother made the Peace and Longevity.

391
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,620
Shen Shaojie made the Auspicious Fish.

392
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,780
But you'd better not eat it.

393
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
This is rice.

394
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,540
This is the Happy Duck Egg.

395
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,060
Yangyang pestered Yu San

396
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,060
and Deyuan to teach her.

397
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,280
She practiced for a long time.

398
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,940
Did you make this?

399
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,020
Is it sweet?

400
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,740
Only you can eat this.

401
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,980
Eat up.

402
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,380
Is it good?

403
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,340
Yes.

404
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,980
Mother made this for a long time.

405
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,740
I've thought it through.

406
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,340
We have to beg them again.

407
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,580
If worst comes to worst,
we'll break into the prison.

408
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,020
Jicai,

409
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,510
listen to me.

410
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,180
You still have your family.

411
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,700
No matter what,

412
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,460
you can live on.

413
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,460
Liar.

414
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,820
You're a liar.

415
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,260
Jicai,

416
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,820
before I met you

417
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,500
and your family,

418
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,940
all I could think of was revenge.

419
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,580
I was like a walking corpse.

420
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,940
But you guys

421
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,660
really feel like my family.

422
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,820
With you,

423
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,260
I've truly lived once,

424
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,340
and that's enough.

425
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,460
His Majesty said he'd give us a reward.

426
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,300
I want to have your life.

427
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,700
Your life is mine.

428
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,340
No one can take it away.

429
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,190
Your Highness,

430
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,060
can't His Majesty spare Lin Yan?

431
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,060
My brother doesn't want to kill Anran,

432
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,320
but the better

433
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,460
Anran does as the Vice Prefect,

434
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,340
the more people he will offend.

435
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,620
There will surely be someone
who envies him.

436
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,500
Deceiving the Emperor

437
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,660
is the perfect excuse.

438
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,540
With solid evidence,

439
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,540
His Majesty will surely act

440
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,820
according to the law.

441
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,020
Your Highness, I beg you.

442
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,060
Please think of something.

443
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,860
Lady Shen,

444
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,860
think carefully.

445
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,350
Your Highness, I beg you.

446
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,580
His Majesty will surely act

447
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,460
according to the law.

448
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,940
If you want to save Anran,

449
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,940
you have to think carefully

450
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,500
about the laws and regulations.

451
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,100
Do you understand?

452
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,500
You've been talking about the law.

453
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,340
The law can condemn Lin Yan,

454
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,860
and the law can also save Lin Yan.

455
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,660
You mean...

456
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,300
Are you saying

457
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,180
you want to ask for an Imperial Waiver

458
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,940
so that Lin Yan can marry you

459
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,180
and be protected

460
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,340
from execution?

461
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,220
Yes.

462
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,980
(Xuanzheng Hall)
Lin Yan has been detained for days.

463
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,580
Please sentence Lin Yan
to the ultimate punishment

464
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,820
to uphold the nation's law.

465
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,540
Indeed, we can no longer delay.

466
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,940
Draft the decree.

467
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,940
Your Majesty.

468
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,620
Your Majesty,

469
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,960
executing Lin Yan will demonstrate

470
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,900
the strictness of our laws
and regulations.

471
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,930
However,

472
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,220
I must impeach you

473
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,460
for being inconsistent

474
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,620
and losing the people's trust.

475
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,880
In quelling Prince Zhao's rebellion,

476
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,460
the Shen family,
who operated in Juxian Alley,

477
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,580
also made contributions.

478
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,450
Therefore,

479
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,300
you granted them an Imperial Waiver.

480
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,220
Lady Shen

481
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,420
is engaged to Lin Anran.

482
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,860
Anran is part of the Shen family

483
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,220
and is also protected
by the Imperial Waiver.

484
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,510
The waiver's exemption from death

485
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,980
has always taken precedence

486
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,380
over other laws and regulations.

487
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,940
Today,

488
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,860
your decision to punish Lin Yan

489
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,900
is actually illegal.

490
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,980
Absurd.

491
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,620
The Imperial Waiver

492
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,620
was granted to the Shen family.

493
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,300
Lin Yan

494
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,460
has never been married,

495
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,660
as everyone in the court knows.

496
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,020
You can't overturn this

497
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,060
with just a few words.

498
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,180
Even if it's an engagement,

499
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,860
it's Lady Shen marrying Lin Yan.

500
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,420
According to this logic,

501
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,740
Lady Shen should also be implicated.

502
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,940
The Imperial Waiver

503
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,620
can only ensure her own survival.

504
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,420
Your Majesty,

505
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,120
I have here their Letter of Marriage

506
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,140
and the list of betrothal gifts.

507
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,480
As an elder,

508
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,040
I witnessed the reception

509
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,630
of the Letter of Marriage

510
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,980
and the betrothal gifts.

511
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,040
Censor.

512
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
Please take a look.

513
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,020
(Lin Yan accepted the betrothal gifts)

514
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,420
This is the list of betrothal gifts
that Lin Yan received.

515
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,020
He is marrying into the family,

516
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,460
so he is also protected
by the Imperial Waiver.

517
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,340
How could this be?

518
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,580
Marrying into the Shen family?

519
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,300
How could

520
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,380
the Vice Prefect

521
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,020
do such a thing?

522
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,140
Your Majesty,

523
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,380
this must be a trick by Lin Yan.

524
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,860
A ruler must be clear
in rewards and punishments

525
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,460
to establish the law

526
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,540
and the foundation.

527
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,140
Since there is an Imperial Waiver
protecting his family,

528
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,700
we must keep our promise.

529
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,940
Otherwise,

530
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,420
the law will not be established,

531
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,780
and the foundation will be shaken.

532
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,080
If everyone follows his example,

533
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,980
how shall we govern?

534
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,630
You...

535
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,420
Now, it's settled.

536
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,300
The clan law, the rules, the world

537
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,200
won't tolerate two shameless sinners

538
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,740
like us.

539
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,740
If there is a hell,

540
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,100
I'll go alone.

541
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,220
Lin Yan,

542
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,620
this is the only way I can save you.

543
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,220
But a fake engagement

544
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,060
can never become real in the end.

545
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,000
Luckily, you've been restored
to your position.

546
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,220
I've talked it over with my parents.

547
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,060
Once this matter blows over,

548
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,460
we will move away from Yong'an.

549
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,700
I will go far away

550
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,500
and never see you again.

551
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,420
Shaoguang.

552
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,020
The descendant has offended you.

553
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,540
Ancestor,

554
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,540
please forgive my sins.

What a sin.

573
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,460
Truly a sin.

574
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,780
I thought these two

575
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,380
would never see each other again,

576
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,020
but His Majesty insisted
on putting them in a painting.

577
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,460
That's right.

578
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,020
It's like taking a wedding photo.

579

580
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,980
Exactly.

581
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,340
It's terrifying.

582
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,860
Mr. Lin.

583
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,700
The painting is done.

584
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,820

585

in the ancestral hall?

(Portrait of Lin Yan, Vice Prefect)

587
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,620
Could it be

588
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,100
that we are witnessing history here?

589
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,220
No way.

590
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,260
Jicai.

591
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,580
Jicai,

592
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,160
stand up straight, lift your head,

593
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,320
and tuck in your chin a bit.

594
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,060
Imagine there's an apple
under your chin.

595
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,220
You'll look better that way.

596
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,500
Yes, listen to your mom.

597
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,850
Hold that apple and you'll look good.

598
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:52,700
Right, right.

599
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,660
Turn your head to the side a bit.

600
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,700
You look fatter this way.

601
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,660
Turn a bit more.

602
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,780
Jicai, turn a bit more to this side.

603
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,580
You forgot about the apple again.

604
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,260
You have to hold the apple to look good.

605
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,860
Too much. Come back a bit.

606
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,340
You look better when you smile.

607
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,540
- Expression.
- Show some emotion.

608
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,740
You look better when you smile.

609
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,940
Hold it.

610
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,020
Your expression needs to be there.

611
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,140
Like this.

612
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,740
This is good enough.

613
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,580
This is good.

614
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,100
Hurry up and paint.

615
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,580
Why this pose?

616
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,540
You...

617
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,380
Never mind.

618
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,860
Let her be.

619
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,660
Mr. Lin, the painting is done.

620
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,900
Thank you.

621
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,420
I'll take my leave now.

Yes, it is.

625
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,940
Jicai, come here and take a look.

626
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,640
- It looks very much like you.
- Come.

I can't quite put my finger on it,

628
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,100
but something feels off.

629
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,180
A bit fat, maybe?

630
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
No, it's not fat.

If you keep doing this.

679
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,500
I won't tell you

the most crucial truth.

681
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,180
Don't tell me then.

682
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,340
How about this?

683
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,140
As we agreed before,

684
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,540
is that okay?

685
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,660
Grandpa, you have to give me 3 yuan.

Alright, sit down.

00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,820
Let me tell you.

690
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,460
The most crucial truth is

691
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,320
that it's all fake.

692
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,100
Well, not exactly fake.

693
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,220
The story

694
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,980
is still real.

695
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,700
The Vice Prefect

696
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,580
did marry a lady surnamed Shen,

697
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,980
but she was not our ancestor.

698
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,990
Our true ancestor

699
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,060
is actually a friend of Mr. Lin,

700
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,580
Censor Pei Fei.

701
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,340
Mr. Pei later

702
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,580
married into our family.

703
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,540
But I don't think

704
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,060
he is as impressive as Mr. Lin,

705
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,940
so

706
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,100
I deliberately said that.

707
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,030
I remember now.

708
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,420
I remember now.

709
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,260

710
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,980
Our ancestor

711
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,420
was never Mr. Lin.

712
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,100
It was Pei Fei.

713
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,660
- What?
- Pei Fei?

714
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,500
Grandpa thought Mr. Lin
was more impressive,

715
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,700
so he deliberately said that.

716
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,820
Jicai,

717
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,140
there is absolutely no relation

718
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,340
between you and Mr. Lin.

719
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,880
