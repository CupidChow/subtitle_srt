2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 15=

3
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,910
Shen Shaoguang,

4
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,680
actually, I can hold my liquor.

5
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
You fell asleep?

6
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
We're at home?

7
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,430
Young Master.

8
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,000
What's the matter?

9
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,420
Your Highness...

10
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,940
Mr. Li,
why suddenly come to the Capital?

11
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,660
Is something wrong?

12
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,940
What could've gone wrong?

13
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,500
I was just worried
about you in the Capital,

14
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,580
so I brought you

15
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,900
some food and necessities.

16
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,580
Are you afraid I'll peek?

17
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,980
What?

18
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,380
Anran, have you become romantic,

19
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,500
hiding a young lady in the carriage?

20
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,500
You're joking.

21
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,540
Does His Majesty know

22
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,020
about your trip

23
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,940
to the Capital?

24
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,980
It doesn't matter.

25
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,540
I'm just a leisurely man.

26
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,980
Even if my brother finds out,

27
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,200
he will just think of it

28
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,020
as a trip for fun.

29
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,980
No need to disturb him.

30
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,590
Though it's already night,

31
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,280
there are still many people around.

32
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,580
It's better not to stay outside.

33
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,260
I'll get off now.

34
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,800
Leave through the back door.

35
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,120
Tell your family to avoid him.

36
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,940
You want me to notify them now?

37
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,020
How can I manage that?

38
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Mr. Li, please come in for a rest.

39
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,620
Please.

40
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,780
I've missed you so much

41
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,480
during the time I was away.

42
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,740
I don't know if you're doing well.

43
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,220
I've been used to living in the Capital.

44
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,580
Don't worry.

45
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,060
- Grandma.
- Yangyang.

46
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,940
Can I use this?

47
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,170
This?

48
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,780
Go ask your dad to do it.

49
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,780
Dad,

50
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,340
I want to use this.

51
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,380
Don't use that one.

52
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
What do you think

53
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,380
of the one I've skewered?

54
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,980
Look at my sword.

55
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,680
I didn't expect your mansion

56
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,390
to be so lively.

57
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,740
Take this. That's too big for you.

58
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,420
When did the guests arrive?

59
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,220
Please forgive me.

60
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,340
They are the Shen family from Qingyang.

61
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,100
When my parents were alive,

62
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,480
they arranged this marriage for me.

63
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,420
Three months ago,

64
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,460
they came to seek refuge

65
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,500
and have stayed since.

66
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,670
When Rangzhi was alive,

67
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,710
he arranged a marriage for you?

68
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,520
Why have you never mentioned it to me?

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,920
Shortly after the engagement,

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,540
Father took us to the Capital.

71
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,180
Since then, we've had little contact.

72
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,700
I thought after my family's incident,

73
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,340
the engagement would be invalid.

74
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,380
But now I've talked it over with them

75
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,090
and broken off the engagement.

76
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,540
They have nowhere to stay,

77
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,890
so they've stayed for now.

78
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,770
That's why

79
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,410
I haven't mentioned it to you.

80
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,340
You used to be very close to me,

81
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,160
but ever since you came to the Capital,

82
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,820
you've kept many things from me.

83
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,620
Though you write letters home,

84
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,980
you never mention the Shen family.

85
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,340
I just think

86
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,540
they are not important.

87
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,860
Is that right?

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,900
But I think

89
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,700
you're reluctant to get close
to the Princess

90
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,270
partly because of this past betrothal.

91
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,260
Yangyang, be careful.

92
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,160
Don't fall.

93
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,020
- Before,
- I know.

94
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,700
you rarely cared about the Capital.

95
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,740
I didn't expect you

96
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,900
to care so much about the Princess.

97
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,010
Are you protecting this family?

98
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,500
You avoided my question

99
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,420
and started to question me.

100
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,660
Anran,

101
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,820
the Princess is
His Majesty's only sibling,

102
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,380
just like Princess Guantao.

103
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,580
The Crown Prince is still young;

104
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,730
his character is not yet set.

105
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,940
The Princess will often give him advice.

106
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,140
If there is someone
she can rely on by her side,

107
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,380
she won't make mistakes.

108
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,580
I understand.

109
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,740
It's getting late.

110
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,980
You should rest first.

111
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,380
What's the rush?

112
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,180
Anran,

113
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,300
even without the engagement,

114
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,540
I still should meet the Shen family,

115
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,420
since they're here.

116
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Mr. Lin is so respectful

117
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,860
to this man.

118
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,860
He even called His Majesty "my brother".

119
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,700
He's not an ordinary man, is he?

120
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,820
He is very extraordinary.

121
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,820
Li,

122
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,260
to grill the lamb well,

123
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,620
besides having good meat,

124
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,380
the seasoning is the key.

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,060
Shen, please.

126
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,100
Look at me.

127
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,660
Well.

128
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,820
Let me learn, too.

129
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,660
Go ahead.

130
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,980
Is this right?

131
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,060
You have a natural talent.

132
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,460
You have the makings of a chef.

133
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,260
You flatter me.

134
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,540
The smoke rises like clouds and mist;

135
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,220
the oil sizzles with a fragrant aroma.

136
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,660
What a learned man.

137
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,900
What a learned man.

138
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Jicai is here.

139
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
This must be

140
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,740
Anran's fiancée, right?

141
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,100
She's too thin.

142
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,860
She should eat more to be plumper.

143
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,940
That'd look better.

144
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,140
Yes, yes.

145
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,260
She never listens to us.

146
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,120
Mr. Li,

147
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,430
our engagement has been canceled.

148
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,460
No need to explain further.

149
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,170
Lady Shen, nice to meet you.

150
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,660
Greetings...

151
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,710
(The hierarchy is not yet very strict.)

152
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,100
(Though he is the Emperor's brother,)

153
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,620
(he seems very close to the ancestor.)

154
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,700
(We've invited him to barbecue anyway.)

155
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,480
(I might as well take a gamble.)

156
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
Uncle Li.

157
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,620
May you achieve your wishes

158
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,740
and be content and happy.

159
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,420
Clever girl.

160
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,580
What a smooth talker.

161
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,780
Anran,

162
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,340
Shen and his family are so interesting,

163
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,420
and we

164
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,020
really hit it off.

165
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,540
Li, no need to say more.

166
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,540
Try this skewer.

167
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,730
- Sure.
- It's done.

168
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,980
I've had grilled lamb before,

169
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,580
but never such lamb skewers.

170
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,460
How is it?

171
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,640
Tender on the inside
and crispy on the outside.

172
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,660
How nice.

173
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,820
You flatter me.

174
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,380
What's in Yong'an City?

175
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,340
Shen's Diner.

176
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,180
Carriages.

177
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,140
Capital Prefecture.

178
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,100
Our ancestor.

179
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,900
What did he just say?

180
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,100
You must be drunk.

181
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,580
Our ancestor?

182
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,500
Nonsense.

183
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,340
Ancestor?

184
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,540
You should drink.

185
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,840
There's no ancestor involved.

186
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,680
- Nothing to do with him.
- We have ancestors,

187
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,200
but you can't say it like this.

188
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,780
- My fault.
- Drink.

189
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,660
I'll drink.

190
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,020
Again, again.

191
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,100
- Come on.
- I want that.

192
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,580
- You go.
- Shen, you go.

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,580
- What's in Yunshui Manor?
- I'll get it for you.

194
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,580
A pond.

195
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,420
A privy.

196
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,280
A study.

197
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,170
Security guards.

198
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,460
What do you mean by that?

199
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,540
Security guards.

200
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,020
Security guards mean

201
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,710
those...

202
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,940
guards who keep us safe.

203
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,460
We call them security guards.

204
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,300
You got it right.

205
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,500
But you mumbled the words.

206
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,260
I'm drunk.

207
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,660
If you say so much, it'll be right.

208
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,700
- Come on.
- Uncle.

209
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,300
My dad... my father.

210
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,700
- My father
- I'm your father.

211
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,100
likes to mumble words.

212
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,900
Please forgive him.

213
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,120
Why not start with me?

214
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,700
- Let's forget that.
- Drink slower.

215
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,380
What's in Juxian Alley?

216
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,940
- Handsome Shen.
- A chef.

217
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,820
Wait.

218
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,420
Both of you are wrong.

219
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,660
It's my turn.

220
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,900
You guys cut in on me.

221
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,260
Uncle, you've got
the essence of this game.

222
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,420
Uncle.

223
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,380
You guys have a drink.

224
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,580
I'll join you.

225
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,580
This game is so much fun.

226
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,380
Where did you guys learn it from?

227
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,940
We made it up ourselves.

228
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,620
We've been playing it
since we were kids.

229
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,340
We innovated it.

230
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,300
You are really talented.

231
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,980
Come on.

232
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,620
I know that Mr. Li

233
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,980
is someone

234
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,900
extraordinary.

235
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,540
I didn't have time to tell them
to avoid him.

236
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,160
Will he cause you trouble later?

237
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,060
Come on, drink.

238
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,860
Weren't you just bold enough

239
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,220
to call him uncle?

240
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,240
- Have some dishes.
- So delicious.

241
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,100
This is

242
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,980
the Emperor's sixth brother,

243
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,140
Prince Zhao.

244
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,300
This wine is also very tasty.

245
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,380
You don't know, Li.

246
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,220
Don't worry.

247
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,500
The Prince is easygoing;

248
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,220
he genuinely finds you interesting.

249
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,310
Li,

250
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,620
I can tell just

251
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,700
by looking at you that you have

252
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,260
an extraordinary presence.

253
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,020
You must be an official, right?

254
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,220
I think your position

255
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,220
is higher than Mr. Lin's.

256
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,180
Right?

257
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,020
Shen,

258
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,980
you have a good eye.

259
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,620
How did you figure it out?

260
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,020
What do I do?

261
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,900
I run a diner.

262
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,700
I see so many people every day.

263
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,060
What kind of people haven't I seen?

264
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,460
Especially those officials.

265
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,780
When they come to my diner,

266
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,660
I just take one look

267
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
and I know what they do.

268
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,900
They look down

269
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,980
on everyone.

270
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,100
You and Mr. Lin are different.

271
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,060
You treat the commoners as human beings.

272
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,220
Good officials.

273
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,380
Shen Jianshe, that's enough.

274
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,020
How many officials have you seen?

275
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,060
Where did you learn this habit

276
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,240
of boasting when you're drunk?

277
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,140
I've seen many.

278
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,340
I've seen...

279
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,660
I've seen too many.

280
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,700
Let me tell you something.

281
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,980
It's always like this.

282
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,620
At school,

283
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,980
they learn some knowledge

284
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,820
and how to be a good man,

285
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,300
but once they become
officials in society,

286
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,780
they forget it all.

287
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,020
Full of bad intentions.

288
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,220
Have you said enough?

289
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,220
We shouldn't have had dinner here.

290
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,780
Mrs. Shen,

291
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,740
Shen is right.

292
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,100
Well said.

293
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,260
But Shen,

294
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,020
I have one thing I don't understand.

295
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,340
What do you mean

296
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,940
by society?

297
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,860
Let me tell you.

298
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,260
It's like a university.

299
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,740
Actually,

300
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,420
you have universities here, too.

301
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,220
The Imperial Academy in Wuben Alley

302
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,580
is a university.

303
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,380
Of course.

304
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,220
However,

305
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,100
let me tell you.

306
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,620
The society university is complex.

307
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,780
For example,

308
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,900
your officialdom

309
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,980
is a society university.

310
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,340
You learn a lot of theories
about being a man at school,

311
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,820
but when you come out into society,

312
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,620
it's not like that.

313
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,220
Who is the most powerful man?

314
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,100
The most powerful man

315
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,060
is the one who can keep his own heart

316
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,220
in this big dye vat of society.

317
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,820
That's the real powerful man.

318
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,900
You

319
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,460
and he.

320
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,860
You are that kind of man.

321
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,140
Your words have moved me.

322
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,020
I'm moved.

323
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
Shen,

324
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,180
you know me well.

325
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,380
How rare to meet a bosom friend.

326
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,500
If we don't hit it off...

327
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,300
Let me skip this part.

328
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,460
We keep hitting it off.

329
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,380
Yes, yes.

330
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,620
Shen.

331
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,460
Go ahead.

332
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,860
To be honest,

333
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,820
with an elder like you

334
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,540
by Anran's side,

335
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,580
I'm relieved.

336
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,460
You're relieved.

337
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,020
This brat

338
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,820
never likes to follow rules.

339
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,020
Today,

340
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,860
is he okay?

341
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,710
Of course.

342
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,070
At worst, it's just a few curfews.

343
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,110
♪To the ends of the earth♪

344
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,370
♪To the corners of the sea♪

345
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,480
♪True friends are few and far between♪

346
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,820
The atmosphere tonight is so great.

347
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,140
I couldn't help but want to sing.

348
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,300
Is that even a song?

349
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,260
- How about I sing?
- Shen Jianshe.

350
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,100
Sure.

351
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,460
I sing pretty well.

352
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,820
- You sing well.
- Li.

353
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,670
You just played

354
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,740
this game quite well.

355
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Let's play a few rounds.

356
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,960
- You go first.
- Okay.

357
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,580
Ready?

358
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,430
Ready.

359
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,980
What's in Yong'an City?

360
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,830
Shen's Diner.

361
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,900
Cucumber salad.

362
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,120
Did I say you can play?

363
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,980
Come on, continue.

364
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,420
Why can't Shen play?

365
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,960
He's drunk.

366
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,310
- He can't play.
- I'm not drunk.

367
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,500
He's not drunk.

368
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,820
- Don't meddle.
- Mother.

369
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,100
Let's start from this side.

370
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,500
- He can't play.
- Father.

371
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,700
Your Highness.

372
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,660
Anran,

373
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,660
your family is a noble family.

374
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,460
How could you be engaged
to a merchant's girl?

375
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,340
This family

376
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,660
seems quite strange.

377
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,660
I've also been puzzled.

378
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,220
But my parents never cared
about family background,

379
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,620
so it's not strange.

380
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,500
As you can see,

381
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,540
the Shens are not deceitful.

382
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,700
These days,

383
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,900
they've treated me sincerely

384
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,100
without any unusual moves.

385
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,940
Have you checked their background
in Qingyang?

386
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,620
Nothing

387
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,260
is wrong with them.

388
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,020
You didn't go?

389
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,660
To protect this family,

390
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,340
you lied to me.

391
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,660
I'm just worried

392
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,980
that investigating an old case
in Qingyang

393
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,780
might cause unnecessary trouble.

394
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,940
Since you're planning
to overturn the Cui Case,

395
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,180
why fear unnecessary trouble?

396
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,300
Do you know how big a deal this is?

397
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,060
I took a risk to save you,

398
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,300
not to let you be trapped in danger.

399
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,220
How do you know?

400
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,260
I was the one who raised you.

401
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,540
Can't I see

402
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,500
through your thoughts?

403
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,780
I know

404
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,620
you'll find out what I want to do.

405
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,830
But you saved me.

406
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,000
I can't implicate you any further.

407
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,360
Please stop asking

408
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,780
to distance yourself.

409
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,820
You're really confused.

410
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,660
To me,

411
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,180
you're like my own child.

412
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,620
How could I distance myself?

413
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,020
You are doing such dangerous things.

414
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,790
I'm not even in the capital.

415
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,060
How can I protect you?

416
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,650
Anran,

417
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,700
you've changed your surname

418
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,500
and are now the Vice Prefect.

419
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,540
That's a high position.

420
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,060
So, you must live well.

421
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,980
That's what your parents would expect.

422
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,140
I understand.

423
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Enough.

424
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,100
Why are you still like this?

425
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,570
Anran,

426
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,560
you've been in the Capital

427
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,980
for quite some time now.

428
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,980
Have you found out anything?

429
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,980
The evidence in the old case files

430
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,580
is complete and detailed.

431
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,320
There's nowhere to start.

432
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,340
Lady Shen

433
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,580
was once engaged to you.

434
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,500
They might know something.

435
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,420
It happened suddenly.

436
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,140
They were far away in Qingyang

437
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,700
and had nothing to do with the court.

438
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,770
I've asked.

439
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,290
They don't know anything.

440
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,100
This family

441
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,060
can't stay in your mansion for long.

442
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,420
If someone with ill intentions
targets them,

443
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,740
that'd be troublesome.

444
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,460
Do you understand?

445
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,380
Yes.

446
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,420
(Gentle and Calm)

447
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,580
Why did the Prince suddenly realize

448
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,940
that you want to overturn the case?

449
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
The Prince didn't just start doubting.

450
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,940
Since I managed to come to the Capital,

451
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,860
the Prince had had suspicions.

452
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,860
Just now in the garden,

453
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,380
the Prince was trying

454
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,420
to lure Mr. Shen into revealing
my abnormalities.

455
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,260
The Prince is not in the Capital,

456
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,100
yet he knows your recent situation.

457
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,140
There must be spies

458
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,580
he has placed around us.

459
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,540
Luckily, you're cautious

460
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,580
and have never told him everything.

461
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,540
Before, I hid this from him

462
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,740
because I didn't want to drag him down,

463
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,300
but now...

464
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,140
Before,

465
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,420
the Prince always used different reasons

466
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,540
to dissuade you from participating

467
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,740
in the annual imperial exams.

468
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,100
If not for the special exams
in Year Jia Wu,

469
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,660
you couldn't have become an official.

470
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,700
In the end,

471
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,420
the Prince transferred you
to a remote area,

472
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,100
saying he wanted you to be leisurely.

473
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,220
If you hadn't solved
the embezzlement case,

474
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,900
we wouldn't have been here.

475
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,100
That day,

476
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,700
it was actually the Prince

477
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
who asked me to investigate that case.

478
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,940
But I don't know if he

479
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,900
wanted me to catch Magistrate Dou

480
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,570
or if he thought I was one of them

481
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,300
and would turn a blind eye.

482
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,940
Indeed.

483
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,740
After you solved the case,

484
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,560
the Prince didn't praise you at all.

485
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,260
What does he want to do?

486
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,620
Why did he insist

487
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,140
on stopping you from coming here?

488
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,860
What?

489
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,340
That's Prince Zhao?

490
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,820
Weren't you close to him just now?

491
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,300
How many lives do you have?

492
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,900
Want to join the imperial family?

493
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,460
I was just...

494
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,660
I even tapped him.

495
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,660
Can I kneel now and apologize?

496
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,740
Don't be too nervous.

497
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,780
Judging by the atmosphere tonight,

498
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,860
it was quite harmonious.

499
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,940
Li...

500
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,080
Li?

501
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,500
I called him Li?

502
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,820
Maybe he won't be angry.

503
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,500
Didn't you guys notice?

504
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,420
Prince Zhao was trying
to get info from Dad

505
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,290
when he got drunk.

506
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,540
Dad, did he ask you about the ancestor?

507
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,080
I knew something was off.

508
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,900
If not for Jicai,
diverting the conversation,

509
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,940
you'd cause great trouble.

510
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,980
He did ask,

511
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,260
but I didn't say anything.

512
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
I didn't say anything.

513
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,400
Without Jicai stopping you,
could you have held back?

514
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,140
I know you too well.

515
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,860
I just wanted to tell him

516
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,340
about our ancestor's curfew violation,

517
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,220
but I didn't say it.

518
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,020
I really didn't say anything.

519
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,620
And Prince Zhao

520
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,020
was quite friendly to me.

521
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,180
He's a prince, after all.

522
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,020
When he treated me like this,

523
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,340
I thought

524
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,140
maybe if I befriended him,

525
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,500
I could help with our ancestor's career.

526
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,220
Could it be because Mr. Lin

527
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,380
made a mistake at work

528
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,900
that upset Prince Zhao?

529
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,780
In ancient times, vassals

530
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,660
couldn't enter the Capital
without permission.

531
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,060
Yet he snuck in.

532
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,420
There must be a reason.

533
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,260
Jicai,

534
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,500
I don't think

535
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,020
their relationship

536
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,250
is that simple.

537
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,900
Grandpa said

538
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,760
that the ancestor changed his name

539
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,000
because he was saved by someone.

540
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,900
This savior

541
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,860
had such great power.

542
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,900
Could it be Prince Zhao?

543
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,900
Did your grandpa really say that?

544
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
I don't remember.

545
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,140
It's quite possible.

546
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,980
Never mind, let's not think about it.

547
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,700
Since he's already here,

548
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,460
we'll just treat him as an elder

549
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,300
and take care of him,

550
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,660
lest we cause any trouble for Mr. Lin.

551
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,420
(Shen's Diner)

552
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,580
What?

553
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,940
Zhao...

554
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,580
Mr. Li has agreed

555
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,620
to come to our diner for dinner tonight?

556
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:53,750
Your parents

557
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,780
delivered the invitation to my master,

558
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,260
saying you'd host a banquet here.

559
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,180
How hospitable.

560
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,100
My master wouldn't let them down.

561
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,020
Auntie.

562
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,620
- What's wrong?
- What's the matter?

563
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,460
Get up, get up.

564
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,540
Are you alright?

565
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,140
Dad, Mom.

566
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,660
What were you thinking,

567
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,180
inviting him to eat at the diner?

568
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,740
Look at you, all flustered.

569
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,420
Didn't you say so last night?

570
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,700
Prince Zhao is already here;

571
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,240
we need to take care of him.

572
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,440
I told you to take care of him,

573
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,720
not to invite him.

574
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,540
Mom, why didn't you stop him?

575
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,160
What have I done wrong this time?

576
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,580
Your dad insisted on inviting him.

577
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,180
I thought

578
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,260
it was fine.

579
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,140
Mr. Lin has to work every day;

580
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,540
Prince Zhao can't be seen in public.

581
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,900
He can only stay at Yunshui Manor.

582
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
How boring that must be.

583
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,100
If we could let him out

584
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,500
for some fresh air

585
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,820
and have some good food,

586
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,180
how happy he would be.

587
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,020
That's right.

588
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,700
Besides, the safest place

589
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,220
is our diner.

590
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,280
Once we serve him well,

591
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,340
it might even be helpful for Mr. Lin.

592
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,640
I feel something is off,

593
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,340
but I seem to be persuaded.

594
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,180
You see?

595
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,340
Jicai, just listen to me.

596
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,340
Relationships

597
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,500
are built through meals.

598
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,460
I know what I'm doing.

599
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,500
We should at least let Mr. Lin know.

600
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,300
How can we decide on our own?

601
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,060
Yes, we should inform Mr. Lin.

602
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,300
But he left for court so early.

603
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,540
We didn't get up.

604
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,900
How about this?

605
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,300
You go and tell him.

606
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,220
Alright, I'll go now.

607
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,820
Jicai,

608
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,520
what's that on your forehead?

609
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,620
Don't forget to wipe it off.

610
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,780
(Xuanzheng Hall)

611
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,300
Elders from my clan

612
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,540
somehow heard

613
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,940
that you don't even have a concubine.

614
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,580
They all came to me to inquire.

615
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,340
I heard from my family

616
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,340
that I have seven cousins

617
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,780
and six nieces

618
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,980
who want to marry you.

619
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,300
The Pei Clan is also prestigious,

620
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,940
but I'm a nobody.

621
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,980
However, because I'm friends with you,

622
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,300
I've become quite popular.

623
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,500
How should I respond to them?

624
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,700
Mr. Pei,

625
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,260
when did I become friends with you?

626
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,980
One of the two ladies waiting outside

627
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,400
is truly a beauty,

628
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,040
not inferior to the ladies of the harem.

629
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,970
Yes.

630
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,660
I wonder where she is from.

631
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,180
What great fortune.

632
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,340
There's a beauty up ahead.

633
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,180
Let's go take a look.

634
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,640
These officials who can discuss in court

635
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,400
must have ranks, right?

636
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,900
They're all looking at you.

637
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,180
Why don't you pick a good one,

638
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,380
and I'll be your matchmaker?

639
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,900
Milady, you're teasing me again.

640
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,820
Don't be embarrassed.

641
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,460
But it's true.

642
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,140
In my hometown,

643
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,060
I'm well-known for being plump.

644
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,100
Plenty of young men came to propose.

645
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,900
I'm Eighteenth Master Pei.

646
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,820
I admire you.

647
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,220
After much thought,

648
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,300
I don't want you to miss me.

649
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,460
(Xuanzheng Gate)
May I ask your name?

650
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,300
Judging by your appearance,

651
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,980
you don't seem unmarried.

652
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,020
My sister

653
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,780
respectfully rejects you.

654
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,860
Ma'am, did you hear clearly?

655
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,050
I'm Eighteenth Master Pei.

656
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,460
The Pei Clan...

657
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,080
Ma'am?

658
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,220
Eighteenth Master Pei,

659
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,700
my family acts properly,

660
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,140
so they don't want to be blunt.

661
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,220
I'll convey the message.

662
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,040
You have a wife and three concubines.

663
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,600
She doesn't want her sister to suffer.

664
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,520
Can you understand?

665
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,180
Suffer?

666
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,210
Goodbye.

667
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,140
Mr. Pei.

668
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,980
Goodbye.

669
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,620
Why are you here?

670
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,700
Making fun of me?

671
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,660
Come here.

672
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,380
That one

673
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,980
is Mr. Lin's cousin.

674
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,300
And that one

675
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,220
is the cousin's sworn sister,

676
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,020
so she's also like Mr. Lin's sister.

677
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,300
What you just did

678
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,290
wasn't quite appropriate.

679
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,940
Forty-seventh Master Pei,

680
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,670
stop gloating here.

681
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,020
Lin Yan's cousin

682
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,500
just runs a diner

683
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,540
in Juxian Alley.

684
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,540
Look at how he treats her.

685
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,780
Does he like

686
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,300
that frail, unattractive woman

687
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,860
and wants to marry her?

688
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,300
Then it's a blessing

689
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,520
that my niece won't marry him.

690
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,020
You call yourself the twelfth outside,

691
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,580
but you're actually
the forty-seventh in the clan.

692
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,860
Stop lecturing me.

693
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,100
Even if I call you forty-seventh

694
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
in front of others,

695
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,080
you'll have to respond.

696
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,780
My parents...

697
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,660
have caused you trouble again.

698
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,580
I'm really sorry.

699
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,380
It seems you always
get me out of trouble.

700
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,540
Like just now.

701
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,260
Treating Prince Zhao to dinner

702
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,340
could have been a disaster.

703
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,740
I might lose

704
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,380
my position tomorrow.

705
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,380
Is it so serious?

706
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,300
It'll be fine.

707
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,700
You spent money and effort on my behalf.

708
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
I'm very grateful.

709
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
If a meal could bring me trouble,

710
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,500
that's my problem,

711
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,900
not yours.

712
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,620
However, the visit of Prince Zhao

713
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,060
reminds us

714
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,980
that we should find a place to live

715
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,300
and move out of Yunshui Manor

716
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,500
to avoid causing you trouble.

717
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,060
Can't you just stay?

718
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,300
It's nothing.

719
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,220
But you're wearing an official robe.

720
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,340
You can't go like this, right?

721
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,180
Indeed.

722
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,760
But going back to the mansion

723
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
might be too late.

724
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,550
I have a robe in my carriage.

725
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,020
You change then.

726
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,380
Are you done?

727
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,500
How disrespectful.

728
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,220
Mr. Lin, you said

729
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,180
an elder kept something

730
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,380
from you.

731
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,820
Is he Prince Zhao?

732
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,100
Is he very important to you?

733
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,420
After I escaped death,

734
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,460
Prince Zhao took me in.

735
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,540
No wonder.

736
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,460
I knew it must be hard

737
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,780
to change household registration,

738
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,140
and you'd need help.

739
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,940
You're very smart,

740
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,960
but don't say such things

741
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,380
in the future.

742
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,570
Mr. Lin,

743
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,380
is there anything to be mindful of

744
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,780
when dealing with Prince Zhao?

745
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,700
Anything we can't let him know?

746
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,220
He cares about me,

747
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,340
but official matters

748
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,100
can't be discussed with him.

749
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,900
I understand.

750
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,540
(Shen's Diner)

751
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,060
Mr. Lin, milady, we're here.

752
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,220
Get down.

753
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,980
What's wrong?

754
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,820
Mr. Lin.

755
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,500
(Shen's Diner)

756
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,100
Mr. Li.

757
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,500
Let me serve you some soup.

758
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
- Okay.
- Drink more.

759
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,140
- Drink more.
- Less for me.

760
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,880
This wine is good.

761
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,960
- Come on.
- Sure.

762
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,460
Try our fish ball soup.

763
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,300
Sure.

764
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,940
It's really rare

765
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,220
for us to gather like this.

766
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,920
- Usually,
- Yes.

767
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,460
we can't see this child now.

768
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,700
Stop it.

769
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,800
It's not easy

770
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,040
for him to be the Vice Prefect.

771
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,740
You're the only capable man

772
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,940
he knows.

773
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,900
If he doesn't work hard

774
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,660
for the Prefecture,

775
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,540
who will support him in the future?

776
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,620
Yes.

777
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,860
Everyone, rest assured.

778
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,820
As long as I'm here,

779
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,940
no one will bully Anran.

780
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,140
Thank you.

781
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,340
Mr. Li, eat up.

782
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,340
Let's have a drink first.

783
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

784
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,900
Let's drink together.

785
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,940
Let's drink together.

786
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,890
Eat up.

787
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,120
Sure.

788
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,220
Try it.

789
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,660
Shen,

790
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,260
after eating the meals you made,

791
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,540
I'm afraid

792
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,810
I won't be used to the food at home.

793
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,460
Mr. Li, don't say that.

794
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,620
Whenever you can come to Yong'an,

795
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,300
I'll cook for you anytime.

796
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,660
Yes.

797
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,990
What if

798
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,110
I can't come often?

799
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,340
You suddenly stopped

800
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,340
calling me Li.

801
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,540
Anran must've told you
about my identity.

802
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,620
My family and I didn't know

803
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,740
your identity before.

804
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,500
Please forgive our rudeness.

805
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,700
Please forgive us.

806
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,620
Please forgive us.

807
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,660
Don't stand on ceremony.

808
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,060
Everyone, sit down.

809
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,820
Come on.

810
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,820
Sit down.

811
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,860
To be honest,

812
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,080
I really hit it off with you guys.

813
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,300
If our relationship becomes distant,

814
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,900
wouldn't that be my loss?

815
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,500
You all are sincere and trustworthy.

816
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,860
What I lack most around me

817
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,340
are friends like you.

818
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,930
Your Highness,

819
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,540
we are just ordinary commoners.

820
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,500
How could we deserve such honor?

821
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,940
You deserve it.

822
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,900
Shen.

823
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,140
Thank you.

824
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,500
These past few days,

825
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,100
I appreciate all of your care.

826
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,460
Come on.

827
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,220
We appreciate it.

828
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,260
What an honor.

829
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,580
You know what?

830
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,300
After having a few drinks,

831
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,140
I feel a bit tipsy.

832
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,100
Shen, accompany me outside
for some fresh air.

833
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,060
Uncle,

834
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,380
let me accompany the Prince for a walk.

835
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,980
Yes, let Mr. Lin accompany you.

836
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,220
Well.

837
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,860
As soon as we came in,
we sat down to eat.

838
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,860
I haven't had a chance
to tour this diner.

839
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,420
Let your uncle accompany me.

840
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,340
We can chat about the art of cooking.

841
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,980
No need for you.

842
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,740
Shen.

843
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,500
You called me out.

844
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,820
Is there something you want to tell me?

845
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,580
Shen, you're perceptive.

846
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,660
Sit down.

847
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,940
Don't be nervous.

848
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,820
Have a seat.

849
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,620
I wanted to talk to you

850
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,020
about Anran's future.

851
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,700
Anran was promoted to the Vice Prefect.

852
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,420
In terms of his career,

853
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,780
he is young and promising.

854
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,560
But when it comes to marriage,

855
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,860
he's an old man.

856
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,290
We are both elders.

857
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,300
We should plan for Anran, right?

858
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,740
Actually, I knew

859
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,860
you wanted

860
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,660
to talk about Mr. Lin,

861
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,340
but I didn't expect it to be about this.

862
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,980
Yes, we did have an engagement

863
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,260
with Mr. Lin,

864
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,940
but it has been

865
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,860
broken off.

866
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,100
What I'm trying to say is

867
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,660
your family

868
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,240
can't live in Yunshui Manor anymore.

869
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,620
Anran is favored by His Majesty

870
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,740
and Princess Fuhui.

871
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,700
His future is limitless.

872
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,660
I don't discriminate

873
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,620
against your job,

874
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,180
but the world is stubborn.

875
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,700
If Anran continues to shelter you,

876
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,060
people might misunderstand,

877
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,120
and it could affect
his career and marriage.

878
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,700
So, that's what this is about.

879
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,420
I actually knew this,

880
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,940
but

881
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,780
we always thought of Mr. Lin

882
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,500
as a member of our family.

883
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,780
Moreover,

884
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,100
the Princess's husband is still alive.

885
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,620
Mr. Lin

886
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,500
can't really...

887
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,580
Knowing that you value Anran,

888
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,320
I dare to speak frankly with you.

889
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,580
We both want what's best for Anran.

890
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,090
But Anran's background is complicated.

891
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,100
Your old ties could become
new leverage at any time.

892
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,610
What I'm saying is

893
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,860
I want to take you away from Yong'an

894
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,420
and settle you somewhere else.

895
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,740
Leave?

896
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,070
Your Highness,

897
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,780
though we are just commoners,

898
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,980
we still have the right to choose.

899
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,580
My diner has just opened;

900
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,260
it's doing really well right now.

901
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,380
The whole Juxian Alley...

902
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,470
Shen, let me explain my plan

903
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,500
before you make a choice.

904
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,140
I'll cover the travel expenses

905
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,300
you need.

906
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,340
You might not understand me well enough.

907
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,980
This is not about money at all.

908
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,860
I am willing to offer 10,000 gold.

909
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,460
How much?

910
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,580
10,000 gold?

911
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,660
To keep you safe.

912
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,960
(Start Near to Go Far)
That's 10,000 gold for the road.

913
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,620
And he promised personally

914
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,100
that once we arrive in Sushui City,

915
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,300
he will build me a big tavern,

916
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,420
buy your mother endless clothes,

917
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,300
build a wedding house for Gongcai,

918
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,180
find a match for him,

919
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,420
and build a school for Yangyang.

920
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,700
Is this for real?

921
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,660
This is my good friend, Prince Zhao,

922
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,820
who told me this himself.

923
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,940
How could it be false?

924
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,040
This is a good deal, Dad.

925
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,880
Good for you.

926
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,740
Sit down. Wait.

927
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,340
This can't be that simple.

928
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,780
A tavern would cost a fortune.

929
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,060
Why would he be so kind to us?

930
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,180
Why don't you understand?

931
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,940
Prince Zhao knows

932
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,100
about our ancestor's background.

933
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,500
He might be the one
who saved our ancestor.

934
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,700
That's right.

935
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,940
The ancestor told me before.

936
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,210
See? I told you.

937
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,980
Wait.

938
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,460
When did the ancestor tell you?

939
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,740
How disrespectful.

940
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,660
Mr. Lin, you said

941
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,820
an elder kept something

942
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,300
from you.

943
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,740
Is he Prince Zhao?

944
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,820
Is he very important to you?

945
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,340
After I escaped death,

946
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,420
Prince Zhao took me in.

947
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,260
He just told me.

948
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,740
Why did he only tell you?

949
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,940
This is not fair.

950
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,910
Don't get off track.

951
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,340
Is this the point?

952
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,580
Prince Zhao and the ancestor

953
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,980
are actually on the same side.

954
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,820
Prince Zhao

955
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,060
is thinking about our ancestor's future,

956
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,740
so he has to get us out of here.

957
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,460
If he's going to get us out,

958
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,660
he has to give us some benefits, right?

959
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,500
Also,

960
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,060
Prince Zhao

961
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,540
has taken a liking to me

962
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,980
and wants to be brothers with me,

963
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,380
so he's being generous.

964
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,780
What's so strange about that?

965
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,780
Right?

966
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,860
It makes sense.

967
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,820
Jicai,

968
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,760
I don't think you need to be so nervous.

969
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,660
We can discuss

970
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,840
whether we should go.

971
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,020
But isn't it always written

972
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,500
like this in novels?

973
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,700
I'll give you five million

974
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,670
for you to leave my son.

975
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,550
Would you agree?

976
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,870
Right?

977
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,430
It's possible that ancient

978
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,000
and modern nobles use the same methods.

979
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,893
That makes sense.

980
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:01,993
That makes sense.

981
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,060
Don't TV shows also portray it this way?

982
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,420
If Prince Zhao introduces
a match for me,

983
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,700
we need to seriously consider it.

984
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,220
Yangyang has been here for so long.

985
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,680
She can't keep missing school.

986
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,440
It's hard to choose a school
in the Capital,

987
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,740
but we can move somewhere else, right?

988
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,180
Let's think about it.

989
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,440
But we need

990
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,830
to consider leaving Yunshui Manor.

991
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,080
The engagement has been broken off.

992
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,870
It's definitely not appropriate

993
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,680
for us to stay like this anymore.

994
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,140
It makes sense.
