1
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,216
<i>Her dad definitely knows something.</i>

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:13,138
<i>The true culprit</i>
<i>of your dad and his colleagues' murder</i>

3
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,432
was Rena and me.

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>I'll destroy what's precious to her.</i>

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,728
<i>Her everything…</i>

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,354
Kokoro.

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,272
Excuse me…

8
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:27,318
have we ever met before?

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,617
I'm sorry, I could be wrong.

10
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,248
Makoto…

11
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,795
Makoto!

12
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,714
I just got home.

13
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,215
I missed you.

14
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,511
Did you introduce yourselves already?

15
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,305
Yeah, but…

16
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,225
I feel like we've met before.

17
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,568
-It's possible!
-Huh?

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,489
Ms. Tachibana used to live
in the area we lived in!

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,784
-Strange coincidence, right?
-Oh, really?

20
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,951
Maybe that's why?

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,831
I'll make your favorite dish,
omelette rice for dinner.

22
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,833
Really? Lucky me!

23
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,711
I should get going, so…

24
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,130
Ms. Tachibana.

25
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,591
If you're not pressed for time,

26
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,010
why don't you stay for dinner?

27
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,222
No, I don't want to trouble you.

28
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,973
I'll head out.

29
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,853
No trouble at all.

30
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,149
It's the least we can do
to say thanks. Please?

31
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,113
Hey, Makoto. About my next tour…

32
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,990
I might be away from home
for about a week.

33
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,575
-A week?
-Yeah…

34
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,245
It's a bigger tour this time.

35
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,916
But I just know I'll miss Kokoro so much!

36
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,129
Kokoro, don't forget your mommy's face!

37
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,506
You'll remember me, right?

38
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,968
-Let's eat!
-Yes!

39
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,719
Hey, Mom.

40
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,721
-Can I have some of your eggs?
-No!

41
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,682
That's the best part!

42
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,268
So stingy!

43
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,854
Oh, can you get my suitcase out later?

44
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,357
-You're staking out again this weekend?
-Yeah.

45
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,984
So I'll just need…

46
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,653
two pairs of underwear.

47
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,573
Hey, we're eating! Don't be disgusting!

48
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:41,077
-How is it disgusting?
-It is! You're talking about underwear!

49
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,914
-I'm taking clean ones, obviously!
-That's not the point!

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,918
Do you not like the food?

51
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,173
My apologies, it's nothing!

52
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,387
I drew the face with ketchup.

53
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,514
Sorry, I messed it up a bit.

54
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,480
This is so tasty!

55
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,386
You do understand what'll happen
if you act suspiciously?

56
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,429
I understand.

57
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,437
<i>Tell me how you did it in detail.</i>

58
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,193
<i>I stabbed him like this…</i>

59
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,779
<i>and turned it clockwise.</i>

60
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,073
<i>I felt his rib cage,</i>

61
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,825
<i>and some flesh got gouged out</i>
<i>because of it.</i>

62
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,579
<i>And you never felt</i>
<i>the sense of guilt doing that?</i>

63
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,581
<i>No.</i>

64
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,708
<i>But so much blood splashed on me</i>

65
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,045
<i>so I did think it'd be a pain</i>
<i>to clean it off.</i>

66
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,382
<i>What are you normally supposed to feel?</i>

67
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,136
<i>Oh, and then Sawako's dad turned up!</i>

68
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,057
<i>I thought to myself, "This is lucky!</i>
<i>He can take the blame!"</i>

69
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,351
<i>"People will think it was a suicide!"</i>

70
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,729
<i>So I kicked him hard like this…</i>

71
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,150
<i>Despicable.</i>

72
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,404
I have enough evidence

73
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,032
to report her to the police now.

74
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:44,867
But…

75
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,413
she needs to suffer

76
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,042
and feel the pain
of failing to protect her loved ones.

77
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,963
I'll put her through hell.

78
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,467
<i>Her photo shoot for</i>
<i>With Botanical is tomorrow.</i>

79
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,596
<i>Perfect timing to post that video</i>
<i>on social media.</i>

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,681
<i>Let's do it.</i>

81
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,351
Once it blows up,

82
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,771
she won't be home much
while she tries to resolve it.

83
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,399
That is when…

84
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,528
I will kill the baby.

85
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,454
-Look this way!
-So pretty!

86
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,706
Looking great, girls!

87
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,666
-Beautiful!
-Okay, now look cool.

88
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,585
Don't smile too much this time!

89
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,836
Okay, get closer!

90
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,087
That looks good!

91
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,256
Wow, guys!

92
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,509
We did talk about
doing a photo shoot together someday,

93
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,386
but I can't believe we did it!

94
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,930
Right? It's thanks to you, Rena!

95
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,600
You all looked stunning, look!

96
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,653
Are you okay?

97
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,542
What's his problem?

98
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,129
It's okay. It doesn't bother me.

99
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,174
You're so nice, Rena!

100
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,301
-You're too nice!
-Wow!

101
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,845
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

102
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,305
We'll check.

103
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,610
KOMI
IT'S POSTED.

104
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,353
I can do this.

105
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,564
I can do this.

106
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,512
Hello?

107
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,639
Hello, Ms. Tachibana.

108
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,058
Is Kokoro okay?

109
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,270
I couldn't see well through the camera

110
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,771
so I got a bit worried.

111
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,773
Yes, she's fine.

112
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,819
I moved your plant, it must have
gotten in the way of the camera.

113
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,323
Sorry, I didn't realize. I'll move it now.

114
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,498
Rena! Something's happened
on social media!

115
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,543
Huh?

116
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,628
SHE'S A FRAUD

117
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,631
Someone was secretly filming us!

118
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,049
Look at this!

119
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,386
<i>You won't use With Botanical products?</i>

120
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,057
<i>They say it's all-natural and organic,</i>

121
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,311
<i>but I heard that there are</i>
<i>some chemical substances in it.</i>

122
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,229
What?

123
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,023
Well, I guess that's the reality of it.

124
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,399
That's true.

125
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,777
But personally,

126
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,531
I don't want to use anything
I can't fully trust.

127
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,699
Shall I cancel the contract?

128
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,162
They never informed us,
so it's not our responsibility.

129
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,581
I would never use it though.

130
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,292
-I'm too afraid to use it.
-Okay.

131
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,587
But please, in order to avoid controversy,

132
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,089
don't tell anyone!

133
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,841
Excuse me.

134
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,303
Who did this?

135
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,805
No idea.

136
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,849
But this was filmed
at our usual cafe six months ago.

137
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,061
What shall we do?
There are so many comments!

138
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,355
And it's increasing by the second!

139
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,483
The damage's severe.

140
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,860
Several gigs have already been canceled

141
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,737
and there might even be a lawsuit.

142
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,408
I feel so useless. I'm really sorry.

143
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,035
Who the hell did this?

144
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,499
When the video was taken, Julia,
Tomomi, Fuka, and Yuko were there.

145
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,503
I hate to doubt them,
but it was shot pretty up close.

146
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,131
So it could be one of them.

147
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,717
Makoto…

148
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:00,141
I will be taking my leave for today.

149
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,944
She looked distraught.

150
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,448
<i>Worth the effort, then.</i>

151
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,327
We followed her constantly for months.

152
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,499
Okay. But please,
in order to avoid controversy,

153
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,084
don't tell anyone!

154
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,920
Excuse me.

155
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,383
<i>Just as planned,</i>

156
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,845
<i>she'll be busy with the lawsuit</i>
<i>and the manhunt.</i>

157
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,804
<i>Can you do it?</i>

158
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,768
Of course.

159
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,519
Although…

160
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,439
the security camera is an issue.

161
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,858
<i>You can hack the camera screen.</i>

162
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,984
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

163
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,537
I'M SORRY TO HAVE CAUSED YOU ALL
SO MUCH TROUBLE

164
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,957
JULIA
LET'S FIND THE CULPRIT!

165
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,542
I won't take it.

166
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,545
TOMOMI
WHO COULD IT BE?!

167
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,963
Wow!

168
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,634
FUKA
IT WASN'T ME!

169
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,676
They don't talk much.

170
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,536
I feel so much better now!

171
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,788
Oops.

172
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,791
Good morning.

173
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,335
It was us three, Yuko,

174
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,088
and Yuki who were there.

175
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,049
Was there anybody else?

176
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,636
Who the hell was it?
I'll never forgive them

177
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,515
Listen…

178
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,602
it doesn't matter
if we never find the culprit.

179
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,396
I don't care.

180
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,398
What I care about…

181
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,986
is losing my best friends…

182
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,488
That would hurt the most.

183
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,323
Rena…

184
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,784
And Yuki…

185
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,287
this wasn't your fault.

186
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,999
It was all my fault, which is why…

187
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,421
I want to live-stream
an apology video now.

188
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,174
But, let's verify the facts before…

189
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,258
No! It's okay!

190
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,094
I will take all the blame.

191
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,013
I just want…

192
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,350
to apologize to everyone who supports me.

193
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,146
Sincerely, with my own words!

194
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,691
Rena, you're amazing.

195
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,485
-I'm proud of you!
-Well said!

196
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,117
In order to avoid controversy,
don't tell anyone!

197
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,037
Excuse me.

198
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,555
I'll just kill her. Problem solved!

199
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,731
<i>I truly regret</i>

200
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,776
<i>the trouble and confusion</i>

201
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,112
<i>that my inappropriate comment has caused.</i>

202
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,699
<i>Please accept my sincere apology.</i>

203
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,327
ABOUT RECENT EVENTS

204
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,495
<i>Six months ago…</i>

205
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,082
<i>I became a brand ambassador</i>
<i>for With Botanical.</i>

206
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,628
<i>And I heard a rumor</i>
<i>that some of their products</i>

207
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,129
<i>contained chemicals.</i>

208
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,258
<i>I blindly… believed it.</i>

209
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,385
WELL DONE ON THE QUICK RESPONSE
WE LOVE YOU RENA

210
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,428
<i>And told my manager.</i>

211
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:12,351
<i>However when I fact-checked afterward,</i>

212
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,148
<i>I found out that all products</i>
<i>were chemical-free.</i>

213
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,278
<i>-And because of that…</i>
-She's done it again.

214
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,738
<i>…I now use With Botanical.</i>

215
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,408
<i>Also…</i>

216
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,911
That was nerve-racking.

217
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,079
You did it!

218
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,999
-Well done!
-You must be exhausted!

219
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,960
I almost cried watching you tear up!

220
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,379
Oh, god…

221
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,965
I couldn't have done it without you.

222
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,300
Thank you so much!

223
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,176
Rena!

224
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,554
With Botanical accepted the apology

225
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,390
and said they want to discuss
contract renewal!

226
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,267
Let's go now!

227
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,518
-Really?
-Yes!

228
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,312
I'm so glad.

229
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,355
-Thank god!
-I'm so happy for you!

230
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,565
You need to go now!

231
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,026
We'll post a video to show support.

232
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,194
We've got your back, Rena!

233
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,154
You truly are…

234
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,906
my dearest friends.

235
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,699
Of course we are!

236
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,492
You are the best friend!

237
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,041
-We can never be apart!
-Never!

238
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,796
Sorry, Ms. Tachibana.

239
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,507
Can I ask you to stay longer today?

240
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,928
No problem at all! I'm free all day.

241
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,220
Thank you.

242
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,473
See you later!

243
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,189
Dearest friends? Such bullshit.

244
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,828
I won't forgive her.

245
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,497
We're so sorry about this!

246
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,957
-Not at all!
-It's okay!

247
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,459
We'd love to collaborate with you again.

248
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,919
-For sure!
-Thank you!

249
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,172
We're planning to announce
a new product next summer.

250
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,508
-So…
-A photoshoot on a beach perhaps?

251
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,842
-Oh, perfect!
-Right?

252
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,338
I'm so sorry.

253
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,384
Don't you ever…

254
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,762
forgive me for this, okay?

255
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,640
I am really…

256
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,144
really sorry.

257
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,922
I can't do it.

258
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,219
Damn it!

259
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,056
How frustrating!

260
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,768
So frustrating!

261
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,111
How can I…

262
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,618
How will I ever take revenge?

263
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,549
I'm so glad things got sorted.

264
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,969
I feel relieved
now that I've seen your face.

265
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,931
Makoto.

266
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,974
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

267
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,354
Hey, what time will you be back today?

268
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,315
I can make dinner!

269
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,151
Give me a second.

270
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,696
Hello?

271
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,324
I'm making it now.

272
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,787
Okay, no problem.

273
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,747
I'll make the changes now. Okay.

274
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,625
I'm sorry…

275
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,837
I'm swamped due to this bulk order.

276
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,089
Eat dinner without me, okay?

277
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,049
Okay.

278
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,093
What a shame…

279
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,563
You're being so loud. Shut up.

280
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,691
Shut up.

281
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,776
Shut up!

282
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,362
Shut up!

283
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,698
Shut the hell up!

284
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,325
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

285
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,945
<i>I need to find another weakness of hers.</i>

286
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,948
<i>I'll show her what true hell is like.</i>

287
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,950
<i>I've reached my limit.</i>

288
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,452
<i>Kokoro's dead.</i>

289
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,912
