1
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,798
(Piano sounds)

2
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,553
(Tachibana Sachiko) Rena

3
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,807
(Hanai Makoto) Kokoro

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,185
Are you okay?

5
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,732
(Hanai Reina)

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,234
Why is there Sawako-san even there?

7
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:30,196
(Sachiko) Why is Rena in such a place?

8
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,782
Here...

9
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,917
Because here

10
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,339
We were united

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,426
Happy

12
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,139
Because it's a place of memories

13
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,477
hey? Myth

14
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:09,569
(Piano sounds)

15
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,907
(Makoto) Reina

16
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,243
Reina will also go to class gatherings after this, right?

17
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,204
I have to go soon

18
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,789
let's go

19
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,171
I like Makoto

20
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:35,261
For me it's so sure

21
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,099
There are no vivid emotions

22
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,149
I…

23
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,529
I want to be Makoto's most important person

24
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,461
I believed

25
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,299
If you're a true person, you'll definitely remember this place

26
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,261
He'll search for me

27
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,854
(Makoto) I knew about this account

28
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:32,694
I found this place because I saw the post.

29
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,363
A lie...

30
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,452
Did everything get discovered?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,711
(Sachiko) Give up now and turn yourself in

32
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,464
Reina

33
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,924
(Reina) That's weird

34
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,636
Why is your senior?

35
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,099
Are you so hostile to me?

36
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,268
picture?

37
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,897
(Reina) Please remember, Senpai

38
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:15,236
The two spent intimate time together

39
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,911
Our dazzling days

40
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,333
(Piano performance)

41
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,221
(Reina) Senior Yukikazuko

42
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,016
Do you remember this song?

43
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,239
The first

44
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,994
Honestly, I approached for just monitoring purposes.

45
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:11,501
But gradually I started to worry about my seniors

46
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,712
Trust me about the old man

47
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,631
(Bando Koukako) Thank you

48
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,801
(Reina) The more we spend together, the more

49
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,513
It's more fun than I thought

50
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,894
I really wanted this time not to end

51
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,860
A senior whom I admired like a sister

52
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,490
To do something like that

53
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,163
Of course it's called a monster

54
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,250
Reina...

55
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,627
Even if it's irreversible

56
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,922
Even if there's no way it's allowed

57
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,967
I know well

58
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,558
but

59
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,145
I just wanted to tell you this

60
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,857
Senior Kowako

61
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,027
I'm really sorry

62
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,329
(Makoto) It's no use trying to deceive it with a makeshift apology.

63
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,956
Honestly, what are you talking about?

64
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,500
-(Reina) I sincerely... -(Makoto) I was playing Reina when I was playing

65
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,794
Do you think I don't know?

66
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,801
on second thoughts

67
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,346
I don't want to say it myself

68
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,519
Senior Yukikazuko

69
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,855
Dad's incident

70
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,487
That's Reina

71
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,074
It was to hide the fact that I killed my mother, right?

72
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,409
(Reina) Lie, lie, lie, lie

73
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,078
(Makoto) I knew everything

74
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,287
It's a lie

75
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,502
(Makoto) Senior's father

76
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,715
I was reporting on my mother's incident with a colleague.

77
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,175
Dad...

78
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,305
One day, Reina realized this

79
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,892
No matter what happens, I don't want to find out the truth behind the incident.

80
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,438
So my colleagues and

81
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,359
Even Kouwako's dad...

82
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:48,116
My senior and my family were just caught up in it.

83
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,498
What's wrong with that?

84
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,458
(Makoto) Reina...

85
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,920
(Reina) But in order to stay by Makoto forever

86
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,923
I had no choice but to kill my uncle.

87
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,177
Even if I'm in the same situation, I'll do the same thing

88
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,100
That's right

89
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,480
I couldn't help but want to torment

90
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:25,570
The senior who tried to take away my sincerity from me

91
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,199
So when I killed that piano instructor

92
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,119
I remembered my senior

93
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,123
I thought I was lucky again

94
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,916
correct answer

95
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,545
Spare parent and child feel the best

96
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,631
- (Makoto) Senior Yukikazu! -(Reina) Don't stop

97
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,645
(Reina) Hehehe

98
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,526
There's no way a senior can kill someone

99
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,945
senior

100
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,324
If you don't want to kill me

101
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,534
Will it disappear quickly?

102
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,205
If there's no senior

103
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,627
Me and my heart and heart

104
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,339
I think I'll be happy

105
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,511
What's it stuck

106
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,571
Makoto!

107
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,406
Sincerity?

108
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,658
Sincere! Sincere!

109
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,909
Sincere! Sincere!

110
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,909
(Sachiko) Ambulance...

111
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,161
(Makoto) Senpai...

112
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,330
it's okay

113
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,793
Now finally

114
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,006
It's over

115
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,966
(Reina) What are you talking about?

116
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,092
It's no good

117
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:53,676
(Reina's cry)

118
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,802
(Reina's cry)

119
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,802
(Makoto) Reina

120
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,679
(Reina's cry)

121
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,014
(Reina's cry)

122
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,014
sorry

123
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,099
Me

124
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,520
From the beginning

125
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,274
Because I've forgiven everything

126
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:12,069
(Reina) Hey, why are you saying something like that last thing?

127
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,905
I don't like that

128
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:20,244
I... I'll never die

129
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,203
(Makoto) Ugh...

130
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,623
Sincerely...

131
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,250
Are you okay

132
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,461
I'll do something

133
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,381
I don't like it, sincere...

134
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,300
Reina is

135
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,928
It's surely okay

136
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,725
You can cry for me

137
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,229
For others too

138
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,234
I'll be able to cry

139
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,161
Just one...

140
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,625
I ask for your heart

141
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,834
Hey, it's fine now

142
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,503
Don't talk about anything anymore

143
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,521
(Makoto) Reina

144
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,733
i love you

145
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,664
Sincerity... Sincerity!

146
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,165
Makoto: I don't like it!

147
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,751
I don't like it, Makoto I don't!

148
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,129
I don't like it, Makoto!

149
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,172
Sincere!

150
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,966
Noooo!

151
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,566
Why don't you kill him?

152
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,654
(Sachiko) Me

153
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,117
I don't forgive Reina at all

154
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,452
I can't forgive

155
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,121
I

156
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,209
I lost everything because of Reina

157
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,920
family

158
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,756
Life as Bando Kokako

159
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,886
And even the desire to be happy

160
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:48,517
Revenge is the only thing that becomes my raison d'és

161
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,688
Change your name and face all

162
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,941
I've been following Reina

163
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,029
Now that Makoto has passed away

164
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,949
Reina is definitely

165
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,536
I'll experience living hell

166
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:13,209
I succeeded in revenge...

167
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,379
It should have been a success

168
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,090
I still can't get too close to my heart

169
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,479
Live

170
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,283
I'm Reina

171
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,203
Until the day is completely forgiven

172
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,415
Live atonement for your sins

173
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,506
Prove that someday monsters can become moms too

174
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:08,222
Makoto... I'm sure he wants that

175
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,359
Believe in that future

176
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,782
I'll keep my heart

177
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,496
Sincerely...

178
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,554
Makoto and...

179
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,726
The ears look exactly like

180
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,483
I see, that's right

181
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,571
Because the heart is

182
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,617
Me and Makoto...

183
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:16,415
(Reina's cry)

184
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:20,502
♪～

185
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,534
(Juria) Are you going?

186
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,915
Yeah

187
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,792
(Sachiko and Kiria) Se-no

188
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,255
(Sachiko) It's over

189
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,300
(Juria) It's over

190
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,179
(Sachiko) Our revenge

191
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,181
It's not a success, is it?

192
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,100
(Juria) Hmm...

193
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,810
Well, but

194
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,896
I don't think it's a complete failure either

195
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,482
I've had some really meaningful discoveries

196
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,650
what?

197
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,278
Sachiko is not suited to revenge

198
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,697
a…

199
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,031
(Juria) Hehehe

200
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,957
oh dear

201
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,626
Be happy

202
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,797
I'm still happy now

203
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,266
Comi What is your email address?

204
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,101
Isn't that good?

205
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,653
Comic is happy too

206
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,870
(Iida Yuki) If you're careful of murderers

207
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,956
Everyone is worried that they might get killed

208
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,501
From the mouth of the only former manager of a murderer in the world

209
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,919
From the mouth of the only former manager of a murderer in the world

210
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,919
(Tomomi) This guy is really strong

211
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,003
(Tomomi) This guy is really strong

212
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:26,712
(Tomomi) This guy is really strong

213
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:26,712
I'll make it clear

214
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:26,795
I'll make it clear

215
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,588
I'll make it clear

216
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,588
(Fuuka) is also a huge hit with 1.35 million views?

217
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:27,671
(Fuuka) is also a huge hit with 1.35 million views?

218
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,672
(Fuuka) is also a huge hit with 1.35 million views?

219
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,672
Answer is non

220
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:28,756
(Fuuka) is also a huge hit with 1.35 million views?

221
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,466
(Fuuka) is also a huge hit with 1.35 million views?

222
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,466
Actually, T&B

223
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:30,549
Actually, T&B

224
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,966
Actually, T&B

225
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,966
(Yuko) Because this is completely selling her soul

226
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:31,425
(Yuko) Because this is completely selling her soul

227
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,593
(Yuko) Because this is completely selling her soul

228
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,593
In the end, timing and balance

229
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:32,676
(Yuko) Because this is completely selling her soul

230
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,635
(Yuko) Because this is completely selling her soul

231
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,635
It's everything

232
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,971
Timing & Balance

233
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,557
Ｔ＆Ｂ Ｔ＆Ｂ Ｔ＆Ｂ

234
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,602
Here's a sample of what you love

235
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,771
One day she says this

236
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,730
See

237
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,648
I am currently the ambassador

238
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,192
There's cosmetics

239
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,276
I haven't used it at all...

240
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,534
(Kokoro) Satchy, flowers!

241
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,745
(Sachiko)

242
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,956
You have to keep quiet here

243
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,041
Do you understand?

244
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,501
(Kokoro) I understand

245
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,553
(Sachiko) That's right here

246
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,931
Why not show it to your dad?

247
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,015
Yeah

248
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,602
Daddy, it's heart

249
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,397
I drew a picture of my heart with my dad and mom

250
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,317
You did a great job

251
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,953
～♪

252
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,757
(Sachiko) Why are you stepping on the ground?

253
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,468
Because it's interesting

254
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,013
(Sachiko) But insects are dead

255
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,641
It's fine, even if I die

256
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,108
(Sachiko) Why does Kokoro think that way?

257
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,694
Hmm, I don't know

258
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,821
I see

259
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,906
So here it is

260
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,827
Let's go home and think about it together

261
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,370
Yeah?

262
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,749
Why is the insect trying so hard to live?

263
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,210
What will happen if you die?

264
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,420
Yeah
