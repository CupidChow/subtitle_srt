00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,632
Hello. I'm Sachiko Tachibana.

2
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,134
<i>Guess who did this?</i>

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>You, Sawako! This looks so familiar!</i>

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:16,725
You are annoyingly like your dad!

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,893
<i>I have to be sure.</i>

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,772
Because my husband
and Kokoro are my everything.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,526
<i>From the height of happiness</i>
<i>to making life hell for her.</i>

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,279
An unimaginable living hell.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,533
<i>Call me if anything happens.</i>

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,909
Kokoro.

11
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,371
Mommy's leaving. Be a good girl, okay?

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,584
See you later.

13
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,171
We'll be waiting.

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,929
<i>Did you see what I sent?</i>

15
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,347
Yeah…

16

JOURNALIST KILLS COLLEAGUE

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,730
The day my dad was murdered…

18
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,943
Mr. Kurokawa canceled his seminar.

19
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,990
And the day Mr. Komiyama was killed…

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,119
it was also canceled.

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,539
<i>Her dad definitely knows something.</i>

22
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,876
<i>Gain as much information and proof</i>
<i>from him as possible.</i>

23
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,794
Okay.

24
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,088
He still has an office in that house.

25
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,757
I'll start there.

26
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:35,553
<i>Multiple mysterious deaths</i>
<i>have been reported in her area lately.</i>

27
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,143
<i>She's still a monster no doubt.</i>

28
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,730
<i>Don't let your guard down</i>
<i>or she'll kill you.</i>

29
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,608
I'm not backing down now.

30
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,778
She deserves to rot in hell.

31
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,342
We finally found a suitable babysitter!

32
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,761
Finally! It took a while!

33
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,597
But you've only met her twice, right?

34
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,474
I wouldn't trust her just yet.

35
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,600
Do you think so?

36
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,105
But she's been amazing
and seems so trustworthy…

37
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,357
You're too naive, Rena!

38
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,025
Haven't you heard?

39
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,987
Incidents involving dodgy sitters
are increasing.

40
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,864
She's right, you know.

41
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,283
The first month I hired a sitter,

42
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,786
I asked for help only when
I was working from home.

43
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,289
She's a stranger in your house.

44
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,499
You should be more careful, Rena.

45
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,462
As Rena's manager,
I have to say I feel relieved!

46
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,132
We have five minutes. Let's get ready.

47
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,300
Okay!

48
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,220
Annoying.

49
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,973
Okay!

50
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,184
I have an announcement to make!

51
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,104
You do? What is it, Yuko?

52
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,608
<i>Well, the watches that I've designed…</i>

53
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,278
<i>will be on sale from today!</i>

54
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,362
<i>That's amazing!</i>

55
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,822
<i>Congratulations, Yuko!</i>

56
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,199
<i>Is that the watch?</i>

57
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,659
<i>Yes, it is!</i>

58
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,703
They're available in three colors

59
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,747
and this is the salmon pink one!

60
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,124
It's so cute!

61
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,293
I think this color suits Rena well!

62
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,837
<i>-Here, try it on!</i>
<i>-Are you sure?</i>

63
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,215
<i>-Of course!</i>
<i>-This is exciting!</i>

64
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,426
You can choose
from white, sky blue, and pink.

65
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,554
-But pink is definitely your color!
-How cute.

66
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,725
Everyone, I'll post the product details
after this on our page,

67
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,727
<i>so make sure to check it out!</i>

68
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,939
The number of comments just increased!

69
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,484
"I want the same watch Rena's wearing!'"

70
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,945
"That pink looks so cute!"

73
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,744
<i>Wow, can you believe this?</i>

74
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,412
<i>-This is amazing!</i>
<i>-Amazing!</i>

75
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,748
<i>The viewers are increasing too!</i>

76
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,250
<i>-Oh, you're right!</i>
<i>-Wow!</i>

77
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,336
<i>You look good in anything, Rena!</i>

ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY

80
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,231
Hey, Yuko.

81
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,694
About that watch, was it--

82
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm sorry, Rena!

83
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,991
I asked one of the companies you work with
to be the manufacturer.

84
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,077
I thought so!

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,705
I only asked them for advice at first,

86
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,833
but it all just sort of happened.

87
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,753
Wait… Are you mad?

88
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,131
Not at all!

89
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,592
Thank you! I'm glad.

90
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,361
Who are you?

91
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,410
I'm sorry, Ms. Tachibana.

92
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,622
I totally forgot to tell you
that my dad was coming today!

93
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,166
Sorry to startle you!

94
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,544
No, I apologize for being in your office.

95
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:41,716
I couldn't find some of the baby goods
so I was looking in all the rooms.

96
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,384
Oh, are you sleepy?

97
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,013
Let me introduce him properly.
Ms. Tachibana, this is my dad.

98
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:54,228
We used to live here just the two of us
after my mom passed away.

99
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,400
So he sometimes comes over
to get some stuff and to see Kokoro.

100
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:00,902
There, there…

101
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,699
It's easy to lie on your resume.

102
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,536
Even if she is a babysitter,
she's still a stranger.

103
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,873
-Be a bit more cautious…
-Looks like it's too late…

104
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,711
-Makoto's going to be sad again.
-Are you listening?

105
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,629
Dad…

106
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,091
can you get that?

107
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,938
You worry too much.

108
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,066
If she becomes an inconvenience,

109
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,901
we can cut her loose.

110
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,449
In terms of Ms. Tachibana,

111
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,035
I already have a plan.

112
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,955
More importantly, Dad,

113
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,290
I need your help.

114
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,012
Ms. Tachibana! I'm sorry…

115
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,431
This is sudden,

116
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,225
but we decided to set up
a security camera.

117
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,310
-Just in case.
-Yes.

118
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:21,649
It's just a precautionary method
for our own safety.

119
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,529
Is that okay with you, Ms. Tachibana?

120
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,075
No problem at all.

121
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,413
It makes sense for you to worry
about a complete stranger

122
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,748
looking after your precious baby.

123
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,258
Her dad doesn't seem to trust me.

124
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,970
<i>How was the office? Any clues?</i>

125
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:56,142
No, only books and papers
on criminal psychology and sociology.

126
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,564
I need to change my strategy.

127
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,693
I'm glad they're selling well!

128
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,362
Oh no, please!

129
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,990
It was all thanks to you!

130
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,992
What?

131
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,410
A meeting?

132
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,371
Where?

133
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,000
I am a housewife, you know?

134
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,962
If I keep going home late,
I'll get in trouble with my husband!

135
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,769
<i>What? She was in an accident?</i>

136
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,479
Yes…

137
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,274
I'll come and see her
as soon as she's conscious!

138
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,195
Stay positive, okay?

139
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,864
Goodbye.

140
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,828
Aw man…

141
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,166
What a shame! She's not dead!

142
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,210
Oh, well…

143
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,295
Dad.

144
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,714
Thanks for the car!

145
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,513
Who's that? She's gorgeous!

146
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,558
Wow, she's pretty…

147
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,109
Thanks. I'll be over here.

148
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,905
Thank you.

149
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,824

-Professor.
-Yes?

157
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,843
I want to ask for your help

158
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,513
with something I'm struggling
to understand.

159
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,977

SHE SAYS SHE WANTED TO SEE
A PERSON GET RUN OVER BY A TRAIN

163
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,076
You…

164
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,955
Do you think you can get away with
doing something like this?!

165
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,668
Professor Kurokawa…

166
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,088
do you know what it smells like

167
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,384
when a person gets burnt alive?

168
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,594
What?

169
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,806
The truth is

170
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,853
it doesn't smell that different
from meat or fish being cooked.

171
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,231
That's why Rena…

172
00:12:55,441 --> 00:13:00,529
didn't feel any guilt
when she left me to die in that fire.

173
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,574
-Are you--
-But…

174
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,453
I wasn't just a piece of meat.

175
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,788
I was alive.

176
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,208
I had a life.

177
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,962
Sawako Bando…

178
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,925
A high schooler aspiring to be a pianist.

179
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,345
Sadly, she didn't have many friends.

180
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,432
She loved summer vegetable curry

00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,476
and hated gym class.

182
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,522
Her favorite thing was

183
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,317
playing board games with her parents.

184
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,947
She dreamed that…

185
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,327
one day, she'd be a mother
just like her mom.

186
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,915
Just a normal girl…

187
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,711
Are you really…

188
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,631
Sawako Bando?

189
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,760
Why are you doing this?

190
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,262
I need you to admit…

191
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,891
that your daughter, Rena Hanai

192
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:16,021
is the one who murdered my father
and his colleague.

193
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,732
Don't be absurd.

194
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,611
Hey! Stop that!

195
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,989
Stop it!

196
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,917
Don't do this! Please!

197
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,545
Do you admit it or not?

198
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,217
Fine!

199
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,761
I'll talk! Just don't kill me!

200
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,436
It was Rena…

201
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,608
Rena killed your father and his colleague!

202
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,653
And you, Professor Kurokawa?

203
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,283
I…

204
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,620
helped her.

205
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,372
And her motive?

206
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,335
Why did she kill them?

207
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,217
I honestly don't know!

208
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,512
I want to know why, too!

209
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,390
I did what I could purely for her.

210
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,392
You wouldn't understand…

211
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,481
what I had to go through!

212
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,323
I'm done…

213
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,952
This couldn't go on.

214
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,705
I'm actually relieved.

215
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,375
Thanks to you…

216
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,254
I'll finally be free from her.

217
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,926
Just… kill me.

218
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,598
You're not the victim here!

219
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,601
Aren't you forgetting something?

220
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,438
You are her parent and her accomplice!

221
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,066
"Kill me"?

222
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,405
Your dying doesn't pay for your sins!
Not even close!

223
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,157
You'll never know…

224
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,536
what I had to go through

225
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,331
to stay alive after that!

226
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,839
Ms. Bando…

227
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,717
can you see me?

228
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,888
<i>When I regained consciousness,</i>

229
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,599
<i>I wished I was dead.</i>

230
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,645
<i>The excruciating pain and grief.</i>

231
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,149
<i>My dad was murdered.</i>

232
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,734
<i>My best friend's betrayal.</i>

233
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,736
<i>Being called a murderer.</i>

234
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,571
<i>And on top of that,</i>

235
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,740
<i>my mom's suicide.</i>

236
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,741
TO SAWAKO

237
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,536
I will never forgive you.

238
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,622
I will do anything

239
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,960
to make Rena's life hell for her.

240
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,216
<i>The girl who is thought to be the suspect</i>
<i>of the murder incident</i>

241
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,636
<i>at Misaki Gakuen High School</i>
<i>has run away from the hospital</i>

242
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,182
<i>and it now appears</i>
<i>that she has killed herself.</i>

243
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,224
SUICIDE

244
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,684
<i>It was two days ago…</i>

245
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,686
<i>After I faked my death…</i>

246
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,979
Look to the right.

247
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,232
<i>…I had reconstructive surgery</i>
<i>and changed my name.</i>

248
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,276
I lived through hell…

249
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,405
just to get to this moment.

250
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,744
To confront

251
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,081
you and Rena.

252
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,265
<i>The true culprit</i>

253
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:25,062
<i>of your dad and his colleagues' murder</i>

254
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,773
was Rena…

255
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,775
and me.

256
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,362
I don't know the motive.

257
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,828
<i>Dad, Mom,</i>

258
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,747
<i>I got all the evidence I needed.</i>

259
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:45,999
<i>But…</i>

260
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,502
<i>I won't report it yet.</i>

261
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,922
<i>My revenge has only just begun.</i>

262
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,761
<i>I'll destroy what's precious to her.</i>

263
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,389
<i>Her everything…</i>

264
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,684
Kokoro.

265
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,076
Are you Ms. Tachibana?

266
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,996
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rena's husband, Makoto.

267
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,498
Nice to meet you!

268
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,128
I was just about to leave, so goodbye.

269
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,718
Excuse me…

270
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,267
have we ever met before?

271
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,027
<i>I can do this.</i>

272
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,820
Rena! Something's happened!

273
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,405
<i>How did this happen?</i>

274
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,949
<i>She's unstoppable…</i>

275
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,493
<i>Don't you ever forgive me for this, okay?</i>

276
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,953
