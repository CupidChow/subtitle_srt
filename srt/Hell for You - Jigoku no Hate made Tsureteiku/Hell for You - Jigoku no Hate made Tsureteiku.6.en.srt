1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,924
(Tachibana Sachiko) and Rena's true nature, but why they stay together...

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,342
(Como) You are Sawako

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,928
If Reina reveals that she was nearly killed and killed

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,889
Hanai Makoto might, of course, push him away

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,934
(Hanai Reina) Maybe my daddy got caught in it

6
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,814
(Everyone) ♪ Happy Birthday to You

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,357
(Hanai Makoto) That's a great success

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,359
It's all thanks to Tachibana-san

9
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,069
(Sachiko) No

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,160
(Reina) Juria

11
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,412
I brought the cake

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,264
I have a request

13
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,266
(Kurokawa Minoru) What is it?

14
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,896
What you know about Makoto

15
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,731
Please tell me everything

16
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,484
Makoto?

17
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:13,198
Makoto was a childhood friend of Reina, right?

18
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,534
Since when did those two get along well?

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,252
When Reina was 10 years old

20
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,339
Makoto moved to the neighborhood

21
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:33,343
From there, the two must have been close.

22
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,428
after a while

23
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,140
Makoto's mother has passed away

24
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,518
(Sachiko) So?

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,939
The perpetrator has not been caught yet

26
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,567
From that incident, Reina is Makoto...

27
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,277
Please wait

28
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,779
The perpetrator...

29
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,907
Does that mean Makoto's mother was murderous?

30
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,496
That's all I know

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,705
Excuse me

32
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,876
(Door opening and closing sound)

33
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,880
(Reina) It's been a while

34
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,302
I wanted to meet

35
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,724
father

36
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,727
Have you been aloof lately?

37
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,645
(Minoru) So...

38
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,482
(Coughing voice)

39
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,734
(Minoru) That's not the case

40
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,069
That's right

41
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:38,533
It's absolutely impossible for your dad to avoid me

42
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,327
That's right, don't say anything weird

43
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,874
(Reina) Dad

44
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,673
Give me one cigarette

45
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,633
yeah?

46
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,012
Did you smoke?

47
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,077
father

48
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,791
Ahhhh...

49
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,043
Ahhh...

50
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,878
We are family

51
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,675
No matter what, Dad won't let go of me

52
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,222
No, you shouldn't let go

53
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,306
Because

54
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,851
It was the father who gave birth to the monsters

55
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,942
Who is the bachelor?

56
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,906
father

57
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,369
I want to know about Tachibana

58
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,163
Can you check it out?

59
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,716
(Comic) Hanai Makoto's mother is murdered

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,760
The culprit has not been caught yet...

61
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,844
(Sachiko) Yes

62
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,266
Apparently he was taken in by his aunt's house, which he lived nearby.

63
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,559
(Comm) Is there something about this?

64
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,063
I will continue to watch this father...

65
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,147
Ah

66
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,565
(Como) What's wrong?

67
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,360
Sorry, the bug...

68
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,320
(Comm) Ah... I was surprised

69
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,780
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

70
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,200
(Makoto) Thank you for your help

71
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:47,120
I look forward to your continued support

72
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,586
- (Sachiko) Good morning - (Makoto) Good morning

73
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,381
Reina leaves a little and I think she'll return soon

74
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,924
I've got it

75
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,634
I'll come

76
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,969
Welcome

77
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,891
(Makoto) Oh yeah, I'm reading it

78
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,312
Trilogy I've recommended this other day

79
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,524
I've been sleep-deprived lately because it's so funny

80
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,944
well

81
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,782
(Reina) Hey, what do you think?

82
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,992
What happened before this

83
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,120
(Juria) Certainly

84
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,331
I think they both thought it was suspicious for a moment.

85
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,666
That's right

86
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,044
Hmm, at times like this

87
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,756
I have to leave my house for a week at a concert

88
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,799
I'm already worried

89
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,926
But I don't think there's anything

90
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,470
picture?

91
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,848
(Juria) Even Makoto-san is really dedicated to Reina.

92
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,893
He was very hard at the surprises too.

93
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,395
That's why the sitter even helped you, right?

94
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,688
yeah…

95
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,525
(Juria) If she's an average husband, she wouldn't do that much.

96
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,860
No, Reina

97
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,404
I was jealous of Makoto's love

98
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,450
I see?

99
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,328
This time it's a big concert, right?

100
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,370
Yeah

101
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,748
I think it's better to focus on that

102
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,500
Hmm, but...

103
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,043
Ah, if you're worried

104
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,836
Why not increase the number of monitoring cameras?

105
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,714
I see

106
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,258
Ah, that's right

107
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,219
I'll help you if something happens too

108
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,347
Thank you Juria

109
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,807
(Juria) It's okay

110
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,143
Thank you, Yuki-kun

111
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,937
(Iida Yuki) No, it's not at all

112
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,854
heart

113
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,482
Mom, I'll do my best

114
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,942
I love you

115
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,490
I'll go then

116
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,534
I'll contact you a lot

117
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,952
Yes, anytime

118
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,161
Do your best

119
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,046
I've gone

120
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,383
(Como) I've been properly gaining Hanai Makoto's trust for the past week

121
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,469
Even if you confess that you're Bando Yukikako

122
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,471
To make you believe

123
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,306
Understood

124
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,105
Oh, are you going back to shopping?

125
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,606
that's right

126
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,733
I passed by nearby

127
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,362
(Myth) Heart

128
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,075
Oh, that's right, today marks the 200th day of heart

129
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,495
Reina has been asking me to give you a photo

130
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,664
I'm not used to that kind of thing

131
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,628
So, when Makoto returns, shall we celebrate together?

132
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,922
Can I ask?

133
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,174
(Sachiko) Yes

134
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,468
(My) Thank you very much

135
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,720
- (Makoto) Heart - (Sachiko) Heart

136
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,345
(Makoto) Kokorokochi This is here

137
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,513
(Makoto) Kokorokochi This is here

138
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,513
(Shutter sound)

139
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:52,597
(Shutter sound)

140
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,348
(Shutter sound)

141
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,348
- (Sachiko) Here we go here - (Makoto) Heart

142
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:54,432
(Shutter sound)

143
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,266
(Shutter sound)

144
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,266
(Sachiko) Here

145
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:55,349
(Shutter sound)

146
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,185
(Shutter sound)

147
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,185
- (Makoto) Like Hahahaha (Sachiko) I laughed, I laughed, I laughed

148
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,146
(Makoto) What do you think?

149
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,231
- (Makoto) Kokoro- (Sachiko) Kokoro-

150
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,774
(Sachiko) I'm watching

151
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,651
- (Makoto) He's laughing, he's laughing- (Sachiko) Ah, he's laughing

152
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,445
-(Myth) It feels good-(Sachiko) It feels good

153
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,169
Kokoro-san, I was tired, so I fell asleep right away

154
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,924
I'm so glad I was able to take a picture like this today

155
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,592
thank you

156
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,177
I have to send it to Reina too

157
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,015
-(Sachiko) So I'm here... -(Makoto) Ah...

158
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,185
that

159
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:43,814
Dinner I also made Tachibana-san's dinner.

160
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,942
Would you like to eat it if you like?

161
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,487
Well, it's omelet rice again

162
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,700
I'll enjoy having this

163
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,328
I'll enjoy having this

164
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,091
Hmm...Did you like omelet rice?

165
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,175
Huh?

166
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,718
Ah sorry

167
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,097
I've been eating it a lot the other day so I guess I really like it

168
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,266
Ah... not

169
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,101
I love omelet rice

170
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,687
It was also very tasty during this time

171
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,835
(Makoto) No, you're not cheating at all

172
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,545
a…

173
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,384
I…

174
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,304
I'm not good at eating

175
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,056
weak point?

176
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,350
It's painful

177
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,313
When you eat solids

178
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,858
I feel alive

179
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,362
My heart is stuffed

180
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,781
It hurts...

181
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,080
Ah... sorry, that's weird isn't it?

182
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,207
I mean, it's just plain disgusting

183
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,043
(Makoto) I was the same

184
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,471
In my case it was a voice

185
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,267
Every time I try to say words out loud

186
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,729
What are you desperately trying to tell me

187
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,190
In the end, nothing arrived

188
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,943
Because my heart is getting painful

189
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,989
I stopped talking

190
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,036
Well, it's from when I was a child

191
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,206
that's why

192
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,336
It's okay

193
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,963
I understand

194
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,053
What are you talking about?

195
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,971
Sorry for the sudden

196
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:30,481
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

197
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,901
hello

198
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,778
(Reina) Oh, what if it's true?

199
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,446
Only one now?

200
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,615
What about Sachiko? Have you gone home already?

201
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,533
Yeah

202
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,201
Ah, is Reina just finished?

203
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,285
(Reina) Yes

204
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,079
Have you seen the video you sent?

205
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,580
Kokoro: Isn't he so cute?

206
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,290
(Reina) It was cute

207
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,625
Ah, that's right

208
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:54,505
Tomorrow, I'm planning to receive the additional watch camera I ordered.

209
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,924
Will you contact me again once I set it up?

210
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,759
learn

211
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:12,982
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

212
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,112
(Reina) Do you understand? That sitter

213
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,907
Ah that's it

214
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:27,163
There was nothing suspicious about this

215
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,332
I also heard about it at my previous workplace.

216
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,044
I used it to check with the police

217
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,504
As far as I have looked into it...

218
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,306
(Comi) What is Reina asking you to do?

219
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,475
Don't make weird moves

220
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,061
Please be careful as we will always keep an eye on you.

221
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,272
(Makoto) Sorry

222
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,774
It's not insane

223
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,651
This is a watch camera for times like this.

224
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,571
Oh, then I'll set it up

225
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,564
(Piano sounds)

226
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:56,377
(Piano performance)

227
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:15,980
(Piano performance)

228
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,043
No, I can't believe it

229
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,255
(Sachiko) Sorry for the inconvenience

230
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,551
When it's right in front of me, I want to play it

231
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,636
unintentionally…

232
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,472
No, it's so...

233
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,645
It was a nostalgic sound

234
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,780
It's not a revenge this time

235
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,990
I wonder if it's soup would work

236
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,285
(Sachiko) It's okay without having to worry about that

237
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,286
Don't say that

238
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,998
I was a part-time worker at a restaurant when I was a student

239
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,292
I'm pretty confident in my cooking

240
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:11,929
(A sound of hitting the counter)

241
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,815
(knock)

242
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,316
(Yuki) Excuse me

243
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,402
Reina, please

244
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,736
(Reina) Yes

245
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,830
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

246
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,416
(Juria) What if

247
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,959
(Reina) What if Shimoshi Kiria?

248
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,419
Are you in front of the house now?

249
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,171
Yes I'm parked nearby now

250
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,424
Thank you, sorry

251
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,719
Yes, don't worry, Reina does her best to rehearse

252
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,470
Thank you so much

253
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,596
That's it

254
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,806
(Juria) Yes

255
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,773
If you don't cook regularly, your arms will fall off.

256
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,291
Tachibana-san?

257
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,767
Tachibana, are you okay?

258
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,351
Ah... yes

259
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,479
Ah, are you okay?

260
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,819
Something... Was there something?

261
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,241
It's already past

262
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,661
Sorry for the inconvenience

263
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,621
I'm going home

264
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,122
It's dangerous to be alone

265
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,374
Shall we call your family?

266
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,881
There's no one

267
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,262
I've always been taking care of myself, so

268
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,767
Sorry, I'm sorry

269
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,352
(I'm gonna understand)

270
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,980
Me too...

271
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,277
I lost my mother when I was in elementary school

272
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,823
But then

273
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,575
Because Reina has helped me

274
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,662
I managed to get over it

275
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,706
Is Reina in her strength?

276
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,168
Sorry, my story is fine

277
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,753
I'll bring you water

278
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,296
What happened...

279
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,048
(Makoto) Tachibana

280
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,675
OK?

281
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,677
(Juria) What are you doing?

282
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,058
♪～

283
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,773
OK?

284
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,152
I'll explain

285
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,915
that

286
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,921
Hmm

287
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,511
～♪

288
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,263
~♪ It's going well

289
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,519
Comic

290
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,236
(Juria) Revenge starts here

291
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,531
(Makoto) Tachibana looks like her first love

292
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,074
(Reina) Senior Yukikazuko?

293
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,034
(Sachiko) It might not be possible

294
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,869
sorry
