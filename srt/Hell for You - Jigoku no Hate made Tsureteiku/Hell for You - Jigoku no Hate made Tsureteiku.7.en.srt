1
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,173
(Commy) What really matters is her husband

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:11,177
(Juria) I think for a moment I thought that they were both suspicious.

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,179
I'll help you if something happens too

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,264
(Hanai Makoto) Tachibana

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,724
(Juria) What are you doing?

6
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,646
(Tachibana Sachiko)

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,696
It's going well

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,658
(Sachiko)

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,785
(Nurse) Bando

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,163
Do you know about me?

11
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,163
(Electrocardiograph sound)

12
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,166
(Electrocardiograph sound)

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,339
(Sawako Bando) Ah... Ah...

14
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,341
teeth?

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,846
Haa...

16
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,015
Please answer

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,435
Do you know who I am?

18
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,691
I see...

19
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,820
disappointing

20
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,949
I

21
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,243
The piano teacher you killed

22
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,163
This is Komiyayama Manami, the younger sister of Komiyayama Ryota.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,295
Thank you so much for awakening

24
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,385
Now you can finally achieve your big brother's revenge

25
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,476
(Kowako) Chi... not

26
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,520
It's not me

27
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,358
The culprit is... Rena

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,653
This is Kurokawa Reina

29
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,863
Kurokawa Reina?

30
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,326
(Kowako) The person who killed Sensei

31
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,496
It's that girl

32
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,873
I

33
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,751
I was just dressed in a wet...

34
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,837
Who believes that story? What is the evidence?

35
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,506
evidence…

36
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,468
The evidence is...

37
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,389
Ugh...

38
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,642
So the evidence is...

39
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,895
It's me

40
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,233
I saw it with this eye

41
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,155
I'm covered in blood

42
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,574
In front of Professor Komiyayama

43
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,369
Reina was laughing...

44
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,581
It's true

45
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,916
Trust me

46
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,919
You killed me

47
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,089
It's not a revenge

48
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,842
Just do what Reina wants

49
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,926
teeth?

50
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,611
on second thoughts

51
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,533
Was the bachelor?

52
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,296
here

53
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,592
Big brother said it on a regular basis

54
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,971
Kurokawa-san always smiles

55
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,558
Sometimes the face reflected on the piano

56
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,352
It's creepy

57
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,066
Even if I told the police, they didn't take it.

58
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,487
That's when I remembered it

59
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,739
You should know everything

60
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,534
You are the only one

61
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,500
Because he witnessed his big brother's final moments

62
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,938
(Sachiko) I'm accepted

63
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,440
This has finally begun

64
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,567
Revenge starts here

65
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,820
(Sachiko) From the peak of happiness

66
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,698
Take Reina to the end of hell

67
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,952
I'll let you experience living hell

68
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,704
(Juria) I can't believe it

69
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,332
The woman who trashed her sin and killed appears with a change of face

70
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,252
You probably wouldn't dream of it

71
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,796
(Sachiko) Thanks to the comic

72
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,298
Because Komi connected with Reina first

73
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,342
I got a lot of information

74
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,510
(Juria) Well, well, well

75
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,138
Did you do your best to play influencers?

76
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,724
But the opponent is that bachelor

77
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,017
Don't let your guard down

78
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:09,767
Don't let your guard down

79
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:09,767
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

80
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,894
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

81
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,729
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

82
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,729
yeah?

83
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,855
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

84
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,982
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

85
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,982
Haa... if you go rumoured

86
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,193
I'll do it well now that I'm back now

87
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,449
Yes what if?

88
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,326
(Hanai Reina) What was Makoto and that person doing?

89
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,577
how was it?

90
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,454
(Juria) Reina calms down a bit

91
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,205
Tachibana, I'm feeling unwell

92
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,000
Makoto was just giving him a little rest.

93
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,211
(Reina) But the two of them had a strange atmosphere

94
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,796
I didn't really know from the camera

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,757
There was nothing

96
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,843
Well, I doubted it for a moment too

97
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,067
(Makoto) Was it really okay?

98
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,819
yes

99
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,822
I'm feeling unwell

100
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,283
I've just apologized for the inconvenience to Makoto.

101
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,369
I've told you about it

102
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,791
- (Makoto) Tachibana- (Sachiko) I'm back

103
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,419
(Sachiko) Sorry for today

104
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,509
(Makoto)

105
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,803
a…

106
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,596
sorry

107
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,057
just…

108
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,517
Tachibana's

109
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,813
I'm really worried about my health

110
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,733
That's just what I wanted to say

111
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,819
sorry

112
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,530
thank you

113
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,869
Ah

114
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,717
(Kowako) Makoto

115
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,183
(Sachiko) Come to think of it, at Mizusaki Academy

116
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,602
There have been murders ever happened

117
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,812
Don't remember?

118
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,065
There was a lot of noise on the newspapers and on TV...

119
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,955
(Staff) Now, all the performers

120
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,957
Please come to the venue

121
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:52,513
(Chihiro) Ah...

122
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,264
(Chihiro) Ah...

123
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,264
(Sound of falling down the stairs)

124
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,390
(Sound of falling down the stairs)

125
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,226
(Reina) Is it cancelled after all?

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,853
(Iida Yuki) It was officially decided earlier

127
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,772
What about Chihiro? Was it a serious injury?

128
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,233
(Yuki) No, I can't play for a while...

129
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,737
But seriously, who is it? The culprit who thrusts down

130
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,113
I

131
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,198
picture?

132
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,365
Lies

133
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,535
No, Reina isn't funny at all

134
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,537
This is the situation so go home soon

135
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,873
Just a little more

136
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,822
a…

137
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,284
Is it time to go out already?

138
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,702
no

139
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,996
I thought I'd drink some coffee

140
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,457
Ah... Is that so?

141
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,671
Oh, come to think of it, Tachibana-san

142
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,924
How are you feeling?

143
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,384
a…

144
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,761
Sorry for the inconvenience

145
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,098
But thanks to you, I've gotten much better

146
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,683
(Since) That's good

147
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,726
I was worried

148
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,158
Will Tachibana drink coffee too?

149
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,786
Ah... thank you

150
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:42,790
But I brought my own ginger hot water so

151
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,502
This is always the case when you get sick

152
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,462
Add honey and lemon

153
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,841
(Coughing voice)

154
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,258
(Coughing voice)

155
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,258
(Makoto) Senpai?

156
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:52,967
(Makoto) Senpai?

157
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,220
Shall I buy some hot drinks?

158
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,055
(Kowako) Yes, it's okay

159
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,099
I brought ginger water

160
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,601
Something with honey and lemon

161
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,860
(Sachiko) Kokoro-san

162
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,155
I'm not sleeping at all today

163
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,198
Ah... Certainly

164
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,744
It's been getting quite difficult to put him to bed lately

165
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,999
(Sachiko) But she still seems to like music

166
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,211
Lullaby is extremely effective when you sing

167
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,296
ah…

168
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:35,384
(Piano songs played from mobile phone)

169
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,846
(Sachiko's humming)

170
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,640
(Sachiko's humming)

171
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,640
(Piano performance)

172
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,518
(Piano performance)

173
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:55,654
(Piano songs played from mobile phone)

174
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,575
Makoto?

175
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,703
Ah... no

176
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,914
(Sachiko) What's up?

177
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,795
Tachibana-san

178
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,757
He looks like his first love...

179
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,552
a…

180
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,611
That person too

181
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,364
I was playing the piano

182
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,702
Serious, caring and honest

183
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,789
It feels comfortable to be with

184
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,292
I really liked it

185
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,800
But I do about her

186
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,304
I betrayed

187
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,559
I've regretted it for a long time

188
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,439
that

189
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,067
That person is now...

190
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,825
He has passed away

191
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,287
So now

192
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,749
I can't even apologize

193
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,754
I really didn't want to do that

194
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,715
to whom…

195
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,302
No matter what you said, you should have been there

196
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,016
It's too late now

197
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,356
Tachibana-san?

198
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,192
sorry

199
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:02,406
(Sachiko's sob voice)

200
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,392
(Sound)

201
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,176
what? An important story

202
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,764
Maybe it's not possible after all

203
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,105
I'm really sorry

204
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,607
that…

205
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,026
To Makoto

206
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,238
Seriously romantic feelings...

207
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,450
Even though we've come this far to work hard together

208
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,035
That's weird

209
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,457
Thinking about your dad and mom

210
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,627
I know it's impossible

211
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,797
But I can't help but

212
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,924
For revenge on Reina

213
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,885
You can't use Makoto

214
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,141
(Juria) Yes

215
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,526
So?

216
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,323
Do you want to be with Hanai Makoto?

217
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,827
Do you want to be united and happy?

218
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,412
no

219
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,626
I'm someone who shouldn't be happy

220
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,004
I think that's different though

221
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,052
Anyway, I want to keep my distance from the Hanai family once.

222
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:33,349
I can't get revenge if I keep feeling this way

223
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,479
in the end

224
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,150
That means using Hanai Makoto is a problem, right?

225
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,986
Yeah

226
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,448
Well then

227
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,077
How about changing your strategy a little?

228
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,079
picture?

229

(Reina) Ah Makoto

236
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,348
I'm sorry

237
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,724
(Makoto) Welcome back

238
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,184
Huh?

239
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,936
Wasn't it the day after I got home?

240
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,646
Hmm, that's it

241
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,148
The violinist got seriously injured

242
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,693
The concert itself has been cancelled

243
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,237
I see, that was difficult

244
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,322
But I wish they had contacted me

Sincere

255
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,538
Take care, come

256
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,540
Yes I'm coming

00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,093
yeah?

260
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,054
I'd like to ask a little advice

(Reina) Please come and join us

264
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,896
in? What about the story?

265
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,650
that…

266
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,569
I'm very sorry

267
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:37,407
Actually, I want to take a little break

268
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,413
That's a problem

269
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,917
Why? what?

270
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,130
That's that...

271
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,381
Did something happen?

00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,662
(Record noise)

273
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,957
(Reina) Who are you?

274
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,721
Who is it?

275
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,944
He looks like his senior

276
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,280
(Sachiko) has a heart, so she's still alive, right?

277
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,865
This buffon is this silly buffon!

278
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,866
No!

279
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,869
(Reina) I'll make you regret being alive
