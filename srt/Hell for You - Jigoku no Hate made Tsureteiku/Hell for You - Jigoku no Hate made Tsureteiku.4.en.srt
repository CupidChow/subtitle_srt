1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,423
I will kill the baby.

2
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,299
<i>I can't do it.</i>

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,885
<i>How will I ever take revenge?</i>

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,556
You're being so loud. Shut up.

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,601
Shut up! Shut the hell up!

6
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,687
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,167
Hello? Makoto?

8
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:45,754
Yep.

9
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,922
What time will you be back?

10
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,553
Okay. See you soon.

11
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,973
<i>So she doesn't love her child at all.</i>

12
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,643
<i>Unbelievable.</i>
<i>This changes everything for us.</i>

13
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,397
<i>Well, she's a true monster, no doubt.</i>

14
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,525
<i>I guess there's no point</i>
<i>in killing the baby.</i>

15
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,196
I agree.

16
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,074
<i>Are you relieved?</i>

17
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,784
What?

18
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>"No matter the reason,</i>
<i>I feel awful killing an innocent child."</i>

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>Is that what you think?</i>

20
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,959
No!

21
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,628
That's not…

22
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,088
<i>Did you forget how much you suffered?</i>

23
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,307
SUSPECT OF MURDER CASE RUNAWAY

24
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,142
POSSIBLE SUICIDE BY JUMPING…

25
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,894
That's terrifying…

26
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,562
-What is that?
-I'm scared!

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,565
So creepy…

28
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,028
Geez, she made me jump! What the hell?

29
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,321
She'll hear you!

30
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,781
-What a freak!
-Creepy!

31
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,908
-A mummy?
-Right?

32
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,493
-It's a mummy!
-Terrifying…

33
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,415
RECITAL
FEBRUARY 8TH, 2014

34
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,126
A NEW CLASSICAL PRINCESS

35
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,051
LIKE PARENT, LIKE CHILD

36
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,416
<i>Our ultimate goals</i>
<i>are to expose all of Rena's crimes</i>

37
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,418
<i>and make her atone for sins,</i>

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,794
<i>and also…</i>

39
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,962
I know!

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,054
I'll show her what true hell is like.

41
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,392
I'll find another weakness of hers.

42
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,186
<i>Okay.</i>

43
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,355
<i>I do wonder though…</i>

44
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,484
<i>Why hasn't she killed Kokoro already?</i>

45
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,569
What?

46
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,490
<i>She's murdered so many people</i>
<i>and managed to cover up all of them.</i>

47
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,202
<i>She definitely could've done</i>
<i>the same with Kokoro.</i>

48
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,662
<i>So why keep her alive?</i>

49
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,580
It's probably…

50
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,419
because she knows
she as a mother can be blamed

51
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,421
or become a prime suspect.

52
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,924
<i>Not anymore though.</i>

53
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,260
<i>She can blame it on you.</i>

54
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,848
<i>Don't let that monster out of your sight.</i>

55
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,519
I won't.

56
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,058
I've reached my limit.

57
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,066
I was playing the piano

58
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,569
when the bed rail fell off.

59
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,948
Kokoro fell off the bed and died!

60
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,120
Good morning.

61
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,706
Oh, right!

62
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,917
I'm so sorry!

63
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,921
I shouldn't have left it here.

64
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,047
My apologies.

65
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,467
Yeah. If it fell,
it could've been a disaster.

66
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,843
I'm very sorry.

67
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,727
Hello? Yuki?

68
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,479
I'll come out.

69
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,566
I need to go pick up my dress.

70
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,443
Okay. See you later!

71
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,874
<i>Recently…</i>

72
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,627
<i>she calms down when I hold her.</i>

73
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,881
I guess Kokoro likes me.

74
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,561
<i>Rena's most prized possession…</i>

75
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,897
<i>Her assets and income?</i>

76
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,066
<i>If I take all that away…</i>

77
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,362
<i>No. Her family is rich anyway,</i>

78
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,574
<i>and she'd easily find</i>
<i>another income source.</i>

79
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,911
<i>What about her social status and value?</i>

80
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,790
<i>What if I just expose her</i>
<i>as a murderer online?</i>

81
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,792
<i>I truly regret</i>

82
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,794
<i>the trouble and confusion…</i>

83
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,588
<i>No.</i>

84
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,048
<i>She's too good at lying.</i>

85
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,595
<i>What about her husband, Makoto？</i>

86
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,057
<i>Although, she doesn't even love</i>
<i>her own child.</i>

87
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,685
<i>Does she actually love her husband?</i>

88
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,690
<i>Would she truly despair if she lost him?</i>

89
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,189
Rena?

90
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,568
No. It's not…

91
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,274
Welcome home.

92
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,112
Is something wrong?

93
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,738
Uh, no.

94
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,955
Rena told me I can use
the record player anytime.

95
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,207
Oh, yeah. That's totally fine.

96
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,458
Sorry to worry you.

97
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,627
Ah…

98
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,089
Hey, Kokoro!

99
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,132
You're awake!

100
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,217
Oh, Kokoro…

101
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,885
You seem happy!

102
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,805
Look! What's this?

103
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,309
Makoto absolutely loves that baby to bits.

104
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,185
A very devoted dad.

105
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,022
<i>That's normal. It's his own daughter.</i>

106
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,065
But Rena once said

107
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,528
Makoto is incapable
of genuinely loving someone.

108
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,074
<i>Is it possible</i>
<i>that Makoto's just like Rena?</i>

109
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,703
<i>Or having a child</i>
<i>made him capable of love?</i>

110
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,250
<i>Hm? What's wrong?</i>

111
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,467
Uh…

112
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,385
Hang on.

113
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,433
Wait…

114
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
Did you just roll over?

115
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,484
Kokoro rolled over by herself!

116
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,570
Oh, wow! That's great.

117
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,368
Is something wrong?

118
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,496
No… Nothing.

119
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,413
I'm back!

120
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,707
Makoto! Welcome back!

121
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,793
-You won't believe this!
-Huh?

122
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,504
Kokoro just rolled over by herself
for the first time!

123
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,547
-Really? That's amazing!
-Right?

124
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,883
A cake to celebrate?

125
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,220
Sounds good.
Shall we order takeout as well?

126
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,514
-Yes! Like a little party!
-Yeah.

127
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,267
Would you like to join us too,
Ms. Tachibana?

128
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,185
Uh…

129
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,521
I'd love to.

130
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,648
-Yay! How exciting!
-Yeah.

131
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,025
-I'll go arrange stuff now!
-Okay.

132
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,570
Well done, Kokoro. You did it!

133
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,617
Do you think we have enough cake?

134
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,953
We should! Kokoro can't eat it yet!

135
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,329
True.

136
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,249
-I'll call when I'm done shopping.
-Okay!

137
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,920
Ask for a message on the cake, too!
How about…

138
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,755
"She rolled over!"

139
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,715
Will do!

140
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,637
We should go, too.

141
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,680
Okay.

142
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,938
What would you like to eat?

143
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,065
Tell me what you like!

144
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,567
No, I feel bad.

145
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,861
-Please choose what you two like!
-But…

146
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,363
I want you to be part of the celebration!

147
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,907
Okay. Well…

148
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,993
-In that case…
-I know!

149
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,580
There's a new Italian restaurant
that opened last week!

150
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,665
I heard it's very popular…

151
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,215
Sorry! Are you okay?

152
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,134
Yes…

153
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,353
Thank god.

154
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,857
Makoto! Makoto, are you okay?

155
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,901
-I'm fine.
-Can you move?

156
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,445
-Yeah…
-Thank goodness!

157
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,364
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah, thanks.

158
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,450
I'm just glad that

159
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,410
you're okay!

160
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,495
Makoto…

161
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,458
I knew it.

162
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,919
RENA HANAI

163
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,713
<i>So her most prized possession</i>
<i>is her husband.</i>

164
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,550
<i>She had the baby</i>
<i>just so he loves her more.</i>

165
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,220
Rena's love for Makoto

166
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,096
seems genuine.

167
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:31,894
I realize now that Rena lied to my face.

168
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,063
Because…

169
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,401
she didn't want him to get taken away.

170
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,112
<i>Makoto's incapable</i>

171
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,364
of loving someone.

172
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,491
He never can.

173
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,202
A living hell for Rena…

174
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,205
is to live without Makoto.

175
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,633
Makoto Hanai, 30 years old.

176
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,260
A florist.

177
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,221
Has known Rena for over 20 years.

178
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,390
When he was 11,

179
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,849
his mother died.

180
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,144
He was adopted by his relative after that.

181
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,150
<i>Fastest way of getting rid of Makoto</i>
<i>is to kill him, you know.</i>

182
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,193
Wait…

183
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,991
We can kill him anytime if needed.

184
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,160
But what would be worse for Rena

185
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,914
is probably if he told her
he wants a divorce.

186
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,751
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>we'll make him hate her first.</i>

187
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:44,258
<i>Show Makoto proof that Rena is actually</i>
<i>a vicious killer.</i>

188
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,513
No, not yet!

189
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,431
I'm not ready.

190
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,891
Sorry for the wait!

191
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,601
That looks great!

192
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,728
I have good news.

193
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,396
Thankfully…

194
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,815
With Botanical has asked us

195
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,568
to do another product collaboration!

196
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,652
-Yes!
-Amazing!

197
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,155
I'm so relieved!

198
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,741
-Hey, Rena.
-Yes?

199
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,410
-Look over there.
-There?

200
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,040
This is a present for you.

201
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,709
Thank you, Nao!

202
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,213
You said you wanted some
when you came to our place, so….

203
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,549
I hope you like them!

204
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,760
Tomomi, you remembered that?

205
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,553
I'm so happy!

206
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,057
-I'm glad!
-Thank you, Nao!

207
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:34,934
Wow, look at that!

208
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,020
Can you catch them, Nao?

209
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,606
Can you? Oh, Almost! Try again!

210
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,400
Ms. Tomomi,
could I ask you about something?

211
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,360
Yes. What's up?

212
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,948
Rena's feeling down
since the With Botanical incident, and…

213
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:55,120
I was thinking about planning
a surprise party for her birthday.

214
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,915
That sounds lovely! Let's do it!

215
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,502
I need to know her schedule
so I was wondering

216
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,254
if you could ask Makoto about it?

217
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,339
Okay!

218
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,049
I'll ask him now!

219
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,594
-Makoto!
-Yes?

220
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,472
For Rena's upcoming birthday,

221
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,434
we want to surprise her with a party
to cheer her up.

222
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,727
-Wow, really?
-Yes!

223
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,729
She would absolutely love that!

224
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,939
Great!

225
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,148
Was it the 26th?

226
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,566
Yes, it is.

227
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,986
-Start from noon?
-That's quite early!

228
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,955
Rena! You made me jump!

229
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,623
Don't do that!

230
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,877
Tomomi, what were you talking
to Makoto about?

231
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:45,921
What?

232
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,966
Oh, it was nothing!

233
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,346
Uh, it was…

234
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,890
about flowers!

235
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,184
I want to send some to my friend!

236
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,316
Oh, Makoto!

237
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,572
Thanks again for helping me
with my friend's bouquet.

238
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,241
Thanks for the order.

239
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,951
I hope she likes it.

240
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,119
Me too.

241
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,832
-Oh, that's it?
-Yep!

242
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:26,879
That's all?

243
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,416
Good morning.

244
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,585
Ms. Tachibana?

245
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,045
Can I help you?

246
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,922
There's something…

247
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,384
I want to talk to you about.

248
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,850
It's regarding Rena.

249
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,800
Ms. Tachibana.

250
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,511
Yes?

251
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,515
I'm sorry but…

252
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,185
I need you

253
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,437
to quit.

254
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,404
-I'm Bando from class A, third year.
-I'm Hanai.

255
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,740
<i>Please let me keep the job!</i>

256
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,285
<i>So that was a lie…</i>

257
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,870
