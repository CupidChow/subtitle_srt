1
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,968
(Hanai Makoto) might still be nearby

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,261
I'll look for it

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,971
(Tachibana Sachiko) Makoto

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,349
be careful

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,227
Sorry, this is what happens

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,190
It's all my fault

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,483
No, that's not it...

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,485
(Makoto) I'll just look for Rena

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,863
Please both of you to support us

10
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:40,540
(Mobile phone ringing)

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,752
(Hanai Reina)

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,838
Did you really think you wouldn't be found out?

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,592
Of course you're prepared, right?

14
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:56,848
(Reina's laughter)

15
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:03,396
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

16
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,693
(Kurokawa Minoru) Rena escaped through the window

17
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,903
Was it found?

18
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,696
No, not yet

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,907
The USB with evidence was also taken away.

20
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,034
(Min) I see...

21
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,162
Let's go to the police

22
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,833
I will testify about everything Reina committed.

23
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,251
father…

24
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,588
That's my compensation

25
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,300
May Makoto, too, will you go to the police?

26
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,469
Of course, thank you

27
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,681
(Sachiko) Makoto: I'm going to the police with Professor Kurokawa

28
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,225
(Juria) I see...

29
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,229
I'll contact you a little bit

30
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,313
(Sachiko) Yes

31
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,692
(Juria) What if it's Yuuki?

32
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,861
Sorry for the sudden

33
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,114
Has Reina contacted you anything?

34
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,992
No, a bit...

35
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,870
(Sachiko) I'm sorry

36
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:05,333
I think it's going to be a big deal from now on

37
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,045
I'm hurt by someone else's words

38
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,381
Don't be swayed

39
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:16,636
You walk through your life

40
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,306
The heart is

41
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,019
She's really cute and good girl

42
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:33,403
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

43
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,742
yes

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,453
(Reina) Sawako-senpai?

45
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,339
Where is it now?

46
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,134
What are you going to do with the evidence?

47
00:02:56,217 --> 00:03:00,054
(Reina) It's been 14 years since we last visited

48
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,476
But I was surprised that Senpai was so different

49
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,024
I liked my oldest older men better

50
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:17,030
(Sachiko) Reina-chan has nothing to change, terrifyingly

51
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,701
I'll say it, but as you say

52
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,204
I've changed

53
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,585
I won't be fooled by you anymore

54
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,756
Don't be so wary

55
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,550
That's sad

56
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,680
I think so much about my senior

57
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,642
If not

58
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,978
You don't bother to teach them this way, do you?

59
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,647
What does that mean?

60
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,984
The truth behind the death of an uncle

61
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,532
The truth that my senior couldn't reach no matter how hard he tried.

62
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,618
I'll tell you everything

63
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,497
But there is only one condition

64
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,335
Please come alone without telling anyone

65
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,337
you must

66
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,341
What do you do?

67
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,846
(Juria) Please contact me if you find out anything

68
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,931
Yeah

69
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,141
Haa...

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,227
Wow, what's wrong?

71
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,648
I just received a call from Makoto.

72
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,360
I really want you to go to the police and testify.

73
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,155
- (Juria) Yes, then I'm with you too... - (Sachiko) Meanwhile

74
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,866
Can you please about your mind?

75
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,246
I want you to protect your heart

76
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,375
Understood

77
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,046
Sachiko

78
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,217
Are you okay?

79
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,469
His face is completely blue

80
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,554
a…

81
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,515
Yeah

82
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,863
I'm in my own way

83
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,575
I tried to regain Reina's humanity, but

84
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,036
I was thinking inside

85
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,583
It's impossible for that child to love someone

86
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,755
In fact, even my father

87
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,258
I never felt any love from that girl

88
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,894
But Makoto

89
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,980
Only you were different

90
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:01,861
That girl loves you from the bottom of her heart

91
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,281
Why did you get that done?

92
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,117
I don't know

93
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,537
father…

94
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,042
I too end up

95
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,879
I couldn't escape that child's curse

96
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,176
I jealous of you

97
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,888
But I also feel sorry for you

98
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,891
What you were being cast

99
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,646
It's hard to compare to me

100
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,859
It's probably a vicious, relentless, and sinful curse

101
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,912
I should have heard

102
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,835
How do you feel loved by that child?

103
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:06,425
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

104
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,306
(Reina) Is it over?

105
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,017
He didn't make you feel sad, right?

106
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,312
Ah, I just put you to sleep

107
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,857
(Reina) So please hurry up

108
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,733
If you're not good

109
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:27,238
This time I'll take responsibility

110
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,948
(The call has been cut off)

111
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,210
Comic Sorry

112
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:57,518
(footsteps)

113
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,605
(Sachiko) Professor Kurokawa

114
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,607
Why…

115
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,068
I have no choice but to let you die

116
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,201
That guy is already

117
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,162
No one can stop it

118
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,379
Hehehe...

119
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,131
Hahaha

120
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,057
Makoto?

121
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,603
(Min) Why on earth...

122
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,146
I'm about you

123
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,607
Did you think you trust it?

124
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,027
Ah, I just put you to sleep

125
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,571
(Reina) So please hurry up

126
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,328
(Myth) Please stop sinning any more

127
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,002
(Juria) Huh? What's wrong, what's wrong

128
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,963
I'll bring you a pacifier

129
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,025
My heart is mom

130
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,655
(Juria)

131
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,572
yeah?

132
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,409
Get away from Kokoro-chan

133
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,038
No, I can't believe it

134
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,875
Is Kiria the younger sister of Komiyayama?

135
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,132
It was difficult

136
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,010
When I put your face in front of me

137
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,972
I'm going to get so full of the desire to stab me to death

138
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,141
I was already at my limit

139
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,560
Scary

140
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,271
Why was your big brother?

141
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,274
Already... Eh

142
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,776
That question again?

143
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,946
Everyone really wants to know

144
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,906
Answer the question

145
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,118
(Reina) Hmm

146
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,580
Sorry I forgot

147
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,582
Ehehehe

148
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:29,128
Because it's a long time ago

149
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,257
Oh, more than that

150
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,926
yes

151
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,430
You want this

152
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,893
Wow!

153
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,042
Ugh... ugh

154
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,462
Ah, amazing

155
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,923
That's amazing, Juria

156
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,802
My brother is

157
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,848
I was seriously worried about you

158
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:29,021
How can you become a pianist?

159
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:36,320
How can you become a bloody person?

160
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,200
Kiria: That's what

161
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,037
I'm talking about unnecessary care

162
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,795
I'm really sorry you

163
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,258
What am I missing?

164
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,469
You've lived without knowing it

165
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,724
I'm still carrying the strange loneliness I want to

166
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,061
I don't even know why

167
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,148
I'm sure he'll die

168
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,359
Ah

169
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,820
Ahaha

170
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,739
I remembered

171
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,743
Why did you kill Komiya-san?

172
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,040
I was annoying like Juria now

173
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,256
Uhh... uh

174
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,049
Ugh...

175
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,774
Uuuh...

176
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,158
I'm stuck already

177
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:15,419
(Makoto) Why did you take on Reina's invitation?

178
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:22,468
(Sachiko) It was always stuck in my chest

179
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,971
Dad

180
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:31,310
Why did he have to be killed?

181
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,980
that's why

182
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:39,860
I wanted to hear it from Reina's mouth

183
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,825
What can you do for your dad?

184
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,372
That's all I have left

185
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,520
To Tachibana

186
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,731
I have a story

187
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,484
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

188
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,735
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

189
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,735
Sorry

190
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,696
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

191

(Iida Yuki) Makoto, it's tough!

193
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,703
what up? Yuuki-kun calm down

194
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,163
(Yuki) I went home thinking that Reina was back, so I went home.

195
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,999
Kiria is full of blood...

196
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,084
What... What is your mind?

197
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,128
(Yuki) I can't see Kokoro either

198
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,964
I don't know what to do anymore

199
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,097
(Sachiko) Comi Are you okay?

200
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,227
(Juria) Sorry

201
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,063
Whatever

202
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:02,234
I had to protect Kokoro-chan

203
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,615
It's not Juria's fault

204
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,493
Sorry
