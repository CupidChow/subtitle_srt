1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:09,259
(Hanai Makoto) Actually, my mother was killed.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,138
To Rena

3
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,891
Reina's first murder

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,521
That might have been the beginning of it all.

5
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,067
(Tachibana Sachiko) between the two

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,904
What on earth happened?

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,534
(Iida Yuki) Makoto

8
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,620
A little story

9
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,332
Sorry, I'm sorry

10
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,757
(Yuki) The company is making a big fuss right now

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,427
So once the questioning is over, I'll go back to work.

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,179
Sorry, at times like this

13
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,263
Oh no

14
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:59,851
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience

15
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,437
But where did you go?

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,521
Reina-san

17
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,574
It looks like the police are coming soon

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,075
What about Makoto?

19
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,619
(Yuki) Eh, haven't you come?

20
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,661
yes

21
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,663
(Yuuki) Huh? That's weird

22
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,126
(Mobile phone ringing)

23
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:25,752
(Mobile phone ringing)

24
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:25,752
It's no good, it won't come out

25
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,587
It's no good, it won't come out

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,131
Why?

27
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,678
It's not anywhere

28
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,055
It wasn't here either

29
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,181
It's not good

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,558
If this continues, even Makoto will be suspicious of the police.

31
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,893
That's...

32
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,480
Oh, the police will be coming soon, so I'll go for now.

33
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,564
- (Sachiko) Please - (Yuki) Yes

34
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:04,207
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

35
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,381
Makoto, where are you now?

36
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,300
Makoto?

37
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,635
(Makoto) Actually...

38
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,390
From the beginning, this is correct

39
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,808
I knew

40
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,353
what do you mean?

41
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,813
(Makoto) Reina

42
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,859
I'll go see you alone

43
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,777
But there's still a place to stay...

44
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,737
(I'm sorry) I understand somehow

45
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,822
picture?

46
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,324
Ours

47
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,121
It's the promised place

48
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,012
(Boy) Don't touch it

49
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,847
Let's go

50
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,461
(Kurokawa Reina) Going elsewhere

51
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,091
I'm going to live here now

52
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,477
what?

53
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,122
"This is my secret base"

54
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,598
From here on, this is me

55
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,226
You definitely shouldn't cross it

56
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,166
Rhinoceros beetle

57
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,464
My dad got mad when I torn a beetle apart

58
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,552
I don't have the right to live in this society

59
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,888
You too

60
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:11,436
Do you think it's disgusting or scary?

61
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,197
"Children"

62
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:29,662
“In the washing machine”

63
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,333
"put in"

64
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,211
"There are adults too"

65
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,475
Is that about yourself?

66
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,520
I mean, why aren't you talking?

67
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,438
cold?

68
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,660
"Even if I talk"

69
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,829
“Nothing”

70
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:17,335
"No change"

71
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,344
Me Kurokawa Reina

72
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,804
you?

73
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,937
Hanai Makoto?

74
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,444
(Makoto) I do what only I can do

75
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,155
that's why

76
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,993
Sawako Senior

77
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:58,251
Please don't interact with us any more

78
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,880
Goodbye

79
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,425
(The call has been cut off)

80
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,425
(The call has been cut off)

81
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,425
Makoto? Makoto!

82
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,802
Makoto? Makoto!

83
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,358
The promised place...

84
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,700
(Makoto) This is the place where I and Reina first met

85
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,098
(Reina) The best!

86
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,601
The world is revolving

87
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,520
Haha, isn't it amazing?

88
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:07,653
(Reina's laughter)

89
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,990
(Sachiko) Makoto!

90
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,951
(Makoto) Yukikazuko-senpai...

91
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,078
Why here?

92
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,957
You said this is where the two met, right?

93
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,629
I want to be involved

94
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,633
If you don't get involved, nothing will end

95
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,470
I feel like nothing's going to start

96
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,474
I'm with Makoto too

97
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,645
I want to face Reina to the end

98
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,654
Understood

99
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,658
but

100
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,663
Reina wasn't here

101
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,629
I thought this was the only place

102
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,434
It's not my blood

103
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,145
Dove wings attached when cut

104
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,909
Who is the monster?

105
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,457
You're much more monster

106
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,793
That's what I gave birth without my permission!

107
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,213
Haa...

108
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,676
I want to mess everything up

109
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,152
"As appropriate"

110
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,449
"How about playing?"

111
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,493
play?

112
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:26,042
“Dad too”

113
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,337
"The world too"

114
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,134
“I'm cheating”

115
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,063
(The sound of the door opening)

116
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:47,730
(The sound of the door opening)

117
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:47,730
Makoto Let's play

118
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,939
Makoto Let's play

119
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,627
(Makoto's mother)

120
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,340
What are you flirting with a girl?

121
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:18,344
I told you to come home early today and cook some food

122
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,553
Hey

123
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,430
What's the reply? reply!

124
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,765
(Reina) Makoto

125
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,225
(Makoto's mother)

126
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:28,145
Why can't you even stand properly?

127
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,233
Sincere

128
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,528
Your girlfriend is cheeky

129
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,614
I'm going

130
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,536
Sincerity... Sincerity!

131
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,543
I'm sorry this time

132
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,379
This is a souvenir from my father

133
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,716
Thank you for your continued support

134
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,633
(Makoto's mother) too

135
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,220
I'm glad I didn't have to worry about it

136
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,305
Go in Go in

137
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,523
(The sound of the door opening)

138
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,420
(Detective) Makoto-kun

139
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:38,591
Have you ever seen anyone suspicious near your house?

140
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,302
yeah?

141
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,107
(I'm sorry) I didn't see it

142
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,613
When I got home, my mother was dead

143
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,413
(Reina) Makoto!

144
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,586
I heard you say it...

145
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,921
(Makoto) Mom

146
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,839
I went to hell

147
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:33,312
I just put the lid on and thought I'd forgotten everything

148
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,650
When the heart was born

149
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,109
accidental…

150
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,030
Until I find this

151
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,537
(Sachiko) 20050818?

152
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,040
(Sincere) August 18, 2005

153
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,836
It's the anniversary of my mother's death

154
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,631
(Sachiko) This is...

155
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,512
This is Reina's secret account

156
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,518
Since committing his first murder

157
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,855
Spit out the weak self you want to hide

158
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,357
It's like a diary

159
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:23,237
At first I think I'll kill someone again

160
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,406
It was intended to be monitored

161
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,869
If Reina has such a human side in the future

162
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,581
The impulse of murder or ferocity

163
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,166
I think it's gone already

164
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,298
Did you put hope?

165
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,301
yes

166
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,847
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

167
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,850
- (Sachiko) Makoto-san What is this... - (Makoto) What?

168
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,612
Senior Kowako

169
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,075
The time spent with Kowako-senpai

170
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,078
The time spent with Tachibana

171
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,539
For me

172
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,001
It was the only comfort

173
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,924
Is this what I really want here?

174
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,096
It's true that I thought so

175
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,140
Makoto?

176
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,434
(Makoto) But Reina

177
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,691
It's my mistake

178
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,615
No matter what happens, I'll carry everything on my shoulders

179
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,118
that's why

180
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,538
Meeting with Senpai Kowako

181
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,294
Today is the last

182
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,548
Really

183
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,759
sorry

184
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,311
Makoto

185
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,316
Can I just ask one thing?

186
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,491
What can only Makoto do?

187
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,958
Let's go, Reina is waiting

188
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:51,343
♪～

189
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:58,684
(The cry of my heart)

190
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,309
(Heart cry) (Hanai Reina) So erotic, really

191
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,145
(Hanai Reina) It's so hot, really

192
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,873
That's all I've got to know about my relationship with you

193
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,709
You too

194
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,836
I wasn't born because I wanted to...

195
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,093
That's what I gave birth without my permission!

196
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,137
Who is the monster?

197
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,535
～♪

198
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:30,317
(Piano performance)

199
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,443
(Piano performance)

200
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,443
Reina...

201
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,111
(Piano performance)

202
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,198
(Reina) She was pampering me for killing a cat again

203
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,035
Can monsters be happy?

204
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,876
Why was I born in the first place?

205
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,462
Is it like God's independent research?

206
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,133
Is God surprisingly bored?

207
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,761
I want to know what people feel

208
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,472
I want to know I want to know

209
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,474
i don't know

210
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:10,691
Even though he's a monster, there's no way he can become a mom

211
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,280
(Piano sounds)

212
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,289
(Sachiko) Reina

213
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,221
(Reina) I couldn't help but want to torment her

214
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,598
I thought I was lucky

215
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,849
(Makoto) I don't want to say it myself

216
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,017
(Reina) It's a lie

217
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,310
Will it disappear quickly?

218
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,937
(Sachiko) I will never forgive you

219
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,937
(Reina's laughter)
