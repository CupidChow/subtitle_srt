1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,880
I heard it's very popular…

2
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>So her most prized possession</i>
<i>is her husband.</i>

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,927
Makoto, are you okay?

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,765
<i>Show Makoto proof that Rena is actually</i>
<i>a vicious killer.</i>

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,143
I'm sorry but…

6
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,854
I need you to quit.

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,899
Uh… Excuse me?

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,486
I understand that you care
about me and Rena.

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,447
But…

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:32,949
You've learnt…

11
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,827
a bit too much about Rena.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,037
What?

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,540
I know…

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,335
that Rena seems smiley
and perfect all the time,

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,379
but actually…

16
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,175
she's very sensitive

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,052
and vulnerable.

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:55,847
I think…

19
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,392
<i>what she did was just a severe reaction</i>

20
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,936
<i>to work and relationship-related stress.</i>

21
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,230
That's my take on it.

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,859
"Cruel and terrifying."

23
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:12,238
I understand
what other people might think…

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,323
You're wrong!

25
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,699
-Listen, she's--
-But…

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,578
I married her and I'm committed to her

27
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,455
until the end.

28
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,542
The reason is personal, and…

29
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,088
I know I can't ask you to understand it.

30
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,466
Which is why…

31
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,094
for both our sakes,

32
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,139
we should draw the line here.

33
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,394
<i>Why does Makoto Hanai</i>
<i>care so much about Rena?</i>

34
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,273
How can he stay by her side knowing
what kind of person she is…

35
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,943
<i>But if he learns you're Sawako</i>

36
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,695
<i>and you were framed</i>
<i>and almost killed by Rena,</i>

37
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,657
<i>that should change his mind, right?</i>

38
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,703
I don't think he'll believe me
in this current situation.

39
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,082
<i>You'll need to regain his trust</i>

40
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,875
<i>so that he believes you.</i>

41
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,839
Rena? I'll be home soon.

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,799
Yeah.

43
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,107
Excuse me…

44
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,529
I was completely out of line yesterday.

45
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,240
I sincerely apologize.

46
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,412
I…

47
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,540
I wanted to be a pianist.

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,377
It was my lifelong dream.

49
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,839
<i>However…</i>

50
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,841
<i>I failed to achieve it.</i>

51
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,099
So I have always admired
Ms. Rena's achievements

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,643
in such a glamorous world.

53
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,396
That's why

54
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,815
when I saw what she did…

55
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,654
I thought that this can't be
who Rena truly is.

56
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,408
I wanted someone to reassure me,
someone who really knows her.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,994
But…

58
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,496
what you said helped me understand

59
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:31,544
that she's just another human being
trying to survive.

60
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,049
Her struggles and sufferings

61
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,886
must be something I can never understand,

62
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,307
but I feel ashamed
that I didn't even try to understand it.

63
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,145
And if I quit now, I knew I'd regret it,

64
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,856
so rather than giving up,
I came to see you.

65
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,694
I want to support Ms. Rena
the way you support her!

66
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,447
Please let me keep the job!

67
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,243
I beg you!

68
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,381
Please raise your head.

69
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:25,598
Thank you for thinking about
Rena's situation.

70
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,979
I look forward to your continued support.

71
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,860
I'll work hard! Thank you!

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,864
I appreciate you coming.

73
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,161
Wait!

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,622
-Yes?
-This is for you.

75
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,709
Chamomile?

76
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,297
I believe in floriography,
fifteen chamomiles mean "Sorry".

77
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,590
Oh, does it?

78
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,301
You didn't know?

79
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,679
No, I didn't.

80
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,017
-I'm home!
-Makoto!

81
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,601
Welcome home!

82
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,316
-What's with those flowers?
-Oh…

83
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,568
A surplus from the shop.

84
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,697
-That's unusual.
-You think?

85
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,449
-I'll put it in a vase.
-Okay.

86
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,331
Something's not right…

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,461
1, 2, 3. Aquarium!

88
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,254
-Jinx!
-No way, you too?

89
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,923
-Perfect, let's go to the aquarium!
-Yes!

90
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,762
<i>Let's start by introducing ourselves.</i>
<i>Ms. Bando?</i>

91
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,679
Okay.

92
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,058
-I'm Bando from class A, third year.
-Nice to meet you.

93
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,142
14 YEARS AGO, SPRING

94
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,687
I'm Hanai from class B, a first year.

95
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,564
Nice to meet you.

96
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,816
I'm Iijima, class B, second year.

97
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,693
Nice to meet you.

98
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,489
I'm Oikawa from class C, third year.

99
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,407
Nice to meet you.

100
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,550
MS. TOMOMI, MR. MAKOTO AND I
CAN DO THE SHOPPING.

101
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,927
THANK YOU!

102
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,638
<i>Shopping?</i>

103
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,099
Yes. Did Ms. Tomomi tell you about the…

104
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,684
Oh, for the surprise party?

105
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,439
I thought you'd know best
about what Ms. Rena likes,

106
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,318
so I wanted to ask you
to do the shopping with me.

107
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,195
Sure, no problem.

108
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,030
Thank you.

109
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,158
I really hope it'll make her happy!

110
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,541
I'm sure she'll love anything
if it's from you.

111
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,294
Yay, we're home!

112
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,088
Let's go that way.

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,302
Welcome back!

114
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,929
Ms. Rena!

115
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,015
You're back early.

116
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,268
You went for a walk?

117
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,270
Yes.

118
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,730
Kokoro.

119
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,275
Come to Mommy, Kokoro!

120
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,035
You smell like your dad, Kokoro.

121
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,039
The smell of flowers, perhaps?

122
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,961
We went to a park nearby
so it could be that.

123
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,340
Did you have fun?
You do love flowers, don't you?

124
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,484
Kokoro.

125
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,068
What's wrong?

126
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:08,946
Kokoro…

127
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,365
Oh? What's up with Kokoro?

128
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,118
-She's been crying for a while.
-Oh?

129
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,039
Do you just want our attention?
Is that why?

130
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,166
Kokoro?

131
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,129
-Hey, I have an idea.
-Huh?

132
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,256
-Let's go for a walk.
-I can't…

133
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,258
I have work.

134
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,219
But it's your day off.

135
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,014
The flowers for the recital venue
aren't ready.

136
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,434
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,103
I wish I could go.

138
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:42,939
It's okay.

139
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,316
Come home soon though.

140
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,776
I will.

141
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,709
Alright.

142
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,170
-Thank you for coming.
-Not at all!

143
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,798
We can't talk about it in the house.

144
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,885
-So on the day, I will…
-Ms. Tachibana!

145
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,973
What's up, Rena?

146
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:22,979
Apparently it will rain tonight
so I wanted to bring you an umbrella.

147
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,231
Oh, thank you so much.

148
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,368
You've been so busy lately.

149
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,003
Shall we make a bouquet together?

150
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,631
No, it's okay.

151
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,719
-I need to practice the piano.
-Okay.

152
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,934
I hope work goes smoothly.
See you later, Makoto.

153
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,103
Thanks.

154
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,439
Let's go, Kokoro.

155
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,816
-Get home safe.
-Okay!

156
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,906
I'm sorry about that.

157
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,744
No problem at all! I'm fine.

158
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,413
I didn't think she'd come without calling!

159
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:27,001
So kind of her to bring an umbrella.
She really loves you.

160
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,377
It's lovely.

161
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,341
Shall we head out?

162
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,051
Yes, let's go.

163
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,521
SUNNY
0% CHANCE OF RAIN

164
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,662
This is such a cute shop!

165
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,167
A birthday party needs…

166
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,503
a party hat!

167
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,270
Oh wow, Kokoro would love that!

168
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,149
There's all so cute!

169
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,485
They really are.

170
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,986
What color do you like?

171
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,863
Hmm… I don't know.

172
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,420
-I'm going to check downstairs, too.
-Okay.

173
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,814
<i>I think we're basically done!</i>

174
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,358
What are you thinking for her present?

175
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,987
Hm… What should I get her this year?

176
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,074
-Finding a gift takes time, doesn't it?
-Yes.

177
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,035
I like thinking about it though.

178
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,164
Whenever I wrap my customers' gifts,

179
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,332
I wish I could

180
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,544
let the receiver know
how much thought went into it.

181
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,007
I knew it, but you really are so sweet.

182
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,843
-You knew it?
-Sorry. I just…

183
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,763
Oh?

184
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,978
-Do you like this writer?
-Yes, I do.

185
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,022
Do you read, Ms. Tachibana?

186
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,775
I used to.

187
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,944
Really? Any recommendations?

188
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,783
THE SILENT DISAPPEARANCE

189
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,039
Huh. I didn't expect
that you like this kind of book.

190
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,210
Yeah, I like mystery novels
and horror stories.

191
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,669
Me too.

192
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,463
I love them!

193
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,050
Any recommendations?

194
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,053
Ms. Tachibana?

195
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,764
Oh, I'm sorry!

196
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,642
If you like this author,

197
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,772
I think you'll like this trilogy.

198
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,901
That looks interesting!

199
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,459
So that was a lie…

200
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,761
Ms. Tachibana!

201
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,681
<i>Kokoro's asleep so let's have some tea!</i>

202
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,101
I really enjoy baking lately.

203
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,147
Remember we bonded
over butter roles, Sachiko?

204
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,234
I remember clearly.

205
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,444
Sorry, I just called you Sachiko.

206
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,488
-Apologies.
-Not at all!

207
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,240
-I don't mind it.
-Really?

208
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,409
Then Sachiko it is!

209
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,829
How about you?

210
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,207
What do you like to do in your free time?

211
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,293
Uh…

212
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,088
I like to take long walks
and listen to music.

213
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,256
I see.

214
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,467
Is that what you did last weekend?

215
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,265
I went shopping that day, actually.
What did you do?

216
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:56,645
Us three went for a walk near the beach.
We hadn't done that in a while.

217
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,441
-That sounds lovely.
-It was.

218
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,902
Since I was young,

219
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,449
I had no doubt that I was going
to marry Makoto someday.

220
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,162
Makoto moved to my hometown
when I was ten.

221
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,123
I had no friends back then,

222
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,208
but he became my best friend

223
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,337
and he never left my side.

224
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:27,968
I just thought
I can never live without him.

225
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,599
That's lovely.

226
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,894
You two are such an ideal couple.

227
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,648
And you, Sachiko?

228
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,109
Have you ever felt this way about anyone?

229
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,583
The way I play…

230
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,419
it's really boring, isn't it?

231
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,381
I like it.

232
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,675
It sounds warm

233
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,885
and pleasant to me.

234
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,304
Thanks.

235
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,849
I want to hear more.

236
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,229
You're the only one who'd say that!

237
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,399
You think so?

238
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,442
Yes.

239
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,588
<i>-Mr. Bando murdered…</i>
<i>-Just stay there forever!</i>

240
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,507
<i>Why did he kill himself then?</i>

241
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,676
<i>It was out of guilt, wasn't it?</i>

242
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,511
Makoto's incapable…

243
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,556
of loving someone.

244
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,557
<i>He never can.</i>

245
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,311
Sachiko?

246
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,650
I'm sorry! I need the bathroom.

247
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,661
MAKOTO HANAI
THANK YOU FOR THE OTHER DAY

248
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,872
Hey, Sachiko?

249
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,067
Sawako!

250
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,417
What's this?

251
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,837
Rena! Happy birthday!

252
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,966
Wow! You guys!

253
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,721
Happy birthday!

254
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,223
Thank you!

255
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,226
-Yay!
-Woo-hoo!

256
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,977
I honestly had no idea!

257
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,938
We wanted to surprise you!

258
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,731
Isn't this great?

259
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,108
This is amazing!

260
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,654
Ready, go!

261
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,327
-Happy birthday, Rena!
-Happy birthday!

262
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,455
Ms. Tachibana was the one
who planned it all.

263
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,415
And we all helped her out.

264
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,668
-Oh, wow! Really?
-Yep!

265
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,920
Thank you so much, Sachiko.

266
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,714
I feel emotional…

267
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,801
I've wanted these for ages!

268
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,762
I'm so happy. Thank you, Makoto.

269
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,809
-I'm glad. They suit you.
-They're so cute!

270
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,289
It went well!

271
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,043
And it's all thanks to you.

272
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,675
Not at all.

273
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,219
I'm glad she enjoyed it.

274
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,904
<i>-What do you think?</i>
<i>-I want to know more about Ms. Tachibana.</i>

275
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,072
<i>It sounded… familiar.</i>

276
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,117
You mean, Makoto's mother was murdered?

277
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,911
<i>It can't be…</i>

278
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,870
