1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,424
I'm Sachiko Tachibana.

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,427
I was born in 1991,

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,345
on December 19th.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,683
My hobbies are cooking
and listening to music…

5
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,239
"Don’t let her fool you.
She’s an absolute monster."

6
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,450
A monster…

7
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,786
MURDERER'S DAUGHTER

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,204
STUDENT MURDERS TEACHER

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,330
MR. BANDO…
SUICIDE…

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,667
LIKE PARENT, LIKE CHILD

11
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,537
Hello.

12
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,581
I'm Sachiko Tachibana.

13
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,793
Please come in, Ms. Tachibana.

14
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,889
Your hobbies are cooking and…

15
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,599
listening to music?

16
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,101
How lovely!

17
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,814
What kind of music do you listen to?

18
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,441
I like Brahms, Debussy, and…

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,239
It feels shallow to say
I like classical music to you though.

20
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:58,993
No, I love them too. They are unassuming,
but still so very beautiful.

21
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,790
So, Ms. Tachibana…

22
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,626
You have two years
experience in babysitting…

23
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,047
But the thing is,
Kokoro is a sensitive child.

24
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,425
-I prefer someone more experienced--
-Um…

25
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,721
I might not have a lot
of actual experience,

26
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,141
but I am a certified babysitter,

27
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:25,812
a child psychological counselor,
and a pediatric first aider.

28
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,897
I will do anything to support you

29
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,527
so you can have some time for yourself
to relax and feel refreshed.

30
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,242
Thank you.

31
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,621
However…

32
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:49,502
I feel like your enthusiasm
and desperation feels a little

33
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,628
abnormal?

34
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,631
Sorry.

35
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,593
-I’m probably overthinking it!
-No. I mean…

36
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,262
-I…
-Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.

37
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,932
I was just taken aback a bit, that’s all.

38
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,435
Your tea…

39
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,520
It's getting cold.

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,694
Hey, hey…

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,154
What's wrong?

42
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,864
Um…

43
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,534
May I try…

44
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,953
holding her once?

45
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,247
No, that's okay.

46
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,002
What's wrong?

47
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,945
I look ugly in that photo, don’t I?

48
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,030
No, not at all.

49
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,575
Stop staring, it's an embarrassing photo.

50
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,126
Did you go to Misaki Gakuen High School,
Ms. Hanai?

51
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,670
Yes…

52
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,714
How did you know?

53
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,174
I used to live nearby.

54
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,261
-What?
-I recognized the uniform.

55
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,137
Are you serious?

56
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,639
Where did you live?

57
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:30,061
Do you remember there was a bakery
behind the church?

58
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,854
-Yes, I do.
-That same street.

59
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,940
-Really?
-Yes.

60
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,901
I used to go to that bakery all the time!

61
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,113
My absolute favorite was the…

62
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,698
butter roll!

63
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,159
Oh, you too?

64
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,663
Hang on,
I might have photos of that bakery!

65
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,791
This makes me so happy!

66
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,892
You've made me want to listen
to some Brahms.

67
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,440
By the way,

68
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,694
wasn't there a murder case
at Misaki Gakuen a while ago?

69
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,237
Don't you remember?

70
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,615
It gained a lot of attention
from the media.

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,994
I don't remember that at all!

72
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,214
<i>At an apartment in Kawasaki today,</i>

73
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,427
<i>Keisuke Bando, a reporter from Maicho</i>
<i>Newspaper, was found unconscious…</i>

74
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,511
<i>14 YEARS AGO</i>

75
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,347
<i>…and was taken to a hospital</i>
<i>where he later died.</i>

76
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,268
<i>Also found dead at the entrance</i>
<i>of the apartment</i>

77
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:57,482
<i>was his colleague, Atsushi Goto,</i>
<i>with multiple stab wounds in his neck.</i>

78
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,444
<i>The knife that was used</i>
<i>had Mr. Bando's fingerprints on it.</i>

79
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,988
<i>-The police…</i>
<i>-It doesn't make any sense!</i>

80
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,533
-My husband wouldn't do this to us!
-Mom!

81
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,536
I understand how you feel, Mrs. Bando.

82
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,499
But the fingerprints and the DNA
detected matched your husbands.

83
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,000
I beg you!

84
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,294
-There were eyewitnesses, too.
-Please!

85
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,004
-Mom!
-Please reinvestigate!

86
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,798
-That's enough, Mom!
-Please!

87
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,430
Concentrate, Bando.

88
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,308
From No. 15.

89
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,186
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,438
1… 2…

91
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,869
Just stay there forever!

92
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,287
You can just live in there.

93
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,085
She actually came out!

94
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,546
-You look gross!
-Wow, she's soaked!

95
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,630
CAN YOU JUST DIE?

96
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,923
Why did she come out?

97
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,174
MURDERER'S DAUGHTER

98
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,178
My dad's not a murderer.

99
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,723
What? Did you say something?

100
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,312
My dad's not a murderer!

101
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,815
Why did he kill himself then?

102
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,986
It was out of guilt, wasn't it?

103
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,740
Nothing to say, huh?

104
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:47,049
<i>Do you think my dad</i>
<i>really murdered that man?</i>

105
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,595
Your dad…

106
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,641
He often came to my dad's work
to interview him.

107
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,479
Whenever his colleague messed up,

108
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:04,275
he said it was his fault
and covered for them.

109
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,783
What do you believe, Sawako?

110
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,453
Do you really believe…

111
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,332
that he's a killer?

112
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,544
Then…

113
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,963
you should believe in him.

114
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,050
Not just you.

115
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,927
I believe in him.

116
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,477
Thank you.

117
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,231
Please don't cry.

118
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,649
Here you go.

119
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,567
Thanks!

120
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,097
Makoto.

121
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,653
<i>What do you mean?</i>

122
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,491
Makoto's incapable…

123
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,661
of loving someone.

124
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,663
He never can.

125
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,337
I…

126
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,257
can't watch you get hurt again!

127
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,303
Rena…

128
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,406
Stop.

129
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:02,620
Your technique is great, Kurokawa,
but you convey no emotion at all.

130
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,208
It will be a huge weak point
if you want to be a professional pianist.

131
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,796
<i>I want to practice</i>
<i>our concert song a bit more.</i>

132
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,715
<i>Can we practice it together?</i>

133
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,189
Rena?

134
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,712
Rena…

135
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,924
What's going on?

136
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,192
My goodness, you're so clumsy!

137
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,195
Honestly!

138
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,539
Don't you worry!

139
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,916
Guess who did this?

140
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,960
You, Sawako!

141
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,055
This looks so familiar!

142
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,851
You know…

143
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:54,190
you are annoyingly like your dad!

144
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,693
The way you both get into people's way!

145
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,154
No way…

146
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,990
Rena, did you

147
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,742
kill my dad?

148
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,186
Sawako, thank you so much for this.

149
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,673
I'm sorry but…

150
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,304
although I do feel a connection to you,

151
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,308
at this time, I can't hire you.

152
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,769
I have to be sure.

153
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,982
Because my husband
and Kokoro are my everything.

154
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,278
I want to give it plenty of time
and choose carefully

155
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,574
to find the best possible sitter for her.

156
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,497
Kokoro, what's wrong?

157
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,375
Kokoro?

158
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,710
What's up with you?

159
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:07,257
Excuse me, when was the last time she ate?

160
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,134
Two hours ago.

161
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,264
I hate to ask this
but could I check her diapers?

162
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,183
She might have diarrhea.

163
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,601
Okay.

164
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,609
-It looks like an allergic reaction.
-Really?

165
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,569
What do I do?

166
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,739
I know a pediatric food allergist.

167
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,243
It's a holiday today,
but I can try calling.

168
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,411

170
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,915
By the way, I bought tickets
for Rena's recital!

171
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,835
Oh, you did? Thank you as always!

172
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,169
I'll let her know.

Do you want to stay for dinner?
It's almost ready!

181
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,516
I'd love to!

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,227

-Okay!

It was amazing she noticed the allergy.

184
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,484
Is she hired?

185
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,986
I'm not sure yet.

186
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,240
It would give me peace of mind
to know we can rely

187
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,202
on the babysitter
in emergency cases like today.

188
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,537
You're back to work, after all.

189
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,126
And also…

190
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,338
we'll be able to have some alone time.

191
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,741
This is Hanai.

192
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,410
Thank you for today.

193
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,038
Thank you for meeting with me.

194
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,417
You were right. It was an egg allergy.

195
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,295
You were a great help.

196
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,133
And well…

197
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,885
it got me thinking…

198
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:04,059
and we would like to have you
as our babysitter.

199
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,024
Would you accept our offer?

200
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,570
Of course!
Thank you for offering it to me.

201
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,125
Hello? I just got a call from her.

202
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,378
They hired me.

203
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,426
Now it finally begins.

204
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,056
<i>From the height of happiness</i>

205
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,476
<i>to making life hell for her.</i>

206
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,690
An unimaginable living hell.

207
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,611
-See you.
-Who are you?

208
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,113
<i>Her dad doesn't seem to trust me.</i>

209
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,157
<i>Don't let your guard down.</i>

210
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,575
<i>I need your help.</i>

211
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,327
Do you admit it or not?

212
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,786
