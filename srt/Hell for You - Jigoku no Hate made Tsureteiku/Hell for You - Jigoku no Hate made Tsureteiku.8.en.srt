1
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,048
(Hanai Rena) Who are you?

2
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,010
Who is it?

3
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:15,181
(Tachibana Sachiko) I am Tachibana Sachiko

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,726
(Reina) Ahhh

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,271
Me in high school

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,899
There was a senior I admired so much

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:29,612
She was a very ordinary person

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,698
That ordinary

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,993
It was very special to me

10
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,371
But

11
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,373
she

12
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,543
You killed someone

13
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,839
His father is a murderer

14
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,551
That senior also killed someone and set fire to it

15
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,803
Ahahaha

16
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,098
Hey, it's an incredible monster parent and child, right?

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,311
And

18
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,856
After that

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,444
My senior was in a coma all the time

20
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,783
One day I left the hospital

21
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,620
Apparently he committed suicide in the sea

22
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,583
But this is the important thing

23
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,425
The corpse hasn't risen yet

24
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,054
Why did you tell me that story?

25
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,391
He looks like his senior

26
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,018
Sachiko-san

27
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:46,231
How to speak and how to play the piano

28
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,399
Just like my senior

29
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,194
Please let go

30
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,073
Haa haa haa...

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,785
(Reina) Hey you

32
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,745
Really Tachibana Sachiko?

33
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,332
What does it mean?

34
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,255
Hmm, yes

35
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,133
Reina?

36
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,969
No!

37
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,516
(The cry of my heart)

38
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,017
(Sachiko) Sorry, here you go

39
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,352
It was scary

40
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,440
If Reina has doubts about me

41
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,443
I'm quitting my sitter today

42
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,196
but

43
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,616
I have only one request

44
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:44,747
Please cherish and raise Kokoro-san

45
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,048
This is a record of Kokoro's growth so far

46
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,472
Never feed egg whites

47
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,141
Otherwise, like the other day

48
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,226
It causes an allergic reaction

49
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,353
I really really please

50
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,116
Who are you planning?

51
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,912
This child's mother is me

52
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,333
My heart is

53
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:33,421
It's the crystallization of my love and Makoto

54
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,424
It's not a crystallization of love

55
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,634
teeth?

56
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,427
(Sachiko) Reina

57
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,014
He gave birth to Kokoro just to keep Makoto connected

58
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,310
If you cry, you're loud and laugh, you get annoyed

59
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,395
I almost killed Kokoro many times

60
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,732
For those of you

61
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,194
I don't have a mother qualification

62
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,033
Make eye contact with Kokoro even once

63
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,953
Have you ever said you love me?

64
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,537
(Reina) Noisy

65
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,165
(Sachiko) Do you know what Kokoro's favorite toy is?

66
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,250
(Reina) Noisy

67
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,459
(Sachiko) If you're hungry

68
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,420
You don't even know that you have the habit of snipping your mouth

69
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,005
In the end, Reina is Kokoro...

70
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,383
It's loud, you're shut up!

71
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,468
No silence, this buckmon!

72
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,682
I'll make you regret living

73
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,020
(Hanai Makoto) Reina?

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,613
Sincerity?

75
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,239
(The cry of my heart)

76
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,573
(The cry of my heart)

77
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,573
Why...

78
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,534
(The cry of my heart)

79
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,785
(The cry of my heart)

80
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,785
(Myth) What does this mean?

81
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,167
Sincerity... Sincerity!

82
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,963
This guy was all lies

83
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,341
I disguised everything and got into it all in the future

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,512
Heart It was almost dangerous

85
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,806
heart…

86
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,935
Sorry mom didn't notice at all

87
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,355
You have to report it to the police soon

88
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,566
Have this person's monster peeled off

89
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,525
Let's stop Reina

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,737
picture?

91
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,952
Going to the police

92
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,121
Reina

93
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,624
It's you

94
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,336
picture?

95
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,764
What... what does that mean?

96
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,391
I knew everything

97
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,644
(Reina) What are you talking about? Myth

98
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,481
Even if I know, what on earth...

99
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,860
You've ever fucked

100
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,904
It's all about crime

101
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,908
Last night

102
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,787
I got a call from Tachibana

103
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,622
(Sachiko) It's Tachibana

104
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,166
I have an important story to Makoto

105
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,091
Tachibana-san

106
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,222
Juria?

107
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,062
picture…

108
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,406
What is this

109
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,454
this is…

110
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,456
Why is this picture here?

111
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,420
It was caught in Professor Kurokawa's research diary

112
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,382
(Makoto) This is the place where I and Reina first met

113
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,634
Why did this

114
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,770
Sawako Senpai...

115
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,733
After that, Kouwako's senior man came

116
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,819
Lucky

117
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,447
If I keep blaming the old man like this

118
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,449
I thought I could pass it by suicide

119
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,452
And if I kicked it all out

120
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,996
It's fallen

121
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,337
(Juria) Yukikazuko's father and his colleague reporter

122
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,007
And my brother was killed

123
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,217
To your wife

124
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,763
(Sachiko) I had plastic surgery on my face

125
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,600
Buying Tachibana Sachiko's family register

126
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,602
For two

127
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,356
I've been preparing to revenge on Reina

128
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,859
Please wait a minute

129
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,028
No, but Yukikazuko-senpai...

130
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,825
I'm dead

131
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,495
I went to visit the grave before

132
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,750
There's nothing filled there

133
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,211
(Juria) That guy's absolute

134
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,839
The two of us vow to make us enjoy living hell

135
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,507
Infiltrate your house

136
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,219
Finally I realized what's more important than anything else.

137
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,261
That's you

138
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,765
Honestly, the quickest one is

139
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,308
To die here

140
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:37,725
To die here

141
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:37,725
(Sachiko)

142
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,434
(Sachiko)

143
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,527
What I'm worried about is Kokoro

144
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,197
If Reina is revealed to be a murderer

145
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,407
Kokoro-san is

146
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:57,620
She is labeled as a murderer's daughter

147
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,331
That feeling

148
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:06,003
I know better than anyone else

149
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,095
All the evidence is available

150
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:20,059
Reina should be subject to social sanctions

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,771
And then

152
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:28,651
I'll leave it to Makoto's decision

153
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,113
Tachibana-san...

154
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,949
It's Kowako

155
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,870
Bando Koukako

156
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:55,928
Kouwako... Senior

157
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,853
Makoto

158
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,775
Sorry I couldn't say it forever

159
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,487
Why...

160
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,533
Why didn't you say it?

161
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,164
Many times

162
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,168
The words that went all the way to my throat

163
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,588
I swallowed it

164
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,508
If possible

165
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,763
Makoto and Kokoro didn't want to get involved

166
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,765
I didn't want to hurt

167
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,450
Reina-chan

168
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,371
I

169
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,042
Bando Koichiko

170
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,128
As expected, you...

171
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,382
Thank you for remembering

172
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,139
He has a proper rhythm and is alive, right?

173
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,143
It's all thanks to Reina

174
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,314
For this moment today

175
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,275
Because I've lived a life of death

176
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,571
Sincere

177
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,367
Makoto: This woman just says all the bullshits

178
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,911
Hey, don't believe it

179
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,102
There's a video of Reina confessing to the crime

180
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,148
It's over already

181
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,150
Reina

182
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:18,946
Hey

183
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,157
I don't like it

184
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,036
Don't say that

185
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,371
Let's go to the police

186
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,123
Sincere

187
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,667
Reina

188
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,672
heart…

189
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,134
Kokoro can't live without mom, right?

190
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,261
That's the case for mom too

191
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,680
If I hadn't had my heart I would have died

192
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,723
Stop it already

193
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,268
I don't know?

194
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,770
It's unseemly, that lie acting

195
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,650
You don't love me, you know, your mind

196
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,447
I wish it was all my mistake

197
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,657
But it's weird not to notice

198
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,243
I'm

199
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,579
Reina's husband

200
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,834
He's the father of the heart

201
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,841
I wonder if Reina will develop maternal identity someday

202
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,844
I initially believed

203
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,514
But

204
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,601
It was impossible after all

205
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,611
Reina

206
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,242
Reina

207
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,541
(Reina) I'm really sorry

208
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,711
As Makoto says

209
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,673
Still to me

210
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,927
Maybe there's no emergence of motherhood

211
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:10,349
I was aware of that myself

212
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,769
I promise

213
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,021
I…

214
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,192
You'll be the best mother in your heart

215
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,487
Become Makoto's perfect wife

216
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,782
I'm confident

217
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,245
Hey, sin...

218
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,458
I

219
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,253
If it's for the sake of your heart

220
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,089
Anything can be done

221
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,261
Just give me another chance

222
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,601
I want to become a real family with the three of us

223
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,480
Please

224
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,524
please

225
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,653
please

226
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,376
No way...

227
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,046
The heart is

228
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,132
I'll raise it

229
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,177
Let's turn ourselves in

230
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,222
Let's atone for our sins

231
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:44,485
(Reina's cry)

232
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:06,256
(Reina's laughter)

233
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,011
Oh, I think I won

234
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,476
Makoto was also on my side.

235
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,812
This will help you get revenge

236
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,815
You think so

237
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,860
But

238
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,655
Makoto is

239
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,866
It has to be me

240
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,164
It was me who saved Makoto

241
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,251
Makoto is

242
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,670
It has to be me!

243
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,850
-(Makoto) Reina Calm down-(Reina) I don't like it!

244
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,019
(Reina) Makoto is mine!

245
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,520
I won't give it to you guys!

246
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,565
It's because of you!

247
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,817
Makoto is mine!

248
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,402
Sincere!

249
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,947
(Makoto) I don't want to hate Reina any more

250
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,241
(Reina) Makoto! Makoto!

(Makoto) I will also submit this with the evidence

258
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,923
Please wait with your heart

259
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,801
I consulted with a lawyer

260
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,387
I take Reina to the police.

261
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,348
Her sin

262
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,102
I think I'll carry it together

263
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,609
We

264
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,946
Why did it become like this?

265
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,410
(Vibration sound on mobile phone)

266
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,084
(Reina) Makoto

267
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,010
lastly…

268
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,515
Can I hug you?

269
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:26,480

270

271
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,255
(Makoto) What if

272
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,382
Teacher Yes it's fine

273
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,428
Reina!?

274
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,814
(Juria) What about Reina?

275
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,774
Did you stay with you?

276
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,235
(Makoto) I got a call from my lawyer

277
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,112
Finally, talk to Reina...

278
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,336
(Juria)

279
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,111
(Makoto) I have to find Reina as soon as possible

280
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,238
(Reina) I'll tell you all the truth

281
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,364
(Sachiko) I've changed

282
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,449
I won't fool you anymore

283
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,950
(Juria) Answer the question

284
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,911
(Reina) Are you ready, right?
