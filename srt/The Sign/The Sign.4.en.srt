00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
This is the girl I often saw in my dream.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,400
I’m going to start from where it begins.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,177
Your destiny have been entwined since your past lives.

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,588
Are you afraid of the Naga statue?

5
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:25,280
I’m the boy who almost got drowned, the one that Tharn had rescused on that day.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,982
Attention!

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,780
Nice to meet you all.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,862
I’m Police Major Akkanee Assawawaisoon...

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,211
your team leader.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,605
They all have the same cause of death.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,542

The Sign

28
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:17,440
Are you saying that you killed Mr. Korn…

29
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:19,988
because someone ordered you to do it?

30
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:24,540
Yes, I was forced.

31
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:30,502
Are you sure?

32
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,500
Didn’t you kill him as a revenge?

33
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,977
You sued him for the charge of sexual assault but unfortunately the case got dismissed.

34
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:43,620
I didn’t have any choice. He captured me.

35
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:48,617
And forced me to kill that man.

36
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:51,540
I was so scared.

37
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:53,817
I didn’t want to do it.

38
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,508
But when I saw him dead...

39
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,862
I felt so glad.

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,245
Now, he won’t be able to harm other people anymore.

41
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,640
So, he was raped by his step-father?

42
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:23,782
A victim is a victim regardless of the gender.

43
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:26,297
The man who got killed is called Ong.

44
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,720
He was charged with raping his step-son and just got out of jail.

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,342
Then he committed the same crime again.

46
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:37,702
You said someone abducted you and locked you up with your step-father.

47
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,022
Can you recall what that man looks like?

48
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:42,520
(Crying)

49
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,850
I can’t remember.

50
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,540
Someone suddenly put a handkerchief over my nose.

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn’t even know when I passed out.

52
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:58,000
Pat!

53
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,302
I had no idea how I got there.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,691
HURRY, PAT. PLEASE COME HELP ME!!

55
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:08,137
Can you tell us anything about the place you were locked up in?

56
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,525
It was a square room.

57
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:12,982
It was dark.

58
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,131
And very dirty.

59
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,005
There were lots of tools for torturing.

60
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,165
Was the killer always there with you?

61
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:33,222
No.

62
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,205
When he appeared...

63
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:40,228
he would wear a clown mask...

64
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:44,697
and black outfit.

65
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:48,660
He would give orders and make me do as he said.

66
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:53,390
If I refused...

67
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,548
he would torture me. I was so scared.

68
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,811
So, I had to do as he said.

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,605
The victim tried to hit on you.

70
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:09,634
But you weren’t interested and turned him down. Am I right?

71
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,502
He was a scumbag.

72
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,308
He tried to rape me.

73
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,937
When I told him I would go to the police,

74
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,205
he would tell everyone that I tried to seduce him and that I wanted to sleep with him.

75
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,371
So what? Those sexy dresses and shot skirts...however I dress up is my own business.

76
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,748
He doesn’t have any right to mess with my body.

77
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:32,845
Please calm down.

78
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,140
Do you remember how the mask man wanted you to kill the victim?

79
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:44,937
Cut off his tongue.

80
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,740
(Screaming in pain)

81
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:51,771
Lashing.

82
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:56,720
Cut off his genital.

83
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:59,657
(Screaming in pain)

84
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:05,531
And shot him in the face.

85
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:15,180
Where’s the genital that got cut off?

86
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,060
The result from the forensic examination…

87
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:30,800
shows that the killer had thoroughly cleaned the body of all three victims before he hung them up.

88
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:33,737
No fingerprints were found...

89
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:36,700
on the victims’ bodies and around the areas where the bodies were found.

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,400
There wasn’t any witness or other solid evidence too.

91
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,205
We already asked our three suspects to do the lie detector test.

92
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,331
The results were negative.

93
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:52,674
The only evidence found in the crime scene were the victims’ DNA.

94
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:56,205
The killer is very careful.

95
00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:57,977
He didn’t leave any trace or evidence.

96
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:09,460
The body of the first victim was found in the middle of the wood.

97
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,182
The second one was found near the road sign.

98
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,668
And the third one was found near the canal.

99
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:24,020
The killer dumped these bodies around the area of the deserted wood...

100
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,582
which was once where the mental hospital situated.

101
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:32,091
But judging from the bodies of the victims...

102
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:34,160
I don’t think there’s only one killer.

103
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:37,108
The killer probably did this...

104
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:41,474
because he wanted to send us a sign or signal something.

105
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,154
Our three suspects also said that…

106
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:52,308
the killer abducted them and forced them to kill the victims.

107
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:57,497
He tortured them and turned their fear into revenge so that they’d kill.

108
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,142
He’s definitely a psycho.

109
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:04,708
But what they told us…

110
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:07,897
was quite hard to believe somehow.

111
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,857
Who’d force someone to do something like that?

112
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:13,908
But this reminds me of another case in the past…

113
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:18,000
where a group of women came together to plot a murder on their exes who had dumped them.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,525
And made it looked like a robbery instead.

115
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,702
I think there’s a similarity here.

116
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,382
The three suspects might be in this together.

117
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:27,828
But I don’t think they were lying.

118
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,862
I’ve rechecked the interrogation tapes over and over again.

119
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,331
They didn’t hesitate or beat around the bush when they answered the questions.

120
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,360
It didn’t look like they had prepared the answers either.

121
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,560
They were just telling us what had happened to them.

122
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,800
I think they were telling the truth.

123
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:49,691
I agreed with Thongthai.

124
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,571
During the interrogation with Miss Pear.

125
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,091
I looked her in the eyes but she didn’t budge or avert her eyes at all.

126
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:58,377
If they were really forced to kill the victims,

127
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:02,582
is it possible that the killer...

128
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:07,737
might use to experience this kind of violence or sexual assault before?

129
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,382
That’s why he planned the murder...

130
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,760
to take his revenge on people like the victims.

131
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:16,251
I’m going to divide you into two teams.

132
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,285
Phaya, Tharn, and Yai.

133
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,285
Find out whom the victims had met before they were captured.

134
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:25,954
Singh, Thongthai, and Khem.

135
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,445
Analyze the interrogation reports of our three suspects…

136
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:35,142
and find out the place where the killer locked up the vicitmes and killed them.

137
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,948
Make sure you check every CCTV carmera around the suspected areas.

138
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:41,542
Look for something that will lead us to the killer.

139
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:45,348
No man can commit a crime and disappear without a trace.

140
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:51,920
Hi, babe. I just got off work.

141
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,862
Do you want to eat anything? I’ll buy it on the way home.

142
00:09:57,908 --> 00:09:58,617
What?

143
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:00,125
Huh?

144
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:06,514
What did you say?

145
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:11,140
You want to eat me? You got it, babe.

146
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,640
I’ll be right there.

147
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,988
Please wait for me.

148
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,348
- Let's go.
- Tharn, I can’t drop you off today.

149
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:20,697
Go back with Phaya then.

150
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:23,611
- Phaya, can you drop him off for me?
- What?

151
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:24,720
- Okay
- See you then.

152
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,220
What the..? Yai!

153
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:27,805
Geez, Yai...

154
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,140
Let’s go. You’re coming with me today.

155
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,140
Don’t bother. I’ll call a cab.

156
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,348
My place and your place are on the opposite way.

157
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:46,262
Wait, I said I’d drop you off.

158
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:48,537
I’ll call a cab.

159
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,765
I said I’ll drop you off.

160
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:57,691
Tharn. Phaya.

161
00:10:57,988 --> 00:11:00,845
I’m going to gather as much information as I can tonight.

162
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:03,645
So that we can find out something that will lead us to the killer.

163
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:06,102
You two hurry up and go back home to get some sleep.

164
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:08,034
We have a lot to do tomorrow.

165
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,828
Our time is running out.

166
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,565
But our time has just begun.

167
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:14,948
What the...

168
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,211
Let’s go, babe. I’ll make a bowl of warm water for you to dip your feet in.

169
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:20,365
Behave yourself.

170
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,851
Maybe I should also give you a massage. It’ll surely be a long day tomorrow.

171
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,468
See you then.

172
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:27,874
Baby.

173
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:34,022
Let’s go. I’m hungry.

174
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:38,354
But I’m not. I want to go home.

175
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:43,900
But I am. Just come and eat with me first.

176
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:45,085
Then I’ll drop you off.

177
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,194
Let’s go.

178
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,285
Here you go, it’s boiling hot!

179
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:00,640
Hey, watch out!

180
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:02,780
Go and take care of the customers over there.

181
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,845
What do you want?

182
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,260
Will you be able to finish them all?

183
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:17,760
I haven’t eaten anything today.

184
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,982
Neither have you.

185
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:21,268
You were reading the case files all day long.

186
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:23,188
Eat up.

187
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:26,022
I want this case closed as soon as possible.

188
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:30,171
I’ve revised the interrogation reports of our three suspects.

189
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:35,300
I want to find out more about the noise that those three suspects heard.

190
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,988
If we can identify that sound...

191
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,857
I’m sure we’d be able to find out the place where the murder took place.

192
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,822
The noise there was so loud. So annoying.

193
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:47,702
I could hear some noise. It was so irritating.

194
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:52,180
There was a loud noise in the background. It got on my nerve.

195
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,617
Stop thinking about the case and eat up.

196
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:07,140
Where do you think the killer...

197
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,000
got rid of the genital that he cut off?

198
00:13:11,062 --> 00:13:12,514
Maybe in this pot?

199
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,737
Here, just eat it, the genital that you are so fond of.

200
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,565
Geez, I got food all over me.

201
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,022
I thought you wanted it so badly.

202
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,960
Oh, I’m sorry. Are you all right?

203
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,868
Your life is short.

204
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:38,160
You were supposed to be dead since when you were young.

205
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:43,580
But your parents gave you to the Abbot...

206
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:47,780
to extend your life and try to change your destiny.

207
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:51,702
That’s why you’re still alive today.

208
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,480
But young man, I warn you.

209
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,257
You must look out for those whom you’ve wronged in the past life.

210
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,980
They are very near.

211
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,697
They are coming to take your life.

212
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:12,228
Please excuse me.

213
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,377
Don’t ever let go of that man.

214
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,868
Don’t let those whom he’s wronged in his past life...

215
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:32,860
take him away from you.

Hi, Nee.

218
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,571
Phaya, where are you?

219
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,937
I’ll call you back. I’m going home now.

220
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,582
Be quick then. Grandma is worried about you.

221
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,320
Okay.

222
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:08,720
Who are you looking for?

223
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:11,851
That weird granny.

224
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:15,897
I just turned the other way to pick up a call...

225
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,497
and she was gone.

226
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:18,925
Let’s eat.

227
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:31,180
But what she told me was exactly like what the Abbot said.

228
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,154
Really?

229
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:34,262
Yeah.

230
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,948
Why don’t you go back home...

231
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:58,140
and sleep on your own bed? Woudln’t it feel more comfy?

232

00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:50,669
Ouch!

355
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:52,520
Ouch!

356
00:28:59,228 --> 00:29:00,966
(Phone Message Sound)

357
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:10,555
(Phone Buzzing)

358
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,915
Hello.

359
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:15,412
(Yai: ‘Hey, I already left the office.’)

360
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:19,652
(Yai: ‘Sing told me that we should also check the CCTV at the coffee shop...’)

361
00:29:20,143 --> 00:29:21,903
(Yai: ‘…around the time before Meena got kidnapped.’)

362
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:23,983
Yai: ‘Hurry up and meet me there.’)

363
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:26,898
Okay, I’ll see you there.

364
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:29,149
Let’s go.

365
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:30,280
Where are you going?

366
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,498
Calling a cab.

367
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:34,578
What for?

368
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:35,378
Come here.

369
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,338
Geez, what is it?

370
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:41,800
Come here.

371
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,486
Take this.

372
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,743
I thought you said it’s broken.

373
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:49,800
Well…

374
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:53,583
I got it fixed.

375
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:56,852
- The engine probably got overheated. It already cooled down overnight.
- I see.

376
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:59,263
Your bike has a self-fixing service too?

377
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:01,160
Why are you so curious? Just hop on.

378
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,663
Let’s go.

379
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:13,058
(Motorbike engine staring up)

380
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:30,440
Yai.

381
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:31,778
Hey.

382
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,835
You came by motorbike?

383
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:35,663
Yeah.

384
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:38,863
Don’t you have to return the helmet?

385
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:42,292
No need.

386
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,258
- Hello.   /   - Hey.

387
00:30:45,252 --> 00:30:46,258
Are you here together?

388
00:30:46,852 --> 00:30:48,303
He picked me up on the way.

389
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:55,480
What’s wrong?

390
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:57,640
Why do your trousers look so small?

391
00:30:58,018 --> 00:30:59,960
They’re his trousers. They’re so…

392
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,829
Ouch!

393
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:02,383
Shut up.

394
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:09,926
He slept at my place last night.

395
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:12,806
Huh?

396
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:17,355
Let’s get to work then.

397
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:18,715
Fine.

398
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:26,238
I already made an appointment with the barista. He was there on the day of the incident.

399
00:31:26,246 --> 00:31:26,978
(Cracked Sound)

400
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:29,298
What’s that sound?

401
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:32,783
It’s from me.

402
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,995
Shit!

403
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:41,606
Geez, why didn’t you be more careful?

404
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,012
It was your trousers.

405
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:44,006
- They’re so fucking...
- Stop!

406
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,355
Just go and fix it.

407
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,395
Your little brother is pointing at my face right now.

408
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,578
I’ll go buy a new one then.

409
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:55,355
Geez.

410
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:57,583
I can still see it when I close my eyes.

411
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:04,475
What?

412
00:32:04,863 --> 00:32:05,766
Nothing.

413
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:09,686
Do you have anything you want to tell me?

414
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:11,678
About work.

415
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:13,903
Let’s wait for Phaya first.

416
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:17,618
What are you thinking? Nothing happened.

417
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:19,846
I haven’t said anything.

418
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:22,989
Sooo…

419
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,749
how was last night?

420
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:27,320
Last night, my foot.

421
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:28,246
Let’s talk about work.

422
00:32:31,286 --> 00:32:32,223
Hey!

423
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:33,858
Get down!

424
00:32:33,858 --> 00:32:34,840
(Bomb exploding)

425
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,098
(Screaming)

426
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:37,435
Miss Mayris.

427
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:40,158
Tharn, take care of Miss Mayris!

428
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:47,118
The Sign
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

429
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,220
The Sign

430
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:00,691
That’s all we’ve got on the CCTV.

431
00:33:02,222 --> 00:33:07,091
Did you notice anything unusual on that day?

432
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:12,325
I’m afraid not.

433
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:22,554
Please excuse me.

434
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:40,611
According to the report, this is the place
where Miss Meena bumped into a man
and their phones got swapped.

435
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:47,582
It also said that her car was parked in the blind spot.

436
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,577
So, the CCTV couldn’t capture the person who kidnapped her.

437
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,742
For the man whose phone got swapped with Miss Meena’s,

438
00:33:55,982 --> 00:33:57,670
she said she couldn’t see his face clearly...

439
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,845
because he was wearing a mask and a hoody.

440
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:03,674
The police have already gathered all the evidence they could find here.

441
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,805
The CCTV camera at the back of the shop is broken.

442
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:08,931
So, there’s no other clues or evidence.

443
00:34:10,977 --> 00:34:12,897
Why are there so many coincidences?

444
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,880
Or did he plan it all out?

445
00:34:19,502 --> 00:34:21,800
The man who kidnapped Miss Meena...

446
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:26,588
must know every single thing about her daily life.

447
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,640
I’m sure he must make a mistake somewhere.

448
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,468
Or something unexpected might happen...

449
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:38,062
that would make us able to find some clue here.

450
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,730
Look at this place, it’s beautiful. The atmosphere is really nice too.

451
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,670
Of course, or else many people wouldn’t be talking about it every single day.

452
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,510
Three days ago,

453
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,154
I was watching a review where the influencer came to eat the burnt cheesecake here.

454
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:54,980
It looked so yummy that I wanted to have it too.
I’m so lucky it still hasn’t been sold out today.

455
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,300
Then, can you film me while I’m making a content today?

456
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,091
I want to do a review too.

457
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,500
Sure. Give me your phone.

458
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,440
Sure.

459
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:05,377
Excuse me?

460
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,857
I’m a special investigation officer.

461
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:10,565
I’d like to ask you a few questions.

462
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:47,788
Wait! Stop!

463
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,068
Isn’t this Miss Meena?

464
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,260
Oh! It’s really her.

465
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:03,411
Play it.

466
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,400
What I’m having here is the burnt cheescake...

467
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,828
which is a signature menu of this cafe.

468
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,180
Wow, it smells so good.

469
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,620
- Now, let’s...
- Stop!

470
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,542
...dig in...

471
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:20,280
Rewind back a little.

472
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,417
See that man? The one with a hoody and a mask.

473
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,171
He perfectly matches the description that Miss Meena told us.

474
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,177
Let’s show this clip to Singh.

475
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:38,165
He might be able to find out more clues from it.

476
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:42,954
Let’s go back then.

477
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,171
Too bad he was wearing a mask and a hoody.

478
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:53,091
Otherwise, we could have seen his face.

479
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:58,828
There’s a programme which allows you
to see more details of the person in the picture...

480
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,748
by using the facial instruction to create a rough profile of the eyes and the face structure.

481
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,502
We then compare those information with our database in order to identify the identity of our suspect.

482
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,388
Then do it.

483
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:11,171
I want to do that too.

484
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,170
But I’d need a few more days.

485
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:18,040
We need to wait for the data from the CCTV cameras around the wood.

486
00:37:18,622 --> 00:37:22,380
So that we could be certain that our suspect was actually there on the day of the incident.

487
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,125
That would lead us to where he took Miss Meena and locked her up.

488
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:33,605
Damn it

489
00:37:41,937 --> 00:37:45,420
This is Mayris, the head of forensic team. She’d help us with the case.

490
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:53,960
I just introduced you to my team.

491
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,405
Hello, my name is Mayris.

492
00:38:03,171 --> 00:38:05,800
They are all good looking this time.

493
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:10,577
Quite worthwhile to sacrifice my sleep for finding the information.

494
00:38:10,782 --> 00:38:13,050
(Sigh) Please behave, Mayris.

495
00:38:13,388 --> 00:38:14,817
The rumour you created last time still hasn’t died down yet.

496
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,114
Let’s see what you have got for us. Go ahead.

497
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,325
I’ve looked at the medical records of our three victims.

498
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:43,982
One of them was diagnosed with an allergy.

499
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,605
I also found fungal spores in the victim’s lungs.

500
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,285
So, I decided to examine the lungs of the other two victims.

501
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,000
And found fungal spores in both of their lungs too.

502
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:03,354
The place where the killer locked up the victims...

503
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,565
is probably somwhere very damp...

504
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,680
with poor or inadequate air ventilation.

505
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,640
That’s why there are lots of fungus there.

506
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:18,097
Our suspects also said that it’s a dark room which is very damp and hard to breathe.

507
00:39:19,502 --> 00:39:21,480
Is it possible that it might be a cellar?

508
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:23,251
Yes.

509
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:28,348
It’s possible.

510
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,914
About the irritating noise in the background,

511
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:38,805
I suspect it’s probably...

512
00:39:40,142 --> 00:39:42,771
the area where we found the bodies.

513
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:46,165
In the wood near the airport.

514
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,820
The reason we couldn’t find any fingerprints or traces of secreation…

515
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,520
such as sweat or saliva of the killer on the victims’ bodies...

516
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,725
while all three suspects confirmed that...

517
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,228
the killer was also there when they were forced to torture the victims,

518
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,062
I think it’s probably because…

519
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,662
our killer knows how to destroy and wipe out all the evidence.

520
00:40:15,994 --> 00:40:20,580
He knows how to destroy the evidence and also has access to the criminal data.

521
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:25,380
Is it possible that he’s someone in our unit?

522
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,657
All three victims were charged with sexual assaults.

523
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,085
It’s impossible to know all the details about the victims just by watching the news.

524
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,914
Unless he read it from our case files.

525
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,800
- Singh.    /   - Yes, sir.

526
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,274
Go and check the case-file access record of every officer in our unit.

527
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,514
Find out who, within the past month...

528
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:55,620
had accessed to look at the case files of these three victims.

529
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:56,840
Yes, sir.

530
00:41:00,154 --> 00:41:00,930
The rest of you...

531
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,217
go and find out more clues around the area of the crime scene.

532
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:11,502
It’s possible that the killer might use
the area around the deserted wood to lock up and kill the victims.

533
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,691
Yes, sir.

534
00:41:34,017 --> 00:41:36,702
This place used to be a part of the mental hospital.

535
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,817
But it has been left deserted for so long...

536
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,314
so the druggies often come here to take refuge.

537
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,040
There were also murders and suicides at this place.

538
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,070
It’s quite similar to the Aokigahara forest in Japan.

539
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,108
We better hurry up.

540
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,440
Or else it’d get dark before we finish.

541
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:56,740
Ouch!

542
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,154
What’s wrong?

543
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:14,257
I just sensed something.

544
00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:18,965
Let’s get to work.

545
00:42:34,554 --> 00:42:35,354
Cruel.

546
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,148
Ouch!

547
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:12,725
It’s the noise that our suspects mentioned about.

548
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,920
That room is probably around here.

549
00:43:15,937 --> 00:43:16,840
Let’s go then.

550
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:55,034
Hey!

551
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:56,874
- Get down!
- (Screaming)

552
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,142
- (Screaming)
- Miss Mayris!

553
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:04,540
Tharn, look after her!

554
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:07,685
Ouch!

555
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:12,097
Stop!

556
00:44:13,765 --> 00:44:14,691
Stop!

557
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,257
Stop!

558
00:44:18,154 --> 00:44:19,377
I said stop!

559
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:21,091
Are you okay?

560
00:44:23,148 --> 00:44:24,954
Miss Maris!

561
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,137
(Screaming)

562
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:31,068
I’m okay. Let’s get out of here.

563
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,860
Go!

564
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:36,508
(Screaming)

565
00:44:37,354 --> 00:44:39,540
How are we going to get out of here?

566
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,940
(Coughing)

567
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,040
Stop!

568
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,382
Stop!

569
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,851
I said stop!

570
00:44:51,868 --> 00:44:52,620
Stop!

571
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,177
I said stop!
(Gunshot)

572
00:44:56,074 --> 00:44:56,897
Freeze.

573
00:44:58,268 --> 00:44:59,194
Put your hands up.

574
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:01,388
I said put your hands up.

575
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:02,405
Now!

576
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:03,960
Slowly.

577
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,660
(Fighting)

578
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,330
(Gunshot)

579
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,228
(Fighting)

580
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:16,314
(Gunshot)

581
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:22,462
Phaya.

582
00:45:24,245 --> 00:45:25,445
Miss Mayris, move!

583
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:28,702
Ahhhhh

584
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:31,205
Let’s go.

585
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,228
(Coughing)

586
00:45:35,354 --> 00:45:37,380
Please call for backup from our unit.

587
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,737
And stay here. Don’t go anywhere.

588
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:45,194
(Coughing)

589
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,140
Hello, I’d like to report an emergency case.

590
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,251
There’s a fire at the mental hospital.

591
00:45:49,274 --> 00:45:51,210
(Fighting)

592
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:51,811
Hey!

593
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:54,005
Ouch!

594
00:46:17,697 --> 00:46:19,057
Where is he?

595
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,251
(Gunshot)

596
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:39,194
Damn it!

597
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:51,468
Are you okay?

598
00:46:52,874 --> 00:46:53,900
Yeah.

599
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:03,548
My team and I came here
to find out more clues about the murder case.

600
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:05,754
How’s the situation inside?

601
00:47:05,937 --> 00:47:08,060
We were looking around in one room.

602
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:11,788
Then a man in black appeared and threw a Molotov cocktail at us.

603
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:13,500
- Serg.   /   - Yes, sir.

604
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,720
- Get our team and go inspect inside.
- Yes, sir.

605
00:47:18,577 --> 00:47:19,308
How is it?

606
00:47:32,428 --> 00:47:33,400
Stay still.

607
00:47:34,337 --> 00:47:35,400
I already am.

608
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,577
Is it done?

609
00:47:43,617 --> 00:47:44,554
Thanks.

610
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:54,451
Next time if you’re going to go after the culprit, don’t go alone like this.

611
00:47:56,657 --> 00:48:00,348
I couldn’t help it. I had to get him no matter what.

612
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:05,480
Remember what the inspector used to tell us?

613
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,708
That you shouldn’t go solo.

614
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,411
What if I couldn’t get there in time.

615
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:18,348
Do you have any idea what would happen to you?

616
00:48:20,874 --> 00:48:24,302
Geez, don’t get so overreacted.

617
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:26,520
If I got stabbed to death...

618
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,050
it was solely because of my own decision.

619
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,160
It doesn’t have anything to do with you.

620
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,582
Are you done?

621
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:33,000
I’m leaving.

622
00:48:34,074 --> 00:48:34,840
Hey.

623
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:47,045
Don’t let me hear you talking about you being dead ever again.

624
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,382
Well, I don’t want to interrupt but...

625
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:58,577
the inspector wants us to go back right now.

626
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,690
So, what was that?

627
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:14,180
Did you have to grab his collar like that?

628
00:49:14,474 --> 00:49:15,800
Is there anything I should know?

629
00:49:18,634 --> 00:49:19,662
Nothing.

630
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:33,034
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Oh, sorry.

631
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:37,260
Oops.

632
00:49:38,714 --> 00:49:39,788
I’m sorry.

633
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,690
Tell me honestly, what happened there?

634
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:54,970
Why are you so upset?

635
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,222
I already told you.

636
00:49:57,468 --> 00:49:59,674
Did you see the Sign about Phaya again?

637
00:50:00,462 --> 00:50:01,331
Yeah.

638
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,891
When I saw the Sign about other people,

639
00:50:06,668 --> 00:50:10,931
eventhough I couldn’t help them, I didn’t get so upset like when I saw the Sign about him...

640
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:12,440
and saw that he was about to die.

641
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:15,400
Why?

642
00:50:16,428 --> 00:50:18,085
Why do I care so much about him?

643
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:19,994
Why do I keep thinking of him?

644
00:50:20,714 --> 00:50:22,508
Why do I feel so scared that he’d die?

645
00:50:24,885 --> 00:50:26,531
Are you that worried about him?

646
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:49,251
Where are you guys going?

647
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,514
We’re going for dinner.

648
00:50:51,754 --> 00:50:52,737
Do you need anything?

649
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,445
Can I tag along too?

650
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:56,600
-  Of course.   /   - No.

651
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:04,420
The Sign
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

652
00:51:04,546 --> 00:51:11,526
The Sign

653
00:51:12,016 --> 00:51:15,726
Damn it! If I were also there, he wouldn’t have been able to get away like this.

654
00:51:16,566 --> 00:51:18,966
This means the culprit is someone from our unit.

655
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:20,766
That’s why he knew you and Tharn...

656
00:51:20,836 --> 00:51:23,136
went to the crime scene with Miss Mayris.

657
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:27,766
We’d find out soon. I already got his knife and gave it to the forensic team.

658
00:51:36,686 --> 00:51:37,676
Inspector.

659
00:51:38,446 --> 00:51:40,806
Do we have the identity of the culprit?

660
00:51:41,036 --> 00:51:44,896
They couldn’t find any fingerprints on the knife.

661
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:46,266
What?

662
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:50,186
That’s impossible.

663
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,766
He used that knife when we were fighting.

664
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:55,046
And he didn’t wear gloves.

665
00:51:59,796 --> 00:52:00,866
Did the forensic team overlook something druing the test?

666
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:03,086
They insisted that they had rechecked it quite a number of times.

667
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,476
But they still couldn’t find any fingerprints.

668
00:52:09,776 --> 00:52:10,916
Damn it!

669
00:52:14,596 --> 00:52:15,516
Geez.

670
00:52:19,616 --> 00:52:20,816
What the heck!

671
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:27,306
Inspector.

672
00:52:27,526 --> 00:52:29,796
I’m sure that deserted building is where the culprit killed our victims.

673
00:52:30,226 --> 00:52:32,006
- Let’s get our team to inspect there.
- No.

674
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:33,686
The building is almost destroyed during the fire.

675
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:35,876
It’d be too dangerous to go into the cellar.

676
00:52:35,896 --> 00:52:37,326
Let’s wait until we hear from the crime scene officers.

677
00:52:37,636 --> 00:52:39,306
But...Inspector! Inspector!

678
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:45,376
We have only 4 days left.

679
00:52:46,946 --> 00:52:49,346
Meanwhile, we don’t know if he’s going to commit another murder like this.

680
00:52:50,646 --> 00:52:51,826
We have to go there.

681
00:52:52,146 --> 00:52:55,206
- And get the killer.
- I’m in.

682
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:02,766
I know. I’ll be home soon.

683
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:05,056
I’m on my way. Hold on.

684
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,046
(Dropping something)

685
00:53:06,046 --> 00:53:07,126
Phaya.

686
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:10,556
Dao.

687
00:53:11,206 --> 00:53:13,026
What brings you here?

688
00:53:13,246 --> 00:53:15,026
Come here.

689
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:17,696
When did you come back from France?

690
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:19,786
Since last week.

691
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:24,146
But I didn’t want to bother you since you just started your new job.

692
00:53:24,566 --> 00:53:26,566
I’m meeting a friend around here today.

693
00:53:26,566 --> 00:53:28,236
So, I thought I could give you a surprise.

694
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:31,186
But it turns out I’m the one who is more surprised.

695
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:32,726
What is it?

696
00:53:33,136 --> 00:53:35,376
- Here it is.   /   - Ouch!

697
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:40,046
Your grandma would surely give you an earful if she sees you like this.

698
00:53:40,046 --> 00:53:43,606
I’m begging you. Please don’t tell her about this.

699
00:53:43,626 --> 00:53:44,546
Please?

700
00:53:45,226 --> 00:53:47,706
- Grandma…
- Come on. Please don’t tell her.

701
00:53:48,706 --> 00:53:52,926
I’m going to do anything for you. Pleaes don’t tell Grandma, okay?

702
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:56,006
- Pleaseee...   /   - Fine

703
00:53:58,286 --> 00:53:59,086
Thank you.

704
00:53:59,086 --> 00:54:01,476
- You’re really...   /   - Ouch.

705
00:54:01,496 --> 00:54:03,476
You haven’t changed a bit.

706
00:54:03,776 --> 00:54:05,756
Are you still having a bad dream?

707
00:54:06,036 --> 00:54:07,036
Bad dream?

708
00:54:07,906 --> 00:54:10,196
Yeah.

709
00:54:10,786 --> 00:54:12,246
But it’s getting a little weird these days.

710
00:54:12,926 --> 00:54:18,926
I kept dreaming of the same thing.

711
00:54:19,486 --> 00:54:21,036
Sometimes I can still see it while I’m awake.

712
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:23,366
Are you still dreaming of that girl?

713
00:54:24,816 --> 00:54:27,666
I think you should go see the doctor.

714
00:54:31,446 --> 00:54:32,326
Okay.

715
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:38,566
Let’s take a picture of you for Grandma.

716
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:40,506
- Hey. / - Huh?

717
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:42,706
Who do you think she is? Doesn’t she look familiar?

718
00:54:42,706 --> 00:54:43,696
Stop it, Dao.

719
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:46,116
You always love to tease me.

720
00:54:47,236 --> 00:54:48,496
Stop teasing me.

721
00:54:50,256 --> 00:54:53,156
Yeah, she does look familiar.

722
00:54:57,846 --> 00:55:01,266
Isn’t she the one who called him yesterday?

723
00:55:02,436 --> 00:55:03,376
His girlfriend?

724
00:55:03,806 --> 00:55:06,146
It’s his girlfriend then.

725
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:07,606
They look so sweet.

726
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:10,626
- Sweet couple.   /   - Are they?

727
00:55:11,526 --> 00:55:13,296
Stop looking at Phaya.

728
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,966
Let’s go home. It’s none of our business.

729
00:55:18,366 --> 00:55:19,226
Let’s go, baby

730
00:55:23,246 --> 00:55:26,086
Why? Does it hurt to see him with someone else?

731
00:55:27,466 --> 00:55:28,636
Ouch! You, asshole.

732
00:55:28,716 --> 00:55:29,846
- Go home. / - What a rascal brother.

733
00:55:33,696 --> 00:55:35,726
Oh, Dr. Cholathorn.

734
00:55:36,006 --> 00:55:39,136
Hello. Are you getting off work?

735
00:55:39,286 --> 00:55:39,806
Yes.

736
00:55:40,926 --> 00:55:44,336
Are you here to pick up Tharn?

737
00:55:44,686 --> 00:55:46,476
Yes, I’m going to drop him home.

738
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,986
Well then, I’d get going.

739
00:55:49,006 --> 00:55:50,026
- See you, bro.
- See you.

740
00:55:50,026 --> 00:55:51,216
- See you.
- See you.

741
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:55,296
Do you need to take care of anything before we leave?

742
00:55:55,636 --> 00:55:56,626
No.

743
00:55:59,596 --> 00:56:01,776
- Are you hungery?
- Yes.

744
00:56:02,816 --> 00:56:06,116
Then, let’s find something to eat before we go home, shall we?

745
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:13,066
- Okay.    /    - Let’s go.

746
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:20,516
Dao, I’ll be right back.

747
00:56:20,546 --> 00:56:24,326
Hey, where are you going?

748
00:56:30,476 --> 00:56:31,456
Where are you guys going?

749
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,606
We’re going for dinner.

750
00:56:34,836 --> 00:56:35,786
Do you need anything?

751
00:56:37,346 --> 00:56:38,396
Phaya.

752
00:56:39,476 --> 00:56:40,796
I’m leaving then.

753
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:42,636
Okay. Please take care.

754
00:56:44,156 --> 00:56:45,366
- See you.   /   - Okay.

755
00:56:46,186 --> 00:56:47,276
Goodevening.

756
00:56:47,476 --> 00:56:48,326
Goodevening.

757
00:56:48,716 --> 00:56:49,766
- Bye Bye.   /    - Bye Bye.

758
00:56:54,226 --> 00:56:55,686
Your girlfriend is cute.

759
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,226
You two are a perfect match.

760
00:56:57,226 --> 00:57:01,916
- Well, she’s...
- Ah, is she the one who often calls you?

761
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:02,556
Umm...

762
00:57:05,196 --> 00:57:06,336
Let’s go then.

763
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:08,156
Please wait.

764
00:57:08,316 --> 00:57:11,056
You said you’re going to have dinner, right?

765
00:57:11,286 --> 00:57:13,216
I happen to be so famished.

766
00:57:13,436 --> 00:57:15,946
So, can I tag along too?

767
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:16,996
-  Of course.   /    - No.

768
00:57:19,446 --> 00:57:20,546
Doc.

769
00:57:20,816 --> 00:57:22,126
Why not?

770
00:57:22,336 --> 00:57:23,996
It’d be quite fun with lots of people at dinner

771
00:57:24,706 --> 00:57:25,766
Also,

772
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:28,006
I think he has something to talk to me.

773
00:57:28,116 --> 00:57:28,796
You’re right.

774
00:57:30,606 --> 00:57:33,076
What about your bike?

775
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,506
I want to go by car today.

776
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:39,516
Let’s go then, shall we?

777
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:44,106
Let’s go.

778
00:57:49,316 --> 00:57:50,756
That evil jellyfish.

779
00:57:52,796 --> 00:57:56,786
I heard your team is investigating on the rapists murder case.

780
00:57:57,476 --> 00:57:58,766
How is it going?

781
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:01,746
We almost got the culprit.

782
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,886
- But then...   /   - I’m sorry.

783
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,386
But this is strictly confidential.

784
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,386
We can’t disclose its details to other people…

785
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:11,836
since it might jeopardize the case.

786
00:58:18,106 --> 00:58:20,966
I hope you catch the culprit as soon as possible.

787
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:24,196
This case is a talk of the town at the moment.

788
00:58:24,886 --> 00:58:26,356
It must be tough for you...

789
00:58:26,996 --> 00:58:29,376
to work on a case like this when you just started a job.

790
00:58:32,356 --> 00:58:33,726
Thank you.

791
00:58:33,726 --> 00:58:35,746
Tharn, are you a cripple?

792
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:37,756
Why can’t you get the food yourself?

793
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:44,236
Phaya, if you’re not happy to eat with us...

794
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:46,016
please leave.

795
00:58:46,346 --> 00:58:47,426
I’m not done yet.

796
00:58:47,556 --> 00:58:48,726
I just had a bite or two.

797
00:58:52,576 --> 00:58:54,246
Please excuse me. I have to go to the loo.

798
00:59:03,936 --> 00:59:06,796
You’re probably still upset from work.

799
00:59:08,636 --> 00:59:10,186
If there’s anything I could help,

800
00:59:10,686 --> 00:59:11,766
please let me know.

801
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,746
Leave it to me. I can handle my own business.

802
00:59:14,806 --> 00:59:18,826
The culprit might have a mental disorder called Schizophrenia.

803
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:26,066
The symptoms include hallucinations or delusions,
extremely disordered thinking and behaviour,
and abnormal interpretation of reality.

804
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:29,486
Patients might not be aware of these symptoms in their daily lives.

805
00:59:29,876 --> 00:59:32,806
But they could be stimulated repetitively unitl the symptoms turn into a serious mental disorder.

806
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:34,596
It could drive them to madness and hurting other people.

807
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:38,086
You’d better have yourself checked up too.

808
00:59:42,686 --> 00:59:43,836
What do you mean?

809
00:59:44,486 --> 00:59:46,846
I heard you often have bad dreams.

810
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:48,526
Or seeing ghosts in your dream.

811
00:59:48,596 --> 00:59:54,526
Hearing voices, or thinking that something has happened when in fact nothing actually happens.

812
00:59:54,956 --> 00:59:57,716
Having hallucinations or delusions. Those are signs of mental disorder.

813
00:59:57,946 --> 01:00:00,816
If you don’t treat them in the earlystage,

814
01:00:02,306 --> 01:00:07,846
it could affect not only your health but also your work and people around you.

815
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,126
Tharn also has experienced a trauma which greatly affect his mental health.

816
01:00:13,796 --> 01:00:16,466
I’m just worried about you two because you have to work together.

817
01:00:17,536 --> 01:00:19,326
He told you about me?

818
01:00:31,476 --> 01:00:32,526
(Cutlery clanging)

819
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:37,876
Hey, where are you going?

820
01:00:39,696 --> 01:00:40,816
What happened?

821
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:57,196
Eight, Nine...

822
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:59,446
Are you slacking off?

823
01:00:59,716 --> 01:01:00,916
Help me.

824
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:01,916
Good. One more.

825
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:02,666
- Okay    /   -  You can do it

826
01:01:04,946 --> 01:01:05,646
That’s good.

827
01:01:05,646 --> 01:01:07,066
Yeah.

828
01:01:07,146 --> 01:01:08,566
One more.

829
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:16,076
Hey.

830
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:22,886
(Boxing)

831
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:23,956
(Boxing)

832
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:26,606
What’s wrong with him?

833
01:01:29,226 --> 01:01:30,316
Leave him be.

834
01:01:31,626 --> 01:01:32,426
Let’s go.

835
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:52,816
Phaya.

836
01:01:56,726 --> 01:01:57,306
Hey.

837
01:01:58,276 --> 01:02:00,076
I’m talking to you. Can you hear me?

838
01:02:01,936 --> 01:02:03,046
Ouch!

839
01:02:04,756 --> 01:02:05,426
What’s wrong?

840
01:02:05,616 --> 01:02:06,396
What’s wrong with you?

841
01:02:06,396 --> 01:02:08,086
- What’s wrong?
- What’s wrong with YOU?

842
01:02:09,356 --> 01:02:10,006
Hey.

843
01:02:11,716 --> 01:02:13,326
- What the fuck’s wrong with you?
- Why did you do that?

844
01:02:13,326 --> 01:02:14,806
Why?!

845
01:02:14,806 --> 01:02:15,916
- Hey!
- Why did you do that?

846
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:17,506
Quit it!

847
01:02:17,506 --> 01:02:19,066
Why did you do that?

848
01:02:19,796 --> 01:02:20,886
What did I do?

849
01:02:23,276 --> 01:02:24,766
Do you think I’m nuts?

850
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,916
That’s why you told that doctor of yours about my dream.

851
01:02:30,076 --> 01:02:31,166
What dream?

852
01:02:33,026 --> 01:02:35,456
Hey, you guys! Come quick!
We found the genital.

853
01:02:36,106 --> 01:02:37,536
We found the genital.

854
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:39,536
The Inspector calls for an urgent meeting.

855
01:02:40,026 --> 01:02:41,236
The Inspector calls for an urgent meeting.

856
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:47,726
This morning, a bottle of three male genital organs was discovered in front of the office of Royal Police Bureau.

857
01:02:47,906 --> 01:02:51,686
Mayris and Wit are now examining the evidence to find out more clues...

858
01:02:51,706 --> 01:02:53,306
in hope that we might be able to identify the cultprit.

859
01:02:53,846 --> 01:02:56,686
A group of women who used to fall victims to rapists...

860
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,956
(Riots)
are also gathering to protest against the bureau…

861
01:02:58,956 --> 01:03:01,836
(Riots)
and demand that we must press serious charges to all the rape convicts.

862
01:03:02,466 --> 01:03:05,366
without pardoning or reducing the punishment.

863
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:08,206
From our interview with these women...

864
01:03:08,236 --> 01:03:11,646
they said they also received the video clips of our three victims being tortured.

865
01:03:11,926 --> 01:03:14,236
So, they are encouraged to call out for a better justice.

866
01:03:15,516 --> 01:03:18,646
He’s trying to provoke all the victims of sexual violence and use them to pressure us.

867
01:03:19,836 --> 01:03:21,066
Who is he?

868
01:03:24,746 --> 01:03:26,226
I know who the culprit is.

869
01:03:33,986 --> 01:03:36,366
This is the picture of the culprit from the CCTV of the coffee shop.

870
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:39,666
He’s now our prime suspect of three murders.

871
01:03:40,306 --> 01:03:43,596
I’ve used AI to help create the facial structure of this man.

872
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:45,306
Then compared it with our criminal database.

873
01:03:46,226 --> 01:03:49,536
The result came up with a match.

874
01:03:52,066 --> 01:03:53,716
He looks similar to the man we saw...

875
01:03:54,076 --> 01:03:57,516
from other CCTV cameras around the area of the wood where we found the victims’ bodies.

876
01:04:00,286 --> 01:04:03,446
A man wearing this kind of hat and driving a car without a license plate.

877
01:04:04,096 --> 01:04:05,236
Who’s this man?

878
01:04:14,816 --> 01:04:17,146
His name is Narong. He’s a forensic officer.

879
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:23,386
According to the record in the past month...

880
01:04:23,386 --> 01:04:27,186
he had accessed to look at a lot of case files...

881
01:04:27,186 --> 01:04:30,946
especially the ones involving rapes and sexual assaults including the case of our three victims.

882
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:36,986
So, Narong is the real culprit.

883
01:04:37,906 --> 01:04:40,756
Why would he kill those victims then?

884
01:04:41,196 --> 01:04:42,906
What’s the motive?

885
01:04:46,036 --> 01:04:48,686
His younger sister got raped and killed herself.

886
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:51,566
The culprit got away and wasn’t pressed with any charge.

887
01:04:52,186 --> 01:04:54,506
It’s the same as our murdered victims.

888
01:04:55,756 --> 01:04:58,286
Two of the three also got away without any charge.

889
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:01,246
Inspector.

890
01:05:02,506 --> 01:05:06,846
I think we now have much enough evidence so let’s go and arrest him.

891
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:07,916
Before he’d run away.

892
01:05:08,436 --> 01:05:09,806
That’s right. I agree with him, Inspector.

893
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:10,546
Me too.

894
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:15,716
What did you see?

895
01:05:16,226 --> 01:05:18,526
Hey, what is it? Hey!

896
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:25,396
Singh, do you have the picture of the man who hurt Narong’s sister?

897
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,006
Yes.

898
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:30,406
Here it is.

899
01:05:32,156 --> 01:05:33,626
His name is Songyod.

900
01:05:39,616 --> 01:05:43,366
Narong is not running away. He’s going to kill his last victim...

901
01:05:43,996 --> 01:05:44,906
who is Songyod.

902
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:17,766
Idolfactory

903
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:18,756
Shit!

904
01:06:19,086 --> 01:06:20,646
Why are there two of you?

905
01:06:20,646 --> 01:06:23,376
Please find the culprit and put him behind bars for me.

906
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:27,046
Let me know if you need anything.

907
01:06:27,046 --> 01:06:29,046
I’d be more than willing to help.

908
01:06:29,176 --> 01:06:31,086
The security guard at the entrace said that...

909
01:06:31,086 --> 01:06:32,676
there’s a car without a license plate...

910
01:06:32,696 --> 01:06:34,306
parked not far away from our unit.

911
01:06:34,716 --> 01:06:36,526
Arghhhh!

912
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:38,956
Tharn!

913
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:42,156
Can you dig up an old case file for me?

914
01:06:42,176 --> 01:06:43,136
What case?

915
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,596
The one about my father.

916
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:49,036
If you don’t let go on the count of three...

917
01:06:49,056 --> 01:06:50,426
I’m going to sleep right here.

918
01:07:04,836 --> 01:07:12,556
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

919
01:07:12,556 --> 01:07:20,036
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

920
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:28,446
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

921
01:07:28,446 --> 01:07:38,556
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

922
01:07:38,816 --> 01:07:46,196
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

923
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:50,556
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

924
01:07:50,956 --> 01:07:53,786
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

925
01:07:53,786 --> 01:08:01,046
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

926
01:08:01,046 --> 01:08:05,486
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

01:08:05,486 --> 01:08:12,686
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
