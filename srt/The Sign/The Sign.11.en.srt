1
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,222
We must gather as much information as we can today.

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,988
Bing go

3
00:00:17,988 --> 00:00:23,260
Tharn, do you really think Montree is the one behind your father’s death, as well as Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s deaths?

4
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:26,285
Inspector already knew. Why didn’t he tell us the truth?

5
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:28,182
Or maybe, he’s one of Montree’s lackeys?

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,851
Inspector, do you know my father?

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,080
Your father was betrayed by someone in his unit.

8
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,314
Your father’s team leader.

9
00:00:33,428 --> 00:00:35,748
We’ll stay here for a week.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,337
We’ll be staying at Tharn’s grandma’s place.

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,891
Khem, hurry up and go to Ning’s house.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,017
What did you say? Ning is dead?!

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,817
She didn’t leave us any evidence and we couldn’t help her somehow.

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,520
How many times does it have to be like this?!

15
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:47,702
Gather as many artworks as you can.

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,988
This time, it’s going to be a big one. Once you get them, send them to our warehouse in Nongkai.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,125
[Montree is heading to NongKai, where the NongKai forest produces medicine along the Mekong River.]
It’s one of our workers who went into the woods to collect wild products.

18
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,420
Kai – he was eaten by the Tiger-man.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,960
Where’s his body right now?

20
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:04,777
According to the report, the area along the bank of Mekhong river, especially between Thailand-Laos birder,

21
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:10,760
is often used as the route to smuggle in drugs from Laos to Thailand...

22
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,868
...via the natural border path.

23
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:17,520
Smugglers also pay local people to load drugs into their boats and secretly made landfall in Thailand.

24
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:22,445
There are amphetamine, Ice, and also heroin.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,748
We suspect that the place where Montree and his gang use as a shelter and a hub in producing drugs…

26
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:31,268
is around the area of national reserved forests in Nongkai.

27
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:46,514
In this wipe-out mission, we’d be working closely with the forest rangers and the navy force.

28
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:50,560
The forest rangers will assist us during our search in the forest.

29
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:56,548
The navy force will help provide a backup force during our arrest.

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,800
Inspector, aren’t you going to include Phaya and Tharn in this mission?

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,160
That’s right, Inspector.

32
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:06,022
I think Tharn wants to be included in this mission too.

33
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:08,605
He’s already in Nongkai, staying at his grandmother’s place.

34
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,137
Should I call him?

35
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:13,222
You know better than anyone how badly Tharn wants to arrest Montree

36
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,925
Please give him a chance.

37
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:20,765
Go and get ready.

38
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:22,971
We’ll leave to Nongkai tomorrow.

39
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,874
Yes, sir!

40
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,685
Yai, you stay.

41
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:41,940
Yes, sir.

42
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,325
I want to know how Tharn knew that Ning was going to get killed.

43
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:56,994
Well, that’s because...

44
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:04,651
he can see a vision or a sign of what’s going to happen.

45
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:06,708
The sign?

46
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:08,822
Yes.

47
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:13,497
After his accident with his parents,

48
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:16,571
he started to see all these signs and visions...

49
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,388
including ones about our cases.

50
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:21,440
He’s been having a vision ever since.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
I’m going to give you one last chance to tell me the truth, Yai.

52
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,348
I ‘am’ telling you the truth, Inspector.

53
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,845
Tharn can see what’s going to happen beforehand. I really mean it.

The Sign

71
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:11,120
Kham, you have to tell me everything.

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,325
I have told you everything that I know.

73
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:14,800
And they are all the truth.

74
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,480
Didanyone go into Joe’s room last night?

75
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,137
Umm, I don’t know.

76
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:29,508
It looks like his room was ransacked.

77
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:34,080
Joe is not a tidy person. His room is often in a mess.

78
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:37,862
He’s untidy and not hygienic.

79
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:41,577
He doesn’t like to mingle. We barely know him.

80
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:43,600
What are you two looking for?

81
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,834
What are you two looking for?

82
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,565
What are you two looking for?

83
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,600
I’m looking for drugs. Joe’s test result reveals that he has drugs in his body

84
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:59,874
Grandma told me you’re the leader here, taking care of all the workers and looking after the sawmill.

85
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:01,771
Don’t you know that Joe uses drugs?

86
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,245
Not a clue.

87
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:05,474
I barely know him.

88
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:11,600
What does a Tiger-man look like? Can you show me?

89
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:14,617
Absolutely not. He’s scary.

90
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:17,965
He’s half human half ghost. He can transform into a tiger.

91
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:21,988
I’d rather not talk abou it anymore. It’s so scary. I’m off to bed then.

92
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:29,988
Hey, why did you try to get on his nerves?

93
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:32,468
We still need more information from him.

94
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:34,777
Well, so that I could get some information.

95
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:37,325
Look here.

96
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,125
Why are these footprints in Joe’s room?

97
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:49,314
He doesn’t like to mingle. We barely know him.

98
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:53,154
He’s untidy and not hygienic.

99
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:54,742
What are you two looking for?

100
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:56,525
You heard what he said.

101
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,674
Joe hardly talks to anyone.

102
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:02,137
Then why there are Kham’s footprints in Joe’s room.

103
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:07,828
I think he’s hiding something from us.

104
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,771
Tharn, go and look upstairs.

105
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:08,800
- Found anything?
- No.

106
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,245
(Door unlocking)

107
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:46,548
Hey, come and have a look here.

108
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:51,691
(Exciting sound)

109
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:08,354
This definitely has something to do with drugs like what you think.

110
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,571
Then we must hurry up and find the body of that worker.

111
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,845
We can use it as an evidence to arrest Kham.

112
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:37,554
Why are you calling Chalothorn?

113
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,754
I’m going to ask him about giving our workers a drug test.

114
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,382
Can’t you call some other doctors instead?

115
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,045
But I only trust Doc.

116
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,085
But I don’t trust him.

117
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:59,188
Phaya, give me back my phone.

118
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:03,165
Let me take care of the drug test matter.

119
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:06,708
No, you stay out of it. This is my family’s matter.

120
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,908
I can take care of it.

121
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,502
Aren’t I one of your family too?

122
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,068
Am I not the one you love?

123
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:17,588
Phaya, about Doc and I, you know I only think of him as my brother.

124
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,330
So, please stop being jealous. Can’t you guys just be friends?

125
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:24,720
As long as Chalothorn is still in your life,

126
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:26,525
I’ll never stop getting in the way

127
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,794
It’s all right if you don’t trust him. But can’t you just trust me?

128
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:33,965
Why are you like this?

129
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,377
What has he done to you? Why do you hate him so much?

130
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,805
Because he’s the Naga!

131
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:41,120
the one who kept us apart in our past lives.

132
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,548
He’s the one who tried to kill me and take you away from me.

133
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,268
That drowning that almost killed me, it was because of him.

134
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,142
He was trying to kill me.

135
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,805
I never thought you’d be like this. Just because you don’t want me to get close to him,

136
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:05,760
you even came up with this nonsense.

137
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,708
Hey, I didn’t make it up. I’m telling you the truth.

138
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:12,285
If you don’t believe me, let’s go ask the Abbot. He knows everything

139
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:16,731
That’s enough. I’m going to let it slide and ignore what you just said.

140
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:18,651
But don’t ever mention it to me again.

141
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,228
I have an important job to do.

142
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,525
Kai’s body must be in this forest. I have to find it.

143
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:31,382
(Thunder sound)

144
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,411
(Thunder and lightening)

145
00:11:46,857 --> 00:11:50,857
(Thunder and lightening)

146
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,114
(Sighs)

147
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:57,177
(Thunder and lightening)

148
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:03,165
Your time is coming, isn’t it?

149
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:31,028
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of him for you.

150
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,360
Don’t you worry.

151
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,034
(Door knocking)

152
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,142
Tharn, come out and eat something, dear.

153
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,548
Don’t lock yourself in there.

154
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:01,554
(Door knocking)

155
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:02,720
Tharn.

156
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:04,822
(Door knocking)

157
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:06,285
Tharn

158
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:12,388
(Door opening.)

159
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,297
Who are you? Why are you in my grandson’s room?

160
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:22,400
When the time comes, you and I will finally be together.

161
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:34,430
Grandma.

162
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,554
I miss you so much.

163
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:45,702
Aww, don’t sweet talk me.

164
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,765
Where’s that friend of yours that you want to introduce to me?

165
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,194
He’s outside. Let me introduce him to you.

166
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:57,840
Doc.

167
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:06,788
Here he is, Grandma. The one I want to introduce to you.

168
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:24,502
Phaya, please protect Tharn

169
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,540
I want someone who knows which route Joe and Kai took.

170
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,085
But we believe he was eaten by the Tiger-man.

171
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:39,920
Hey, what’s wrong?

172
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:41,840
I saw Kham going to get killed.

175
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:37,894
Grandmas,

176
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:39,894
please eat something.

177
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:42,522
Both of you haven’t eaten anything since last night.

178
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,934
I’m afraid you two might faint.

179
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,848
I hardly slept last night too.

180
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:52,808
I heard a loud and scary noise from the forest

181
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:57,276
Or maybe, it really came from the Tiger-man.

182
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:05,745
I'm not hungry.

183
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:09,734
Your brother has disappeared into the woods with Tharn since last night.

184
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:11,619
And he’s not answering my call.

185
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:17,916
Please let both of them come back safely.

186
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:24,122
The cops already told them they would take care of it but they never listened.

187
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,768
I’m afraid we won’t be having a vacation this time.

188
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,802
Oh! Grandmas!

189
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:45,516
They are back.

190
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:46,248
Huh?

191
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,105
Phaya! Tharn!

192
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,584
Are you all right? We have been worried sick about you.

193
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:55,288
You just disappeared and didn’t answer my call too.

194
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:57,196
We went looking for some evidence about Joe’s case.

195
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:58,876
But we found nothing.

196
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:00,944
Sorry for keeping you waiting and worrying about us.

197
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:02,991
Joe still refuses to say anything.

198
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,208
He keeps insisting that Kai was killed by the Tiger-man.

199
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:12,396
But according to the drug test, we found drugs in his body.

200
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:16,922
Grandma, can I go seach Joe’s shelter?

201
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,796
Since it’s happening with our workers,

202
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:22,614
I’m worried about you.

203
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:30,796
Let’s go and talk inside, shall we?

204
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:32,259
Tharn.

205
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,105
Can I have a word with you?

206
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,796
You don’t look good, are you okay?

207
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,574
I have a bad feeling.

208
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,208
Like that time when I lost your parents.

209
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:14,831
Looks like that bad feeling is coming back.

210
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,631
What the Abbot used to tell me...

211
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,991
when you were very young,

212
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:28,694
I don’t want it to happen to you again.

213
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,025
I can only pray...

214
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:33,894
what the Abbot said

215
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:37,002
about that someone...

216
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:43,345
who’d be able to protect you

217
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,254
would be Phaya.

218
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,968
I know you’re worried about me.

219
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:55,494
But everything that’s happening here,

220
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,025
might lead me to find the person who killed my parents.

221
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:03,654
I’m a police officer after all.

222
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:05,928
I have my father’s blood in me.

223
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:11,276
I can feel that eveything is going to end soon.

224
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:13,928
The person who killed dad,

225
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,905
the one who created all these terrible things,

226
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:22,385
and also drugs network with Montree being the man behind it all,

227
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,494
all of these must be connected in some way.

228
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:29,082
I’m going to find a solid evidence to take them down.

229
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,191
I promise I’ll be careful.

230
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:42,282
I’ll infrom my unit as soon as I can,

231
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:45,151
and will ask them to send me a backup team.

232
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:47,848
I promise....

233
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:53,562
not to do anything on impluse and make you worried.

234
00:19:55,984 --> 00:20:00,659
I know I can’t stop you.

235
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:04,842
So, please always stay focus.

236
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:08,076
If what the Abbot said is true,

237
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:14,974
that person is coming to take you back.

238
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:29,951
Yes,sir. I’ll send you some artworks as a gift then.

239
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:32,122
(Laughing)

240
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:34,488
Yes. Thank you, sir.

241
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:39,025
Hey.

242
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:42,614
Send someone to deliver the gift to our dear sir tomorrow.

243
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,602
Don’t forget to take a picture too.

244
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,791
Just in case they might betray us. I’m not going to let them get away so easily.

245
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:49,105
Yes, sir.

246
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:52,019
Have you sent someone to that side to load in the drugs?

247
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:54,214
- Working on it, sir.
- Okay.

248
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:59,082
Hey, you. The one holding the gun.

249
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:03,002
You go with Khom so that you can learn from him.

250
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:04,808
Yes, sir.

251
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:06,088
Good.

252
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:09,482
After this shipping lot, I might have to take a break for a while.

253
00:21:09,474 --> 00:21:11,928
Inspector Akk is keeping an eye on me.

254
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,294
I have to get rid of him.

255
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:02,545
I want someone who knows the route that Joe and Kai took

256
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,339
when they went into the woods that day.

257
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:06,419
I’ll pay you 10,000 baht.

258
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:08,625
Does anyone want to volunteer?

259
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:20,031
Or just tell me how much you want.

260
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:23,699
I don’t think anyone would want to take you into the woods.

261
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:27,036
They are all afraid of the Tiger-man.

262
00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:31,505
Don’t worry, a Tiger-man is not real.

263
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:33,985
Joe was having a hallucination because he used drugs.

264
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:37,414
The test result has confirmed that Joe had drugs in his body.

265
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:41,379
Fine then, if that’s what you want to believe.

266
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:45,334
But we believe he was killed and eaten by the Tiger-man.

267
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,248
Right?

268
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:47,631
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:22:47,962 --> 00:22:49,231
Let me warn you.

270
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:53,688
If you go into that woods and get attacked by the Tiger-man, we’re not going to help you.

271
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:55,745
Does anyone still want to go with them?

272
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:57,162
No.

273
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:00,271
Whatever. We’re off to work now.

274
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:01,871
Hurry up.

275
00:23:23,722 --> 00:23:26,796
Joe is still detained. The police said he’s still having some hallucinations.

276
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:28,511
He can barely answer the questions.

277
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:31,619
I don’t think he’d be able to tell us about the route into the woods.

278
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,345
I think Kham probably has planned it all.

279
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:38,762
If Kai’s body is really in the woods,

280
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:43,425
I’m afraid it might already be destroyed

281
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,568
by tigers or other carnivorous animals.

282
00:23:58,705 --> 00:23:59,951
(Gunshot)
Hey.

283
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:02,202
Hey.

284
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:03,985
What’s wrong?

285
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:08,168
I saw Kham going to get killed.

286
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:14,614
Tharn, wait!

287
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:15,951
Tharn!

288
00:24:21,882 --> 00:24:22,876
Wait up!

289
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:31,848
- Has anyone seen Kham?
- No, sir.

290
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:34,545
Has anyone seen Kham?

291
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:42,024
Or did he go back into the woods to destroy the evidence?

292
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:56,911
Hey.

293
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:58,534
I think we’ve found him.

294
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:36,442
Tharn.

295
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:41,471
This is probably the route that Kham often uses.

296
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:43,105
He left a mark here.

297
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:44,705
Let’s go.

298
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,282
(Exciting sound)

299
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:09,482
This is probably the area that we suspected.

300
00:26:09,474 --> 00:26:11,299
It’s close to Tharn’s grandmother’s sawmill.

301
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:13,128
I think we should call Tharn and let him join us.

302
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:14,168

303
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:15,951

Tharn doesn’t pick up my call.

310

He doesn’t read his LINE either.

311
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:26,076
Have you tried calling Phaya?

312
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:28,773
Yeah, I called both of them.

313
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:30,771
Wonder what they are doing.

314
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:32,771
Or are they busy cuddling each other in bed?

315
00:27:35,031 --> 00:27:38,853
Yai, does Inspector know you’re calling Tharn?

316
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:42,396
Don’t worry. I have a plan.

317

Let’s pretend we’re bumping into them here.

318
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,019
Inspector is coming.

319
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:57,151
Get ready. The forest rangers have arrived.

320

How is it going, sir?

321
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:26,282
Does the disciplinary committeee agree that Tharn can get back to work?

322
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:30,465
Yes, sir.

323
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:42,316
If you want me to narrow it down, I think this area is probably where they are producing drugs.

324
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:47,379
It’s deep in the forest with lots of wild animals. Most local people don’t go there.

325
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:59,151
Inspector, that area is close to the sawmill that belongs to Tharn’s grandmother.

326
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,471
I think we should call Tharn.

Chart, go take care of that drug thief.

351
00:30:34,396 --> 00:30:37,162
I’m going to handle those two cops.

352
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,076
Let’s go!

353
00:30:43,996 --> 00:30:44,911
Turn yourself in!

354
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:47,219
No! I didn’t do anything wrong!

355
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:50,716
We know everything. That body in the hole is Kai, isn’t it?

356
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:53,128
And what you just dig out are drugs, aren’t they?

357
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:55,893
Where did he get all those drugs?

358
00:30:58,488 --> 00:30:59,231
(Gunshot)
Careful!

359
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:10,225
(Gunshot)
Tharn.

360
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:20,099
Phaya!

361
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:20,853
Hey

362
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:21,882
(Sound of branch breaking)

363
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:22,705
(A branch dropping on the ground)

364
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:28,648
(Gunshot)
Hey

365
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:29,351
Put down your weapon

366
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:30,693
(Gunshot)
Hey

367
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,088
All of you, spread out!

368
00:31:32,385 --> 00:31:34,236
Time’s running out. Please lead the way.

369
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:36,739

370
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:39,779

371
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,299
(Fighting)

372
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:04,545
(Gunshot)
Hey

373
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,493

(Gunshot)

379
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:15,539
Phaya, watch out!

380
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:17,722

381
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,768

Tharn!

391
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,116
Watch out!

392
00:33:00,465 --> 00:33:01,173
(Gunshot)

393
00:33:01,676 --> 00:33:02,293
(Gunshot)

394
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:06,202
I think you better go after Phaya and Tharn.

395
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,351
Are they hurt? Where are they now?

396
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:09,848
They are at...

00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:19,651

(Exciting sound)

410
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:10,752
I’ll send you to your parents.

(Fighting)

412
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,474
Isn’t that bastard going to give me a break?!

413
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:26,640
Everything should be okay by tomorrow, sir.

414
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:29,737
Clear out this lot as soon as you can. Don’t mess it up.

415
00:34:31,406 --> 00:34:32,080
Yes, sir.

416
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,172
Hey!

417
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:40,777
Did you get him?

418
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:42,709
He got away.

419
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:44,732
What about you? Did you get rid of those cops?

420
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:05,177
Don’t let go of my hand! Hang on!

421
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:07,749
What are you doing?! Let me go!

422
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,823
No!

423
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,263
I’m not going to leave you here!

424
00:35:13,852 --> 00:35:16,069
Let me go! You can’t hold it any longer.

425
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:19,417
You said you wouldn’t leave me.

426
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,577
You promised!

427
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,509
Are you going to leave me?

428
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:30,652
What are you doing?!

429
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:32,522
No. No.

430
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:35,029
I’m sorry...

431
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,240
What are you doing?!

432
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:37,772
...that I couldn’t keep my promise.

433
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:39,132
Don’t do that!

434
00:35:39,212 --> 00:35:39,909
No. No.

435
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:40,789
No!

436
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,949
Phaya!

437
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:45,406
Phaya!

438
00:35:45,406 --> 00:35:48,112
(Exciting sound)

439
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,126
So, it’s true.

440
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:33,692
I guess I don’t have explain anything now.

441
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:36,423
Phaya already told you everything.

442
00:36:38,389 --> 00:36:39,737
So...

443
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:42,674
all this time,

444
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:47,200
those that I love have been taken away from me all because of you?

445
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:51,406
I’m sorry.

446
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:53,806
But I can’t lose you.

447
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:56,046
You belong to me.

448
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:58,457
You are mine and only mine.

449
00:37:00,663 --> 00:37:01,863
Come with me.

450
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:05,029
You can’t help Phaya anymore. It’s over.

451
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:09,954
What do you mean?

452
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,766
Haven’t I warned you before?

453
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:16,869
That if you choose him over me,

454
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:19,189
you will lose him in the end.

455
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:24,240
You can’t love anyone.

456
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:28,332
I’m the only one who can stay by your side.

457
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:30,709
And I will never make you cry or face with any loss again.

458
00:37:30,702 --> 00:37:32,640
- I have to go save Phaya.
- Stop it, Tharn.

459
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:35,612
Phaya is dead.

460
00:37:36,674 --> 00:37:39,623
Even if you can save him now, he’ll evetually die.

461
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:45,394
You can never be with him.

462
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:48,766
I’m the only one who can be by your side.

463
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:52,080
You are mine.

464
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:54,823
Only mine.

465
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:59,143
I’ll never make you cry or lose anyone.

466
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:18,914
You have to promise me that you’d come with me.

467
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,412
I’m not going anywhere with you.

468
00:38:28,263 --> 00:38:30,537
Please don’t push me. I don’t want to make the matter worse.

469
00:38:35,017 --> 00:38:37,246
If you choose to stay with Phaya,

470
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:40,034
he won’t be the only one that I’ll kill.

471
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:43,612
I might kill everyone that you love.

472
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:52,709
It’s time for you to choose.

473
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:56,983
It’s not just about Phaya, the man that you love.

474
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:01,772
It’s about everyone that you love.

475
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:26,434
(Incoming call)

476
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:30,092
Where are you?

477
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:31,657
We’re going to make an arrest.

478
00:39:32,697 --> 00:39:35,280
Maybe you should go after Phaya and Tharn first.

479
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:36,972
They got attacked.

480
00:39:37,212 --> 00:39:38,000
What?

481
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:40,057
Tharn and Phaya got attacked?

482
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,154
Where are they now?

483
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,223
They’re at...

484
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:46,114
Whom are you talking to?

485
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:50,400
Chart?

486
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:51,543
Chart?

487
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:52,480
Chart?

488
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:24,526
Phaya

489
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,342
Tharn.

490
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:48,366
You’re safe now.

491
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,926
Don’t say anything.

492
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:57,657
They will come and rescue us tomorrow.

493
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,914
Who are they?

494
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:05,600
No one knows we’re here.

495
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:13,497
It’s all right.

496
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:18,457
Let’s stay here tonight.

497
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,023
We’ll look for a way out tomorrow.

498
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,566
Let’s get some sleep.

499
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:24,286
Those trainings we did

500
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:27,280
have finally paid off.

501
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,857
The only way for us to survive...

502
00:42:35,383 --> 00:42:38,080
is that I must get out of here and call for help.

503
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:42,686
Let’s go together.

504
00:42:43,486 --> 00:42:46,000
What if Khom and his men are waiting up there.

505
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:47,132
You can’t fight them.

506
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:49,062
Let’s go together.

507
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,149
Ouch.

508
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:53,657
Ouch.

509
00:42:58,537 --> 00:42:59,726
Does it hurt a lot?

510
00:43:00,382 --> 00:43:02,869
Neh, I’m all right.

511
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:06,274
I’m so sorry.

512
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:09,040
Since I’ve come into your life,

513
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:13,509
you often got hurt and almost got killed too.

514
00:43:19,737 --> 00:43:22,892
Even if I weren’t dating you, I’m still a cop.

515
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,102
It’s my job to live with danger.

516
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,749
I’m glad you’ve come into my life.

517
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:40,480
You’ve fulfilled my life.

518
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:42,972
I promise...

519
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:47,063
that I’ll never forget you.

520
00:43:48,034 --> 00:43:49,646
That you are the one I love.

521
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,554
And I will always love you.

522
00:43:54,354 --> 00:43:55,342
Tharn,

523
00:43:56,732 --> 00:43:57,714
Are you all right?

524
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:00,343
What made you say something like that?

525
00:44:00,343 --> 00:44:07,352
(Romantic sound)

526
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:50,072
idolfactory

527
00:44:50,072 --> 00:44:51,623
Yai, please find Phaya and Tharn.

528
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:52,126
Yeah.

529
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,320
I hope they are safe.

530
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:59,143
I pray to the holy spirits, please make everyone come back safely.

531
00:44:59,142 --> 00:45:00,046
Careful, Tharn.

532
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,823

533
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:06,754
(Gunshot)

534
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:09,112
You son of a bitch just can’t leave me alone, can you?!

535
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:10,126
(Gunshot)

536
