00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,725
Let’s finish your work.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,748
I know you’ve always wanted to do it.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,971
Hello, Mr. Montree.

4
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,451
I finally get to meet you, Mr. Art.

5
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:10,240
- What did you do to Kao? What did you do?
- Stop.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,691
You didn’t mean it.

7
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:16,034
I didn’t do it.

8
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,177
He’s not the culprit.

9
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,034
Found the bloodstain.

10
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,908
Can we release Art?

11
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:23,020
He has nothing to do with Kao’s disappearance.

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,411
No use to keep being persistent.

13
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,537
Better let them live together happily. Don’t get in the way.

14
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:29,580
But if I really love someone, I’m willing to waste my time, Phaya.

15
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:32,500
Tharn, I’m going to do everything to have you by my side.

16
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:52,605
Please stop.

17
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:57,680
If you keep doing this, your soul will be destroyed one day.

18
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:00,194
He messes with what is mine.

19
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,942
He has to die!

20
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:07,382
Nothing ever belongs to you, you are well aware of that.

21
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,994
Tharn didn’t choose you.

22
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:15,020
The worst sin in life is to think only about oneself.

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,354
This love full of selfishness that you’re trying hold on to...

24
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:24,800
will eventually burn you to hell.

25
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,640
I don’t care.

26
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:29,760
I will never let them be together.

27
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,337
Tharn has to be with me, and I will make them parted for eternity.

28
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,268
Tharn, wake up.

29
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,245
Tharn.

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,577
Wake up.

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,340
Phaya!

32
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:18,605
Hey!

33
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,771
What happened?

34
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:30,331
Are you okay?

35
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:36,971
Yeah.

36
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:41,851
Did you have a bad dream again?

37
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:50,628
Yeah.

38
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:59,577
In that dream, someone was trying to strangle me.

39
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:03,805
It was so real.

40
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,822
I think you should wear this necklace while you sleep.

41
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:39,588
Okay.

42
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:45,645
I’m all right now. Let’s go back to sleep.

What you saw isn’t a dream.

61
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,817
It’s your karma.

62
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:11,260
What I saw in the dream is acutally my karma?

63
00:07:11,794 --> 00:07:15,520
Tharn, that doctor you’re getting a treatment from…

64
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,365
Better keep these two people away from each other.

65
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,565
Don’t let them meet.

66
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:39,120
Hello, Luangpor.

67
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,194
Tharn.

68
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:42,320
I need your advice on something.

69
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,508
Okay.

70
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:48,674
Wake up, Tharn.

71
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:51,348
It wasn’t just your voice that I heard.

72
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,788
I also heard someone else’s voice.

73
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:57,611
That person was screaming in pain.

74
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,331
The voice sounded so familiar.

75
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:11,820
Bounded by a chain of karma and the ego that knows no end,
he is coming back to reclaim what once belonged to him.

76
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:15,234
What do you mean by that?

77
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:23,062
Tharn, you and Phaya must be more careful during these days.

78
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:30,651
Always be mindful. The danger can occur in any moment.

79
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:33,108
What danger, Luangpor?

80
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:38,660
You both will face a serious problem.

81
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,097
Stay mindful and use your wisdom.

82
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:48,860
Remember, your good deeds and merits will always protect you.

83
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:54,034
Also, try to stay away from the river.

84
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:56,000
Because it’s where he lives.

85
00:08:58,537 --> 00:08:59,794
Yes, Luangpor.

86
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,211
[Phaya: I already put your clothes in a washer.]

87
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:27,920
[Phaya: You can wear my clothes to work today.]

88
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:31,268
[Phaya: Hurry up and get dressed then come down for breakfast.]

89
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:13,440
Hey.

90
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:19,700
Does it fit? I think it’s a little too big.

91
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:22,480
It’s okay.

92
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,034
I made you a sandwich. Try it.

93
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:34,297
Go on. I want to know if you like it or not.

94
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:42,628
Where is your Grandma?

95
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,314
I want to say goodbye to her before we go to work.

96
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:50,342
My sister took her to see a friend.

97
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:57,485
Do you want sugar?

98
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:00,342
I’ll have two of that.

99
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,942
Two?

100
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,331
Hmm

101
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:20,262
Why did you kiss me?

102
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,971
Well, you said you wanted two of that.

103
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,302
So, I just gave you my sweetest kisses. Do you want more?

104
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,525
Quit it. I meant the sugar.

105
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,531
If you keep eating like that, you’ll get diabetes soon.

106
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,514
Better have my sweet kiss instead. It’s good for your health.

107
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:41,622
Whatever, I don’t want it anymore.

108
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:42,537
Aww

109
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,542
By the way, I just talked to the Abbot.

110
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:02,765
I told him about your bad dream.

111
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
He asked me to warn you...

112
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,508
to try to stay away from the river.

113
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,782
But can I stay close to you then?

114
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,885
Quit fooling around. I’m being serious.

115
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:24,182
It might have something to do with why you had a bad dream last night.

116
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,994
But it’s just a dream after all. Don’t worry too much.

117
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:52,525
Or maybe, it might be because I decided to be with you.

118
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:57,497
Hey, stop that. It’s totally unrelated.

119
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,131
I already told you, haven’t I? That I’ll always be by your side.

120
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:05,485
Well, if you’re that worried,

121
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,074
why don’t you move in with me  so that we can be together all the time?

122
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:10,285
Wanna do that?

123
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:10,990
No.

124
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,222
I’ll let you say it again.

125
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:16,822
No.

126
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,891
But my bed is so soft. You had already tried it last night.

127
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:26,640
Ouch.

128
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,834
What are you doing?

129
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:36,537
It’s a mess now.

130
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:57,565
Hurry up and finish your breakfast so that we can go to work.

131
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,268
I know that.

132
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,537
Stop smiling like a fool.

133
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:04,022
Tharn!

134
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,217
Tharn! Where are you?

135
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:07,965
Tharn!

136
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:09,530

There you are. Why didn’t you pick up my call?

Why didn’t you pick up my call last night?

156
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,001
Are you working today?

157
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:49,127
I thought you’d take a day off.

158
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:51,596
Hewwww

159
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,002
I’m not sick. Why should I take a day off?

160
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:57,922
Well, I thought you’d go on a honeymoon...

161
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:59,850
since last night...

162
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,256
you slept at Phaya’s place, didn’t you?

163
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:04,896
Hey!

164
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,247
That’s right.

165
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:07,478
How did you know?

166
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:11,699
I had dinner around your flat last night. I wanted to drop by your place to give you some snacks...

167
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,266
but you didn’t pick up my call.

168
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,738
I went to your room and rang the bell but no one answered it.

169
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,416
So, I figured out you might not be home.

170
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,715
And then I saw you two coming to work together.

171
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:21,047
It was so obvious.

172
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,145
Yeah.

173
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,143
You’re also wearing an oversized shrit.

174
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:28,021
It must be Phaya’s.

175
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,095
Hooo

176
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:33,785
It’s pretty obvious. Just admit it.

177
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,478
Come on. Just say it.

178
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:41,604
From what I’ve analysed,

179
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:46,908
our suspect seems to be lying. He tries to avoid our gaze and is also stuttering.

00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:47,681
(Laughing)

181
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:49,759
- Yeah, stuttering indeed.
- Ouch.

182
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,238
- Stuttering, you said?
- Ouch.

183
00:16:51,238 --> 00:16:53,036
Stuttering my arse.

184
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:56,016
Babe, help me. I was just making fun of him a bit.

185
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,522
- Ouch!
- Ouch!

186
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:00,271
That’s enough.

187
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,856
Yes, he slept at my place.

188
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,391
My grandma and my sister wanted to thank him and treat him for dinner.

189
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:09,013
Thank him for what?

190
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,421
For loving me...

191
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:15,108
For every time that you hug me...

192
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,248
- Hug you?
- Ouch.

193
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:21,172
Babe, help me.

194
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,098
Help!

195
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:23,450
Give it to me.

196
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,415
Here, let me help.

197
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:31,650
- I’ll help you.
- Ouch.

198
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:36,224
I’m glad to see you smile like that again.

199
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:39,376
And to have someone by your side.

200
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,685
Phaya.

201
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,821
What?

202
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,469
Take care of my bro for me.

203
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:49,113
Me too.

204
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:51,102
You too, what?

205
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:53,272
Please take care of my body too.

206
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,545
Your body? Okay.

207
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:55,740
Come, Tongthai.

208
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,005
- Your body?
- Ouch.

209
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,393
- One more.
- Ouch.

210
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:00,847
Make it two.

211
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:01,925
- Two more?
- Okay.

212
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:02,925
You got it.

213
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:05,304
Ouch! Ouch!

214
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:07,557
Hey, guys!

215
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,209
Hey!

216
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,547
Inspector has called for a meeting about Kao’s case.

217
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:14,971
- Hey!
- Hey!

218
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:22,064
This morning, the bank called to confirm they had detected a new transaction on Kao’s credit card.

219
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,753
But the person who used it isn’t Kao.

220
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:25,873
It’s a teenage boy who is around 20 years old.

221
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:27,999
He told us he went there to find some fish.

222
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,652
And found Kao’s wallet in the swamp.

223
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,315
Where’s this swamp?

224
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:34,762
6km away from where Kao got off the taxi.

225
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,341
We’ve checked via the satelltie.

226
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:39,201
It’s a deserted forest with no residences nearby.

227
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,194
Just a forest and the swamp where the wallet was found.

228
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:43,076
What was Kao doing there?

229
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:55,830
Phaya, Tharn, and Yai. Go find more evidence at the swamp.

230
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,089
Tongthai and Kem, go to Ning’s place.

231
00:18:58,089 --> 00:18:59,853
Make her talk more about Kao.

232
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:04,774
Ask her if Kao has any sibling or relative that he can rely on.

233
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:07,156
Someone he really trusts that he can stay with them.

234
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,437
Yes, sir.

235
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:25,301
Found anything?

236
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:26,411
Not yet.

237
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:49,338
We haven’t seen any residence in this area.

238
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:52,172
Why would Kao come here?

239
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:55,689
Or did he come here to meet that person he was talking to on the phone?

240
00:19:55,689 --> 00:20:00,879
The taxi driver also said that Kao asked to get off after he hung up.

241
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:06,004
At a place like this? It’s probably not something good.

242
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,327
Let’s split up and look around the swamp.

243
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:09,445
We might get more evidence from there.

244
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:10,448
Okay.

245
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:16,934
I tried to interview those people but still didn’t get anything new.

246
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:37,183
Phaya! Phaya!

247
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:40,589
Tharn, what’s wrong?

248
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:44,163
You’d better get out of here.

249
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,586
Why?

250
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,353
Don’t you remember what the Abbot has warned you?

251
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,712
That you should stay away from the river.

252
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:59,087
Go and wait outside.

253
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,587
Yai and I will take care of it here.

254
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:03,368
I don’t want anything to happen to you.

255
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:06,996
I’ll be fine. You’re here with me.

256
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,044
You’ve seen a lot of visions where I was supposed to be dead.

257
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:11,301
But I’m still alive.

258
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:17,470
I trust you that you’d be able to take care of me.

259
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,866
And I want you to trust me too.

260
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,866
So what?

261
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:24,948
I’m not leaving you.

262
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:32,071
Promise me...

263
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:35,549
that you won’t go anywhere.

264
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:39,079
Okay.

265
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:52,299
Now, I wish my wife were a cop too.

266
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:55,496
So that I would get some romantic scene like this.

267
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:09,546
(Shutter sound)

268
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:21,138
(Coughing)

269
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,906
Oh, that one was mine.

270
00:22:26,906 --> 00:22:28,537
I’m sorry.

271
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:36,185
The tide is quite stable now.

272
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:40,401
Let’s have the divers go look under the water again.

273
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,793
Yes, sir.

274
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,980
Where should we start?

275
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,588
(Incoming call)

276
00:22:50,588 --> 00:22:52,722
Hi, Doc.

277
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:55,908
Oh, I’m working.

278
00:22:57,714 --> 00:22:59,373
Hello?

279
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:03,050
Hello? The signal isn’t quite good here.

280
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,315
Hello? Can you hear me?

281
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,365
Yes.

282
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:12,647
I went there to discuss about the case.

283
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:14,711
It was quite late so I just slept there.

284
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:16,724
That’s good.

285
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:19,868
Let’s start.

286
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:20,750
Okay.

287
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,458
Yes.

288
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,911
Divers, please get ready.

289
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:36,904
เฮ้ย

290
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:46,871
I’ll go see you after my work is done.

291
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:49,099
I have something to talk to you.

292
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,971
See you.

293
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:54,135
That way.

294
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:55,447
Come quick!

295
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:07,677
Tharn!

296
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:10,493
Tharn! Where are you?

297
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:11,420
Tharn!

298
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:12,832
Tharn!

299
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,298
Tharn!

300
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,038
What’s he doing?

301
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:20,956
Tharn!

302
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,089
Tharn!

303
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:33,685
Tharn! Tharn!

304
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:37,572
Tharn! Tharn!

305
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:39,994
Tharn! What are you doing?

306
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:19,857
Why am I here?

307
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:25,367
Today, you will know the truth about your past.

00:26:05,702 --> 00:26:08,502
I’m glad we meet again.

00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:20,959
Who are you?

313
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,051
Where is this place?

314
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:28,491
How did I get here?

315
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:31,714
You were here before.

316
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:33,371
Don’t you remember?

317
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,776
I was here?

318
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:40,411
I have been waiting for so long to meet you.

319
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:44,742
To make amends to what I have done wrong to you...

320
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,388
and Wansarut.

321
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:49,188
Do you know Wansarut?

322
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,119
She is my younger sister.

323
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,474
And also your lover.

324
00:26:56,804 --> 00:27:00,868
Today, you will know all the truth about your past.

325
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,685
Master Garuda.

326
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:05,256
Garuda?

327
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:44,308
Argh!

328
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:46,674
Why does it hurt so much?!

329
00:27:46,674 --> 00:27:47,931
Arghh!

330
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:50,708
You’re being constricted by the Naga like that Garuda.

331
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,056
Arghhh!

332
00:27:52,054 --> 00:27:56,159
You can also feel his pain...

333
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:59,451
because you and that Garuda...

334
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,039
is one and the same.

335
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:02,811
(Crying in pain)
Arghh!

336
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:34,708
That damn doctor.

337
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,759
He is Prince Chalothorn.

338
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:40,045
The ruler of Naga city.

339
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:42,742
And also your enemy of love.

340
00:28:46,814 --> 00:28:52,468
You were injured from your fight with Chalothorn and then you met my sister.

341
00:28:57,885 --> 00:28:59,382
Ouch!

342
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:01,519
Ouch!

343
00:29:03,028 --> 00:29:03,611
Ouch!

344
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,176
Ouch!

345
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:44,811
That's my sister Wansarut.

346
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:01,451
Why did you help me?

347
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,382
Because you were still alive.

348
00:31:07,028 --> 00:31:08,525
Once you’ve regained your strength,

349
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:10,228
get out of this place as soon as you can.

350
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:20,765
Ouch!

351
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:23,119
Don’t touch me!

352
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,399
Thank you.

353
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:41,085
I will repay you when I can.

354
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,239
Can you repay it now?

355
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,274
What do you want?

356
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,885
Can you and your kind stop hunting us?

357
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,399
Can’t we just live our separate lives?

358
00:31:58,228 --> 00:31:59,039
Ouch!

359
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:04,354
If Chalothorn hadn’t attacked us first,

360
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:07,291
then we wouldn’t have to hurt you and your kind.

361
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:10,491
I don’t want to argue with you.

362
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:12,491
Get well soon.

363
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:13,725
And leave.

364
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:26,251
Ouch!

365
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,485
Is this the cause of vengeance between the Naga and the Garuda?

366
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:49,222
In the past, Naga and Garuda were siblings.

367
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:55,485
But due to a serious controversy and also jealousy, it escalated into a war between bloodlines.

368
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:14,845
I haven’t visited the human world for quite some time.

369
00:33:15,942 --> 00:33:20,731
Have you come down to visit here lately?

370
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:23,942
The human world?

371
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:29,165
Long before I was born,

372
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:33,439
there was a legend told about a Naga...

373
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:36,879
who disguised itself as a man in order to become a monk.

374
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:44,811
One night while that Naga was asleep and revealed its true self,

375
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:49,279
the Buddha asked it to leave the monkhood…

376
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:54,468
since it was not a human creature and couldn’t be ordained to become a monk.

377
00:33:57,062 --> 00:34:01,862
Later on, when the Buddha came down from the second heaven where Indra dwells...

378
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:06,354
after visiting his mother for one whole season,

379
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:13,759
all the Nagas and Naginis as well as their attendants…

380
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:19,142
had brought their offerings and breathed out fire to pay respect to the Buddha...

381
00:34:19,702 --> 00:34:23,771
on his return to the human world on the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon.

382
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:31,336
There...look at that.

383
00:34:34,182 --> 00:34:35,508
Beautiful, isn’t it?

384
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:41,142
Yes.

385
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:48,239
So beautiful.

386
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:19,279
But in the end,

387
00:35:19,976 --> 00:35:22,136
everything was ruined because of me.

388
00:35:24,308 --> 00:35:25,931
Because of my jealousy...

389
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:30,239
for wanting Master Chalothorn for my own.

390
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:33,931
So, I set up a plan...

391
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,702
and made it look like Wansarut was poisoned to death.

392
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:40,924
Then I would take her to you.

393
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:44,616
But then...

394
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:48,891
nothing ever escaped the eyes and ears of Master Chalothorn.

395
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:52,216
You tried to take Wansarut away.

396
00:35:52,354 --> 00:35:54,468
But you were caught by Chalothorn.

397
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:57,405
Wansarut! Wansarut! Where are you?

398
00:35:57,428 --> 00:35:58,479
Wansarut!

399
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:00,056
Wansarut! Where are you?

400
00:36:00,388 --> 00:36:01,439
Wansarut!

401
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:02,811
Wansarut!

402
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:04,136
Wansarut!

403
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,622
Where are you?

404
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:06,685
Wansarut!

405
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,011
Wansarut!

406
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:10,319
Wansarut!

407
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,222
Master Garuda, what are you doing here?

408
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,691
You would be in danger if you are seen.

409
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:18,502
I’m worried about you. Where have you been?

410
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:21,359
This is my home.

411
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:24,102
Do not worry about me.

412
00:36:25,176 --> 00:36:26,342
Please go.

413
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:28,334
No.

414
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:29,645
You have to come with me.

415
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:30,822
You can’t be here.

416
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:32,902
I can’t go with you.

417
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:35,062
Can’t you see...

418
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:38,708
what a war caused by your brother has destroyed?

419
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:41,599
I don’t want anyone to die because of me.

420
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,651
No, you have to come with me.

421
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:45,702
You can’t be here.

422
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:47,119
Please go back.

423
00:36:58,102 --> 00:37:00,022
Nobody is going anywhere.

424
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,211
(Fighting)

425
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:04,354
(Fighting)

426
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:05,874
(Fighting)

427
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:12,239
(Fighting)

428
00:37:12,548 --> 00:37:13,782
Stop it!

429
00:37:15,988 --> 00:37:16,868
Ouch!

430
00:37:21,348 --> 00:37:22,708
Please stop, Master Chalothorn.

431
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:23,656
(Fighting)

432
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:25,816
(Fighting)

433
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,256
Stop!

434
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,668
Master Chalothorn.

435
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:48,891
I will stay with you.

436
00:37:49,188 --> 00:37:51,074
Please let Master Garuda go.

437
00:37:51,256 --> 00:37:52,376
I’m not going anywhere.

438
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:54,994
No...don’t do that.

439
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:00,971
Master Chalothorn.

440
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,222
Return her to me!

441
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:38,788
No.

442
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:40,331
She is mine.

443
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,805
You should let her go.

444
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:45,119
She doesn’t love you.

445
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:49,645
I don’t care. Whether she loves me or not, she must stay with me.

446
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:51,371
Not with someone like you.

447
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,599
You are Nagini.

448
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:57,885
Garuda and Nagini can’t be together.

449
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:01,999
What we have between Wansarut and I...

450
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:04,365
is pure love and affection.

451
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:11,254
Why do we have to create a condition or boundary for our love?

452
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:14,708
Love has no right or wrong.

453
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:16,994
I will prove to you...

454
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:19,588
that a Garuda like me...

455
00:39:21,816 --> 00:39:24,091
can also love Wansarut.

456
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:41,014
(Fighting)

457
00:41:32,582 --> 00:41:34,079
Wansarut!

458
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,714
No!

459
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:40,354
No!

460
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:44,936
Wansarut!

461
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,616
Wansarut!

462
00:41:59,222 --> 00:42:00,171
Wansarut!

463
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,102
Sorry...

464
00:42:05,062 --> 00:42:06,094
I’m sorry.

465
00:42:06,114 --> 00:42:07,165
Garuda,

466
00:42:11,942 --> 00:42:15,588
I might not be able to be with you in this life.

467
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:19,554
But in my other next lives,

468
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:23,931
I only wish to be right next to you.

469
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,314
And I will always take care of you.

470
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,262
I promise you.

471
00:42:48,788 --> 00:42:50,331
If our next lives do exist,

472
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,228
I will keep looking for you...

473
00:42:56,011 --> 00:42:57,302
until my last breath.

474
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:12,651
Arrrrrh

475
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:16,536
Arrrrrh

476
00:43:20,314 --> 00:43:21,771
Wansarut!

477
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:35,976
Wansarut felt so guilty for being the cause of your death.

478
00:43:36,411 --> 00:43:41,439
So, she decided to cough out her own soul…

479
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,702
to save your life.

480
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:46,799
But she was so weak.

481
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,256
And wasn’t able to help you.

482
00:43:50,614 --> 00:43:54,845
Still, she had made a wish before losing her last breath.

483
00:43:56,422 --> 00:43:59,554
What does all this have to do with me?

484
00:44:00,102 --> 00:44:02,822
I didn’t take Wansarut from Chalotorn.

485
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:05,668
I didn’t even know your sister.

486
00:44:06,274 --> 00:44:11,634
No matter how many lives have passed, you and my sister will always find each other.

487
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,514
Even now, you and my sister are still in love with each other.

488
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:19,634
I don’t love your sister anymore.

489
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:21,565
I already have someone else that I love.

490
00:44:21,736 --> 00:44:22,822
His name is Tharn.

491
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:27,679
That Wansarut you used to love...

492
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,051
is Tharn.

493
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:35,268
You and Wansarut are destined to meet in every life…

494
00:44:35,931 --> 00:44:37,725
but never be able to be together...

495
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:40,879
because Master Chalothorn will always be there to obstruct you.

496
00:44:41,976 --> 00:44:43,599
And kill you.

497
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:49,279
But he’s also unable to do so because you have the soul of Naga with you.

498
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:51,999
The one that my sister gave you.

499
00:44:57,222 --> 00:44:58,456
The soul of Naga?

500
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:02,182
It’s that necklace Wansarut gave you.

501
00:45:02,948 --> 00:45:05,382
Never remove it.

502
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:19,691
(Wind sound)

503
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:25,851
Master Chalothorn must have known already...

504
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,844
that I am here to see you.

505
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:29,508
And tell you everything.

506
00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:35,565
On this 15th night of the 11th waxing moon, you must protect my sister.

507
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:38,251
Do not let Master Chalothorn take her away.

508
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:41,714
Otherwise you and my sister...

509
00:45:41,714 --> 00:45:44,934
will be parted...forever.

510
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:50,354
Wait! Wanwisa! Wait!

511
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:52,959
Wait!

512
00:45:53,736 --> 00:45:56,091
Ouch!

513
00:45:57,759 --> 00:45:59,542
Ouch!

514
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:05,199
Hey!

515
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:06,662

The Sign

518
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:44,027
It’s really Kao

519
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:46,755
Judging from his body,

520
00:46:47,323 --> 00:46:49,839
he must be killed somewhere else and dumped here.

521
00:46:55,386 --> 00:46:58,899
[Phaya: Lieut Tam didn’t tie this knot on his ankles by himself.]

522
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:02,944
The knot is at the back. This means someone tied it for him.

523
00:47:02,944 --> 00:47:03,754
That’s right.

524
00:47:06,009 --> 00:47:07,199
Excuse me?

525
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,390
Tharn.

526
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:18,222
The knot on his ankles...

527
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:21,246
looks exactly like the one on Lieut Tam’s body.

528
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:24,687
These two cases must be related.

529
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,683

00:47:39,495 --> 00:47:40,689

Hey!

533
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:19,879
I’d like to inform IDF unit...

534
00:48:20,722 --> 00:48:22,498
that we’ve found Kao’s body.

535
00:48:22,498 --> 00:48:23,599
Hey!

536
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,702
Stop!

537
00:48:30,557 --> 00:48:31,540
Hey!

538
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:44,900
Stop!

539
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:49,087
Put your hands up!

540
00:48:49,865 --> 00:48:51,595
Turn around slowly.

549
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:27,774
Stop!

550
00:50:31,148 --> 00:50:32,206
(Gasping for air)

551
00:50:32,206 --> 00:50:33,637
Are you all right?

552
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:35,196
Follow him!

553
00:50:40,354 --> 00:50:41,560
Ouch!

554
00:50:50,545 --> 00:50:52,254
Phaya!

555
00:51:41,624 --> 00:51:42,882
Phaya!

556
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:48,673
Phaya!

557
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:57,252
Phaya!

558
00:51:58,047 --> 00:51:59,123
Phaya!

559
00:52:04,395 --> 00:52:06,540
Phaya!

560
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:10,505
Help!

561
00:52:11,884 --> 00:52:13,307
Help!

562
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:15,858
Anybody, please help!

563
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:17,658
Help!

564
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,977
Phaya!

565
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,883
Anybody, please help!

566
00:52:37,582 --> 00:52:40,520
Idolfactory

567
00:52:41,428 --> 00:52:43,622
Phaya, please stay with me.

568
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:45,179
Pipop!

569
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:46,229
Um

570
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:50,257
Are you saying that Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases are related to your parents’ case?

571
00:52:51,555 --> 00:52:54,056
Our suspect tried to fight back

572
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:54,971
(Fighting)

573
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,692
So, I got a glimpse of the tattoo on his arm.

574
00:52:57,692 --> 00:52:59,733
If you want me to believe you,

575
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:00,921
show me an evidence.

576
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:03,638
I’ll let you choose whether you’d take us with you,

577
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,955
or I’ll tell the Inspector.

578
00:53:04,955 --> 00:53:09,758
If you can’t separate work from your personal matters,

579
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:47,340
