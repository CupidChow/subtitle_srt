1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,594
A man wearing a mask, a hat and a hoody.

2
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:04,411
Exactly the man that Miss Meena had described.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,594
Get down!

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,040
(Screaming)

5
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:09,210
We’ve got one suspect.

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,302
His name is Narong, a forensic officer.

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,137
I’ve checked the access record.

8
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,108
He had accessed to the case files on rapes and sexual assault in the past month.

9
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,525
He’s not running away.

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,131
He’s going to finish his job on his last victim.

11
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,057
That is Songyod.

12
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,457
Can I tag along too?

13
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:23,542
- Of course.
- No.

14
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,331
When you imagine something has happened...

15
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,834
when in fact it never happened at all.

16
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:30,948
Did Tharn tell you about me?

17
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:34,160

The Sign

34
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:30,674
Yes, sir.

35
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:32,251
I’ll get it done as soon as possible.

36
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:38,297
Thongthai and Kem. Come with me to see Mr. Songyod.

37
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,102
Singh, you stay here.

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,691
Try to track down Narong’s phone
and check all the CCTV cameras on every route that he takes.

39
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,794
Find out where he had been since the last day he came to work.

40
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,834
Phaya, Tharn and Yai. Go to Narong’s house near Suvannabhumi airport.

41
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:54,502
We might find a cellar there.

42
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,262
Let’s get to work.

43
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,085
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,400
We’re going after the culprit.

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,137
If you guys are still mad at each other like this, it might ruin the work.

46
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,611
Go and clear it up with him first.

47
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:13,280
Phaya.

48
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,491
Phaya!

49
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:25,725
Phaya, wait!

50
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,514
I’ve never told Doc about your dream.

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,108
Then how did he know?

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,245
I’ll ask him how he knew about it.

53
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,960
Then what? It wouldn’t make anything better.

54
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:46,571
Because you...

55
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:49,120
already betrayed me.

56
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,251
I never betrayed you.

57
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,051
Shut up! I don’t want to talk about it anymore.

58
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,885
Hey!

59
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,520
I don’t want you to misunderstand me.

60
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:09,780
If you think I’m nuts, then leave me alone.

61
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,640
Damn it! That’s too much!

62
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:15,531
It’s okay.

63
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:19,851
Let’s go.

64
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,354
(Door opening)

65
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:09,817
Guys.

66
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:12,822
Look.

67
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:18,740
(Thrill Sound)

68
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,782
It’s really him.

69
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,720
What a psycho.

70
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,291
He planned everything for his revenge.

71
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:28,171
But all those cases have nothing to do with his sister.

72
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,634
Why did he do it then?

73
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:41,428
It’s a sign from someone who used to be a victim.

74
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:45,885
For what?

75
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:49,988
To retaliate.

76
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:53,017
Like the laws in the past.

77
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:56,377
An eye for an eye (and a tooth for a tooth.)

78
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,800
Those victims were tortured – whip lashing and hung by the neck. Their tongues...

79
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,668
and genital organs got cut off and finally they were shot in the head.

80
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:19,154
We’re at Narong’s place right now.

81
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:24,182
We’ve found evidence that he is the real culprit.

82
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,342
But there’s still no sign of Narong.

83
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,902
He might know that we’d be coming and probably ran away before we arrived.

84
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:35,291
How is it going over there?

85
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,451
What?

86
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:42,742
Okay. See you at the office.

87
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,497
Songyod is at our office right now.

88
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:52,262
Let’s gather all the evidence and go back there.

89
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,422
- Okay.
- Um

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,971
(Door opening)

91
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:53,862
Hey!

92
00:08:59,017 --> 00:08:59,977
Yai! What happened?!

93
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,485
Stop!

94
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,640
Shit! Why are there two of them?

95
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,474
- Follow him!
- Okay

96
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:23,988
Stop!

97
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:25,817
Stop!

98
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:29,542
Stop right now!

99
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,668
I said stop!

100
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Stop!

101
00:09:54,194 --> 00:10:00,420
Stop! Stop right now!

102
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:05,657
Where did he go?

103
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:08,525
Stop!

104
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:16,820
Shit!

105
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:24,148
Damn it!

106
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,165
Stop!

107
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,040
Get up!

108
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:39,040
Get up!

109
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,977
You have the right to remain silent...

110
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,234
What the fuck are you babbling about?

111
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,114
Wit!

112
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:16,011
You’re wasting my time, Inspector.

113
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:18,228
When will you let me go?

114
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,828
I recommend you to cooperate with us and stay here for a while.

115
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:27,714
It’s for the sake of your own safety.

116
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,834
The man who wants to attack you is sitll on the loose.

117
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,611
Then go get him.

118
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,131
Your salaries are paid from the taxes we pay.

119
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:39,291
So, you’d better work hard.

120
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,782
Don’t just be a guarding dog...

121
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,977
Oops, I mean a security guard who’s keeping watch on my every move.

122
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:51,140
This man wants to hurt you...

123
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:53,417
because you raped his younger sister.

124
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:56,400
So, you’d better be careful. Or else you might end up as the next dead body.

125
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,360
Excuse me? What are you talking about?

126
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:03,340
My client is an innocent man.

127
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,380
Please keep in mind why Mr. Songyod has to be here.

128
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:12,620
He’s here as a prospect who might fall victim to the culprit.

129
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,902
I don’t understand why you keep trying to incriminate my client.

130
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,754
Are you sure?

131
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,874
I’ve looked at the record. It seems you’ve had a lot of charges filing against you.

132
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,800
Khem.

133
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,588
He actually has a lot of cases.

134
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,211
I admire you and your team for your fast and effiecient work.

135
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:37,860
And I’m greatly honoured to receive a protection from your team…

136
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,137
as an innocent man.

137
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:43,451
Okay then.

138
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,960
But let me warn you about something.

139
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,217
You’d better watch out and lay low during these days.

140
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,542
You’re the culprit’s real target --  the victim that he wants to kill the most.

141
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:08,820
Then I hope you and your team...

142
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,125
will catch this culprit soon so that I can finally feel at ease.

143
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,725
Please let me know if you need anything.

144
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:21,828
I’d be more than willing to help.

145
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:02,240
Yes, sir.

146
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,131
Thank you very much, sir. Everything went well.

147
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,260
Once I’m done with my business at the safe house...

148
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,691
please allow me to treat you to a meal.

149
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,445
Tharn, let’s go.

150
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,708
Mr. Songyod, please say something.

151
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,000
Please say something.

152
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,285
What made you do it?

153
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,405
Why did you do it?

154
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,394
Listen up, everyone.

155
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,914
Please allow me to explain.

156
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,828
My client only came here to provide some information to the police...

157
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,160
so that they could use it to catch the culprit.

158
00:14:56,182 --> 00:15:00,340
But is it true that you were once sued with the charge of sexual assault?

159
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,405
- Is it true, Mr. Songyod?
- Is it true?
- Is it true?

160
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,405
Excuse me?

161
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,285
We refuse to answer any questions that are not related to this case.

162
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,268
I’m afraid there’s nothing much I could tell you today.

163
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,302
It might jeopardize the authority’s investigation on the case.

164
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,320
But I’m so thankful to the special investigation unit...

165
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,605
for their quick and effective work.

166
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,737
They really make me feel safe.

167
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,788
As an innocent man, I feel so grateful to them.

168
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:30,377
Let’s go!

169
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:34,148
Block them.

170
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,788
Go, go!

171
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,920
Where are you going?

172
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,828
Go!

173
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,222
- Mr. Songyod!
- Please wait!

174
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:52,380
We almost got him at Narong’s place.

175
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,954
It was my fault that he got away.

176
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,514
We’re checking the CCTV cameras to track down the car and his escape route.

177
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:03,580
It’s all right.

178
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:11,051
Singh, what have you got?

179
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,771
I’ve hacked into the system...

180
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,645
and found out that Wit is the boyfriend of Rin, Narong’s younger sister who had killed herself.

181
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,125
I think Wit is probably helping the culprit.

182
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,931
He gave Narong a tip-off and kept informing him about our investigation.

183
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:42,137
I’m afraid Wit is not going to say anything.

184
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,405
He probably wants Narong to finish his job.

185
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,257
What’s going on?!

186
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:54,354
Ouch!

187
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:06,340

188
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:13,441
The Sign

189
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:26,209
Drive me to the safe house. I’m going to clean up a bit.

190
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:29,961
Also, call the agent and tell them to send me those girls to kill my time.

191
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:37,798
Geez, those assholes. Now my suit stinks.

192
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:51,775
(Tap Sound)

193
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,901
What’s that sound?

194
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:02,441
Hey, why did you stop?

195
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:07,201
(Someone calling for help.)

196
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:09,706
Shit! What’s going on?!

197
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:10,895
Ouch!

198
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,981
(Sad Music)

199
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:53,135
Rin.

200
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:56,415
Why did you do this to me?

201
00:18:57,398 --> 00:18:59,123
(Crying)

202
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,238
(Crying)

203
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:07,146
(Crying)

204
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:19,958
Rin.

205
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:29,101
(Crying)

206
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:32,941
Rin.

207
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,535
Inspector, the security guard at the entrance said that...

208
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:48,758
there’s a car without a license plate parked not for away from our unit.

209
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:52,381
The description matches with the one Narong uses to escape and commit a crime.

210
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,066
Inspector.

211
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:58,918
- Singh, check the CCTV cameras at the front.
- Yes, sir.

212
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:00,838
- Khem and Thongthai. Try to find the connection.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:02,438
Mayris, go and look at the case files.

214
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:04,781
The one we were looking at yesterday.

215
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:10,438
(Messaging Sound)

216
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,095
- Found it?
- Yes, I found it.

217
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:13,958
Look here

218
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,921
- Inspector.
- Yes?

219
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,798
Damn it!

220
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,541
- Phaya!
- Phaya!

221
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,386
Let him go.

222
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:33,161
Did you give Narong a tip-off on our investigation?

223
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:35,161
That’s why he could always get away from us.

224
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,335
Is this what you and him have planned all along?

225
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,295
If you really want to help the victim.

226
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,489
If you want to make it right.

227
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,952
You have to let him pay for what he did to Rin. You have to let him die.

228
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,232
Why would you help him?

229
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:55,855
Because I’m a cop!

230
00:20:56,311 --> 00:21:00,026
Not even you or Narong has any rights to do this to anyone.

231
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,009
But those bastards can do it to other people?

232
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:05,135
Rin took her own life because of him.

233
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,541
Many people’s lives are ruined because of a fucking bastard like him.

234
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:12,701
The one who should be arrested is not me, but him!

235
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:17,001
This is why I have to get my hands dirty and do what you people are supposed to do.

236
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:19,881
This is what he deserves.

237
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:25,741
Whether he deserves it or not is not your job to decide. The laws will do it.

238
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:36,072
Narong and I only called out for those people who deserve a better justice.

239
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:41,203
Can’t you see how many people agree with me?

240
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:46,241
(Riots)

241
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:58,161
(Thrill Sound)

242
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:07,798
- Look into those paper again.
- Tharn, what else did you see?

243
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,112
What else did you see yesterday? Tharn!

244
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:14,712
Geez.

245
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:18,106
Inspector, we don’t have any time left.

246
00:22:20,678 --> 00:22:22,038
Let’s go get him!

247
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:25,055
Singh, show us pictures from the CCTV at the crime scene.

248
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:27,569
- I’m trying.
- These are all we’ve got.

249
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:28,563
Hurry up.

250
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:29,661
Show me again.

251
00:22:39,878 --> 00:22:42,861
(Airplane Sound)

252
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:58,666
Why do you want from me?

253
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:19,021
Do you remember me?

254
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:21,626
No.

255
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,809
If you want to stay alive, you’d better let me go.

256
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:29,921
Ouch!

257
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:35,169
If you can’t remember me,

258
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:42,301
what about this girl? Do you remember her?

259
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:49,398
No.

260
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,089
No?

261
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:58,998
Don't you remember her?

262
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:03,135
She’s the girl you raped.

263
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:18,121
(Someone panting)

264
00:24:32,358 --> 00:24:33,375
Watch me, Rin.

265
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:39,032
I’m going to make him pay for what he did to you.

266
00:24:56,758 --> 00:24:58,712
What are you doing?

267
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:06,952
What are you doing?!

268
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:09,603
Please don’t!

269
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:12,049
Please don’t hurt me.

270
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:16,401
(Thrill Sound)

271
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:23,261
What are you doing?!

272
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:35,238
Call for a backup.

273
00:25:35,352 --> 00:25:38,141
We’ll seal off the wood and search for the cellar that Wit told us about.

274
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:40,141
That’d be where Narong took Songyod and kept him captive.

275
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:44,041
Inspector, this is the place where Rin killed herself.

276
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,832
It’s nearby those areas where we found the victims’ bodies.

277
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:50,712
It’s possible that Narong might go back to the place where his sister killed herself.

278
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,038
Inspector!

279
00:25:57,161 --> 00:26:01,866
Someone annonymous called us and said that she has some clues about Narong’s whereabout.

280
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:05,615
I think she’s probably someone was raped by Songyod.

281
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:08,335
I’ve looked into all evidence.

282
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:10,872
Everything confirms that it’s the same place.

283
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,415
I’m sure Songyod is locked up there.

284
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:15,386
Are you sure?

285
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:21,089
Phaya, Tharn and Yai. Go to the wood and find out where the cellar is.

286
00:26:21,695 --> 00:26:25,041
Thongthai and Khem, come with me.
We must find the location of Songyod’s safe house.

287
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,752
We’re running out of time.

288
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,361
We must find Narong and stop him.

289
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:32,849
But Songyod is...

290
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,921
We’re not going to stand by and watch anyone commit a crime...

291
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:37,375
eventhough the victim has done something unforgiving.

292
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:40,111
(Wailing)

293
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:44,038
Our job is to devlier them into the hands of the laws.

294
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:45,958
Got it?

295
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:47,032
Yes, sir!

296
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:48,243
Let’s go!

297
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:01,441
(Laughing)

298
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:09,601
(Thrill Sound)

299
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:10,826
Hey!

300
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:11,752
Ouch!

301
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:14,438
(Airplane sound)

302
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:17,601
The noise there was very loud.

303
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:19,981
I don’t know what it was but it was so irritating.

304
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:21,523
There’s a loud noise.

305
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:22,815
This is the place.

306
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:24,575
We’ll divide into 2 teams.

307
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:25,295
Yai.

308
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,843
(Wailing)

309
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:51,761
(Thrill Sound)

310
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:53,761
Hello, everyone.

311
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:58,232
What you are about to see...

312
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:01,295
requires parental guidance.

313
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:05,761
Those who wish to walk down this path,

314
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:08,929
this will be your punishment.

315
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,506
The adults should be more aware...

316
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:17,741
and pay attention to normal people who have no power.

317
00:28:18,552 --> 00:28:19,786
People who have been bullied...

318
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,821
and the innocent ones who have fallen victims...

319
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:28,438
to an evil and disgusting act like what this rascal did.

320
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:32,552
What he deserves the most...

321
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:41,041
is the punsihment from hell that you are about to witness.

322
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:53,832
(Screaming)

323
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:55,066
I promise you...

324
00:28:57,478 --> 00:28:59,409
that I will not let you die so easily.

325
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:05,361
(Screaming)

326
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:11,361
(Thrill Sound)

327
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:25,341
(Screaming)

328
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,061
Please...please don’t hurt me.

329
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,043
Look.

330
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,603
(Whip lashing)

331
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:39,775
(Whip lashing)

332
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:41,786
- (Whip lashing)   /   - (Wailing)

333
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,581
(Whip lashing)

334
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:46,121
- (Whip lashing)    /    - (Wailing)

335
00:29:54,951 --> 00:30:00,506
(Screaming)

336
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:02,666
(Incoming call)

337
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:06,481
(Incoming call)

338
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:12,335
Stop what you’re doing right now.

339
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:14,975
Do you think you can bring justice to your sister by doing this?

340
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:19,192
It’s the justice that I can choose for myself.

341
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:21,649
And it’s about to be over.

342
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,523
Stop it right now.

343
00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:28,015
Your sister probably didn’t want to see her big brother
become a criminal like the man who had hurt her.

344
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:32,655
I’m willing to sacrifice myself for those who once fell victims follow suit.

345
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,581
See you in the LIVE, Inspector.

346
00:30:37,718 --> 00:30:39,841
H...help!

347
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:41,421
Wait! Hey!

348
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,158
Damn it!

349
00:30:43,158 --> 00:30:45,641
(Crying in pain)

350
00:30:45,923 --> 00:30:46,849
Fuck!

351
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:50,095
Inform Phaya and his team that the cellar is in that area.

352
00:30:50,091 --> 00:30:52,003
They must hurry up and find the cellar. We’re running out of time.

353
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,055
-  Go.   /   - Yes, sir.

354
00:31:05,135 --> 00:31:06,026
Ouch!

355
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:08,121
(Wailing)

356
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,529
What’s wrong?

357
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:14,609
He’s going to kill Songyod.

358
00:31:15,363 --> 00:31:17,961
(Wailing)

359
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:43,249
Don’t worry.

360
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:46,072
I won’t let you die that easily.

361
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:51,718
Do you think you’re the only one who can escape the hands of laws?

362
00:31:53,306 --> 00:31:55,226
I can do that too.

363
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:00,826
And this is…

364
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:05,512
Geez, why is it stuck now?

365
00:32:13,272 --> 00:32:17,081
(Screaming)

366
00:32:19,112 --> 00:32:21,112
Arghhhh!

367
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:32,129
Stop!

368
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,038
It’s over.

369
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:38,152
You can’t bring her back from death by doing this.

370
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:42,121
If you kill him, he won’t get to be punished any further.

371
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:47,169
But then no more people will have to fall victims to someone like him.

372
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:51,695
Rin should be happy to see him die slowly and painfully.

373
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:55,441
But you and your people are ruining my plan.

374
00:32:55,611 --> 00:33:00,643
I know you’re disappointed that a scroundel like him hasn’t
served the punishment for what he did.

375
00:33:00,735 --> 00:33:02,826
But that doesn’t mean you should become like him.

376
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:05,478
Let the laws handle these people.

377
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:06,769
The laws?

378
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:10,781
They are only for those who don’t have much enough power or money.

379
00:33:11,101 --> 00:33:12,221
You know that too.

380
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:15,889
How many cases were sealed off and ended up in silence.

381
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:18,072
Like my sister’s.

382
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:24,026
And look what happened to these scumbags?
They can still start a new and live a happy life.

383
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,706
What about my sister?

384
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:29,238
She was having a bright future ahead.

385
00:33:31,272 --> 00:33:33,215
She was getting married with the man she loved.

386
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:35,363
But then she was forced to take her own life...

387
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:38,529
because of what a scumbag like him did to her.

388
00:33:39,969 --> 00:33:42,792
If you want him to serve his punishment...

389
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,586
you should keep him alive.

390
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:48,426
If you kill him, he’d no longer be a criminal but a victim.

391
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:51,078
And you would become the criminal instead.

392
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,072
I don’t care.

393
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:58,072
I’m going to make him pay for what he did to my sister.

394
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,043
(Gunshot)

395
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:02,518
(Gunshot)

396
00:34:05,272 --> 00:34:06,232
(Gunshot)

397
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,003
(Gunshot)

398
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:09,672
(Gunshot)

399
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:11,329
(Gunshot)

400
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:17,101
Shit!

401
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:22,438
(Fighting)

402
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:23,226
(Fighting)

403
00:34:24,906 --> 00:34:25,569
(Fighting)

404
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:33,032
Phaya!

405
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:46,941
(Fighthing)

406
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:51,923
I don’t want a loser on my team.

407
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:55,398
Can I ask you a favour?

408
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:58,609
If it’s about the case, then I can do it for you.

The Sign

411
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:15,701
(Panting)

412
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,936
Tharn!

413
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:24,929
Tharn!

414
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:36,219
Tharn!

415
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:38,341
Tharn!

416
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:40,570
Tharn!

417
00:38:41,096 --> 00:38:42,449
Are you all right?

418
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,924
I’m glad you’re safe.

419
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:19,793
Tharn! Phaya!

420
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:25,907
This way!

421
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:51,896
Please be careful. Don’t let your wound come in contact with water.

422
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:53,439
Thank you.

423
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:32,970
Tharn.

424
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:39,861
Maybe you should go to the hospital.

425
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:42,559
I’m okay.

426
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:45,393
Thanks to the bulletproof vest,

427
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:47,941
or else my wound would be much deeprer.

428
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,124
Why didn’t you treat your wound?

429
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:57,427
It’s all right. I’m good.

430
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,010
Tharn.

431
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:02,799
Can I ask you something?

432
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:09,793
Tharn.

433
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:16,021
What happened to Narong…

434
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:18,387
in the cellar...

435
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:22,124
Those green eyes.

436
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,553
They are exactly what I saw in my dream.

437
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:32,159
I also saw those eyes when you were drowned.

438
00:41:34,547 --> 00:41:38,147
How did you save me back then?

439
00:41:39,473 --> 00:41:41,084
I can’t remember either.

440
00:41:42,273 --> 00:41:46,044
I just knew that thing would save our lives.

441
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:49,107
Then everything just happened like a miracle.

442
00:41:51,256 --> 00:41:54,101
Do you think that something which tried to attack me twenty years ago...

443
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,599
is now coming back?

444
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:00,341
That something...

445
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:02,513
might never stay from you at all.

446
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:06,581
This is like what happened at the camp.

447
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:10,261
And the training centre.

448
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,524
- Pull him up!    /    - Phaya!

449
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:16,113
You’re always there to rescue me.

450
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:20,033
What’s this all about?

451
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:22,227
I don’t know too.

452
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,364
Hey...

453
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:35,050
I’m...I’m sorry.

454
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,364
You got hurt because of me.

455
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:42,593
It was just a coincidence.

456
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:44,536
It wasn’t your fault.

457
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:47,899
I was just doing my job.

458
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:55,039
Tharn.

459
00:42:56,947 --> 00:42:58,684
When you got hurt,

460
00:43:00,547 --> 00:43:02,319
I was really afraid you’d die. I don’t want to feel like that anymore.

461
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:06,696
I promise...

462
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,919
that from now on I’ll always listen to everything you say.

463
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:16,787
Please don’t leave me.

464
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:25,141
I’m not going to leave you.

465
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,484
We’re on the same team.

466
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,833
How can I leave you?

467
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:40,570
What about...you thinking that I told Chalothorn about your dream?

468
00:43:42,547 --> 00:43:44,056
Are you still mad at me?

469
00:43:46,479 --> 00:43:47,489
Tharn.

470
00:43:53,187 --> 00:43:54,719
I don’t care about anyone.

471
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:57,999
I already told you.

472
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:02,341
I’ll listen everything you say.

473
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,084
I’m so sorry.

474
00:44:07,827 --> 00:44:09,164
For being an asshole.

475
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:16,090
It’s okay. I’m glad you’re safe.

476
00:44:46,604 --> 00:44:50,627
You said you couldn’t remember everything that happened in the cellar.

477
00:45:03,096 --> 00:45:07,747
You said you put your fingers on the kettle...

478
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,513
in order to destroy your fingerprints.

479
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:13,130
That’s why we couldn’t find any fingerprints at the crime scene.

480
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:32,259
(Pouring out water)

481
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,599
(Boiling water)

482
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,153
You don’t have to ask me anything.

483
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,930
If you want to arrest me, just put me in jail.

484
00:46:13,907 --> 00:46:16,719
You want to bring justice to your sister,

485
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:19,553
but you also killed those three victims.

486
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:22,821
The one who killed them...

487
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,136
is you.

488
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,810
And those bastards...

489
00:46:29,629 --> 00:46:32,410
who use their power to bully someone defendless like us.

490
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,987
The laws that you cherish and look up to...

491
00:46:40,707 --> 00:46:43,027
can never keep those scumbags behind bars for long.

492
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:47,084
They will get out and roam around happily.

493
00:46:48,524 --> 00:46:50,056
But victims like me...

494
00:46:53,381 --> 00:46:58,059
who have to carry those scars they had left on us,

495
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:03,347
can never live the life we used to have again.

496
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,130
Are you calling this justice?

497
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:10,273
Is it really fair?

498
00:47:12,673 --> 00:47:14,890
You are not different from those scumbags.

499
00:47:17,736 --> 00:47:18,433
Yes.

500
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:22,056
But I still believe.

501
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:26,479
I still believe that justice also takes time to proof itself.

502
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:28,376
But my sister’s time is done.

503
00:47:35,976 --> 00:47:36,959
Let me ask you one thing.

504
00:47:38,044 --> 00:47:40,284
Do you really think the job you’re doing...

505
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:42,867
is something that a hero would do?

506
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,421
You might not see yourself like that.

507
00:47:48,456 --> 00:47:49,953
But when in trouble,

508
00:47:51,347 --> 00:47:56,479
to those people out there, you’re a hero.

509
00:47:57,713 --> 00:47:58,741
You’re their hope.

510
00:48:01,153 --> 00:48:02,170
But then...

511
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:07,884
why a hero like you couldn’t do the right thing.

512
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:12,399
And help those who are in need.

513
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:18,341
Why?

514
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:23,210
Inspector.

515
00:48:27,016 --> 00:48:28,284
We’ve arrested Songyod.

516
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:34,867
Khem and Thongthai have found another evidence...

517
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:38,939
which are video clips of him raping other victims. They were hidden in his house.

518
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:44,261
Mr. Songyod.

519
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:46,259
(Shoutings)

520
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,667
Please calm down.

521
00:48:52,056 --> 00:48:55,621
That’s the justice you’re looking for.

522
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,296
It might show up late.

523
00:48:58,696 --> 00:49:00,284
But it will always come in the end.

524
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,793
I’m not going to let the victims or those who get hurt...

525
00:49:06,353 --> 00:49:10,284
falling into despair and giving up on justice like what you did.

526
00:49:11,004 --> 00:49:11,964
I give you my word.

527
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:19,450
Inspector.

528
00:49:19,644 --> 00:49:21,564
While we were searching Narong’s house,

529
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,981
we found a video clip of his sister before she committed suicide.

530
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:39,896
Thank you, my brother.

531
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,861
Thank you for always taking care of me.

532
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:48,147
I’m so lucky to be your sister.

533
00:49:49,461 --> 00:49:51,701
When our parents left us,

534
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,204
I always thought my life would never be happy again.

535
00:49:57,919 --> 00:49:59,004
But it’s not like that at all.

536
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:03,039
Although you’re the only family I have left,

537
00:50:03,873 --> 00:50:07,656
I still feel so happy like when our parents were with us.

538
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:10,101
I want to live my life.

539
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,570
I want to enjoy it.

540
00:50:12,924 --> 00:50:14,799
I want to stay happy like that forever.

541
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:17,221
But right now...

542
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:21,839
my happiness is gone.

543
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:26,947
(Crying)

544
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:30,679
All because of that bastard.

545
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:34,639
He took my whole life from me.

546
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:37,153
He took my happiness away.

547
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,541
He took my body and my soul.

548
00:50:43,427 --> 00:50:46,993
These days…

549
00:50:48,056 --> 00:50:51,099
I’m dying inside.

550
00:50:53,953 --> 00:50:55,713
You told me to wait.

551
00:50:56,273 --> 00:50:58,136
You told me to be patient.

552
00:51:01,873 --> 00:51:03,153
But I’m too tired.

553
00:51:04,959 --> 00:51:07,587
I want the laws to sentence him to death.

554
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:15,416
But the laws has given me death instead.

555
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,189
Me, who is the victim.

556
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:20,741
I’m sorry.

557
00:51:22,924 --> 00:51:24,159
I’m sorry.

558
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:26,079
I’m so sorry.

559
00:51:42,189 --> 00:51:46,627
Narong had tried to file a case against Songyod for many times.

560
00:51:47,061 --> 00:51:48,364
But it never went far.

561
00:51:49,644 --> 00:51:51,176
And the case eventually got dismissed…

562
00:51:51,189 --> 00:51:52,684
because there wasn’t enough evidence.

563
00:51:53,393 --> 00:51:57,164
A few days after Rin was released from the hospital,

564
00:51:58,399 --> 00:51:59,576
she took her own life.

565
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:08,033
When Narong said that police like us are also responsible for his sister’s death,

566
00:52:09,553 --> 00:52:10,844
I guess it’s true.

567
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:17,619
I don’t want someone who gives up so easily on my team.

568
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,816
Right now, we might not be able to bring justice to everyone.

569
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,844
But that doesn’t mean we won’t be able to make it happen.

570
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:31,519
If you are feeling discouraged just by hearing what they said,

571
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,279
I recommend you to quit.

572
00:52:36,147 --> 00:52:38,513
I don’t want a loser on my team.

573
00:52:45,027 --> 00:52:47,164
Even if I couldn’t help every victim,

574
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,153
I’m not going to run away.

575
00:52:52,284 --> 00:52:54,444
I’m not going to leave those who are in need of help...

576
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,370
ever falling into despair like her.

577
00:52:58,604 --> 00:52:59,770
Me too.

578
00:53:00,299 --> 00:53:07,141
I decided to become a cop because I still believe that justice still exists.

579
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:11,210
Those who have done wrong will eventually pay for what they did.

580
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,833
I don’t want to.

581
00:53:41,724 --> 00:53:42,844
I don’t know how to do it.

582
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:56,753
Singh.

583
00:53:57,576 --> 00:53:59,416
Come here. I have something to tell you.

584
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:08,259
So,

585
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,987
What do you want to tell me?

586
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,496
Can you do me a favour?

587
00:54:16,307 --> 00:54:17,290
What is it?

588
00:54:17,427 --> 00:54:19,553
Your job is to gather information...

589
00:54:20,179 --> 00:54:24,433
which also includes information about the cold cases, right?

590
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:30,799
Well, yeah, if it’s about the case then maybe I can help you.

591
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:34,799
Why are you asking though?

592
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,621
I want  you to dig up an old case.

593
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:43,804
I want to know the names...

594
00:54:44,124 --> 00:54:46,101
of police officers who took care of that case.

595
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:49,896
Which case?

596
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:51,313
About my father.

597
00:54:53,404 --> 00:54:55,656
I’m going to bring justice to my father.

598
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:07,633
You two should try to avoid each other.

599
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:11,016
I don’t care how close you are to Tharn.

600
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,999

I’ll call you later. See you in a few days.

605
00:55:42,276 --> 00:55:42,893
Yes.

606
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:02,173
I tried to ask Narong about what happened in the cellar today.

607
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:07,202
But it seems he wasn’t aware of what was happening.

608
00:56:08,482 --> 00:56:10,276
As if everything got blacked out.

609
00:56:12,459 --> 00:56:18,550
Singh said that the lie detector indicated that Narong was telling the truth.

610
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:22,219
Is there anyone who can explain what it is that we saw?

611
00:56:22,848 --> 00:56:24,790
Damn it! Ouch!

612
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:27,419
Hey.

613
00:56:29,899 --> 00:56:30,745
Let me see.

614
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:36,173
It’s just a graze.

615
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:41,065
Wait here. I’ll fix the wound for you.

617
00:57:07,308 --> 00:57:10,848
why didn’t you say anything now that I come crashing your place again.

618
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:17,682
If I were you, I wouldn’t have wanted my grandma to see myself in this state.

619
00:57:18,276 --> 00:57:19,350
Forget it.

620
00:57:19,922 --> 00:57:20,665
Are you done?

621
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:22,658
Yeah.

622
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:24,299
Thanks.

623
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:25,145
Wait.

Let me check on your wound.

Don’t worry.

632
00:58:39,785 --> 00:58:41,545
The doctor already took care of it.

633

I want to do what you just did to me.

Umm, well...

637
01:00:01,748 --> 01:00:07,716
When I was a kid, my grandma always blew over the wound after fixing it.

638
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:11,179
Can you...can you do it too?

639
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:20,916
What if my saliva happen to be in contact with your wound? It might get infected.

640
01:00:21,848 --> 01:00:22,928
Didn’t they teach you this in school?

641
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:24,288
Geez!

642
01:00:28,738 --> 01:00:31,762
Then let me check on your wound.

643
01:00:32,802 --> 01:00:33,910
No need.

644
01:00:34,562 --> 01:00:36,048
The doctor already took care of it.

645
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:39,453
I’m going to rest now.

646
01:00:40,185 --> 01:00:41,488
I’m not feeling well.

647
01:00:42,573 --> 01:00:44,025
The medicine is starting to kick in.

648
01:00:46,162 --> 01:00:47,110
Okay.

649
01:00:54,265 --> 01:00:55,328
Sleep well.

650
01:00:55,682 --> 01:00:56,425
Okay.

651
01:01:07,076 --> 01:01:10,733
Go rest. I’ll keep watch for you tonight.

653
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,836
Huh? Who’s visiting this late?

654
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:20,025
It’s probably Yai.

655
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:23,659
I asked him to fetch me some of my clothes from my place.

656
01:01:23,876 --> 01:01:26,390
I probably have to crash your place quite often.

657
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:28,596
Okay.

658

659
01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:41,865
I didn’t know you’d be here.

660
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:46,688
I have to finish off some work with him.

661
01:01:48,893 --> 01:01:51,168
What are you doing here?

662
01:01:52,748 --> 01:01:56,813
I’m here to visit Tharn as usual, just like what I always do.

663
01:02:10,653 --> 01:02:11,968
We have to talk.

664
01:02:31,305 --> 01:02:34,413
I don’t care how close you are to Tharn.

665
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:37,910
But I think you should know your place.

666
01:02:39,758 --> 01:02:43,625
It’d be best for you to play the role of his big brother. Not something else.

667
01:02:44,516 --> 01:02:46,379
Right now, Tharn and I...

668
01:02:46,836 --> 01:02:48,722
and everyone in our team...

669
01:02:49,545 --> 01:02:52,390
have a lot of things that we should keep...

670
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:54,653
confidential.

671
01:02:56,562 --> 01:02:59,362
I don’t want him to see you so often like before.

672
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:02,036
- Why?   /   - You want to know why?

673
01:03:02,276 --> 01:03:08,653
Because Tharn might accidentally slipped out something confidential about the investigation to you, like what he did last time.

674
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:10,950
- So?   /   - So...

675
01:03:13,328 --> 01:03:15,533
it might badly affect the unity in our team.

676
01:03:23,848 --> 01:03:27,808
Your reason seems nothing personal at all.

677
01:03:29,636 --> 01:03:34,425
I’ll try my best to heed your advice.

678
01:03:35,488 --> 01:03:37,510
Until your time is done.

679
01:03:38,939 --> 01:03:40,002

683

Keep it. It will protect you.

01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,939

01:11:20,228 --> 01:11:21,725
Good morning, Luangpor.

722
01:11:22,228 --> 01:11:25,428
I’ve been quite busy with my first case so I didn’t have time to call you.

723
01:11:26,651 --> 01:11:30,708
Oh, you had it rough since the first one?

724
01:11:34,068 --> 01:11:35,451
Yes.

725
01:11:36,123 --> 01:11:40,285
It’s the victim turned attacker.

726
01:11:41,017 --> 01:11:44,845
When your mind is shrouded by hatre or anger,

727
01:11:45,645 --> 01:11:48,548
you will become obsessed with that thing.

728
01:11:48,731 --> 01:11:49,920
Remeber...

729
01:11:50,103 --> 01:11:54,514
Mindfulness can help strengthen your mind.

730
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,948
Being mindful at all time...

731
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,977
will help strengthen your meditation and leads you to the enlightenment...

732
01:12:02,123 --> 01:12:05,017
which would then help you to distinguish between the good and the evil.

733
01:12:05,503 --> 01:12:11,280
But some people will always choose to do something evil.

734
01:12:12,373 --> 01:12:15,680
Like those scumbags who never hesitate to take advantages on other people...

735
01:12:16,303 --> 01:12:22,480
and push them into the darkness filled with despair, humiliation, and vengeance.

736
01:12:23,303 --> 01:12:26,125
Those victims are left with no choice but to fight back in order to survive.

737
01:12:26,823 --> 01:12:27,920
They have to kill.

738
01:12:28,754 --> 01:12:32,963
The basic code of moral conducts for human beings like us...

739
01:12:33,325 --> 01:12:35,085
is the 5 precepts.

740
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:38,685
One should be abstained from killing other living beings.

741
01:12:38,933 --> 01:12:44,891
These precepts can bring peace and happiness to your family and the society.

742
01:12:45,463 --> 01:12:52,331
Undertaking the five precepts will benefit not only yourself but also the people around you.

743
01:12:52,693 --> 01:12:59,303
I used to believe that a person would be good or bad depends on what they did in their past lives.

744
01:12:59,383 --> 01:13:03,234
But that’s not entirely true. Karma isn’t the only thing that shapes us.

745
01:13:03,423 --> 01:13:12,194
Dhamma also helps refine and enlighten our mind to be able to tell the right from wrong.

746
01:13:12,777 --> 01:13:16,043
It cannot cancel your karma.

747
01:13:16,203 --> 01:13:19,497
Just because you did something good,

748
01:13:19,668 --> 01:13:24,563
whether building a pavillion, a chapel, or even a temple, in hope that it would help erase your wrongdoings in the past.

749
01:13:24,663 --> 01:13:27,954
That’s impossible. You cannot undone what you already did.

750
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:32,123
What you did will eventually comes back to you.

751
01:13:32,503 --> 01:13:33,268
That’s right.

752
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:35,440
Karma is the sum of our own actions.

753
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,857
This morning, Tharn did something bad to me.

754
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:40,903
He hurt me.

755
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,543
So, he’ll pay for what he did soon.

756
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:45,257
Do you want another one?

757
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:46,553
(Incoming message)

758
01:13:55,803 --> 01:13:57,325
[Nee: Grandma is sick. Come home ASAP.]

759
01:13:57,323 --> 01:13:58,803
Shit!

760
01:14:06,217 --> 01:14:07,097
Hey,

761
01:14:07,325 --> 01:14:07,657
Yeah?

762
01:14:07,653 --> 01:14:08,640
I’m leaving.

763
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:10,937
Goodbye, Luangpor.

764
01:14:17,074 --> 01:14:18,297
What’s wrong with him?

765
01:14:22,297 --> 01:14:28,563
Tharn, do you still receive a treatment from that doctor?

766
01:14:29,263 --> 01:14:32,240
Not anymore.

767
01:14:33,405 --> 01:14:35,063
But he still checks on me regularly.

768
01:14:36,697 --> 01:14:42,297
But I don’t know why Phaya seems to hate him.

769
01:14:43,371 --> 01:14:48,057
Those two should avoid each other if possible.

770
01:14:50,183 --> 01:14:52,343
As if Phaya would listen to me.

771
01:14:52,777 --> 01:14:54,777
He follows me everywhere like a dog’s flea.

772
01:15:37,683 --> 01:15:39,714
Nee, where’s Grandma?

773
01:15:39,713 --> 01:15:41,120
She’s upstairs.

774
01:15:41,405 --> 01:15:43,291
Grandma!

775
01:15:43,803 --> 01:15:46,423
Are you sick? Why didn’t go to the hospital?

776
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,365
Who’s sick?

777
01:15:50,971 --> 01:15:52,503
I thought you said you’d come back in 2-3 days.

778
01:15:55,543 --> 01:16:01,234
Nee texted me and said that you’re sick.

779
01:16:07,634 --> 01:16:08,411
Come here.

780
01:16:08,434 --> 01:16:10,403
- What is it?
- Just come.

781
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:17,131
Grandma could hardly eat or sleep. She’s always grumpy too.

782
01:16:17,513 --> 01:16:20,697
So, I thought she might be a little sick.

783
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:22,948
Because she misses you.

784
01:16:24,365 --> 01:16:25,737
You tricked me again.

785
01:16:26,571 --> 01:16:27,760
I’m serious.

786
01:16:28,011 --> 01:16:30,683
Since the day you left for a training at the camp,

787
01:16:31,165 --> 01:16:34,765
she really thought you might stay home more often after the training was done.

788
01:16:35,043 --> 01:16:38,091
Turns out you hardly came home.

789
01:16:38,423 --> 01:16:40,331
So, she’s upset.

790
01:16:41,673 --> 01:16:43,554
Go on your knees and beg for her forgiveness.

791
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:46,503
Hey, wait.

792
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,908
Well, Grandma...

793
01:17:03,394 --> 01:17:07,097
I finished my work earlier than expected so I came straight home see you.

794
01:17:07,093 --> 01:17:10,571
I thought you were not feeling well. I was really worried.

795
01:17:10,685 --> 01:17:12,480
Don’t try to sweet talk me.

796
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,805
Grandma...

797
01:17:16,754 --> 01:17:18,137
Please don’t be mad at me.

798
01:17:18,423 --> 01:17:19,828
I’m really sorry.

799
01:17:20,274 --> 01:17:21,531
Please forgive me, okay?

800
01:17:21,714 --> 01:17:22,720
You’re really something.

801
01:17:22,713 --> 01:17:23,417
Ouch.

802
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,748
What’s wrong?

803
01:17:26,034 --> 01:17:27,611
What happened to your hand?

804
01:17:27,828 --> 01:17:29,520
It’s nothing, Grandma.

805
01:17:29,513 --> 01:17:33,143
Take off your shirt right now. I want to see why you are hurt when I touch you there.

806
01:17:33,143 --> 01:17:34,343
Take it off.

807
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,560
Careful. Slowly.

808
01:17:36,868 --> 01:17:38,228
Let me see.

809
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:39,988
Oh my goodness.

810
01:17:40,194 --> 01:17:44,388
I never knew your job is this dangerous.

811
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,983
Oh dear. Nee!

812
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,251
Come and look at your brother.

813
01:17:48,243 --> 01:17:51,063
- I’m coming.
- Why didn’t anyone tell me about this?

814
01:17:51,303 --> 01:17:55,794
He told me to keep quiet because he was afraid that you might be worried.

815
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:02,228
It’s just a graze, Grandma.

816
01:18:02,223 --> 01:18:04,354
It’s really nothing. I’m feeling great.

817
01:18:04,353 --> 01:18:06,285
Please don’t worry too much. I’m really fine.

818
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:07,623
Phaya!

819
01:18:07,897 --> 01:18:08,971
Don’t say that.

820
01:18:11,413 --> 01:18:13,988
If you think I overreacted...

821
01:18:14,183 --> 01:18:16,983
and don’t want me to mess with your life,

822
01:18:18,663 --> 01:18:20,308
then I’ll leave you alone.

823
01:18:21,565 --> 01:18:22,537
Grandma.

824
01:18:22,857 --> 01:18:24,468
Please wait, Grandma!

825
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:27,623
Geez.

826
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:30,823
You’re such a lousy guy.

827
01:18:32,163 --> 01:18:34,788
Now, she’s even more upset. Why did you say that?

828
01:18:34,953 --> 01:18:36,000
I’m so doomed.

829
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:37,691
What to do now?

830
01:18:38,033 --> 01:18:43,897
Stay home tonight, have dinner with her and talk to her.

831
01:18:44,365 --> 01:18:46,571
Wait for the right timing and try to beg for her forgiveness again.

832
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,965
But right now, you better go take a shower first.

833
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:53,771
You stink. I can hardly smell my dessert.

834
01:18:54,011 --> 01:18:55,520
Now, you’re overreacting.

835
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:56,045
Geez.

836
01:18:56,043 --> 01:18:57,623
Grandma.

837
01:18:57,623 --> 01:19:03,363
(Lovely Sound)

838
01:21:00,233 --> 01:21:02,365
We finally meet once again.

839
01:21:11,474 --> 01:21:12,403
Who are you?

840
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,748
Why are you in my dream?

841
01:21:16,765 --> 01:21:18,285
Don’t you remember me?

842
01:21:20,163 --> 01:21:22,480
Use your heart instead of your eyes.

843
01:21:23,737 --> 01:21:25,988
And you’ll finally see.

844
01:22:23,403 --> 01:22:26,403
idol Factory

845
01:22:26,403 --> 01:22:27,885
Nee.

846
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:31,920
Is Wi still teaching at the Faculty of Archaeology?

847
01:22:32,303 --> 01:22:35,588
She already quit to open an art gallery.

848
01:22:36,623 --> 01:22:38,903
Phaya!

849
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:41,063
Try looking in that room.

850
01:22:41,203 --> 01:22:45,577
It might have something that you want to know.

851
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:18,593
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

852
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:26,043
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

853
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:34,457
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

854
01:23:34,453 --> 01:23:44,868
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

855
01:23:44,863 --> 01:23:52,297
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

856
01:23:52,297 --> 01:23:56,783
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

857
01:23:56,788 --> 01:23:59,883
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

858
01:23:59,883 --> 01:24:07,123
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

859
01:24:07,353 --> 01:24:11,543
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

860
01:24:11,543 --> 01:24:19,123
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
