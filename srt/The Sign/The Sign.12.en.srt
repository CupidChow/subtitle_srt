1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,377
What has he done to you? Why do you hate him so much?

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,805
Because he’s the Naga!

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,211
Let go of me.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,022
No, I’ll never leave you here.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,994
What are you doing?! No. No! Phaya!

6
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:16,742
No. No!

7
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:18,445
Phaya!

8
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:22,205
Everyone that I love are taken away from me, all because of you.

9
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:23,862
It’s time for you to choose.

10
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:26,342
This is not just about Phaya, the man you love.

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,982
It’s about everyone that you love.

12
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:33,291
You know the whereabout of Montree and his every move...

13
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:35,565
because Chart is your spy?

14
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,285
That’s right.

15
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:38,742
I have recruited him to work secretly...

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,548
after he didn’t pass the training at the camp.

17
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:44,937
Disguising himself as one of Montree’s people, I sent him to find more evidence on the drug network.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,228
and also evidence on Tharn’s father’s murder as well as my brother’s and Lieut Tam’s cases.

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,068
That day we secretly went to investigate on the spider tattoo,

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,645
Chart was also there. Was it your order?

21
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:58,060
If we had arrested Khom that day, everything would just end there.

22
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:01,200
We’d never able to get to Montree.

23
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,028
Why didn’t you tell us anything, especially Tharn?

24
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,325
- If Tharn had known about this...
- Because I don’t trust anyone.

25
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,045
I can’t trust anyone even you.

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,302
Lieut Tam died because someone in our unit tipped that information off.

27
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:18,811
Inspector.

28
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:21,702
Singh has tracked down Chart’s last location.

29
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:24,982
But it’s not clear.

30
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:27,725
We only know it’s close to our target area.

31
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:30,777
What about Phaya and Tharn, can you track them down?

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,228
Yes, they’re on the west side.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,754
Only 5 kilometres away from Chart’s location.

34
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:39,805
Let’s split up into 2 teams.

35
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,691
Yai, go look for Phaya and Tharn with the forest rangers.

36
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:46,845
The rest of you come with me. We’ll go arrest Montree.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,611
Yes, sir.

38
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:49,257
Can you show me the map?

39
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,622
- Come here.
- What is it?

40
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:53,017
Just come.

41
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:56,034
What is it?

42
00:01:57,988 --> 00:01:58,720
Here.

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,394
Keep it for me first. Once everything is done, I’ll come back and put it on your ring finger.

44
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:09,074
Don’t be so full of yourself.

45
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:12,011
I’ve never said I would let you do that.

46
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,617
This mission is really dangerous. Please be careful.

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,102
Yeah, you too.

48
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,314
(Incoming call)

49
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:23,668
Hello, babe.

50
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:26,240
I’m with Tharn’s grandma right now.

51
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:27,760
Have you found him?

52
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,765
Not yet. We’d get going now.

53
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,417
Okay, please find them.

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,897
Yeah. By the way, can you make me a spicy fish paste when I go back?

55
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:39,314
I want to eat it.

56
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:42,000
Of course, I’ll make it for you.

57
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:46,491
Please come back soon. And promise me you’ll come back safely too.

58
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:49,314
Or else, I’ll throw it away. Got it?

59
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,091
Okay.

60
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,085
Please be careful.

61
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:09,108
He still hasn’t found them.

62
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:29,005
Please, let both of them come back safely.

63
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:37,988
I pray to all the holy spirits, please protect everyone and make them come back safely.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,971
Please protect Phaya and Tharn too.

65
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:58,160
Dad, Mum. Please help protect Phaya and bring him back saftely.

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,788
I promise I will be good to him.

67
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:07,028
And will listen to everything he says.

68
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:35,794
Got it.

69
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:37,680
Gather up, everyone!

70
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:41,120
Let’s go, Yai.

71
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,011
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:44,674
Yai, please find Phaya and Tharn.

73
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:47,234
Yeah, you guys be careful too.

74
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,000
I promise I’ll catch up to help arrest Montree.

75
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:52,651
Let’s go.

76
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,697

Okay.

96
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:02,411
- Tharn, I’ll go look that way.
- Okay.

97
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:33,805
Are you going to tell me now, whom you were just talking to on the phone?

98
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:41,085
Sir, the cops are coming.

99
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:45,417
Tell our men to clear the warehouse.

100
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,005
Hey, look! The light.

101
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,314
Come.

102
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,051
Come.

103
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,051
This is where I heard the shooting yesterday.

104
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:41,050
This way.

105
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,691
Wait a second.

106
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:03,310
Let’s hurry up. I think the persons I’m looking for are probably around here.

107
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,085
Careful.

108
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:22,582
Help!

109
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:23,874
Help!

110
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,040
Can anyone hear us?!

111
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,091
Help!

112
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,594
Help! Anybody, help!

113
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,017
Help!

114
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,897
Can you hear us?! Help!

115
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:40,628
Help!

116
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,514
Anybody, help!

117
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:45,554
Help!

118
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,131
Tharn! Phaya!

119
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:50,434
Yai!

120
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:59,565
Sit down first. I thought I’d never see both of you again.

121
00:10:00,194 --> 00:10:02,411
Why do you guys always get yourselves into danger like this?

122
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,034
We are so worried about you.

123
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,485
How did you find us?

124
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,480
Inspector and our team...

125
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:09,954
are going to raid Montree’s drugs warehouse around here.

126
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:13,108
Montree’s drugs warehouse?

127
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,994
How did Inspector find out?

128
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,291
Chart is his spy. He’s secretly working for Inspector.

129
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:19,165
He was the one who told Inspector...

130
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:20,502
about you two after Khom tried to kill you.

131
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:22,605
Chart is Inspector’s spy.

132
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:48,628
(Gunshot)

133
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,177
Khem, let’s go.

134
00:10:51,170 --> 00:11:00,662
(Gunshot)

135
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:04,182
Already started?

136
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:06,068
You two go back first.

137
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,020
I have to go help our team and Inspector.

138
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:08,290
Wait, take us with you.

139
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,308
Look at yourself, how can you help us?

140
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:12,617
I’m okay. I can do it.

141
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:14,200
Let us help, Yai.

142
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,508
I’m not going to miss this chance to arrest Montree.

143
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,148
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

144
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:31,074

145
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:49,154
(Gunshot)

146
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:52,080
Cover him.

147
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:54,285
Go back!

148
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:02,011
Go back! Back!

149
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,885
Go after them!

150
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,085
Yes, sir.

151
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:20,148
Burn them all! Get him up, he’s coming with us.

152
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,891
Hey!

153
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:23,325
Let’s go.

154
00:12:25,188 --> 00:12:25,965
Let’s go.

155
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:31,920
Walk!

156
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:34,445

158
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:42,171
Go! Go! Go!

159
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,628
Dammit! Why can’t they just leave me alone?!

160
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:03,245
Drop your weapons and turn yourself in!

161
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,497

165
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,988
Let’s go back!

166
00:13:15,497 --> 00:13:17,657
Inspector, they went back inside.

167
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,777
Follow them.

168
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,794
(Explosion)

169
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:26,697
- Anybody hurt?
- No, sir.

170
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:28,445
Wait for my signal.

171
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:30,925
Go!

172
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,542

Go!

Go! Go!

176
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,742
3 o’clock. Set 2.

177

Phaya! Tharn! Let’s go!

00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:09,245
Take cover, Yai!

182
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:15,554
Go!

183
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:41,188
Stop!

184
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,754
Slow them down. I’ll get on the boat.

185
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,350
Make sure you get there in time.

186
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,131
Yes, sir.

187
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:57,010

188
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:19,108
Can’t you guys just leave me alone?!

189
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,885
I shouldn’t have spared your life.

190
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:25,840
I should have killed you both just like your father and your brother!

191
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:32,057
Please cover me.

192
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:40,457
(Gunshot)

193
00:15:43,554 --> 00:15:44,251
Khem!

194
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:58,411
Khem!

195
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,137

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,180
Khem!

200
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,834
Stop! Let him go!

201
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
You don’t want him to die, do you? Put your gun down!

202
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,330
I said, put it down!

203
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:24,900

Yai, go!

207
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:03,531
Go get him, Tharn!

208
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:10,617
Stop!

209
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:33,040
Do you want to be with your parents so much?

210
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:36,868
I’m going to send you to live with them soon.

211
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:41,200
Say hello to them for me too. Tell them I miss them.

212
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:52,217
What the f***?!

213
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,022
No! No!

214
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:48,331
I don’t want him to die that easily.

215
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:51,580
I want him to pay for what he did.

216
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:10,948
Tharn.

217
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:52,011

Inspector, we found various kinds of drugs in the warehouse
including amphetamine, Ice, and Heroin.

221
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:20,719
It’s also a hub for processing drugs for concealment to avoid detection during the smuggling.

222
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,079
How are Chart and Khem?

223
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,102
Both of them are safe now.

224
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:29,519
Tharn.

225
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:36,011
What happened to Khom and Montree at that abandoned factory?

226
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:41,336
They both already paid for they did to my dad,

227
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,605
your brother, and the others.

228
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:47,348
Yeah.

229
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,999
I have a voice clip in which you’re dealing on your drugs business with Kao.

230
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,816
Just confess.

231
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,016
You won’t get away this time.

232
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:12,753
Then why do you still want to frame me?

233
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:16,033
If you have any evidence, just show it to me. Where is it?

234
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:18,331
I don’t want to frame you.

235
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:19,691
I want you to confess.

236
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,091
And you won’t be going to jail alone.

237
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,091
I’m going to get that person behind you too.

238
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:27,039
So, you better tell me how that person is.

239
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:29,851
(Laughing)

240
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,708
That person behind me?

241
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:38,342
Why would you want to know?

242
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:41,176
There is no one behind me!

243
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:44,399
Let me tell you this, Inspector.

244
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:48,308
It’s actually one of your kind who often comes wagging their tails...

245
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,045
and begging me to help them.

246
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:55,496
I’m telling you justice, honesty justification they don’t really exist in this world.

247
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,565
Even though you could arrest someone like me,

248
00:21:57,561 --> 00:22:00,799
there’ll always be someone worse than me being born somewhere in this world.

249
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,988
Do you know why?

250
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,571
Because there are some people who are worse than people like me.

251
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:06,479
Some people like you lot...

252
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:10,708
who always help facilitate those with money and power like me, Inspector.

253
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:12,936
So, if you have any evidence, just lay it in front of me.

254
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,262
I’m not afraid of you.

255
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:15,748
Fine.

256
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:19,691
Then you can look forward to go rotting in jail.

257
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:22,742
And let me tell you something.

258
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,245
Justice, honesty, and justification

259
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:27,496
they do exist.

260
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,491
It’s up to the people who use them.

261
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:30,639
Um

262
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:32,205
Just wait and see.

263
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:37,816
I’m going to crush these filthy network and put people like you behind bars.

264
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:42,696
Then do it. Prove it.

265
00:22:46,285 --> 00:22:50,993
You might feel so sure that your power and money can help you to escape the hands of law this time.

266
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:53,828
But trust me.

267
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,039
You can never escape karma.

268
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:26,136
Inspector.

269
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:28,639
Should I take him back to Bangkok?

270
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:31,885
Did he confess?

271
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:35,391
People like him won’t confess so easily.

272
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:38,365
He must think that the person behind him...

273
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,696
will be able to help him get away with this.

274
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,856
If we can Montree to confess,

275
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:45,382
Those behind him will surely be in trouble.

276
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:03,873
There is a recent report from IDF special investigation unit today...

277
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:11,188
regarding the big raid and arrest at Montree’s drugs warehouse.

278
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:15,119
Montree will be sentenced to prison for life.

279
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:18,471
He is involved in many criminal cases including an international drug traffiking.

280
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,245
A recent report also confirms that...

281
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:25,176
several high-ranking police officers...

282
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:29,085
as well as politicians are also involved in this case.

283
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:35,256
IDF special investigation unit will reopen the murder cases of many ex-police officers...

284
00:24:35,251 --> 00:24:40,353
in order to bring back justice for every one of them whose deaths are still shrouded in mystery.

285
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:42,251
Phaya.

286
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:43,268

289
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:53,901
I’m safe and sound.

290
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,411
- Miss you so much.
- Yai.

291
00:24:58,445 --> 00:25:00,491
Finally, you’ve made it.

292
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:05,302
- I was so worried. Are you hurt?
- No.

293
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,231
You're as beautiful as you always were.

294
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,181

Ouch.

295
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:11,473

- Ouch.

296
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:13,908
- Are there cuts or wounds anywhere?
- No.

297
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:17,633
I thought I’d never see you again.

298
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:22,548

299
00:25:27,668 --> 00:25:29,588

300
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,073
Can I have you instead?

301
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:38,639
(Slapping on the shoulder)

302
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,496
Don’t do this again, Tharn.

303
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:52,593
You’re the only family I have left.

304
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:55,062
Without you, I won’t be able to live.

305
00:25:57,496 --> 00:25:59,039
I’m so sorry, Grandma.

306
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:03,908
But I can finally put the one who killed my parents behind bars.

307
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:08,033
You’re not the mother of a bad cop.

308
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:16,525
You are a mother of a good cop an honest and law-abiding one.

309
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:20,388
That’s good, dear.

310
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:23,839
Your father must be so proud...

311
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:30,056
that his son is also a good cop like him.

312

313
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:46,319
Now that you’ve caught the killer, your parents must be so happy.

314
00:27:52,822 --> 00:27:53,805
Phaya.

315
00:27:57,405 --> 00:27:59,199
Thank you so much.

316
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:01,599
For staying by my side.

317
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,108
We’ve been through a lot together.

318
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,788
Thank you so much.

319
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:49,999
It must be destiny.

320
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,788
Just like what you’ve always wondered...

321
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,685
how I’m always there to protect you.

322
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:15,313
Me too.

323
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:33,359

327

No matter what might happen tomorrow,

328
00:32:47,496 --> 00:32:49,188
you must never give up.

329
00:32:53,702 --> 00:32:54,833
You have to fight for us.

330
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:00,491
And we will get through it together.

331

00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:09,070
will help turning a disaster into a blessing.

363
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:20,076
(Exciting sound)

364
00:40:54,464 --> 00:41:07,496

365
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:09,496

367
00:41:22,496 --> 00:41:38,293
(Praying)

368
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:13,413
Tharn!

369
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:14,773
Tharn!

370
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:16,041
Tharn!

371
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,207
Tharn!

372
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,287
Tharn!

373
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:20,864
Tharn! Where are you?!

374
00:42:21,424 --> 00:42:22,544
Tharn!

375
00:42:22,864 --> 00:42:24,544
Tharn!

376
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:26,453
Have you already taken him away?

377
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:27,716
Tharn!

378
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,046
- What’s going on?
- Grandma

379
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:31,390
What’s going on?

380
00:42:31,527 --> 00:42:32,818
He has taken Tharn away!

381
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:39,744
Tharn!

382
00:42:41,527 --> 00:42:42,476
Tharn!

383
00:42:44,304 --> 00:42:45,287
Tharn!

384
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,258
- Grandma!
- Tharn!

385
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:51,641
Tharn!

386
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:53,744
- Tharn!
- Grandma!

387
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:55,687
Where are you going?

388
00:42:56,818 --> 00:42:57,630
Let me go!

389
00:42:59,486 --> 00:43:01,093
I am going to find Tharn.

390
00:43:02,944 --> 00:43:04,338
- Tharn
- Where are you going to find him?

391
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:05,390
- Phaya
- Grandma!

392
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:06,526
Grandma!

393
00:43:06,556 --> 00:43:07,378
- Hey!
- Tharn!

394
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:10,087
Tharn!

395
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:13,173
- Tharn!      /     - Phaya!

396
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:16,407
What happened?

397
00:43:16,716 --> 00:43:17,847
Tell me, what happened?

398
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:24,896
- Abbot!
- Phaya.

399
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:25,813
Luangpor!

400
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,224
Luangpor!

401
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:29,596
Tharn is gone!

402
00:43:29,596 --> 00:43:30,567
Luangpor!

403
00:43:37,138 --> 00:43:41,136
(Crying)

404
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,687
Tharn! Tharn!

405
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:49,196
Hey! Phaya!

406
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:01,813
Tharn!

407
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:02,898
Tharn!

408
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:04,704
Tharn!

409
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:06,464
Tharn! Where are you?!

410
00:44:06,864 --> 00:44:07,801
Tharn!

411
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:10,446
Tharn!

412
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:12,007
Tharn!

413
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,156
Hey!

414
00:44:21,296 --> 00:44:23,493
(Jumping into the river)

415
00:44:41,653 --> 00:44:42,636
Tharn!

416
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,493
Tharn! Where are you?!

417
00:44:45,904 --> 00:44:46,944
Tharn!

418
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,133
Tharn!

419
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,893
Phaya…why did you follow me?

420
00:44:57,858 --> 00:44:58,876
I already told you.

421
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,016
I’m not going to let you go.

422
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:04,418
I decided to spare your life.

423
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,664
But you just chose to leave it here.

424
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:09,447
If you really love Tharn,

425
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:12,670
you should stop hurting him.

426
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,207
I’m not hurting him,

427
00:45:16,178 --> 00:45:18,658
I just want to take him back to where he belongs.

428
00:45:19,013 --> 00:45:22,030
To be with someone who can protect him, and love him.

429
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:24,898
When you said you love him,

430
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:28,453
the only person you love is actually yourself.

431
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:30,658
You did all this for yourself.

432
00:45:30,956 --> 00:45:33,076
You’ve never loved him.

433
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:33,984
No!

434
00:45:34,716 --> 00:45:36,933
I love him. I never forgot about him.

435
00:45:37,866 --> 00:45:40,556
Unlike you who couldn’t remember anything.

436
00:45:41,024 --> 00:45:44,807
Without Wanwisa, you wouldn’t have known the truth you wouldn’t have remembered him.

437
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:47,173
Tharn.

438
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:50,281
Even if Wanwisa hadn’t told me the truth.

439
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:55,047
Even if I hadn’t known anything about our past, about who you are.

440
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:58,270
Even if I hadn't known how much we used to love each other.

441
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,338
Nothing would change.

442
00:46:01,664 --> 00:46:02,898
I still love you.

443
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:05,207
Just the way you are.

444
00:46:06,338 --> 00:46:08,156
I’m not going to let you go.

445
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:10,544
I’m not going to make that mistake again.

446
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:13,973
Tharn.

447
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,458
Come back with me.

448
00:46:15,466 --> 00:46:16,521
Hey!

449
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,944
(Pushing / Falling)

450
00:46:22,018 --> 00:46:23,744
Doc, please let him go.

451
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:26,144
Leave me alone!

452
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:29,344
Tharn!

453
00:46:30,327 --> 00:46:33,538

454
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:34,864

Ouch!

462

463
00:47:20,956 --> 00:47:24,121
Without you, everything would have been over by now!

(Fighting)

465
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:31,401
No!

466
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:25,126
Help!

467
00:49:28,656 --> 00:49:33,218
- Hey!    /    - No

468
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:43,046
Tharn!

469
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,336
Tharn!

470
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:50,316
About Tharn, I’ve asked every officer and authority involved to help serach for him day and night.

471
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:54,224
I truly hope we’ll hear something from them soon.

Tharn!

478
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:29,297
Tharn!

479
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:31,445
Tharn.

480
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:32,588
Tharn.

481

Tharn.

483
00:50:36,977 --> 00:50:37,777
Tharn.

484
00:50:38,725 --> 00:50:40,508
He has always sacrificed himself for you.

485
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:43,285
But all you do is trying to keep him where he doesn’t belong.

486
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:46,142
You are selfish.

487
00:50:46,954 --> 00:50:48,759
No, Tharn.

488
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,262
Stay with me, Tharn.

489
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,308
You have to come with me.

490
00:50:54,154 --> 00:50:54,908
Tharn.

491
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:58,885
Please stop killing each other.

492
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:02,919
I’m begging you both for one last time.

493
00:51:04,942 --> 00:51:05,662

Tharn.

497
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:13,754
- Tharn.     /    - Tharn.

498
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:14,988
Tharn.

499
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,434
He must go back to the Naga cave.

500
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:20,782
It’s the only way to save him.

501
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:24,725
Stop being selfish and let him go.

502
00:51:25,342 --> 00:51:26,931
No. No.

503
00:51:27,342 --> 00:51:28,085

Phaya, you’re back, dear.

516
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:57,365
Phaya.

517
00:51:58,474 --> 00:51:59,834
Why am I here?

518
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:01,937
You were drowned.

519
00:52:02,542 --> 00:52:04,691
You were unconcious for 4 days.

520
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:07,457
I thought I had lost you forever.

521
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:11,948
I went looking for Tharn.

522
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:14,497
Have you found him?

523
00:52:15,022 --> 00:52:16,428
Has anyone found him, Grandma?

524
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:26,885
Tharn, he...he disappeared.

525
00:52:26,965 --> 00:52:29,445
He’s disappeared since the day he was taken away.

526
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:33,137
No one has found his body yet.

527
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:43,845
Where are you going?

528
00:52:44,051 --> 00:52:46,237
- I’ll go looking for Tharn.
- Phaya!

529
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:48,451
I’ll find him. I know where he is.

530
00:52:48,474 --> 00:52:50,714
Chalothorn has him. I have to go help Tharn.

531
00:52:50,707 --> 00:52:52,485
Where is it then?

532
00:52:52,477 --> 00:52:54,394
In Makhong river. Let me go.

533
00:52:54,387 --> 00:52:56,005

Phaya.

534
00:52:55,997 --> 00:52:57,319

Let me go!

Get yourself together!

539
00:53:03,422 --> 00:53:05,194
Tharn is gone!

540
00:53:06,279 --> 00:53:08,057
He’s not with us anymore.

541
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:09,845
Don’t you get it?

- Grandma
- Please try to get over it.

547
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:23,422

551
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:31,925
Tharn.

552
00:53:37,285 --> 00:53:38,359
Tharn.

553
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:48,611
(Crying)

554
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:51,731
(Crying)

555
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:07,674
[ Dao: Nee, how’s the situation there? ]

556
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:10,074
Phaya has already come to.

557
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:11,742
But...

558
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:14,599
Tharn has disappeared.

559
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:17,331
Everyone here is so worried.

560
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:21,822
[ Dao: Is Grandma okay? ]

561
00:54:22,588 --> 00:54:24,782
Well, sort of.

562
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:30,382
How are you? Is everything okay there in France?

563
00:54:33,514 --> 00:54:36,565
[ Dao: Things are almost already in place once I’ve arrived. ]

564
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:41,057
[ Dao: Please send my best regards to Grandma and Phaya too. ]

565
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,394
Okay.

566
00:54:43,399 --> 00:54:44,931
- Nee.     /      - Yes?

567
00:54:46,565 --> 00:54:48,497
[ Dao: Please stay strong. ]

568
00:54:51,319 --> 00:54:56,428
[ Dao: You have to take care of both Phaya and Grandma right now. ]

569
00:54:58,977 --> 00:55:00,325
[ Dao: I’m worried about you. ]

570
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:02,097
Okay.

571
00:55:02,588 --> 00:55:03,959
[ Dao: I’ll call you again later. ]

572
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:06,314
Okay.

573
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:15,262
Paranee.

574
00:55:20,691 --> 00:55:21,937
Phaya has already come to.

575
00:55:41,628 --> 00:55:42,428
Here, take it.

576
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,759
Why?

577
00:55:47,879 --> 00:55:49,091
Just take it.

578
00:55:50,377 --> 00:56:04,157
🎵Making me know that what we have has made you walked away🎵
It will help protect you.
Until next time, we’ll meet again.

579
00:56:05,427 --> 00:56:15,502
🎵I never want it to be like this. I also have a heart🎵
Do you remember the first time we met at the camp? You know what?

580
00:56:15,525 --> 00:56:19,457
🎵A heart that’s only for you🎵
I really want to hug you right now.

581
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:33,717
🎵I don’t want it to be like that. So, what should I do?🎵

582
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:43,057
🎵Or should I disappear?🎵
You don’t want me to stay away from water. Then can I stay close to you instead?

583
00:56:43,057 --> 00:56:50,565
🎵No more that person who always has to watch you walk away🎵

584
00:56:50,557 --> 00:56:59,399
🎵Or am I the one who should leave? No more tears from now on🎵
Do you believe in past lives and reincarnation?

585
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:05,971
🎵No more those time we could spend together🎵
I do.

586
00:57:05,977 --> 00:57:15,457
🎵You and me, it’s over now🎵
Then I’ll do anything so that I could stay by your side.

587
00:57:17,327 --> 00:57:18,348
I’m not going anywhere.

588
00:57:19,491 --> 00:57:20,828
I’ll stay close to you.

589
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:36,188
🎵It’s over now, isn’t it🎵
I’ll do everything so that you won’t feel sorry or lose me. I promise.

590
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:55,517
🎵I don’t want it to be like that. So, what should I do?🎵

591
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:15,274
Has anyone found him yet?

592
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:27,171
Maybe, you should take leave for a while.

593
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:32,954
Once you’re ready, you can get back to work.

594
00:58:34,588 --> 00:58:35,868
About Tharn.

595
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:43,628
I’ve asked every officer and authority involved to help search for him day and night.

596
00:58:45,845 --> 00:58:50,337
I truly hope we’ll hear something from them soon.

597
01:03:06,919 --> 01:03:08,908
Baby and I took a week off from work.

598
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,931
We’ll help you look for Tharn.

599
01:03:11,182 --> 01:03:13,277
Wherever you’re going,

600
01:03:13,285 --> 01:03:14,977
we’ll go with you.

601
01:03:19,685 --> 01:03:25,285
Phaya, do you know that today is the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon?

602
01:03:25,731 --> 01:03:27,479
The elders here believe that on this day...

603
01:03:27,662 --> 01:03:29,502
the Nagas will disguise themselves as human.

604
01:03:29,868 --> 01:03:33,914
Maybe, they might come to help looking for Tharn.

605
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:37,548
Yeah, so when the first fire ball appears,

606
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,822
we’d wish for you to finally find Tharn.

607
01:03:43,148 --> 01:03:46,485
Are you going to spend the rest of your life like this...

608
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:50,428
if you can’t find him in this life?

609
01:03:54,394 --> 01:03:55,228
Phaya

610
01:03:56,782 --> 01:03:59,788
There are still lots of work at the unit waiting for you to take care of.

611
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:05,114
And I don’t think Tharn would want to see you in this state.

612
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:16,907
I’m sorry, sir.

613
01:04:43,388 --> 01:04:49,157
(Music)

614
01:05:11,697 --> 01:05:12,691
Phaya.

615
01:05:27,297 --> 01:05:28,131
Tharn.

616
01:05:28,954 --> 01:05:32,428
(Music)

617
01:05:32,451 --> 01:05:33,308
Tharn.

618
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:37,797
(Music)

619
01:06:17,967 --> 01:06:19,331
You are back.

620
01:06:20,725 --> 01:06:21,637
(Crying)

621
01:06:22,725 --> 01:06:23,868
It’s really you.

622
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:25,331
You came back to me.

623
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,971
Yes, it’s me.

624
01:06:28,999 --> 01:06:29,994
(Crying)

625
01:06:32,497 --> 01:06:34,771
Since that day,

626
01:06:35,777 --> 01:06:37,971
Chalothorn took me back...

627
01:06:38,817 --> 01:06:40,748
and tried to save my life.

628
01:06:41,925 --> 01:06:45,422
He gave me his Naga soul so that I’d live.

629
01:06:59,342 --> 01:07:01,171
Then why didn’t you come back earlier?

630
01:07:02,877 --> 01:07:06,679
Do you know how much I really miss you?

631
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:10,077
I do.

632
01:07:12,137 --> 01:07:17,045
But I feel bad for Chalothorn. I wanted to look after him.

633
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:19,719
And wanted him to truly let me go.

634
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:24,097
I did everything I could…

635
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,468
to make him understand about us.

636
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:30,097
So that he would stop making us apart.

637
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:34,817
And...did he get it now?

638
01:07:35,057 --> 01:07:36,954
He’s not going to take you away from me again, is he?

639
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:41,308
Yes.

640
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:48,542
He’s the one who sends me here today.

641
01:07:49,834 --> 01:07:51,502
He wants me to be with you.

642
01:07:59,925 --> 01:08:01,102
Please don’t worry.

643
01:08:02,462 --> 01:08:03,914
I will take care of him.

644
01:08:06,268 --> 01:08:07,971
And will always love him.

645
01:08:27,597 --> 01:08:31,347
You’re not going to leave me again, are you?

646
01:08:33,285 --> 01:08:34,154
Do you know…

647
01:08:35,971 --> 01:08:37,879
that during the time you were gone,

648
01:08:40,565 --> 01:08:42,257
how badly I wanted to see you?

649
01:08:43,277 --> 01:08:45,537
- I miss you so much.
- Say no more, Phaya.
