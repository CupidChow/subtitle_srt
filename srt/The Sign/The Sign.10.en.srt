Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases are related to your parents’ case?

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,120
I only believe in evidence.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,085
If you want me to believe in what you said...

4
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:22,120
go find me the evidence.

5
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:25,840
Chart!

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:26,914
Dammit!

7
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:31,462
Do you realise that your reckless actions will get us all into trouble?!

8
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:34,674
I will take responsibility alone for what happened last night.

9
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:38,540
If you guys really want to help me, then find out who the real culprit is.

10
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:41,805
Phaya.

The Sign

28
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:17,634
Are you saying that the answer you’ve been looking for about your dream...

29
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:22,365
has something to do with our past lives?

30
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:26,560
That you are the Garuda and I’m the Naga...

31
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:32,137
I’m that woman who often appears in your dream?

32
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:35,657
Yeah.

33
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:44,491
Wansarut, you and I have been in love since our past lives.

34
00:02:46,754 --> 00:02:48,822
But the war between our kinds...

35
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:54,628
brought us to death as if we had been cursed.

36
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:00,754
The shadow that has been trying to attack me all this time...

37
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:05,748
is another Naga.

38
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:10,880
He tries to separate you from me so that we can’t be together.

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,628
So...

40
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:19,760
that Naga shadow also exists in this life.

41
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:22,914
Who is he?

42
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:36,491
Why do you want me to keep it a secret from Tharn? Why can’t I tell him about Chalothorn?

43
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:41,177
If Tharn knows, he will surely do something.

44
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:44,137
He will try to stop Chalothorn.

45
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:46,845
And might try to settle things by himself.

46
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:53,360
The 15th night of the 11th moon is coming soon.

47
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:55,531
You must be careful and don’t let Chalothorn get close to Tharn.

48
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,422
Protect him from whatever that might make him in danger.

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,405
Once the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon has passed,

50
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:08,160
Tharn will then be free from the karma and those whom he has done wrong in the past. Am I right?

51
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:10,274
If possible,

52
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:12,868
- I want Tharn to come stay with me...
- Okay

53
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:16,445
until the Day of Judgement has passed.

54
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:38,308
So, every time when an unexplainable incident occured…

55
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,914
in every case that both of us were working on,

56
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:48,331
whether those incidents at the training camp...

57
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:58,491
or the ones during Narong and Art’s cases. Did all those happen because of that man?

58
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,114
Listen to me, Tharn.

59
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,868
No matter what is going happen.

60
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:20,137
I’ll always be by your side to protect you.

61
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,891
The prophecy that the Abbot used to tell us when we were young…

62
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,365
is about to happen inevitably.

63
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:37,771
You’ll be in danger because of me.

64
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,931
Just like my parents.

65
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:45,165
Hey, he can’t harm me.

66
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,057
I have this amulet with me.

67
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:00,845
Don’t you worry. I’m not going to leave you again.

68
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:08,960
If we can’t avoid what’s going to happen,

69
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:14,091
maybe running away is not the right answer anymore.

70
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:16,285
Yeah.

71
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:27,417
Since I still have to recover...

72
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,428
and you’re suspeneded from work,

73
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:34,788
should we go see the Abbot?

74
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:38,640
I can’t right now.

75
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:43,337
I need to find out the truth.

76
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:46,754
I need to know if Chart is related to the killer who murdered my parents.

77
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,200
Khem is taking care of it right now.

78
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:03,634
I want you to use this time during your suspension...

79
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:06,182
to take some rest for a while.

80
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:14,662
I’ll help you find out about your parent’s case.

81
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,485
Let’s go see the Abbot in Nongkai together, okay?

82
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:27,085
Please?

83
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:31,177
Okay.

84
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:47,337
Oh, there’s one more thing.

85
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:50,491
Yes?

86
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:58,011
If Chalothorn comes to see you or ask you to go anywhere with him,

87
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:00,502
you must tell me right the way.

88
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:06,262
Don’t go anywhere with him alone, okay?

89
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:08,628
Why?

90
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:15,462
I’m jealous. Is that reasonable enough?

91
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:23,394
Don’t go anywhere with him again, okay? I’m begging you.

92
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:25,668
Please, Tharn.

93
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,234
Fine, you don’t have to worry about that though.

94
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:34,502
I’m sure he’s quite fed up to quarrel with you.

95
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,177
He didn’t even call or text me during the past few days.

96
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:49,097
Did he tell you where he’d go?

97
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:54,868
He didn’t tell me anything.

98
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,085
I don’t know what he’s doing either.

99
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:00,845
Is that so?

100
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:01,920
Yeah.

101
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:13,565
Huh? Why is it not charging?

102
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:19,371
Geez, he forgot to plug it in.

103
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:23,485
Now we don’t know if Yai has called about the case.

when you left the hospital last night?

116
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,091
No.

117
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,851
Did you call them this morning?

118
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,954
Shit, I forgot.

119
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:07,908
I didn’t bring my phone with me.

120
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:13,657
Yai, Grandma, and your sister are looking for you right now.

121

Tharn! Tharn! Open the door!

00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,805
Tharn! Tharn!

123
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,325
Phaya has been missing since last night.

124
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:29,222
His grandma and sister are looking for him.

125
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,628
Tharn! Phaya has been missing from the hospital since last night.

126
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,137
I still couldn’t contact him.

127
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,731
Do you know where he is?

128
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:41,188
Do you?

129
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,485
Umm, I’m here, Grandma.

130
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:52,502
I’m really sorry, Grandma. And to you too, Paranee.

131
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,040
Why are you holding hands? Are you dating?

132

You’ve just recovered.

137

Why did you rush out of the hopsital like that? Why did you run away?

Why did you run away?

139

Where did you discuss it, on the bed or sofa?

144

You shouldn’t care about your work more than your care for your life.

145

Didn’t you know you almost got killed from drowning?

146
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:34,633
Grandma and I were so worried about you.

I’m really sorry.

150
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,302
I have to apologize to Grandma and Paranee too...

151
00:13:56,648 --> 00:14:01,868
for not telling you when I found out he had left the hospital last night. I should have called and let you know.

152
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:20,873
Grandma, I’m sorry for making you worried.

153
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,182
I promise I’ll be more careful from now on.

154
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,458
I will always think twice and not act on impulse.

155
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,485
And I will not do anything that’d make you and Nee...

156
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,559
worry about me again.

157
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,450
Please rest assured, Grandma.

158
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:49,742
I’ll help take care of him too.

159
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,805
Hey.

160
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:00,576
Why are you holding hands?

161
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:02,816
Are you guys lovers?

162
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:04,965

163
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,008

164
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,679
Why didn’t anyone tell me that you guys are together?

165
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:14,530
So fake, Yai.

166
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:20,759
Grandma.

167
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,239
I have something important to tell you.

168
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,285
Give me a second.

169
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:39,102
Okay, go ahead.

170
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:43,868

we’re dating.

174
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:00,656
Give me a second.

175
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,828
So, if it weren’t because you ran out of the hospital last night...

176
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:14,828
and then I finally found you here,

177
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,176
you’d have still kept it a secret from me, wouldn’t you?

178
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:22,130
I didn’t mean to keep it a secret from you, Grandma.

179
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,542
I just didn’t get a chance to tell you.

180
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:26,988
I was afraid you might not approve of...

181
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:29,205
me dating a guy.

182
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:37,308
Phaya.

183
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:40,142
Haven’t I told you before...

184
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:45,948
that whom you want to be with is your own choice to make?

185
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:48,553
Because it’s you who’d live that life.

186
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,159
Don’t you remember?

187
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:55,182
Tharn.

188
00:16:55,696 --> 00:17:01,045
Thank you for always taking care of him.

189
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,525
Since that day when he was drowned...

190
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,513
and recently when you had brought him back from death.

191
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,479
If it weren’t because of you,

192
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:20,622
I would have lost him long ago.

193
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,679
Thank you, dear.

194
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,290
Thank you for understanding me, Grandma.

195
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:32,348
Please don’t worry, Grandma.

196
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,348
It is my job to protect him.

197
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:37,479
I will always be by his side.

198
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:03,090
You go on and talk to them.

199
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:20,793
Grandma.

200
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,208
Yes?

201
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:26,450
There’s one more thing.

202
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,250
Oh, more?

203
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,250
Give me a second.

204
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,176
Now you can say it.

205
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:41,833
Well...

206
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:44,839
during this time that I’m still recovering,

207
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,176
Tharn has to go back to Nongkai.

208
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:52,508
Can I...can I go with him too?

209
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,216
So that we could take care of each other.

210
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,822
Awww, you’re so crazy in love, Police Officer.

211
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:05,102
Is that all?

212
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:08,016
You scared me.

213
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:10,008
You don’t have to ask for my permission.

214
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:13,422
After that drowning incident,

215
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,439
I still haven’t gone back to Nongkai since then.

216
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:21,833
Can I go with you? I want to go see the Abbot too.

217
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:22,988
Can I?

218
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,370
Of course, Grandma.

219
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,216
Thank you, Grandma.

220
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:48,142
Inspector, we’ve found a suspect. Do you want our team to arrest him?

221
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:49,010
Not yet.

222
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:51,399
Tell them to keep an eye on our suspect.

223
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:57,079
Hey, we must get as much infromation as possible today.

224
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,153
Singh

225
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:01,948
Can you hack into the police bureau database?

226
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:06,896
I want to know what Chart has been doing since he left the training camp.

227
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:08,348
You got it. I’ll take care of that.

228
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:09,776
And for me...

229
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:11,822
I’ll go check out the Inspector’s desk.

230
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,313
He might hide something in there.

231
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:15,902
Let’s go.

232
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:22,679
(Excited  Sound)

233
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:48,862
Geez, too many people here. What to do now?

234
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:52,199
I have a plan.

235
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:54,485
Hey, listen up!

236
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,090
There’s a meat ball vending stall in front of our building.

237
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,942
It’s Thongthai’s treat.

238
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,233
Don’t you want to grab some?

239
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:06,382
Hurry up or it’ll be sold out soon.

240
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,079
Enjoy eating.

241
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:11,628
You’re really something.

242
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:13,248
I told you.

243
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:18,248
Bingo!

244
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,890
Baby, are you done?

245
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:29,330
Bingo!

246
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,576
Hey.

247
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,473
Where are you guys going?

248
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:50,908
To Tharn’s place.

249
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:59,068
He forgot something at the office. I’ll drop by and give it to him.

250
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:02,862
Um

251
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:12,908
- Let’s go.	    /    - Let’s go.

252
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:18,530
Singh has looked into Chart’s record.

253
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:22,999
After he failed the test, he didn’t go back to work with his unit.

254
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:27,559
But what’s strange is, he still hasn’t filed for a resignation as a police officer.

255
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:32,393
His work record has also been wiped out completely.

256
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,748
I tried to get some information from his police colleagues,
but no one knows his whereabout.

257
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:44,668
It’s quite similar to what happened to Lieut Tam.

258
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:46,908
And to Inspector’s older brother too.

259
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:50,645
Their record as a police officer were wiped out clean.

260
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,873
As for me,

261
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:56,016
I’ve checked the CCTV cameras at the club.

262
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,919
Everything was also deleted.

263
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:00,965
This is really strange.

264
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:06,016
It’s as if someone is cleaning up after Chart’s mess so that there’ll be no traces of him.

265
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:10,439
Khem and I sneaked in to search the Inspector’s desk.

266
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:14,839
We found a file containing a prisnor’s record.

267
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,908
It’s a record of Khom, Montree’s right-hand man.

268
00:23:19,582 --> 00:23:21,468
Look at his right wrist.

269
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,730
The spider tattoo.

270
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,359
They are the same.

271
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:33,993
So, I looked into Khom’s record.

272
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:39,010
While he was still in jail, the one who bailed him out was Montree.

273
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:42,885
I also looked into old cases.

274
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,525
Turns out every Montree’s lackey who used to be in jail has this spider tattoo.

275
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,770
Tharn said he saw a spider tattoo on Chart’s wrist.

276
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,999
Does this mean Chart is also one of Montree’s lackeys?

277
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:01,102
Tharn.

278
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,839
Maybe what you told me…

279
00:24:04,838 --> 00:24:08,588
about your parents’ case and also Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases,

280
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:11,616
is Montree the one behind all these?

281
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,542
Inspector already knew.

282
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:17,273
Why didn’t he tell us then?

283
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:20,462
Why trying to keep it a secret from us?

284
00:24:24,405 --> 00:24:25,159
Oh!

285
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,393
Maybe, Inspector is also one of Montree’s people...

286
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:30,416
who helps taking care of things inside the unit.

287
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,582
Well, it was just an idea.

288
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:42,245
The most dangerous person is the one closest to us.

289
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:45,170
Like a plot from ‘Secret Crush On You The Series’.

290
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,168
Or ‘GAP The Series’.

291
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:50,645
You see? Such a plot twist, isn’t it?

292
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,090
Hey, where are you going?

293
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,113
I’m going to see the Inspector.

294
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,108
No, you’re not.

295
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,108
You’ll only upset him and make things worse.

296
00:25:05,468 --> 00:25:07,033
What if you get suspensed longer?

297
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:09,028
I’m not going to argue with him.

298
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,142
I’ll just want to ask him about my father.

299
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:16,885
I promise I’ll behave.

300
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,313
See? I told you.

301
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:29,308
Like a scene in ‘Secret Crush On You The Series’.

302
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,079
And ‘GAP The Series’.

303
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:32,656
Exactly the same.

304
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,868
The day your father died,

305
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:38,336
he already got an evidence on where Montree and his gang smuggled in drugs.

306
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:42,688
Do you know where Chalothorn is right now?

307
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:49,648
The Sign
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

308
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:11,749
The Sign

309
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:21,483
You’re still suspended. Why are you here?

310
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,894
I need to ask you about something, Inspector.

311
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:26,489
Do you know my father?

312
00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:36,995
My father used to tell me that he planned to adopt a younger brother of his junior officer who died in line of duty as his son.

313
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:39,355
But that boy turned down the offer.

314
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:42,862
So, my father could only support him for his education.

315
00:26:43,862 --> 00:26:46,755
The boy I’m talking about is you, isn’t it?

316
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:54,289
Yes, it is.

317
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:59,115
Then why didn’t you tell me you know my father?

318
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:09,702
Or is it because you’re still mad at my father for taking care of your brother’s case?

319
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:15,422
Your brother, Captain Itt, commited a breach of discipline.

320
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,742
He bribed Montree.

321
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:20,169
And chose to kill himself instead of serving his punishment.

322
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:27,649
My brother was innocent.

323
00:27:30,555 --> 00:27:31,969
So was my father.

324
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:34,209
He was also innocent.

325
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,582
And I, too, believe that your brother was also innocent.

326
00:27:40,502 --> 00:27:46,555
My father used to tell me that your brother was a good cop -- a very honest man.

327
00:27:47,186 --> 00:27:51,266
If I have a chance again, I want to be a good cop like your brother, Inspector.

328
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:55,986
But why do you have to keep it a secret from me?
Why keeping information about the case and Montree to yourself?

329
00:27:56,786 --> 00:28:00,020
Everything that I know up to now is nothing but the truth.

330
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:04,557
You want to know the truth about your brother’s case.

331
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:09,140
I also want to know the truth about my father’s case.

332
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:22,386
I don’t trust anyone in this unit. I can’t trust anyone.

333
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:29,746
On the day your father died, he got a hand on the evidence
about where Montree and his gang smuggled in drugs

334
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,380
But while he was on the way back to the unit, an accident occured.

335
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:37,003
I didn’t believe it was a coincidence.

336
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:40,317
So, I kept digging into this case.

337
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,180
Until I found out that your father was betrayed by someone in his unit.

338
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:50,980
Do you know who that person is?

339
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,146
Your father’s team leader.

340
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,489
That’s why I have to do it secretly.

341
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,534
The investigation must be done surreptitiously.

342
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:02,363
That’s why I couldn’t tell anyone about it.

343
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,534
You asked me why I didn’t tell you that I know your father.

344
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,637
It’s because I’m sure...

345
00:29:09,106 --> 00:29:11,106
that if someone or anyone in our unit has found out about this,

346
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:13,129
you will be in danger.

347
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:17,540
Is there anything else that you want to know?

348
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,809
Tharn, maybe you should go back first.

349
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,391
Go and get yourself together.

350
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:28,386
About the case and everything that happened,

351
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:36,054
I’ll tell you everything that you want to know once you’re back to work.

352
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:45,026
Yes, Inspector.

353
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:11,254
How are you doing?

354
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,957
I’m doing well, Luangpor.

355
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:15,803
I hope you’re feeling well too.

356
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:19,174
I am. How long are you going to stay this time?

357
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,117
Where are you staying?

358
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:24,694
We’ll stay here for a week.

359
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:26,511
We’re staying at Tharn’s grandmother’s place.

360
00:30:27,197 --> 00:30:31,746
Phaya told me that it’s very cozy and beautiful there.

361
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:38,671
Yes, the view around there is very scenic. It’s close to the forest and waterfall too.

362
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,254
It’s good that you go and stay with your grandmother so that you can also take care of her.

363
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:49,197
She’s very worried about you.

364
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,671
You never call and let her know how you are.

365
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:59,426
Tharn, can you take me to the waterfall after this?

366
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:02,249
Don’t trouble him any further.

367
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:06,249
We are already staying at his place.

368
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,694
It’s all right, Grandma.

369
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:11,380
I’ll be her personal tour guide and take her around.

370
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:19,437
Phaya and Tharn, come and give me a hand.

371
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,174
I want to give all of you the holy threads to help protect you from the danger. Let’s go.

372
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:25,026
Yes, Luangpor.

373
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:47,929
Here are the holy threads.

374
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:50,900
Make sure all of you wear it.

375
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,374
Thank you

376
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,877
How are you feeling now? Have you fully recovered?

377
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,277
I feel much better now, thank you.

378
00:31:58,214 --> 00:31:59,803
Luangpor.

379
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:03,757
Do you know where Chalothorn is?

380
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:06,374
He seems to disappeared after the incident.

381
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:09,140
He didn’t call or come to see Tharn at all.

382
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:14,500
I couldn’t come into contact with his spirit in my meditation either.

383
00:32:15,163 --> 00:32:17,369
He’s probably severely hurt.

384
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:21,963
You must stay close to Tharn and take a good care of him.

385
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:25,209
The Naga Fireball Festival is near.

386
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,557
Chalothorn will regain his power and become even more powerful.

387
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:36,237
one day before the 15th night of the 11th waxing moon.

388
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:39,231
Maybe, both of you should come stay with me...

389
00:32:41,974 --> 00:32:45,151
- Okay, I’ll let Tharn know about his.
- Good.

390
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:50,660
Hurry up and go home before it’ll get dark.

391
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:54,774
Tharn.

392
00:33:09,837 --> 00:33:11,300
We’d get going then, Luangpor.

393
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:16,649
Good luck to you all.

394
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:51,551
- Hello, Grandma.
- Hello, dear.

395
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,077
- Do you want to hug?
- Give me a hug first.

396
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,597
Hmmmm

397
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:58,443
Look who are here with me.

398
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:00,077
Oh, hello there.

399
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:02,317
- Hello.
- Oh my goodness! Long time no see.

400
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:03,711
- How are you doing?
- I’m good, thank you.

401
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,106
Welcome, all of you.

402
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:10,031
Let’s get inside. It’s quite hot right here.

403
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:11,346
Please come in.

404
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:17,769
Let’s go.

405
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,820
The Bael juice. I made it myself.

406
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:31,231
- How is it?
- It’s very tasty. Makes me feel fresh.

407
00:34:31,814 --> 00:34:36,031
- If you like it, I’ll make it for you every day.
- Oh, please don’t bother.

408
00:34:39,197 --> 00:34:41,231
Our grandmas are quite the same.

409
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:44,420
If you compliment on her food or tell her that you like to eat anything, she’d cook it for you every day.

410
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:47,666
Recently, I had to eat a green curry for a whole week!

411
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:51,197
I’ve been having Egg and Pork in Sweet Brown Sauce for two weeks.

412
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:53,151
My face is getting so round.

413
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:57,403
Let’s go.

414
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:06,751
Tharn told me that you own a wood processing plant.

415
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:08,134
That’s right.

416
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:13,049
It belongs to our family. Our main products are wooden furnitures.

417
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:17,871
These tables and cabinets are all my design.

418
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:20,489
Wow.

419
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:21,631
Really?

420
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:23,757
- Of course.
- You’re so talented.

421
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:30,889
Grandma, do you know that she was also very adventurous when she was younger?

422
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:33,529
She even went into the wood to supervise the workers herself.

423
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,923
I didn’t have any choice.

424
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:39,483
My son wanted to become a police officer.

425
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:44,831
And my only grandson, whom I hoped would take care of our business,
also decided to walk in his father’s footsteps.

426
00:35:45,094 --> 00:35:48,797
Oh, Phaya is like that too.

427
00:35:49,174 --> 00:35:52,763
He didn’t want to help me take care of the family business.

428
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,683
He just wants to become a cop. Now, he’s finally one.

429
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,774
This one is really something too.

430
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:05,071
He secretly sneaked out and applied for the exam. He didn’t tell me anything.

431
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:10,134
Quite a handful he is. I wonder if I’ve been raising up a boy or a monkey.

432
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:12,043
That’s what I’m thinking too.

433
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:19,197
Phaya is quite the same. He’s so stubborn. He never listens to anyone.

434
00:36:19,189 --> 00:36:23,700
- I’m afraid both of your grandsons are surely monkeys.
- Yes, indeed.

435
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:25,334
(Laughing)

436
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:31,643
Seems like your grandma and mine can get along really well.

437
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:36,134
Did I make the right choice introducing them to each other?

438
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:42,249
Miss, the food is now ready.

439
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:45,540
Oh, okay then. Let’s eat, shall we?

440
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:49,014
The food is fresh from the oven.

441
00:36:49,391 --> 00:36:51,489
Then you can take a shower later.

442
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,849
- Oh, that’s right. Phaya.
- Yes?

443
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:57,746
I’m afraid you have to sleep in Tharn’s room tonight.

444
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,094
Do you mind?

445
00:36:59,871 --> 00:37:00,649
Not at all.

446
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:01,300
Okay

447
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,283
I’ll go and tidy up the room for you.

448
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:10,100
Then make it quick. Hurry up and come down for your meal, okay?

449
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,049
Yes, Grandma.

450
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,734
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

451
00:37:43,003 --> 00:37:49,551
While we were still at the camp, you told me you’ve lived with the Abbot since when you were a kid.

452
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:56,111
The Abbot is someone that my family respects.

453
00:37:57,437 --> 00:37:59,483
Since my parents passed away,

454
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:07,254
the Abbot told my grandma that I am bound to make my loved ones die.

455
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:12,774
So, he asked my grandma to let me stay with him at the temple.

456
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:16,214
I didn’t have anyone then...

457
00:38:18,717 --> 00:38:20,191
apart from my grandma.

458
00:38:21,437 --> 00:38:23,346
So, I decided to take the offer and lived with the Abbot ever since.

459
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,940
My grandma often came to visit me.

460
00:38:32,454 --> 00:38:37,780
Do you have to stay with him for the rest of your life?

461
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:42,111
I don’t know.

462
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,974
I want to move back to live with my grandma.

463
00:38:47,403 --> 00:38:52,180
I plan to do that after I’m done with my father’s case.

464
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,129
I’m going to quit my job and stay with her.

465
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:02,569
I want to look after her, to show her my gratitude for raising me up.

466
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,014
At least you got to stay with your parents for a while.

467
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,209
And shared wonderful memories with them.

468
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:25,186
Honestly, I don’t remember much about my father.

469
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:31,071
Growing up, I only saw him dedicated himself in work as a police officer.

470
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:37,220
Until his last breath, he died because he was a cop.

471
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:52,546
They’re probably looking at you from above.

472
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:57,951
I hope so too.

473
00:39:59,986 --> 00:40:02,043
I want my parents to see...

474
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:05,289
when I can finally put the person who killed them behind bars.

475
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:12,420
Sir,

476
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,083
please don’t worry about Tharn.

477
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:16,511
I’m going to take care of him for you.

478
00:40:17,563 --> 00:40:20,580
I’m going to arrest the killer who took your life.

479
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,477
Thank you.

480
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,277
Let’s go put your things in the room.

481
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:35,529
Okay.

482
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:48,489
Hello, Yai.

483
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,386
I have good news.

484
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,386
Ning agrees to be our witness.

485
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,894
Really?

486
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:59,254
She told us she found a flash drive that Kao kept as an evidence.

487
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,403
Inspector and our team are on their way to see Ning at her place.

488
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:07,243
Call me as soon as you get anything new, okay?

489
00:41:07,803 --> 00:41:11,403
Okay. Are you at your grandma’s place?

490
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:14,009
Yeah.

491
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:16,466
Please take care, okay?

492
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,579
Okay. Say hi to the Abbot for me.

493
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:23,403
And tell him I’ll go visit him after the case is done.

494
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:25,551
I have to go.

495
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:26,797
Okay.

496
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,254
I hope the evidence we get from Ning will be solid enough to arrest Montree.

497
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,620
Hey, any update from Yai?

498
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:19,551
No.

499
00:42:21,643 --> 00:42:24,854
Don’t worry, he will call you if there’s anything important.

500
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:36,229
Ouch.

501
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:38,229
(Strangling / Gasping for breath)

502
00:42:40,214 --> 00:42:42,729
Tharn! What’s wrong?

503
00:42:54,797 --> 00:42:56,180
Did you have a vision?

504
00:42:58,111 --> 00:43:02,294
Yes, Korn is going to kill Ning.

505
00:43:11,814 --> 00:43:15,469
- Attention!
- You can go now. I’ll take it from here.

509
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,330
Hello, Tharn.

510
00:43:58,473 --> 00:43:59,558
Hello, Yai.

511
00:44:00,393 --> 00:44:03,181
I saw a vision where Khom was going to kill Ning.

512
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,507
What? Khom is going to kill Ning?

513
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,213
(Crying)

514
00:44:14,393 --> 00:44:16,975
How did he know Khom is going to kill Ning?

515
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:20,575
I’ll explain it to you later, Inspector.

516
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,678
But he’s never been wrong  with his information.

517
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:26,655
How do you know Khom is going to kill Ning?

518
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,964
Please trust me, Inspector.

519
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:31,467
Don’t question me anything right now.

520
00:44:32,038 --> 00:44:34,553
Hurry up and go to Ning’s place first. I’m begging you.

521
00:44:34,827 --> 00:44:37,730
You can go now. I’ll take if from now on.

522
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:50,293
(Commotion outside the house)

523
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,541
All clear.

524
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:13,935
Okay.

525
00:45:21,353 --> 00:45:22,324
Just run a red light, Khem.

526
00:45:22,323 --> 00:45:23,033
Yes, sir.

527
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:02,370
Ouch!

528
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:13,101
(Screaming in fright)

529
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,661
Who are you?

530
00:46:28,701 --> 00:46:30,381
Why are you here? Get out!

531
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:35,933
(Screaming)

532
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:54,333
(Screaming in pain)

533
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,564
That’s Ning’s house. Hurry up.

534
00:48:28,563 --> 00:48:29,284
Okay.

535
00:48:48,998 --> 00:48:49,935
I’m sorry, Inspector.

536
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,033
You can’t go in there.

537
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:51,833
Please stop.

538
00:48:51,935 --> 00:48:52,884
You can’t go in there.

539
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:54,553
You can’t go in there.

540
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:56,633
Hold on.

541
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,290
Ning

542
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:08,793
Inspector.

543
00:49:09,673 --> 00:49:10,850
She’s dead.

544
00:49:19,981 --> 00:49:21,878
Commander, the witness is dead.

545
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,330
What should we do?

546
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:34,587
If we don’t do something, they will have this case closed soon.

547
00:49:34,758 --> 00:49:36,370
Montree is definitely behind this.

548
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:39,398
Go find the evidence that Ning wanted to give to us.

549
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,907
- Go!    /    - Yes, sir.

550
00:50:46,187 --> 00:50:46,933
Ouch!

551
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:00,598
Who are you?

552
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:02,598
Why are you here? Get out!

553
00:51:26,724 --> 00:51:27,533
Yes.

554
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:29,467
Yes.

555
00:51:30,495 --> 00:51:31,364
Yes, sir.

556
00:51:36,095 --> 00:51:37,764
You and your men should leave, Inspector.

557
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,947
This case is no longer your responsibility.

558
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:41,650
What?

559
00:51:41,718 --> 00:51:42,644
What do you mean?

560
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:45,135
You and your team are removed from this case.

561
00:51:45,883 --> 00:51:47,341
- What do you mean?
- You can’t do that!

562
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,181
We’ve been on this case since the very beginning.

563
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:51,238
- The victim is also our prime witness.
- That’s enough!

564
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:52,998
Follow your order.

565
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:53,993
Yes, sir.

566
00:51:56,804 --> 00:51:57,524
Let’s go.

567
00:52:16,118 --> 00:52:17,238
What did you say?

568
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:19,707
Ning is dead?

569
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:23,170
Dammit!

570
00:52:24,884 --> 00:52:26,415
She did leave us any evidence.

571
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:27,901
But we still couldn’t help her!

572
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,970
How many times do I have to face something like this?!

573
00:52:29,963 --> 00:52:31,581
Tharn, please calm down.

574
00:52:32,758 --> 00:52:36,004
The one who should feel sorry is Montree, not you.

575
00:52:37,535 --> 00:52:40,324
Once you get back to work, you can help make her soul rest in peace...

576
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:42,404
by arresting the one who killed her.

577
00:52:44,198 --> 00:52:45,124
M’Lady!

578
00:52:45,513 --> 00:52:46,267
M’Lady!

579
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,107
M’Lady! We’ve got a problem!

580
00:52:50,015 --> 00:52:51,078
What’s going on, Tong?

581
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:53,421
Our workers who’ve gone into the woods to collect wild products.

582
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,490
They were eaten by the tiger-man.

583
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:56,815
A tiger-man?

584
00:52:56,813 --> 00:52:57,673
That’s right.

585
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:01,741
Careful!

586
00:53:01,935 --> 00:53:03,204
What happened, Kham?

587
00:53:03,353 --> 00:53:06,335
Joe and Kai went across the border into the woods in Laos to collect wild products

588
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:09,044
Kai got eaten by the tiger-man.

589
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:09,661
What?!

590
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,021
A tiger-man is not real.

591
00:53:11,558 --> 00:53:13,067
What would you know?

592
00:53:13,753 --> 00:53:14,690
It is real.

593
00:53:15,855 --> 00:53:17,684
If you don’t believe it, then don’t distrepect it.

594
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:19,124
I’m not disrespecting it.

595
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,473
Where’s the body of that worker?

596
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:31,227
Joe said it was aleady taken by the tiger-man.

597
00:53:31,223 --> 00:53:32,347
It took the body and ate it up.

598
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,893
The, the, the...the tiger-man took Kai’s body away.

599
00:53:42,038 --> 00:53:43,695
Singh, play it.

600
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:44,918
Yes, sir.

601
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,038
Gather as many artworks as you can.

602
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:50,918
This time is going to be a big lot.

603
00:53:52,164 --> 00:53:52,987
Okay.

604
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:57,215
But I will have to increase the price this time.

605
00:53:58,053 --> 00:54:00,198
Can you help talk to the Minister for me, Khom?

606
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:02,953
You’ll see him tomorrow anyway.

607
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:04,793
Tell him yourself then.

608
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:08,930
Once you get all the artworks, send them to the warehouse in Nongkai.

609
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:12,781
Nongkai?

610
00:54:16,724 --> 00:54:17,810
(Incoming message)

611
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:20,693
[Montree is heading to NongKai, where the NongKai forest produces medicine along the Mekong River.]

612
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:35,581
Montree.

613
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:37,284
You won’t get away this time.

614
00:54:52,853 --> 00:54:55,853
idolfactory

615
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:59,718
I want to know why Tharn knew Ning was going to be killed.

616
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,301
I want someone who knows the route that Joe and Kai took.

617
00:55:02,293 --> 00:55:04,781
They don’t believe that Kai was eaten by a tiger-man.

618
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,221
Why did you call Chalothorn?

619
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:09,090
Phaya.

620
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:11,238
This is my family’s matter, let me handle it.

621
00:55:11,233 --> 00:55:12,473
Am I not the one you love?

622
00:55:12,473 --> 00:55:14,907
What did he do to you? Why do you hate him so much?

623
00:55:14,903 --> 00:55:16,347
Because he’s the Naga!

624
00:55:17,627 --> 00:55:18,243
(Gunshot)

625
00:55:18,244 --> 00:55:18,907
Hey!

626
00:55:19,421 --> 00:55:20,553
(Gunshot)

627
00:55:21,215 --> 00:55:21,947
Watch out!

628
00:55:24,253 --> 00:55:25,101
Shit!

629
00:55:40,563 --> 00:55:48,210
