Phaya!

3
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:09,280
Hey!

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,685
What you did tonight...

5
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:14,754
was a serious breach of discipline.

6
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:17,222
If you really think you are good enough…

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,651
just do your job as best as you can and pass the exam.

8
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:22,022
Hooya!

9
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,280
Shit!

10
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:27,337
You go drop him off at his condo then.

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,640
- But I’m drunk too. I can’t do that.
- So am I.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,331
Geez, what’s wrong with him?

13
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:36,820

Dr. Cholathorn!

Tharn

35
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:28,137
Why are you so drunk?

36
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:30,434
Please get your hand off my friend.

37
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,634
I’m afraid I can’t since he’s my brother.

38
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,022
- But he’s with...
- Thank you for looking after him.

39
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:37,748
You can leave him with me now.

40
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:40,217
Ah, my head…

41
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:41,988
Let’s go then.

42
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:43,497
You..

43
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:47,405
Can you walk? We’re almost there.

44
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,057
Wait.

45
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:03,085
Have we met before?

46
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:05,645
I’m not sure.

47
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:08,560
We might have met before but I couldn’t remember it.

48
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,645
But we’d probably meet more often after this.

49
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:13,485
Please excuse us.

50
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:45,051
Yai, are you all right?

51
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,045
Of course.

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,965
- Yai.
- Yeah?

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,182
Do you think Phaya and Tharn are now...

54
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:55,220
Let’s drink for my bro then.

55
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,977
My bro has finally lost his virginity.

56
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:59,970
Cheers!

57
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,634
- Down it.
- You've finished your last drink.

58
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:10,845
Hey, I thought you were dropping Tharn off. Why are you back so early?

59
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,702
Yeah.

60
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:13,988
Or did I give you a wrong location?

61
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,725
That’s why you’re back here so fast.

62
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,897
Some guy named...

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,462
Slow...Slowmotion or something like that.

64
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,120
Slowmotion? Is that even a name?

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,057
Hey! Listen to me.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Whatever. He just parked in front of us and said...

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,771
that he’s Tharn’s big brother.

68
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,177
So, Tharn just left with him.

69
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:37,097
Ahhh, Dr. Chalothorn.

70
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,874
Yeah, that Chalothorn. Who is he?

71
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,770
Tharn and I have known him since when we were kids.

72
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:46,205
He’s always looking after Tharn.

73
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,171
Good for him. Now he’d have someone to look after him whenever he’s drunk.

74
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,451
Isn’t a doctor supposed to take care of a sick patient?

75
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,737
How come he has to take care of a drunkard too.

76
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:06,537
- A doctor takes care of a drunken man.
- How would he take care of him?

77
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,000
So do I.

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,920
How would he take care of him?

79
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,902
Shower?!

80
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,691
- Take a shower
- Yeah

81
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:16,137
How can you let him taking a shower with a stranger?

82
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:18,011
Why not?

83
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,451
We did that a lot too.

84
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,382
A lot? Did you say ‘a lot’?!

85
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:22,640
So often?

86
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,114
What’s wrong with you?

87
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,862
Calm down, man. You’d break all the glasses.

88
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,217
- I’m more worried about the beer.
- Be careful, P'Yai, be careful.

89
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,091
Hey, where are you going?

90
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,142
I’ll be back!

91
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:34,891
Huh? What happened?

92
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,811
Whatever. Go ahead and down it, Yai.

93
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,205
Yeah. Bottoms up.

94
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:45,840

Tharn, Tharn.

98
00:05:57,554 --> 00:05:59,828
Phaya?

99
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,931
How are you feeling?

100
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,291
Where are you?

101
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,554
In my room.

102
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,611
Are you okay?

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,610
Yeah, I’m okay.

104
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:16,620
Ah my head.  I really need to sleep.

105
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,748
- I gotta go now.
- Wait, Tharn!

106
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:24,651
Go take a shower first.

107
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:26,650
How are you feeling now, Tharn?

108
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,885
Doc.

109
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:36,697
Are you okay?

110
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:39,394
Yeah.

111
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,325
Don’t drink too much next time, okay?

112
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:44,754
It’s not good for yourself.

113
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,051
I didn’t want to. Yai made me do it.

114
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,640
It’s all right. Come on then.

115
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:52,662
Get up first.

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,262
Are you sure you’re okay?

117
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:58,000
Are you okay?

118
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:03,645
- I’m so sleepy. Can I go to bed?
- Not yet.

119
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:07,165
Take a shower and get changed first so that you’d feel better.

120
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:13,988
Let’s get up. Can you do it?

121
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:16,620
Oh, you’re quite heavy.

122
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,954
Let’s go.

123
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:20,011
Tharn.

124
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:23,417
Can you walk?

125
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:29,622
Tharn!

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,474
Shit! The battery is out.

127
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:33,540
What to do now?

128
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,260
Yai!

129
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:41,851
Yai, my phone is...

- Nee?
- Welcome home, brother.

149
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,874
- Oh, my
- I miss you so much.

150
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,697
Let me go.

151
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,108
Why are you reeking of alcohol?

152
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:19,325
Did you go drinking or bathing in it?

153
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:21,940
Oh, just quit it. Where have you two been?

154
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,457
I went out for dinner with Grandma.

155
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:26,925
- Phaya.
- Grandma.

156
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:28,990
Hello.

157
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:31,710
I miss you, my boy.

158
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,880
I miss you too.

159
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,497
You spent a lot of time outdoor, didn’t you? Now you looked a lot tanner.

160
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,520
And a lot thinner too.

161
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:45,668
The training was tough, wasn’t it?

162
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,228
Well...

163
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,794
Thinner?

164
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,222
He’s a lot bulkier.

165
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,657
Look at his arm muscles. Look at those muscular arms, Grandma.

166
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,725
- Looks very muscular, very muscular.
- One more time.

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,394
- Give her one more.
- Look

168
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,937
- Ouch.
- Don’t bad-mouth your brother.

169
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,285
My boy.

170
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,200
What were you thinking, sitting in the dark like that?
Why didn’t you go take a shower and get some rest?

171
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:07,360
Oh, maybe…

172
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:10,765
you were thinking about someone?

173
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:16,240
He was probably thinking of a girl he just met at the club.

174
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,394
Huh?

175
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,337
I was just reading something, Grandma.

176
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,125
Um

177
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:24,320
I’m going to go take a shower first.

178
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,548
You’re always finding an excuse when I ask you about girls.

179
00:11:32,342 --> 00:11:33,885
An excuse, huh?

180
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,737

It’s very late. Why are you still up?

196
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,708
I want to ask if you want me to wake you up tomorrow morning for the merit-making?

This one is the girl I often saw in my dream.

I don’t know why I dream of her quite often these days.

213
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:53,460
That’s strange. Usually, you’d only dream of her on the 15th day of the 11th waxing moon.

214
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,580

I think you’re probably tired and stressed from work.

217
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,474

You’ve been researching and studying about them for so many years, haven’t you?

I’m going to start from where it begins – where all those dreams started.

Go on and finish your food.

294

00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:52,536
I still haven’t lectured you about last night.

336
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:56,128
That you got so drunk and almost made us both miss the plane.

337
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,038
Oh, so you remembered? Why didn’t you tell me then?

338
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:01,228
Are you blaming me now?

339
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:02,738
Is it my fault?

340
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:06,278
What? Of course, not, sweetie.

341
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:10,358
I was just kidding. Please forgive me. It’s all my fault.

342
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:14,758
It’s my fault. Please tell me what you want me to do tonight, my baby.

343
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:16,478
Please behave. We’re at the temple.

00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:13,508
Never lose your awareness.

361
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,028
Always be calm.

362
00:26:15,628 --> 00:26:16,650
Don’t be a hotheaded.

363
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:20,753
As long as he has me with him, I’ll always make sure he behaves.

364
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:23,782
I’ll always make sure he behaves.

365
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,778
You can rest assured that he’ll always be mindful.

366
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:30,902
Maybe you should tell that to yourself first.

367
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,765
Whenever they are together, there’s always trouble.

368
00:26:35,736 --> 00:26:36,833
I agree.

369
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,582
Totally agree.

370
00:26:39,256 --> 00:26:41,542
Without you...

371
00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:44,845
harn would surely be more calm and always think twice.

372
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:47,788
You are quick-tempered and act on impluse.

373
00:26:47,788 --> 00:26:50,570
Please mercy me.

374
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,268
Darling, I got scolded again.

375
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:53,728
There you go.

376
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:56,308
Ouch! It really hurts, babe.

377
00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:57,378
Does it?

378
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:58,168
Does it hurt a lot?

379
00:26:58,168 --> 00:26:59,256
Ouch!….

380
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:01,736
Go that way.

381
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:05,408
While you’re staying here.

382
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:07,668
Let me warn you about something

383
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:12,765
Make sure you often meditate and dedicate the merits to those whom you have wronged in the past.

384
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:17,782
So that it would help lighten the consequences of your karma.

385
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:18,833
Got it?

386
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,668
Is he still not free from them?

387
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:27,628
They’ve been after him since when he was born.

388
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,816
That’s why he had to live at the temple.

389
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:33,519
What do they want from him? Why are they so vengeful?

390
00:27:59,576 --> 00:28:02,388
Are you going to Rocket Festival tonight?

391
00:28:03,153 --> 00:28:05,318
Absolutely. They won’t miss the chance.

392
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,765
Do you want to go home to visit your grandma first?

393
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:10,925
We can meet again this evening.

394
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:14,342
’m going to stay here tonight.

395
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:17,142
So that I can help take care of the Abbot.

396
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:19,758
You and Yai go back first.

397
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,199
I’ll give you a call later.

398
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:22,376
Okay.

399
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:25,919
We’d get going then. Goodbye, Luangpor.

400
00:28:25,942 --> 00:28:28,170
Stay safe, both of you.

401
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:40,479
Tharn, can you do me a favour?

402
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:42,788
Luangpor,

403
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:46,022
Why do you ask me to bring an extra set of bedding?

404
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:48,536
Someone will also sleep here tonight.

405
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,348
Go and make your bed in the pavillioin first.

406
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:53,508
Okay.

407
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:00,422
Phaya!

408
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:03,656
Tharn!

409
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,588
What on earth are you doing here?

410
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:18,168
Goodevening, Luangpor. Do you remember me?

411
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:22,968
Oh, I haven’t seen you for a long time. How are you?

412
00:29:23,668 --> 00:29:24,708
I’m good.

413
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,210
You two spent a lot of time together during the training, didn’t you recognised each other?

414
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:35,382
Do you mean, Phaya and I...

415
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:38,193
have met before we went to the training camp?

416
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,285
That’s right.

417
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:46,296
You used to give him the amulet when he was young.

418
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:47,393
What?

419
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:52,799
You’re that boy who gave me the amulet?

420
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:13,313
Thank you so much, Luangpor.

421
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:17,805
For always taking care of Tharn since the day he lost his parents in an accident.

422
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,888
You and this temple...

423
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:22,228
have always been a sanctuary for Tharn and I.

424
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:30,548
He often told me that all he has is his grandmother.

425
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:34,113
So, he doesn’t want anything bad to happen to you.

426
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:37,039
That’s why he asked if he could live here.

427
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:43,161
I don’t want him to blame himself.

428
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:45,428
I could only hope that...

429
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,488
he will eventually forget about that terrible accident when he gets older.

430
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,582
Everything has already been destined.

431
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,959
His life is written by the karma he did in his past life.

432
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:02,868
Is there a way to fix it?

433
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:07,679
Well, there is somehow.

434
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:16,079
His destiny has been entwined with someone since his past life.

435
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:20,970
That person will lead him to experience bad things.

436
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:28,022
But it is also that person who would be able to free him from his karma.

437
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:52,788
Tharn, let’s go to the festival.

438
00:31:54,728 --> 00:32:00,845
Tharn, it’s the 15th day of the 11th waxing moon today. Are you going to the Rocket Festival with Yai?

439
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,125
Yes, grandma.

440
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,988
Please don’t worry.

441
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:05,698
I’ll take a good care of myself.

442
00:32:05,698 --> 00:32:08,170
When the festival is done, I’ll go visit you at home.

443
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,408
Take care of each other, okay?

444
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:12,010
Yes, grandma.

445
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,513
- Let's help pack up
- Okay.

446
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:21,976
Tharn, I need a little favour from you.

447
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,982
Make sure you track down the owner of this amulet by tonight.

448
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,936
Once you’ve found him, give him this amulet.

449
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:41,119
Who is the owner of this amulet, Luangpor?

450
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:46,348
If you meet him, your feelings will tell you.

451
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:48,582
Who is the owner of this necklace?

452
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:51,233
But you must find him.

453
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:55,576
Whether you’d be free from those whom you have wronged in the past...

454
00:32:56,365 --> 00:33:02,056
depends on whether you’d be able to find the owner of this amulet tonight.

455
00:33:09,245 --> 00:33:10,388
Let’s go.

456
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,193
Goodbye, Luangpor.

457
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:20,125
Tharn! Yai! Come quick! What took you so long? I’ve been here for a while.

458
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:22,045
Let’s go.

459
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:42,708
Who are you looking for?

460
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:46,136
The person that the Abbot asked me to give this amulet to.

461
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,890
Geez, I thought you and I could just have fun at the festival.

462
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:54,730
Too bad the Abbot also gave you a mission for tonight.

463
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,650
Now, I’m bored.

464
00:33:57,348 --> 00:34:02,328
The Abbot said there’ll be a sign and I’ll know once I see him.

465
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,445
The owner of this amulet.

466
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,228
What sign?

467
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:08,061
What are you two talking about?

468
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,662
Some nonsese stuff.

469
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:14,548
Let’s light up these firecrackers. I bought tons of them.

470
00:34:14,548 --> 00:34:18,113
After we finish eating, let’s go watch something at the outdoor cinema.

471
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:19,256
Yeah, let’s do that.

472
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,719
- You take the meatballs to eat first.
- Okay

473
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,142
What’s this for?

474
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:28,208
Help! Help! My nephew is drowning!

475
00:34:30,308 --> 00:34:32,528
Help! My nephew is drowning!

476
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:44,448
Tharn, what’s wrong?

477
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:48,148
I saw a boy drowning.

478
00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:50,318
Geez, nonsense.

479
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:52,182
Are you going to tell me that you have a vision?

480
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:53,788
But I really saw it.

481
00:34:53,788 --> 00:34:56,288
Nonsense. Let’s go watch a movie.

482
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:58,262
Help! My nephew is drowning!

483
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:09,688
Help! Help! My nephew is drowning!

484
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:13,496
Help! My nephew! He is drowning!

485
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,142
Phaya!

486
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,828
Phaya!

487
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:38,456
Phaya!

488
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:42,833
Wake up

489
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:47,519
- Wake up
- Phaya

490
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:49,528
- Wake up
- Phaya

491
00:35:49,528 --> 00:35:50,528
(Choke)

492
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,599
(Crying sound)

493
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:10,502
Thank you

494
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,008
It’s okay. You’re safe now.

495
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:35,538
Here are your clothes. Let’s go and get changed.

496
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:41,073
- Thank you all of you so much for saving his life.
- You’re welcome.

497
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,182
Tharn.

498
00:36:44,658 --> 00:36:46,490
You should go and get changed too.

499
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:49,028
We’d get going then.

500
00:36:49,245 --> 00:36:50,678
Goodbye.

501
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:06,878
Without him, my nephew would have been dead.

502
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:08,608
Thank you so much indeed.

503
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:13,279
Oh, it’s all right. I was quite worried when I heard about it.

504
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,250
But what a relief to know that they were all safe.

505
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:20,445
It’s probably like what you said.

506
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,888
Your nephew is a very fortunate boy.

507
00:37:24,888 --> 00:37:26,673
So, he would probably live for a very long time.

508
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,713
But you have to be careful though.

509
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:35,610
If both of your destiny are entwined like what I think...

510
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:40,205
you would eventually find each other again.

511
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:48,822
Please take this as a thank you gift for saving my nephew’s life.

512
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:55,016
Thank you, ma’am. But my grandma and the Abbot have taught me to always help those who are in need.

513
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:58,102
Hey, but you did something good so you should take it.

514
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:01,608
I’ll take it then.

515
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:02,398
Thank you.

516
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:03,245
Ouch!

517
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:11,302
Well, then...I’ll give it to the Abbot instead.

518
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:17,638
I’d like to donate this money for the temple and those who live here.

519
00:38:17,638 --> 00:38:20,845
So that you could use it as an education fund of these kids.

520
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:27,793
I'm so close to getting the money,The Abbot.

521
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:34,970
Are you here for the Rocket Festival?

522
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:38,728
You don’t look local though.

523
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:40,662
We came from Bangkok.

524
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:44,148
My nephew often dreamt about the Naga.

525
00:38:44,148 --> 00:38:46,278
So, he insisted that I must take him to the festival.

526
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:48,376
He wants to witness it by himself.

527
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:52,513
But I had no idea why he almost got drowned.

528
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:55,828
He doesn’t know how to swim.

529
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:58,358
But he still wants to go and play near the riverbank.

530
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:05,382
Grandma, I really heard someone calling me there last night.

531
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,176
I want to go home now.

532
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:17,610
Well then, please excuse us.

533
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:20,662
Thank you so much once again.

534
00:39:20,822 --> 00:39:23,496
For saving my nephew’s life.

535
00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:25,958
You’re welcome. Please travel safe.

536
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:27,268
Thank you.

537
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:29,279
Please take care.

538
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:30,742
Okay.

539
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,858
If you have a chance to visit here again in the future,

540
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:37,245
I hope we’ll meet again.

541
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:38,998
Thank you.

542
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:40,753
Let’s say goodbye to the Abbot.

543
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:50,348
Have a safe trip.

544
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:22,833
Please wait!

545
00:40:30,068 --> 00:40:30,868
Here, take it.

546
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,096
Why?

547
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,062
The Abbot used to tell me...

548
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:39,953
to find the owner of this amulet.

549
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:42,936
I think you’re that person.

550
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:45,405
But I don’t want it.

551
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:48,639
Take it.

552
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:51,382
It will help protect you.

553
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,513
Until we meet again.

554
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:23,488
ou’re that boy I saved from getting drowned?

555
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:25,439
Geez.

556
00:41:25,713 --> 00:41:27,085
I shouldn’t have done that.

557
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:28,559
Then we wouldn’t have to see each other again.

558
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:30,288
But I’m glad

559
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:33,462
to know that you were the boy who saved my life.

560
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,770
Why are you glad?

561
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,845
Well, because...

562
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:42,285
you might be the one who can help answer the questions I have about my dreams.

563
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,588
What you saw wasn’t a dream.

564
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:50,605
It was your karma

565
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,422
Are you saying that...

566
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,965
they are those whom I have wronged in my past life?

567
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:03,188
That’s right. But they are not just yours.

568
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:09,336
Why are you looking at me like that?

569
00:42:10,273 --> 00:42:12,570
Do you remember what I used to tell you?

570
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,702
hat you must find the owner of that amulet.

571
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:20,719
Once you’ve found him, you must protect him with your life.

572
00:42:21,256 --> 00:42:25,599
Because he could help free you from your karma.

573
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:28,902
It’s all up to the owner of this amulet.

574
00:42:31,096 --> 00:42:32,285
All these years,

575
00:42:33,256 --> 00:42:35,416
I’ve been trying to find the meaning of my dreams.

576
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:40,136
I want to know what exactly it was...

577
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,285
that I saw when I was drowning.

578
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:03,736
After that incident...

579
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,776
on every 15th day of the 11th waxing moon,

580
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,165
I’d always see those pictures in my dream.

581
00:43:14,056 --> 00:43:15,268
A pair of green eyes.

582
00:43:20,022 --> 00:43:22,925
These pictures became clearer and cleaer every time I saw them.

583
00:43:26,845 --> 00:43:31,119
From just a pair of green eyes to seeing the Naga?

584
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,108
Yes.

585
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,713
Have you ever seen any of them?

586
00:43:39,142 --> 00:43:40,045
No.

587
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:43,542
I only saw it once when I was down there to rescue you.

588
00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:48,456
But those green eyes that I saw...

589
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:53,439
might have been the Naga fireballs.

590
00:43:58,742 --> 00:44:01,702
Everything that happens to both of you...

591
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:03,450
is a result of your karma.

592
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,016
You’d only know the answer...

593
00:44:07,793 --> 00:44:13,336
through the act of meditation which will enlighten you and lead you to the truth.

594
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,593
Your destiny have been entwined since your past lives

595
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:18,845
มันผูกกันมาหลายภพ

596
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:22,959
You both are destined to help each other

597
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,233
Trust each other.

598
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:30,776
Only then, you would be able to free yourself from your karma.

599
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,113
Your kind hearts are your best weapon.

600
00:44:41,336 --> 00:44:43,393
And remember to always trust each other

601
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:46,239
Help each other.

602
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:51,530
And you both would live a happy life,

603
00:44:52,342 --> 00:44:54,365
like you’ve always dreamt of.

604
00:46:12,685 --> 00:46:15,256
(Thunder sounds)

605
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:46,408
I was only doing my job.

606
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:51,610
Your job? Or you just wanted to intervene.

607
00:46:51,878 --> 00:46:53,599
I don’t want to hurt anyone.

608
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:56,136
I just want to get what is mine back.

609
00:46:56,136 --> 00:46:58,488
(Thunder sounds)

610
00:47:13,688 --> 00:47:16,308
You’re so beautiful.

611
00:47:18,822 --> 00:47:20,628
Why is it that every time I got near you,

612
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,358
I’d always have a bad dream?

613
00:47:23,368 --> 00:47:30,328
The Sign
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

614
00:47:30,435 --> 00:47:37,415
The Sign

615
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:44,325
You already know what you’ve always wanted to know.

616
00:47:44,423 --> 00:47:45,657
Why are you still after me?

617
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:49,315
But that’s not everything that I want to know.

618
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,137
Tharn.

619
00:47:55,715 --> 00:47:56,755
Phaya.

620
00:47:57,623 --> 00:48:00,286
-Yai.
What on earth are you doing here?

621
00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:02,366
You doing here?

622
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:03,452
I’m here to sort out something.

623
00:48:03,452 --> 00:48:05,445
Oh, you’ve come quite far.

624
00:48:05,445 --> 00:48:05,943
(The sound of laughter)

625
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:07,935
How did he get here?

626
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,440
I don’t know.

627
00:48:09,435 --> 00:48:11,703
Oh, this is my girlfriend, Sand.

628
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:13,635
Hello.

629
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:16,709
Wow, you’ve got a beauty as your girlfriend, huh?

630
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:19,349
Of course. A handsome guy like me only deserves the best.

631
00:48:19,452 --> 00:48:20,732
Right, honey?

632
00:48:21,885 --> 00:48:24,720
It was quite dark so I didn’t know he actually looks like this.

633
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,335
(Everyone laughs)

634
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:32,732
That was harsh, honey. I’m hurt.

635
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:36,835
So, welcome to Nongkai.

636
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:39,337
It’s always crowded on this day of every year.

637
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:41,783
Once, the traffic jam went all the way to Udon Thani.

638
00:48:42,617 --> 00:48:45,303
Those people probably wanted to come witness the Naga fireballs with their own eyes.

639
00:48:46,165 --> 00:48:47,223
So,

640
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,817
Are you here for the first time?

641
00:48:50,743 --> 00:48:52,560
No, this is my second time.

642
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:53,646
I used to come here once when I was a kid.

643
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:55,280
I see.

644
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:58,800
If you want to come here more often, then you should get yourself a lover in Nongkai.

645
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:00,400
Right, Tharn?

646
00:49:02,297 --> 00:49:03,897
Do you want me to recommend someone?

647
00:49:04,012 --> 00:49:06,812
My junior is still single.

648
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,395
Thank you.

649
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:13,486
Maybe Tharn, the single one...Oops! I mean...

650
00:49:14,005 --> 00:49:16,366
Tharn might want to see the Naga fireballs now.

651
00:49:16,365 --> 00:49:17,760
Let’s go find somewhere to sit.

652
00:49:17,783 --> 00:49:18,457
Okay.

653
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,669
We’ll see you at the festival then.

654
00:49:19,685 --> 00:49:21,657
I’m going to eat the grilled fish at my favourite restaurant first.

655
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:23,886
I already made a reservation. The place is packed with people from the festival today.

656
00:49:23,905 --> 00:49:24,812
See you!

657
00:49:24,825 --> 00:49:26,000
See you.

658
00:49:26,983 --> 00:49:27,855
Want some?

659
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:29,909
- See you then.
- See you

660
00:49:29,905 --> 00:49:30,903
- Okay.
- Bye.

661
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:42,275
Are you ready, my guide?

662
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:44,149
Lead the way.

663
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:52,775
(Music)

664
00:50:13,737 --> 00:50:14,895
It’s beautiful.

665
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:19,326
It’s so crowded this year.

666
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:20,286
Hey, the pork here is really good.

667
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:21,086
Really?

668
00:50:23,246 --> 00:50:24,495
Can I have one, please?

669
00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:26,995
This one and this one too. The crispy pork skin too.

670
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:28,137
Thank you.

671
00:50:28,545 --> 00:50:29,223
Let’s go.

672
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:30,069
Thank you.

673
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:34,895
(Fun music)

674
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,855
(Fireworks sound)

675
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:07,737
Let’s go eat something after this.

676
00:51:07,735 --> 00:51:08,480
Okay.

677
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:15,155
Are you okay?

678
00:51:19,817 --> 00:51:21,257
Are you afraid of the Naga statue?

679
00:51:23,715 --> 00:51:24,389
No

680
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,389
But you look so pale right now.

681
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:33,495
It’s nothing. Let’s get going.

682
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,535
(Fireworks sound)

683
00:52:05,097 --> 00:52:06,675
Did you see that, honey?

684
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:07,875
Yes.

685
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,440
There are lots of them this year.

686
00:52:09,455 --> 00:52:11,680
But I only saw the first one.

687
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:13,372
Aww, why didn’t you pay more attention?

688
00:52:14,137 --> 00:52:14,949
It’s amazing.

689
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:21,783
Look over there!

690
00:52:22,565 --> 00:52:23,452
Did you see it?

691
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:24,149
Yes,

692
00:52:24,515 --> 00:52:25,303
Amazing.

693
00:52:27,966 --> 00:52:29,189
But not as amazing as you.

694
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,709
Where?

695
00:52:38,705 --> 00:52:39,863
- Sure?
- Yeah.

696
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:41,372
- Really?
- Yeah.

697
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:42,412
It was huge

698
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,246
Why couldn’t you see it?

699
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,863
Did you see that one Tharn was talking about?

700
00:52:47,855 --> 00:52:50,000
- No.
- Did you fool me?

701
00:52:49,995 --> 00:52:51,257
We both saw it.

702
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:52,457
Sure?

703
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:55,795
Yes. See that?

704
00:53:05,635 --> 00:53:07,395
Phaya, did you see it? Over there.

705
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:09,669
Yes.

706
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,737
Right in front of me

707
00:53:26,635 --> 00:53:28,195
Saw that, honey?

708
00:53:28,195 --> 00:53:28,960
Yes.

709
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,183
-Yes.
-It was big.

710
00:53:39,806 --> 00:53:41,063
Are you feeling better?

711
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:43,600
Yeah, sort of

712
00:53:46,332 --> 00:53:48,057
But you don’t look okay at all.

713
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,532
I don’t know.

714
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,995
I couldn’t breathe all of the sudden.

715
00:53:57,543 --> 00:53:59,337
And I felt the burning pain all over my body.

716
00:54:01,995 --> 00:54:05,977
You go enjoy the festival then.

717
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:07,463
I’ll go back to the temple first.

718
00:54:09,783 --> 00:54:12,183
It’s okay. I’ll go back with you.

719
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:14,972
Thanks.

720
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,415
You’re so beautiful.

721
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:45,615
Once upon a time, a Naga disguise itself as a man.

722
00:54:46,526 --> 00:54:47,975
It was long before I was born.

723
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,015
There is no way you can help him, Wansarut.

724
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:58,240

725
00:54:59,806 --> 00:55:00,423
(Gasping)

726
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:29,669
Why is it that every time I got near you,

727
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,577
I’d always have a bad dream?

728
00:56:15,703 --> 00:56:16,549
Phaya,

729
00:56:16,743 --> 00:56:19,143
Sand and I will give you a tour in Nongkai today.

730
00:56:19,315 --> 00:56:20,469
Think of it as my apology

731
00:56:20,686 --> 00:56:22,480
For last nigt.

732
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:25,509
It was too crowded. I couldn’t find you guys so I just stayed with my girlfriend.

733
00:56:26,777 --> 00:56:28,617
If you’re going to give him a tour,

734
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:30,355
why do I have to tag along?

735
00:56:30,446 --> 00:56:32,057
I’m want to stay at the temple to take care of the Abbot.

736
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:33,212
Ouch!….

737
00:56:33,205 --> 00:56:34,903
He wouldn’t want you to stay.

738
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:36,617
Otherwise, why would he tell me to take you with me too?

739
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:39,943
I’m going to take you to the cave.

740
00:56:40,766 --> 00:56:41,772
What cave?

741
00:56:42,545 --> 00:56:45,749
I’m sure you’ll like it.

742
00:56:45,977 --> 00:56:49,726
It’s said that this cave is the gateway to the city of Naga.

743
00:56:50,055 --> 00:56:56,023
There are lots of stalactites and stalagmites in the cave. It would surely give you a creep.

744
00:56:56,263 --> 00:56:58,805
I’m having goosebumps right now thinking about last night.

745
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,269
Why didn’t you want to tag along with us?

746
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:11,463
Or do you still want to sleep at the pavillion?

747
00:57:11,455 --> 00:57:12,046
Ouch!….

748
00:57:12,709 --> 00:57:14,126
Watch your mouth. We’re at the temple.

749
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:16,389
Watch my mouth?

750
00:57:51,223 --> 00:57:51,920
Tharn

751
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:55,509
I have to thank you though.

752
00:57:57,886 --> 00:57:59,566
If you hadn’t saved me on that day,

753
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:03,155
I would have been dead.

754
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,823
It was a good thing.

755
00:58:10,492 --> 00:58:12,126
That I got drowned?

756
00:58:13,132 --> 00:58:14,983
If I hadn’t saved your life back then,

757
00:58:15,646 --> 00:58:17,543
we wouldn’t have met like this.

758
00:58:20,149 --> 00:58:22,549
Are you trying to hit on me?

759
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:25,532
Let’s go.

760
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:27,269
I’ll take you to some other places.

761
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:30,412
Where?

762
00:58:40,415 --> 00:58:44,935
[Wat PhraThat Bung Puan]
Nong Khai Province

763
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:48,335
(Fun music)

764
00:58:48,777 --> 00:58:49,497
Let's go

765
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:58,815
(Fun music)

766
00:59:39,095 --> 00:59:40,549
[Wat Tham Din Phiang]
Nong Khai Province

767
00:59:40,545 --> 00:59:43,692
I think there are numerous photographs of me.
Take pictures of the Buddha there.

768
00:59:44,275 --> 00:59:45,063
Here we are.

769
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:46,720
We got here

770
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:48,526
The Dinphiang Cave (aka Srimongkol Cave).

771
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,875
The local people believe that this is the path where the Naga’s daughter has to pass through.

772
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:57,315
One day, she fell in love with the human prince.

773
00:59:57,315 --> 00:59:59,292
But on the End of Buddhist Lent Day,

774
00:59:59,285 --> 01:00:01,680
She must go back to the Naga city.

775
01:00:01,695 --> 01:00:04,686
However, the prince had secretly followed her back.

776
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:08,709
And finally found out that the woman he loved was a Naga.

777
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,252
The prince couldn’t bare with this truth.

778
01:00:10,435 --> 01:00:12,515
So, he decided to leave her forever.

779
01:00:12,515 --> 01:00:17,015

Phaya

781
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:22,423
This is where the people here believe to be the coffin of Indra Naga or the King of Naga.

782
01:00:22,925 --> 01:00:26,035
It is the coffin of Pu Innakarat.

783
01:00:33,295 --> 01:00:34,240
They believe that these poles help support the city of Naga.

784
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:38,469
They were the pillars of the Thousand Halls that sustained the undersea city.

785
01:00:44,252 --> 01:00:45,175
They look amazing.

786
01:00:47,817 --> 01:00:48,815
Incredible.

787
01:00:51,257 --> 01:00:52,675
There’s more. Let’s go.

788
01:00:52,885 --> 01:00:54,126
- Is there anything else?
- There is more to come.

789
01:01:00,103 --> 01:01:01,520
Do you like it?

790
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:02,549
Incredible.

791
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:05,200
Any more places like this?

792
01:01:06,492 --> 01:01:07,383
You want to see more?

793
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:09,863
Wait.

794
01:01:11,932 --> 01:01:12,595
What is it?

795
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,949
If you want to freshen up, have it with this.

796
01:01:21,189 --> 01:01:21,955
Thanks.

797
01:01:22,183 --> 01:01:23,806
I’m going to find something to eat. So hungry right now.

798
01:01:36,915 --> 01:01:38,389
Try this and you’ll feel fresh.

799
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,852
Do you think I can drink it now?

800
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,155
Yeah.

801
01:01:55,806 --> 01:01:56,663
Ah, so fresh.

802
01:01:56,655 --> 01:01:58,320
Here, try it.

803
01:01:59,326 --> 01:02:01,212
Why would you put the cap on?

804
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,229
By the way,

805
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:06,343
I had a bad dream again last night.

806
01:02:08,355 --> 01:02:09,657
Again?

807
01:02:09,675 --> 01:02:10,423
Yeah.

808
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:14,103
What was it like?

809
01:02:14,812 --> 01:02:20,595
Same old story. But this time, you were there in my dream too.

810
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,229
Are you saying it was because of me

811
01:02:24,343 --> 01:02:25,417
that you had a bad dream?

812
01:02:26,652 --> 01:02:30,972
Of course, not. Forget it. Let’s go then.

813
01:02:32,297 --> 01:02:33,383
Where to, next?

814
01:02:34,815 --> 01:02:38,695
Wat Hai Sok (Nongkai province)

815
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:09,532
Wow, is this your house?

816
01:03:09,783 --> 01:03:12,595
It looks really classy.

817
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:16,012
I thought you said you grew up with the Abbot at the temple.

818
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:19,029
This is my grandma’s place.

819
01:03:19,372 --> 01:03:21,383
I often come to visit her.

820
01:03:22,195 --> 01:03:27,175
Why didn’t you stay here then? The house is big. Why did you have to trouble the Abbot?

821
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:31,417
I have my own reason which I don’t have to tell you.

822
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:37,943
- But if you keep pesterting, I’d say you’re being rude.
- He means you’re nosy.

823
01:03:37,935 --> 01:03:40,366
Guys,

824
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:43,246
please watch your mouth. We’re at his grandma’s place

825
01:03:43,245 --> 01:03:44,137
Not your own home.

826
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:47,932
Like you’d let me talk like that in my own home.

827
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:50,995
You knew that too? But you hardly do what I ask you to do though.

828
01:03:51,257 --> 01:03:51,886
Sorry

829
01:03:51,885 --> 01:03:55,695
Welcome home. You’ve arrived in time for dinner.

830
01:03:55,715 --> 01:03:57,772
I’ve prepared a feast for all of you.

831
01:03:58,295 --> 01:03:59,829
Hello, grandma.

832
01:03:59,825 --> 01:04:01,657
Hello.

833
01:04:02,057 --> 01:04:03,760
I miss you so much.

834
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,669
Really?

835
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,749
I’m sorry I didn’t call you that often.

836
01:04:10,085 --> 01:04:13,269
The instructors at the camp was very strict about us using our phones.

837
01:04:13,855 --> 01:04:14,766
So, I....

838
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,212
completely forgot about me?

839
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:20,755
Grandma.

840
01:04:20,755 --> 01:04:24,320
He was right. It was very strict there.

841
01:04:24,335 --> 01:04:27,212
I could hardly find a time to call my girlfriend.

842
01:04:27,225 --> 01:04:29,132
Because I had to call my mistress no.1,

843
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:31,189
no.2 and then no.3 first.

844
01:04:31,185 --> 01:04:32,183
By the time I had to call Sand,

845
01:04:32,175 --> 01:04:34,172
my break time was over.

846
01:04:34,926 --> 01:04:36,137
Is that so? You rascal.

847
01:04:36,135 --> 01:04:38,400
Ouch!

848
01:04:40,229 --> 01:04:42,160
Didn’t you just tell us to watch our mouths while we are here?

849
01:04:42,686 --> 01:04:44,720
How dare you cursed in front of her like that.

850
01:04:44,972 --> 01:04:47,040
You’re a bad girl.

851
01:04:47,035 --> 01:04:48,252
Look at him, grandma.

852
01:04:48,366 --> 01:04:50,297
Why didn’t you say anything to defend me?

853
01:04:50,295 --> 01:04:51,749
Why should I?

854
01:04:51,886 --> 01:04:55,966
I was actually going to ask her to do it on another side too.

855
01:04:55,965 --> 01:04:57,052
- Another side?
- You got it.

856
01:04:57,045 --> 01:04:57,715
On this side.

857
01:04:57,715 --> 01:05:00,595
Hold on. She was just kidding.

858
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:01,886
She really meant it.

859
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:07,006
Is this your new friend?

860
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:10,069
Why does he look so familiar?

861
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,240
Hello, grandma.

862
01:05:13,235 --> 01:05:16,480
I’m the boy who almost got drowned, the one that Tharn had rescused on that day.

863
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:18,857
Huh?

864
01:05:20,515 --> 01:05:24,057
Oh my goodness. It’s really you.

865
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:27,825
I wouldn’t be able to recognise you if you hadn’t told me so.

866
01:05:27,825 --> 01:05:29,680
It’s such a coincidence.

867
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,863
that we finally meet again after that day.

868
01:05:32,423 --> 01:05:34,069
After over a decade,

869
01:05:34,217 --> 01:05:36,697
we finally met again at the training camp.

870
01:05:38,766 --> 01:05:39,589
Yes,

871
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:42,880
what a coincidence. Fascinating indeed.

872
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:46,949
Are you all right, grandma?

873
01:05:47,715 --> 01:05:49,086
I’m okay.

874
01:05:50,172 --> 01:05:51,840
Welcome, all of you.

875
01:05:53,932 --> 01:05:54,629
Let’s go inside.

876
01:05:54,846 --> 01:05:56,625
You all must be famished.

877
01:05:57,166 --> 01:06:00,320
Let’s eat while the food is still hot.

878
01:06:01,035 --> 01:06:02,480
Let’s go then.

879
01:06:02,475 --> 01:06:03,349
Let’s go.

880
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:07,840
Darling, that area where you pinched me hurts.

881
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:25,760
French people do this to say hi and goodbye.

882
01:06:25,755 --> 01:06:26,857
Can I go to sleep now?

The Sign

885
01:06:47,065 --> 01:06:49,305
So, what are you and Phaya?

886
01:06:51,065 --> 01:06:52,505
What do you mean?

887
01:06:53,979 --> 01:06:59,305
I can tell, you know? Your eyes just say it all.

888
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,996
We’re just colleagues.

889
01:07:03,499 --> 01:07:06,368
- Hmm, colleagues? / - Yeah.

890
01:07:06,594 --> 01:07:11,225
But Yai told me that while you were at the camp,

891
01:07:11,842 --> 01:07:14,356
you were quite worried about Phaya.

892
01:07:14,574 --> 01:07:16,299
That you cared about him a lot.

893
01:07:16,596 --> 01:07:19,351
Probably a lot more than friends do.

894
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:24,265
Haven’t I told you...

895
01:07:25,214 --> 01:07:26,802
that I don’t want to feel hurt like that anymore?

896
01:07:27,654 --> 01:07:31,934
Why? Is it because he’s a guy?

897
01:07:32,284 --> 01:07:34,825
Look at me and Yai.

01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:39,214
I don’t give a damn on what other people say about us.

899
01:07:39,614 --> 01:07:45,671
So, no matter how crazy or how annoying he is...

900
01:07:46,334 --> 01:07:47,739
I still love him.

901
01:07:51,111 --> 01:07:53,248
It’s not what you think.

902
01:07:54,344 --> 01:08:00,584
Be honest. If you like him, just admit it.

903
01:08:00,699 --> 01:08:03,088
Just tell him how you actually feel.

904
01:08:03,339 --> 01:08:07,234
Why do you have to complicate things?

905
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:08,459
Just be a man and say it.

906
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:18,074
I don’t want to put those around me in danger.

907
01:08:19,494 --> 01:08:23,374
Geez, you should stop blaming yourself.

908
01:08:25,648 --> 01:08:27,644
Your parents’ death was an accident.

909
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,556
It wasn’t because of you.

910
01:08:30,544 --> 01:08:35,259
If what you said is true, Yai and I both love you like our own brother...

911
01:08:35,274 --> 01:08:37,305
but we’re still safe and sound.

912
01:08:39,774 --> 01:08:42,094
It would only happen to the one I love.

913
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:46,619
It has always been like that.

914
01:08:47,814 --> 01:08:49,796
I don’t want it to happen again.

915
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:54,334
I think you’re being paranoid.

916
01:08:55,979 --> 01:09:02,684
I think you should forget all those bad things that happened to you and enjoy the present moment.

917
01:09:03,796 --> 01:09:04,574
Got it?

918
01:09:07,074 --> 01:09:08,699
I don’t know.

919
01:09:11,088 --> 01:09:12,894
Since I met Phaya again,

920
01:09:13,968 --> 01:09:17,374
I stared to see things.

921
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:23,408
It’s a vision or a sign about something that will occur in the future.

922
01:09:24,184 --> 01:09:28,688
As if I’m supposed to know when he’s in danger.

923
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:32,162
- So that I can... / - Can what?

924
01:09:34,756 --> 01:09:35,991
So that I can protect him.

925
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:40,834
Geez, that sounds like you’ve been cursed.

926
01:09:44,231 --> 01:09:46,688
That’s what I thought so.

927
01:09:53,654 --> 01:09:57,019
Someone wants me to see those visions...

928
01:09:57,991 --> 01:09:59,579
for some unexplainable reasons.

929
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:21,554
Come on, drink up. Stop thinking too much about it.

930
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:32,734
- Are you serious?
- P'Yai

931
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:40,939
Please protect your son.

932
01:10:41,659 --> 01:10:44,002
Don’t let anything bad happen to both of them.

933
01:10:45,088 --> 01:10:47,354
Don’t let what the Abbot has predicted come true.

934
01:11:16,196 --> 01:11:18,802
Hey, are you still up?

935
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:25,122
A new hut is easier to live than an old castle.

936
01:11:27,434 --> 01:11:30,734
It’s actually ‘a happy hut is better than a gloomy castle.’

937
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:37,374
I was just kidding. I’m thinking about something.

938
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:40,596
About what?

939
01:11:43,494 --> 01:11:48,734
I came here because I wanted to find out more about the Naga.

940
01:11:49,488 --> 01:11:50,916
Whether it’s true or not.

941
01:11:52,094 --> 01:11:57,034
About those legends I read from the books, or even about the Naga fireballs.

942
01:11:59,874 --> 01:12:02,996
Do what you believe. Believe in what you do.
(A famous saying from the movie, ‘Mekhong Full Moon Party’)

943
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:10,054
I watched that movie for so many times.

944
01:12:10,608 --> 01:12:12,596
And other movies about the Naga too.

945
01:12:14,014 --> 01:12:15,865
The more I kept watching them...

946
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:20,874
the more I started to feel familiar with those stories.

947
01:12:22,844 --> 01:12:24,002
It’s really weird.

948
01:12:24,265 --> 01:12:25,808
I even dreamt about it too.

949
01:12:26,962 --> 01:12:29,099
And drew that picture in your diary.

950
01:12:29,534 --> 01:12:31,914
And believed that I were that girl you drew, right?

951
01:12:32,694 --> 01:12:42,224
It’s not like that. I just feel something every time I get near you.

952
01:12:45,384 --> 01:12:49,099
You mean, as if we’ve met long before we did at the traning camp?

953
01:12:51,682 --> 01:12:54,594
Long before you had saved my life when I was drowning.

954
01:12:56,196 --> 01:13:03,644
I feel as if we have met long before that.

955
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:09,796
Did you use this kind of story to hit on the girls in France?

956
01:13:11,785 --> 01:13:13,099
Merci Beaucoup. (Thank you in French)

957
01:13:13,545 --> 01:13:15,625
I didn’t use it with every girl that I try to hit on.

958
01:13:15,888 --> 01:13:18,274
I only use it with someone that I really like.

959
01:13:18,882 --> 01:13:19,934
And that someone is you.

960
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:24,814
You evil jellyfish.

961
01:13:25,248 --> 01:13:26,516
Go get some sleep.

962
01:13:37,694 --> 01:13:40,985
French people do this to say hi and goodbye.

963
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,474
I got it. Can I go to sleep now?

964
01:13:59,534 --> 01:14:02,848
And this is called a ‘goodnight kiss’.

965
01:14:06,505 --> 01:14:07,431
I’m off to bed.

966
01:14:09,019 --> 01:14:10,105
(Yawning)

967
01:15:18,699 --> 01:15:19,968
(Phone buzzing)

968
01:15:20,631 --> 01:15:21,964
(Phone buzzing)

969
01:15:22,734 --> 01:15:23,705
(Phone buzzing)

970
01:15:37,034 --> 01:15:39,154
(On phone screen)
Evil Jellyfish

971
01:15:43,434 --> 01:15:45,945
If you love him, just let him know.

972
01:15:46,044 --> 01:15:48,368
Tell him how you feel.

973
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:55,254
I don’t want those around me to be in danger.

974
01:15:56,642 --> 01:16:00,551
Geez, stop blaming yourself.

975
01:16:46,504 --> 01:16:50,196
Hey, I gave you a call so many times after we came back from Nong kai,

976
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:51,922
why didn’t  you answer them?

977
01:16:53,636 --> 01:16:55,191
Nothing serious.

978
01:16:57,065 --> 01:16:58,128
Just too lazy to take the call.

979
01:17:01,682 --> 01:17:03,362
Are you avoiding me?

980
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,431
Why would I do that?

981
01:17:12,802 --> 01:17:13,922
What the fuck?

982
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:17,328
Hang on.

983
01:17:22,654 --> 01:17:23,922
Why are you blocking my way?

984
01:17:25,168 --> 01:17:26,391
Do you want to get hurt?

985
01:17:29,514 --> 01:17:31,854
Yes, I want to get hurt.

986
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:33,554
I want to get hurt so badly.

987
01:17:34,231 --> 01:17:37,474
So, can you tell me now why you’re avoiding me?

988
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:40,859
I’m not avoiding you.

989
01:17:42,756 --> 01:17:43,625
Fine.

990
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:45,774
Let’s do this.

991
01:17:48,939 --> 01:17:50,928
Let’s have a match. If I win,

992
01:17:52,871 --> 01:17:57,154
you must admit that you’re avoiding me.

993
01:18:01,008 --> 01:18:04,754
- Okay? / - Do you really think you can beat me?

994
01:18:08,345 --> 01:18:09,434
Do you want to try?

995
01:18:11,305 --> 01:18:12,374
I’m going to kick your ass.

996
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:24,231
- Ready? / - Bring it on.

997
01:19:00,162 --> 01:19:00,882
How does it feel?

998
01:19:25,404 --> 01:19:27,042
- Let me go!
- Do you give in now?

999
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:28,425
I won.

1000
01:19:29,202 --> 01:19:30,482
- One... / - Let me go!

1001
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:32,985
- Get off me! / - Two...

1002
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:34,505
Three...

1003
01:19:35,488 --> 01:19:36,174
Four...

1004
01:19:36,882 --> 01:19:37,674
Five...

1005
01:19:38,345 --> 01:19:40,054
Six, Seven...

1006
01:19:40,054 --> 01:19:42,322
- Eight, Nine...
- Okay, you won!

1007
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:43,156
you won!

1008
01:19:47,488 --> 01:19:48,368
You lost.

1009
01:19:49,194 --> 01:19:51,419
So, next time when I give you a call...

1010
01:19:51,796 --> 01:19:53,716
you have to answer it. Okay?

1011
01:19:54,871 --> 01:19:55,922
Bolster.

1012
01:19:57,394 --> 01:19:59,434
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1013
01:20:02,688 --> 01:20:04,288
You’re a good boy.

1014
01:20:19,888 --> 01:20:22,082
You’ll meet the leader of Unit 1 today.

1015
01:20:22,322 --> 01:20:24,905
This person will supervise the investigations under your team.

1016
01:20:26,802 --> 01:20:28,894
Is it a he or a she?

1017
01:20:29,545 --> 01:20:33,264
This morning, I saw that the leader of Unit 3...

1018
01:20:33,654 --> 01:20:36,345
is a woman.  She looks so cool.

1019
01:20:37,088 --> 01:20:38,939
You guys are considered very lucky.

1020
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:40,619
Because your team leader is very experienced.

1021
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:42,562
Never failed to arrest the criminals in every case.

1022
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:45,568
Is that why we are Unit 1?

1023
01:20:46,391 --> 01:20:50,274
Yes. There he is, your team leader.

1024
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,391
Attention!

1025
01:21:11,774 --> 01:21:12,608
Inspector.

1026
01:21:15,842 --> 01:21:17,408
Nice to meet you all.

1027
01:21:18,322 --> 01:21:22,734
I’m Police Major Akkanee Assawawaisoon, your team leader.

1028
01:21:23,556 --> 01:21:27,088
Shit, we’re so doomed.

1029
01:21:27,814 --> 01:21:33,214
You didn’t mention anything about being our team leader when we parted, Captain. I mean Inspector.

1030
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:40,214
If I had mentioned it earlier, I wouldn’t have been able to find out whether you’d be true to your words about your determination...

1031
01:21:40,391 --> 01:21:43,054
when you told me on the last day of the training.

1032
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:51,522
I can still remember it word by word.

1033
01:21:54,294 --> 01:21:56,025
What did I say to him?

1034
01:21:57,514 --> 01:21:59,579
You gave him an earful.

1035
01:21:59,574 --> 01:22:01,419
Shit.

1036
01:22:01,556 --> 01:22:04,288
Please keep in mind...

1037
01:22:04,494 --> 01:22:05,922
that this is a real workplace.

1038
01:22:06,334 --> 01:22:07,671
You’re no longer at the traning camp.

1039
01:22:08,779 --> 01:22:10,996
I only have three simple rules if we’re going to work together.

1040
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:14,688
First is teamwork.

1041
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:17,442
There’ll be no solo investigation.

1042
01:22:17,434 --> 01:22:19,179
Or doing anything without permission or approval from others.

1043
01:22:20,745 --> 01:22:25,234
Second, the supervisor’s order is considered final...

1044
01:22:25,864 --> 01:22:28,414
and cannot be challenged or disobeyed.

1045
01:22:28,848 --> 01:22:30,139
Those who do will get kicked out of the team immediately.

1046
01:22:31,602 --> 01:22:37,824
Third, never mix business with your peronsal affairs.

1047
01:22:39,328 --> 01:22:41,728
Every time that you are out on an investigation...

1048
01:22:42,711 --> 01:22:44,734
there must be no mistake.

1049
01:22:45,014 --> 01:22:46,859
Just one false step and that would mean...

1050
01:22:46,854 --> 01:22:50,014
you’re throwing away justice and the truth of the case.

1051
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:53,408
- Got it? / - Hooya!

1052
01:22:54,304 --> 01:22:56,322
No need to say ‘Hooya’. This is not a training camp.

1053
01:22:57,511 --> 01:23:00,025
I hope we’d be able to work together for a long time.

1054
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:03,716
And that no one would get kicked out soon.

1055
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,179
Shit. What did I say to him back then?

1056
01:23:15,819 --> 01:23:17,328
You were giving him an earful.

1057
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,094
- Geez, Yai.
- You too.

1058
01:23:20,482 --> 01:23:22,494
I can’t remember what I said to him.

1059
01:23:23,522 --> 01:23:24,494
But I’m so happy.

1060
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:26,802
Happy my foot.

1061
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:28,791
I’m so dead.

1062
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:33,876
- Put all the information on the screen. / - Yes, sir.

1063
01:23:34,494 --> 01:23:35,156
Come in.

1064
01:23:35,968 --> 01:23:40,391
- Please take a seat. / - Yes, sir.

1065
01:23:57,351 --> 01:24:01,442
Inspector, the information you’ve asked for is ready.

1066
01:24:02,994 --> 01:24:03,751
Give it to the team.

1067
01:24:06,242 --> 01:24:09,408
This is Lieutenant Singh. He’s one of our team.

1068
01:24:09,682 --> 01:24:11,259
He’d help support you on the IT part.

1069
01:24:11,554 --> 01:24:12,619
Hello.

1070
01:24:12,802 --> 01:24:14,471
I’m Lieut Singh, the IT officer.

1071
01:24:14,745 --> 01:24:15,739
Pleased to work with you.

1072
01:24:16,299 --> 01:24:18,368
That one is Wit.

1073
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,574
He’s the forensic officer.

1074
01:24:30,276 --> 01:24:31,705
This is your first case.

1075
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:35,042
The rapist murder.

1076
01:24:39,168 --> 01:24:41,419
I heard about his case whileI was at the camp.

1077
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:43,659
Both victims were charged with rape.

1078
01:24:43,654 --> 01:24:45,728
Their bodies were shot and hung up by the necks.

1079
01:24:45,724 --> 01:24:47,168
Their genitals were also cut off.

1080
01:24:47,164 --> 01:24:48,139
That’s what I heard.

1081
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:53,008
That’s right. Now, we have the third victim.

1082
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:57,728
The first victim was a 45-year-old male. The name is Ohm.

1083
01:24:58,002 --> 01:25:00,231
He was beaten up and his tongue got cut off.

1084
01:25:00,224 --> 01:25:02,505
We found evidence of torturing with candles. His genital was cut off.

1085
01:25:02,504 --> 01:25:05,874
He was charged with raping his stepchild and was released less than 2 weeks before he got killed.

1086
01:25:07,254 --> 01:25:08,871
The next victim...

1087
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:11,705
is Chin, a 30-year-old male.

1088
01:25:11,724 --> 01:25:13,534
Similar condition to the first victim.

1089
01:25:13,564 --> 01:25:17,088
This one was charged with harrassing a woman who dressed up sexily.

1090
01:25:17,294 --> 01:25:19,876
The investigation was still on going but he got killed first.

1091
01:25:20,059 --> 01:25:22,154
The third victim’s body was found yesterday.

1092
01:25:22,314 --> 01:25:25,191
A 55-year-old male. The name is Korn.

1093
01:25:25,184 --> 01:25:28,874
His charge for sexually assault was dismissed because there wasn’t a solid evidence.

1094
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,374
The cause of death was similar to that of the first two victims.

1095
01:25:32,714 --> 01:25:36,684
They all have the same cause of death.

1096
01:25:37,911 --> 01:25:40,794
Is this a serial murder case then?

1097
01:25:41,734 --> 01:25:45,694
But the police still couldn’t find the genitals that were cut off.

1098
01:25:45,694 --> 01:25:48,699
So, they decided to forward this case to us for further investigation.

1099
01:25:48,694 --> 01:25:50,219
In hope that we could have this case closed as soon as possible.

1100
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,814
The time limit is within one week.

1101
01:25:53,984 --> 01:25:55,899
We don’t want to alarm the citizens about this case.

1102
01:25:56,379 --> 01:25:58,754
Inspector.

1103
01:25:59,804 --> 01:26:02,482
The police spent months investigating on this case and they still couldn’t close it.

1104
01:26:03,144 --> 01:26:06,059
Will we be able to do it just within one week?

1105
01:26:06,654 --> 01:26:08,082
We still have no idea who the killer is.

1106
01:26:08,074 --> 01:26:09,648
The killer just turned himself in this morning...

1107
01:26:09,842 --> 01:26:11,934
and already confessed to everything.

1108
01:26:12,094 --> 01:26:15,362
Oh, so the killer is caught.

1109
01:26:15,556 --> 01:26:17,408
Why bother giving us this case?

1110
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:23,042
There are three of them who turned themselves in.

1111
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:25,888
Each claimed that they were the killer.

1112
01:26:27,454 --> 01:26:29,202
But that they didn’t do it intentionally.

1113
01:26:30,314 --> 01:26:31,842
They were forced to kill.

1114
01:26:51,674 --> 01:26:54,594
idolfactory

1115
01:26:55,014 --> 01:26:57,922
Why don’t you go back home and sleep on your bed? Wouldn’t it feel more comfy?

1116
01:26:57,934 --> 01:26:59,568
I want to sleep on the same bed with you.

1117
01:27:00,436 --> 01:27:01,636
Or do you not like that?

1118
01:27:02,304 --> 01:27:05,202
Be careful, boy. The person you have wronged in the past is coming after you.

1119
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:12,714
They are somewhere close to you.  Don’t let them take him away from you.

1120
01:27:17,556 --> 01:27:18,242
Stop!

1121
01:27:39,094 --> 01:27:46,714
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

1122
01:27:46,714 --> 01:27:54,219
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

01:27:54,214 --> 01:28:02,688

🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

1125

🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

1126
01:28:20,444 --> 01:28:25,088
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

1127
01:28:25,084 --> 01:28:28,014
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵
