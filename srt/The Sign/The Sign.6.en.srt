He is Rin’s boyfriend,

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,325
Narong’s sister who committed suicide.

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,537
Stop!

5
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:11,940
The laws that you respect and look up to...

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,760
can never keep those bastards behind bars for long.

7
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,330
Songyod is arrested.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,874
I tried to ask Narong about the thing that happened in the cellar today.

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,085
It seems he had no idea what was happening to him.

10
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:25,900
Is there anyone who can tell us about what we saw?

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,937
You should know where you stand and better stay by his side as a big brother.

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,411
I’ll try to keep that in mind.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,365
Until your time is done.

14
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:37,988

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,702
We finally meet again.

32
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,748
Who are you?

33
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,108
Why are you always in my dream?

34
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:23,565
Don’t you remember me?

35
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:27,817
Use your heart instead of your eyes.

36
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:31,234
And you’ll finally see.

37
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:15,965
Phaya.

38
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,005
Phaya, are you okay?

39
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:22,914
I’ve been calling for ages.

40
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:25,120
Grandma said dinner is ready.

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,474
If you don’t want her to get even more upset, you better hurry up and come down.

42
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:32,411
Okay, I’ll be right behind you.

43
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,900
Tharn.

44
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:50,994
Yes?

45
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:53,234
Where are you?

46
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:57,771
Swimming at my condo.

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,600
With whom?

48
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,045
Khem and Thongthai. Yai is on the way.

49
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:08,651
What’s the matter?

50
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,200
I had a bad dream about you so I was just worried.

51
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:16,457
Don’t worry. I can take care of myself.

52
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:18,811
But I’m really worried this time.

53
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:22,331
Maybe you should take some days off for a while.

54
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:25,108
Think of it as a rehab for your injury.

55
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:27,748
You can get back to work once you’re fully recovered.

56
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,131
Are you saying that I should tell the Inspector...

57
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:33,640
that I need to take leave because of your bad dream?

58
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:35,337
Are you nuts?

59
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,691
Tharn.

60
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:40,980
This is not different from when I doubted about your vision.

61
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,868
But right now I won’t deny what you are seeing.

62
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:47,531
Yes, it might be just a dream.

63
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:52,708
But the fact that I keep dreaming about it again and again...

64
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:55,314
and you are always in those dreams,

65
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,708
don’t you think it’s actually the same as your vision?

66
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:03,360
You don’t need to worry about me.

67
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:07,748
I’ll take a good care of myself, okay?

68
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:09,657
Bye.

69
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:11,828
Wait. Tharn! Tharn!

70
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,994
Hey, where are you going?
Grandma will bite your head off if you leave now.

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,040
I have something urgent to take care of.

72
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,971
Hang on. You’re acting weird.

73
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,051
Is it about someone? Who is it?

74
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:55,988
Just a friend.

75
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:59,417
- My colleague.
- Hmmmm

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,571
He probably needs my help with his work.

77
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:05,977
Are you sure he’s just a friend?

78
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:09,622
Why do you have to rush out like this? Why can’t you just give him a call?

79
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:14,982
I already did but he didn’t pick up.

80
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,171
- Why are you being so nosy, cheeky monkey?
- Ouch!

81
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,440
I’m leaving.

82
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:45,691
Hello, Phaya.

83
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,600
And this is...

84
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,485
This is Nee, my little sister. Do you remember her?

85
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,200
I see...

86
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:09,577
I haven’t seen you for a while. You’ve grown into a beauty.

87
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:13,428
Hello, Dao.

88
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,177
Oh, you’re here? That was quick.

89
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,336
Hello, Grandma.

90
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:48,068
I can’t believe someone like Phaya...

91
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,891
would be so superstitious about his bad dream like this.

92
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,057
Hey, are you and Phaya together?

93
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:58,548
What?

94
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,022
Of course, not.

95
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
Well, he seems to worry about you a lot.

96
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:07,725
Probably a lot more than just a colleague would do.

97
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:12,068
He was having a bad dream about you and it worries him to death.

98
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,142
I’m sure the power of love he has for you is very immense, my bro.

99
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:21,017
Shut up, you jerk.

100
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:24,530
Listen.

101
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,571
Phaya and I are just colleagues. That’s it.

102
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,570
If you don’t like him that way...

103
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,834
why do you always have to protect him?

104
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,194
You even took the stab for him.

105
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,782
Before you’d say anyting,

106
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,828
I want to use your heart rather than your head.

107
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,690
Awww….

108
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,165
Stop. I already told you guys and we are just friends.

109
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,765
- Swear?	 /    - Would you swear?

110
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:53,360
- Go on. Swear it.
- Would you swear?

111
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,125
What?

112
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,302
I’d rather not.

113
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,788
What if Phaya likes you then? What would you say?

114
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:03,988
Yeah, what would you do?

115
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,537
Will you give him a chance?

116
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,325
Come on, say it.

117
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:11,417
I think you’re imagining things.

118
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:17,051
The way Phaya behaves when he’s around you…

119
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:19,417
I used to be like that too.

120
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:22,937
Geez, what’s wrong with you?

121
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,537
For Baby and I,

122
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:28,331
our relationship also started from me always caring for him.

123
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,862
Geez, stop it. It wasn’t an act of caring at all.

124
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,022
It actually started with a chaos.

125
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,491
The first time I saw you,

126
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,554
I almost wanted to quit the university.

127
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,377
What happened?

128
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,788
Tell us then. I really want to know.

129
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:49,500
Well, our relationship began to bloom...

130
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,982
on the day when our young hearts were still yearning for love.

131
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,297
With my bicep muscle under the warm sunlight.

132
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,588
It was the beauty of my young and muscular body…

133
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,954
that made him fallen for me.

134
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,760
You have a pose as well.

135
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,085
Can you get to the point now? I’m listening.

136
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:21,177
Well, it all started like this…

137
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,220
[A university in the north]

138
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,060
[2009]

139
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,977
(Screaming)

140
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,474
(Screaming)

141
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:31,131
Definitely me.

142
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,428
Shit!

143
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,691
Is there anyone?

144
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,691
Hey, are you done? Do you need a hand?

145
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:40,274
Wow, they look cute on you.

146
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:49,520
I’ll wash them and return them to you later.

147
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,342
No worry. I’ll take care of your wet clothes too.

148
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,834
Think of it as my apology.

149
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:57,931
I’m leaving then.

150
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,531
Hey, wait.

151
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:01,531
I have a question.

152
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,628
Do you believe infinity?

153
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:06,994
What?

154
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:12,708
Infinity. Isn’t that what you call something like fate?

155
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:13,725
You know?

156
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:17,394
That’s ‘Destiny’.

157
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:18,331
Huh?

158
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:19,520
Look at my lips.

159
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,085
- Des...   /   - Des...

160
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,377
- Ti...   /   - Ti...

161
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,840
- Ny.   /   - Ny.

162
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:26,125
- Destiny.
- Tishni.

163
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:28,125
No. DESTINY.

164
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,188
Tishni

165
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,834
Stop it.

166
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,188
Then what does that sentence I just said mean?

167
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,108
How can you not know the meaning of what you said?

168
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:43,257
It means whether or not you believe that destiny exists.

169
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:45,337
I see.

170
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:49,714
Actually, I know what it means.
I just want you to ask me the same thing too

171
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:51,554
But if you ask me, I do.

172
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:56,811
Because it was my bicep muscle under the warm sunlight…

173
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,662
and the beauty of my young and muscular body,
that have brought us together.

174
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,091
Wow, that sounds so romantic. I’m so good at it.

175
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:06,148
Well done to myself.

176
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:08,502
Don’t you find it romantic?

177
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,370
Please excuse me.

178
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,274
- See you.   /   - Bye.

179
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:26,971
Oh, wow.

180
00:14:27,428 --> 00:14:29,988
Romantic , wasn’t it?

181
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:31,805
So cheeky.

182
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,542
I thought I was watching ‘Secret Crush On You The Series’.

183
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:37,897
You two seem to get off on the wrong foot.

184
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,805
How come you ended up dating each other?

185
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:43,165
Well, after that day...

186
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,931
I kept following him to offer my sincere apology.

187
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,674
But the more time I spent with him,
the more I started to have feelings for him.

188
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:54,617
So I decided to go after him.

189
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,651
Hi, baby.

190
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,000
Are you...?

191
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,508
Yes. I mean you, baby.

192
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,160
Here you go.

193
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:17,040
I already washed them. They smell so nice.

194
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:19,340
If you don’t believe me, then I’ll show you.

195
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,062
You idiot! That’s my underpants. Why did you smell it?

196
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,605
What is it?

197
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,257
Your clothes. Please take them back.

198
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,914
I’d be going then.

199
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:38,765
Wait.

200
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,651
Let’s find something to eat. It’s on me.

201
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,154
When will you stop bothering me?

202
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,051
How can I do that? We’re not even together yet.

203
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,828
I’m sorry but I don’t like men.

204
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:58,331
Why don’t you go after those junior girls who admire you?

205
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:01,017
Hey, wait.

206
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,011
I just want to know you as a friend.

207
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,634
I already sent you an invitation. Will you accept it?

208
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,462
If not, you’d be so rude though.

209
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:16,034
Judging from your look,

210
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:18,605
you seem to be quite educated.

211
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,720
So, I guess you won’t be so rude to me.

212
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,377
Do you really want to get to know me that much?

213
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:26,937
Why don’t you give me a chance to get to know you?

214
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,902
Maybe, if you do...

215
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:33,440
and we have some time to get to know each other,

216
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:36,320
you and I might turn out to be a perfect match.

217
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:38,068
As friends, I mean.

218
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:43,497
Or maybe when we get to know each other more,

219
00:16:44,182 --> 00:16:46,925
you might fall head over heels for me.

220
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:50,914
Why are you being so persistent?

221
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:54,708
Because I am Khem.

222
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,657
I’m Thongthai.

223
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:01,542
Woo-hoo!

224
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:03,760
What are you doing?

225
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,342
I don’t like wasting time. Can we skip some steps?

226
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,217
We’re now close.

227
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:10,580
Let’s go find something to eat.

228
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:21,420
Tonight, I’m going to make you get to know me even more.

229
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,050
Every part of me.

230
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:33,771
Okay. But let me warn you that my standard is pretty high.

231
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,780
If it turns out to be below my standard, you have to leave me alone.

232
00:17:41,188 --> 00:17:42,411
Well, if you say so.

233
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,194
You got it.

234
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,490
How was it, baby? Sexy?

235
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,994
Respect, respect, respect.

236
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:45,622
So, you guys just skipped the talk and went straight to sex.

237
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:46,868
Why so hurry?

238
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:50,251
Well, if we’re going ot be in a relationship,

239
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:53,485
we’d have a lot more time to talk later on anyway.

240
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:55,954
I’d rather do that thing first.

241
00:18:56,342 --> 00:19:00,148
So that I’d know if we both are on the same page. I don’t want to waste time.

242
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:03,542
By the way,

243
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:06,160
I won’t mind if you’d also adopt my method.

244
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,217
You’ll find out right the way...

245
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,834
whether you two are made for each other or not.

246
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,320
I don’t need to do that.

247
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:21,660
Because I still insist that I don’t like Phaya that way.

248
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,737
Awww, he’s stubborn.

249
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,765
He just ran.

250
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:29,897
Or maybe he probably meant it, that he doesn’t really have feelings for Phaya.

251
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,857
He might already like someone else.

252
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:36,411
Is it me?

253
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:41,097
Obviously not.

254
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:42,228
That was hard.

255
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,817
Let’s brainstorm.

256
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,765
We hardly have any case to work on these days.

257
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:51,942
Yeah.

258
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,520
Let’s find some time and go on a trip together.

259
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:57,954
Maybe it would help Tharn and Phaya...

260
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,980
to get closer to each other when they are both naked.

261
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,502
Eat this! So that you can keep your mouth shut.

262
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,771
Geez! What the fuck!

263
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,325
Damn you.

264
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:12,788
Yai.

265
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,885
Has Tharn ever have a boyfriend or girlfriend before?

266
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:22,925
Yes, but that person was dead.

267
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:25,240
- Dead?   /   - Yes

268
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:31,900
So, he’s afraid. He doesn’t want to get hurt like that again.

269
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,994
What’s wrong with you, Miss Paranee?

270
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,777
Why are you so interested in Dao?

271
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:43,097
Don’t try to be a shipper.

272
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,251
I’m leaving.

273
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:45,860
You’re changing the subject.

275
00:20:57,942 --> 00:21:04,922
The Sign

276
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:12,541
These fruits are fresh from the market.

277
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,369
My aunt asked me to send her best regards to you.

278
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:15,215
Thank you.

279
00:21:15,923 --> 00:21:18,826
- That one is for Phaya.
- Thanks a lot.

280
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:21,752
Phaya is injured from work again.

281
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:24,335
So, my aunt told me to pay a visit as soon as I can.

282
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:27,832
It seems like you had already known beforehand that he’d be injured.

283
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:31,889
Well, that day when I went to see him at the unit,

284
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:34,598
I remember he was also injured from work.

285
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:40,815
I had a hunch that someone hot-tempered like him
would eventually get himself injured again.

286
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:44,243
Well, I’m fine now.

287
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:50,792
That’s why I didn’t tell you. I don’t want to bother you or anyone else.

288
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:54,849
Whether it’s a big or small injury, our parents will always be worried about us.

289
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:03,021
Grandma, I think we should ask him to quit being a cop.

290
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:07,123
He has just started working and look how often he got injured.

291
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:12,632
I’m afraid I won’t be able to stop him since it’s the job that he likes.

292
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:16,266
I don’t like to force anyone to do something against his will.

293
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:19,821
He’s free to do whatever he loves...

294
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:24,666
as long as it’s not so dangerous that he has to risk his life for it.

295
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,426
I totally agree with you.

296
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:31,535
You can do any job you like.

297
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:34,095
But you must also have a work-life balance.

298
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:40,769
Don’t devote yourself to work so much that you forget
to care about those around you, or someone close to you.

299
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:41,729
Do you agree?

300
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:49,009
If you really love your job as a police officer,
maybe you should find someone to take care of you.

301
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:52,381
So that he or she can look after you when you get injured again.

302
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:57,489
Well, he has both Grandma and I to look after him.

303
00:22:57,672 --> 00:22:59,181
So, you don’t have to worry about that.

304
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:03,969
Nee, listen to me.

305
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:07,821
You also need to live your own life.

306
00:23:08,312 --> 00:23:10,861
You can’t spend your whole life looking after your big brother.

307
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:14,506
Unless you don’t want to have anyone.

308
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:18,918
Please excuse me for being rude.

309
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:21,638
But I was wondering if you’re already taken?

310
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:25,683
Well...

311
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,323
Taken? A naughty girl like her?

312
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:29,946
Obviously, not.

313
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:31,981
Thank you so much for your concern about me though.

314
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:38,883
All right then. Let’s start eating. We’ve been chatting for quite some time.

315
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:40,049
Okay.

316
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:49,821
Eat this too, Grandma.

317
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,801
You should eat more so that you’d get better soon.

318
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:02,552
Thank you.

319
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,289
Thanks.

320
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:14,003
You should eat more too.

321
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:17,249
You probably didn’t get to eat Thai food that often when you were abroad.

322
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:21,443
Oh, but I actually did. I worked part-time at a Thai restuarant.

323
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:30,746
Grandma.

324
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:36,575
My aunt told me that you will also attend the art exhibition. Is that right?

325
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:41,866
Yes. Your aunt called and invited me by herself.

326
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:46,106
Will Phaya be there too?

327
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,781
My aunt said you’ll also take him with you.

328
00:24:48,975 --> 00:24:50,095
Ah, that’s right.

329
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:57,523
Can you please come with me? My friends really want to see you.

330
00:24:57,851 --> 00:25:01,123
You hardly go anywhere with me these days.

331
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:02,826
All you do is work.

332
00:25:03,638 --> 00:25:05,226
Well...I...

333
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:13,078
Of course, Grandma. I’ll go with you.

334
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:21,169
I’m also free.

335
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:24,049
Can I go too?

336
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:26,186
Of course.

337
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:53,443
Can’t he just at least send me a sticker?

338
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,209
(Door scratching)

339
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,306
(Door scratching)

340
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:31,432
Nee?

341
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:37,078
What’s the matter?

342
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:43,306
I bring you some fruits that Dao gave us.

343
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:47,809
Hmm, are you really my sister?

344
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,312
Why are you so kind today?

345
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:54,723
This is all you’d get to eat. The rest is mine.

346
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:58,335
Thanks a lot. Put it over there. I’ll eat them soon.

347
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:17,592
Aren’t you done? Go back to your room then.

348
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:20,632
I’m not in a hurry.

349
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:24,163
Your room looks so comfy today.

350
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:34,083
What?

351
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:35,158
Eat this first.

352
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:42,163
Eat it.

353
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:44,986
What is it?

354
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:46,191
I’ll get to the point then.

355
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:46,975
Okay.

356
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:52,323
How close were you and Dao when you two were studying abroad?

357
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:03,089
Grandma asked me to take care of her because she’s the favourite niece of her best friend. That’s all.

358
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:07,398
Have you and Dao ever been together?

359
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:11,683
You are quite a player. So, I think it’s possible.

360
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:14,175
- Geez, you monkey.   /    - Ouch.

361
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:15,672
That’s enough.

362
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:19,466
Just answer my question so that I can be at ease.

363
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:23,558
No, Dao and I are like brother and sister.

364
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:28,301
Okay, I feel better now.

365
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:35,763
What’s wrong with you, Miss Paranee?

366
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:38,358
Why are you so interested in Dao?

367
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:46,381
Well, she is beautiful and seems to know you well.

368
00:28:46,712 --> 00:28:49,398
Our Grandma seems to like her a lot too.

369
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:53,592
So, I just want to know more about her.

370
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:55,386
That’s all.

371
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,232
She and you would probably make a perfect couple though.

372
00:29:01,295 --> 00:29:02,963
I mean, consdisering all other factors.

373
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:07,078
She’s actually too good for someone like you.

374
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,449
But good enough for you, right?

375
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,061
What?

376
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:21,295
What?

377
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,946
Don’t try to be a shipper.

378
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,078
I’m leaving.

379
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:26,861
You’re changing the subject.

380
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:30,038
Namami. Where’s Namami?

381
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:32,163
Where’d he go?

382
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,781
Who’s this girl?

383
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:46,998
And this guy too.

384
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:51,546
Hmm, that girl is the one I often dream of.

385
00:29:51,901 --> 00:29:53,901
That guy is my colleague.

386
00:29:54,838 --> 00:30:01,672
Ahh, is he the one you were rushing out to see this evening?

387
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,141
Yeah.

388
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:08,952
I just feel that these two have something in common.

389
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:14,483
Huh? But this girl is just someone from your dream.

390
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:17,661
That’s right.

391
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:25,558
Hang on. Are you saying that you’re worried about your colleague whose name is Tharn?

392
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,552
So much that you try to relate him with a girl you often see in your dream?

393
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:32,792
Is this the answer you’ve always been looking for?

394
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:36,163
To find out who or what it is that you saw when you were drowning.

395
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,226
Nee.

396
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:47,158
Is your friend, Wi, still teaching at the Faculty of Archaeology?

397
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:52,952
The one you used to say she was cute?

398
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:54,403
Yeah.

399
00:30:55,306 --> 00:31:02,415
When we last talked, she said she would quit to open an art gallery.

400
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:04,141
Why?

401
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:24,146
Are you sure?

402
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:29,851
Yes, I am. My gallery has never bought or displayed this kind of art.

403
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,741
But I was told that it was sold here.

404
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:42,769
I’d still insist that my gallery has never bought that kind of art.

405
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:47,261
You can search the gallery if you want to.

406
00:31:48,632 --> 00:31:50,312
You’re not lying to me, aren’t you?

407
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,681
No, I’m not lying.

408
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:21,631
Hey.

409
00:32:22,992 --> 00:32:24,161
Phaya.

410
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:27,375
Wi.

411
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,112
How are you doing?

412
00:32:35,283 --> 00:32:36,323
I’m good.

413
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:38,321
Long time no see.

414
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:40,495
It’s been over a year, I think.

415
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:44,529
I’m sorry for a sudden visit. I also come empty-handed.

416
00:32:47,603 --> 00:32:52,129
By the way, that man looks very suspicious.

417
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:54,941
He’s looking for his artwork.

418
00:32:55,203 --> 00:32:57,832
He said his girlfriend sold it to my gallery.

419
00:32:58,358 --> 00:33:00,289
But I’ve never bought any artwork from his girlfriend.

420
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:04,266
This happens a lot in the art industry.

421
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,792
Stealing someone else’s works and sell them.

422
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:11,649
Some are rare antiques which the owners have no idea how valuable they are.

423
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:14,301
Those with a keen eye would buy them and resell at a much higher price.

424
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,501
When the owners of the work found out, they often came out to claim their rights of ownership.

425
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:21,089
But some of them are forged. They are fake ones.

426
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:25,123
You can hardly tell them apart from the original works though.

427
00:33:26,883 --> 00:33:30,415
It sounds quite complicated but I got it somehow.

428
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:33,683
There’s always a story hidden behind each artwork.

429
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:39,238
Each has its own unique value, method, and expertise...

430
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:42,986
depending on the artist who has created that piece of work.

431
00:33:42,998 --> 00:33:44,826
Those are what make the artwork valuable.

432
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:51,695
Is this why you decided to quit teaching at the university and open an art gallery instead?

433
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,163
Not really.

434
00:33:55,729 --> 00:34:00,072
Why do you come to see me? Is there anything I can help?

435
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:18,255
If it were told by someone else, I wouldn’t have believed a word.

436
00:34:19,146 --> 00:34:22,186
That all your dreams seem to be connected.

437
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:27,055
Do you have any idea now that you have seen my sketches?

438
00:34:29,843 --> 00:34:37,089
Archaeology is the study of human past through landscapes, architectures, and other material remain...

439
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:39,866
with traces of culture in the past.

440
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,249
These are, however, what you saw in your dreams.

441
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:46,483
I can’t believe they can be connected into a story like this.

442
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:53,941
But what about the legend about Naga or the fireballs
which you can see on every 15th night of the 11th waxing moon?

443
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:57,832
There are records and traces found that it actually happened, aren’t there?

444
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:03,603
But those are proves for a living creature which is not human being.

445
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:05,672
It’s just a legend told among the locals.

446
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:12,495
Even for the Garuda. There’s hardly any record on this half-human and half-bird creature.

447
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:16,609
Most are just stories found in the religious mythology…

448
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:20,255
which cannot be proofed whether it’s true or not.

449
00:35:20,971 --> 00:35:23,352
So, I’m afraid I can’t help you much with this.

450
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:25,821
I only say it from my point of view.

451
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:27,855
It might actually exist.

452
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:32,666
Like energy forces, souls, or miracles.

453
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:36,449
They are things that science can’t proof.

454
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,203
But there are stories told about them.

455
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:43,238
Someone had witnessed those things and record what they saw.

456
00:35:45,203 --> 00:35:49,146
Can you tell me where to find more information about it?

457
00:35:54,221 --> 00:36:01,821
There’s a corner in my gallery where I keep all the records on ancient history.

458
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:03,958
You can try looking in that room.

459
00:36:04,071 --> 00:36:08,552
You might find something useful there.

460
00:36:53,101 --> 00:37:02,941
(Mysterious Sound)

461
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:08,146
(The sound of bookshelves shaking)

462
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:46,312
Come with me.

463
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:47,489
Let me go.

464
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,232
What’s wrong with you?

465
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:54,481
Let’s go.

466
00:37:54,481 --> 00:38:01,441
The Sign
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

467
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:08,550
The Sign

468
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,839
King Garuda, why are you here?

469
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:46,886
Why did you help me?

470
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:49,519
You were still alive so I decided to help.

471
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:53,449
On the 15th day of the 11th month...

472
00:38:53,449 --> 00:39:01,711
all the Nagas and Naginis as well as their attendants will present their offerings and breathe out the fireballs as an act of worship.

473
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,179
Beautiful, isn’t it?

474
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:06,789
Yes.

475
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:09,479
So beautiful.

476
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:13,559
I can’t go with you.

477
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:15,819
I don’t want anyone to die because of me.

478
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:20,951
Master Sakunanoparuj, this way.

479
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,889
Phaya!

480
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,719
Phaya!

481
00:39:34,226 --> 00:39:35,403
Phaya!

482
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,786
What happened?

483
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:41,631
Ouch.

484
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:49,866
I was trying to get the book and the pile just tumbled down.

485
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:53,159
Are you all right?

486
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,111
Yeah.

487
00:39:58,877 --> 00:40:01,803
I ran here as soon as I heard the noise...

488
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:03,799
and saw you lying unconcious on the floor.

489
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:08,146
It took quite some time to wake you up. I was so worried.

490
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:13,209
I’m so sorry. Your room is a mess now.

491
00:40:13,863 --> 00:40:16,157
- Let me help you tidy up.
- It’s all right.

492
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:17,883
Ouch!

493
00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:28,229
(The Son of Naga City Governor)

494
00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:48,197
Wi, can I borrow this book for a while?

495
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:50,220
Sure.

496
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:52,254
Thank you.

497
00:41:06,939 --> 00:41:11,923
Oh, hello Doc. Why didn’t you tell me you’d be here today?

498
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:14,506
My patient just cancelled the appointment.

499
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:17,226
So, I’m thinking maybe we could go out for dinner.

500
00:41:17,729 --> 00:41:19,214
Do you want to join me?

501
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:25,849
Sure. Please come and wait in my room first.

502
00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:27,666
I’ll go get changed.

503
00:41:29,094 --> 00:41:29,723
Okay.

504
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:30,843
Please come in.

505
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:54,306
Where are you going?

506
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,837
He’s going to have dinner with me.

507
00:41:58,797 --> 00:41:59,871
Do you need anything?

508
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:03,551
I’m afraid he can’t go with you now.

509
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:04,991
Because he’s coming with me.

510
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:07,437
Come with me, Tharn.

511
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:09,677
Hang on.

512
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:12,923
Did I say I’d go with you?

513
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:15,254
But I have something important to talk to you.

514
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:20,340
You have no rights to force him.

515
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:23,711
This is outside of your working hours.

516
00:42:25,231 --> 00:42:27,666
My job is to take care of him.

517
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:30,180
But I don’t want to go with you.

518
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:39,266
Do you remember when I warned you that you might be in danger?

519
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:42,077
I told you to stay beside me so that I can protect you.

520
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,986
But I’m going with Doc. It’s not dangerous at all.

521
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:49,843
Tharn.

522
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:00,289
If you are really worried about him...

523
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:02,346
you’d better stay away from him.

524
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,849
The closer you get to him,

525
00:43:07,176 --> 00:43:09,003
the more danger he’d be in.

526
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,146
The one who actually puts him in danger...

527
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:16,237
is probably not me.

528
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:17,506
But I think it is.

529
00:43:19,504 --> 00:43:23,837
Since the day you met him, he has to risk his life to save you for so many times.

530
00:43:25,587 --> 00:43:28,054
If he were to die,

531
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:32,089
you’re most likely to be the cause of it.

532
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:33,414
What the fuck are you talking about?!

533
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:34,329
Ouch!!

534
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,500
Just because he thinks of you as his big brother...

535
00:43:41,047 --> 00:43:42,546
doesn’t mean that I’d be afraid of you.

536
00:43:43,906 --> 00:43:48,107
I don’t really give a fuck about anything!

537
00:43:48,435 --> 00:43:49,369
Phaya!

538
00:43:54,774 --> 00:43:56,614
You mark my words.

539
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:01,963
I will do everything to keep you two apart.

540
00:44:02,637 --> 00:44:04,397
I will take him away from you.

541
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:08,249
Even if he has to die.

542
00:44:09,655 --> 00:44:10,557
What the fuck!!

543
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:11,369
(Punching)

544
00:44:12,054 --> 00:44:13,413
Are you all right?

545
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,389
Tharn, come with me.

546
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:17,986
Come with me, Tharn.

547
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:19,094
Let me go!

548
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:19,997
(Punching)
Ouch!

549
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,934
What’s wrong with you?!

550
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:40,774
Let’s go.

551
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,203
Damn it!

552
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:07,151
I’m so sorry that he hurt you.

553
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:12,511
It’s okay. He’s probably very worried about you.

554
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:16,831
I don’t know what’s got into him.

555
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:19,551
But it makes me want to stay away from him from now on.

556
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:31,948
Your inspector wants me to find out more information on Lieutenant Tam’s case.

557
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:33,862
Okay

558
00:45:34,393 --> 00:45:37,342
Didn't you guys already know this?

559
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:44,429
The Sign
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

560
00:45:44,506 --> 00:45:51,486
The Sign

561
00:45:58,585 --> 00:46:01,196
This is the floor plan of the art exhibition at the BACC.

562
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:04,282
It’s for the mission that I’ve informed you earlier.

563
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:08,195
I need a volunteer for this mission.

564
00:46:08,195 --> 00:46:11,745
Our job is to protect the important people who would attend the event.

565
00:46:12,007 --> 00:46:13,687
This is a special mission.

566
00:46:13,893 --> 00:46:16,990
It’s not an order from the authority.

567
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,876
That’s why I’m looking for a volunteer.

568
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,927
Raise your hand if you want to volunteer.

569
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:30,350
Are you listening?

570
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:34,762
I asked if you were listening.

571
00:46:38,453 --> 00:46:40,705
He asked if you were listening to what he just said.

572
00:46:41,785 --> 00:46:44,773
I didn’t. But I was reading your lips.

573
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:48,922
You want some volunteers to work on a special mission which is not an order from the authority.

574
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:53,150
Their job is to protect the important people at the exhibition.

575
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:57,767
Those who want to volunteer please raise their hands.

576
00:46:58,355 --> 00:47:00,270
(Clapping)
Wow!

577
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:01,745
You’re like a bugging device.

578
00:47:03,893 --> 00:47:06,590
Then I’ll assume everyone already understood what the mission is.

579
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:09,150
Give me the name list once it’s done.

580
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,259
I want to do it.

581
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:23,573
I don’t think it’d be just a simple bodyguard job.

582
00:47:24,727 --> 00:47:26,099
I agree.

583
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:28,293
It’s very strange.

584
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:31,596
Our unit has never taken any job like this before.

585
00:47:32,065 --> 00:47:33,276
I’m sure there must be something behind this.

586
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:40,065
We are not allowed to reveal our identity as an IDF officer too.

587
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:43,493
It’s going to be so interesting.

588
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:47,687
You get to dress up nicely.

589
00:47:48,693 --> 00:47:50,407
And work at a nice building.

590
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:54,865
After work, I will keep the suit on and take Sand to dinner at...

591
00:47:54,865 --> 00:47:55,733
the food stall in the gas station.

592
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:57,733
Yeah. And order a spicy minced pork salad with lots of blood.

593
00:47:57,725 --> 00:48:00,670
Geez, you eat it yourself then. You got me carried away.

594
00:48:00,685 --> 00:48:02,727
You seem to be in a lovey dovey mode.

595
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:03,962
Obviously.

596
00:48:04,405 --> 00:48:06,042
- Are you in then?
- Of course.

597
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:09,025
- Singh, are you in?
- Yeah.

598
00:48:11,253 --> 00:48:15,642
- If my babe is going then I’ll go too.
- (Sigh)

599
00:48:18,705 --> 00:48:21,505
Are you going, Mayris?

600
00:48:23,215 --> 00:48:28,699
No, Inspector probably wants me to find out more information on the Lieutenant Tam’s case.

601
00:48:29,687 --> 00:48:30,556
Okay.

602
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,876
Lieut Tam’s case?

603
00:48:34,316 --> 00:48:36,487
I thought the authority has ordered to have this case closed.

604
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:41,927
They have.

605
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,322
But the Inspector wants us keep investigating.

606
00:48:45,335 --> 00:48:51,756
Because Lieut Tam’s body might lead us to the major drug trafficking network backed up by politicians.

607
00:48:52,085 --> 00:48:54,922
Lieut Tam died in the line of duty.

608
00:48:56,485 --> 00:48:57,173
Huh?

609
00:48:57,585 --> 00:48:59,459
You guys didn’t know about this?

610
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:04,339
Ahh, you came later.

611
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:08,773
Apart from being a coach at our unit,

612
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:12,053
Lieut Tam also had another important job in our IDF unit.

613
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,379
He was one of the best spies we’ve ever had.

614
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:18,293
And he was also the Inspector’s right-hand man.

615
00:49:18,285 --> 00:49:22,430
His mission was to track down the international drug trafficking network...

616
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:27,162
of which Minister Montree is believed to be the man behind it.

617
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:32,350
Songyod is also one of his minions.

618
00:49:32,705 --> 00:49:35,790
He’s actually the Minister’s hand and foot.

619
00:49:36,522 --> 00:49:39,116
Then why can’t we just go question Songyod and force him to tell us...

620
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:43,459
information that could help destroy Minister Montree’s network?

621
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:46,750
Our IDF unit’s main job is to investigate.

622
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,430
The execution of judgement…

623
00:49:48,425 --> 00:49:52,099
or determination of punishment is the authority’s job.

624
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:55,870
- Which we cannot...
- We cannot cross the line, right?

625
00:49:56,922 --> 00:50:00,065
Just like many cases in the past that were treated unfairly.

626
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:05,276
Yeah, including your the case about your parents too.

627
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:11,813
It’s a way to force us to go forward…

628
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:15,127
but with a rope around our neck.

629
00:50:15,276 --> 00:50:17,710
They only allow us to walk in the direction that they are approved of.

630
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,813
Fake freedom, you mean?

631
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:23,470
Well then, I won’t be joining you guys this time.

632
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:26,373
I have a more important job to do.

633
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:34,670
(Sigh)

634
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,516
I’m in.

635
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:40,487
Then go and ask Phaya too.

636
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,933
I think he probably wants to join us too.

637
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,333
You go and ask him yourself.

638
00:50:47,802 --> 00:50:49,722
Yai.

639
00:50:52,065 --> 00:50:53,699
When did they quarrel?

640
00:50:53,695 --> 00:50:55,070
Was it at his condo?

641
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:57,139
Do you really want to know?

642
00:50:57,425 --> 00:50:59,475
It’s my job to know about other people’s businesses.

643
00:50:59,475 --> 00:51:01,790
Then you go and ask him. I don’t want to mention it.

644
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:06,785
Geez! You two are the same.

645
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:08,910
I’ll ask baby then.

646
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:10,487
Baby, Tharn and…

647
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:14,225
Stop. You’re bothering me. Go away.

648
00:51:19,585 --> 00:51:21,459
- That’s a lot.
- Yeah.

649
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,099
Inspector never disappoints us. His special mission is so cool.

650
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:34,015
I don’t want to hold a gun tonight.

651
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,122
I’d rather hold her instead. Oops!

652
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:40,007
If you don’t want to spend a night in a coffin, you’d better quit playing around.

653
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:42,019
- Baby.
- Good luck.

654
00:51:44,933 --> 00:51:46,579
- I’ll go check on the other side.
- Okay.

655
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:51,836
If you are mad at him, you should clear it up with him when he comes to work tomorrow.

656
00:51:52,053 --> 00:51:53,390
I don’t have anything to say to him.

657
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:56,682
Nothing to say? But your face already said it all.

658
00:51:56,933 --> 00:51:59,219
He did that because he was worried about you.

659
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:01,539
Hey, Yai. Tharn.

660
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,219
You guys are here too?

661
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,885
Phaya? What on earth are you doing here?

662
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,436
I’m a guest.

663
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:12,922
This is my grandmother and my little sister.

664
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:15,299
- Hello.    /   - Hello.

665
00:52:16,205 --> 00:52:20,225
Inspector has asked our team to help taking care of the security at the event.

666
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,845
Excuse me? Are you Tharn?

667
00:52:27,105 --> 00:52:29,882
It’s been a long time since we last met. Do you still remember me?

668
00:52:29,895 --> 00:52:31,242
Of course, I do.

669
00:52:31,255 --> 00:52:37,047
Phaya only told me that he met a friend who saved his life when he was a kid.

670
00:52:37,065 --> 00:52:41,470
I didn’t know that you also work at the same unit. The world is round indeed.

671
00:52:42,155 --> 00:52:44,785
Well, it might not be because the world is round...

672
00:52:44,922 --> 00:52:48,876
but rather a destiny that brought these two together.

673
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,522
Ouch.

674
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:53,505
- Um...   /   - Ouch.

675
00:52:55,325 --> 00:52:59,459
I can remember your face but not your name.

676
00:52:59,465 --> 00:53:02,179
- This is Yai, Grandma.
- You’re...

677
00:53:02,185 --> 00:53:05,605
- Yes.
- Another kid at the temple who also saved me that day.

678
00:53:05,805 --> 00:53:11,676
Oh, I see. Now that all of you live in Bangkok, we should see each other more often.

679
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:15,139
Please come to my place for a meal whenever you’re free.

680
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:19,985
I’d like to treat you both to a meal as a thank you for saving my grandson.

681
00:53:20,682 --> 00:53:21,985
Thank you very much, Grandma.

682
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:24,979
I’m afraid we have to get back to work now.

683
00:53:25,162 --> 00:53:27,516
Go on, dear.

684
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:29,070
- Goodbye.   /   - Goodbye.

685
00:53:29,065 --> 00:53:29,962
See you.

686
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:37,093
- Grandma, please wait here for a second. I’ll be right back.
- Okay.

687
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:45,059
Tharn.

688
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:48,762
Can we talk?

689
00:53:51,225 --> 00:53:52,670
You guys talk then.

690
00:53:53,493 --> 00:53:54,819
You can do it!

691
00:53:56,979 --> 00:53:57,916
What is it?

692
00:53:59,882 --> 00:54:02,042
Well, about that night...

693
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:05,425
I’m sorry.

694
00:54:06,979 --> 00:54:10,030
The one you should apologise to is him not me.

695
00:54:10,453 --> 00:54:11,859
But the one I care about is you.

696
00:54:11,855 --> 00:54:13,470
Why do you have to mention him?

697
00:54:13,653 --> 00:54:14,835
Phaya.

698
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,887
When did you arrive?

699
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,379
My aunt is looking for you.

700
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:23,242
Where are Grandma and Nee?

701
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:27,013
Is this your colleague?

702
00:54:27,493 --> 00:54:29,413
- Hello.   /   - Hello.

703
00:54:31,195 --> 00:54:32,510
- I’ll go then.    /   - Hey.

704
00:54:34,053 --> 00:54:34,750
Tharn!

705
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:38,465
Grandma and Nee are over there.

706
00:54:38,465 --> 00:54:39,825
Please excuse me. I’ll go talk to my colleague first.

707
00:54:45,402 --> 00:54:46,305
Tharn.

708
00:54:48,213 --> 00:54:51,047
Doc? You’re here too?

709
00:54:52,076 --> 00:54:53,219
I got invited.

710
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:58,750
It’s an exhibition displaying artworks which reflect on the human’s state of mind.

711
00:54:59,105 --> 00:55:03,215
- Let’s go inside then.
- Okay.

712
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,996
Whom is Phaya talking to?

713
00:55:17,516 --> 00:55:20,053
Is that the girl who came to see him at the unit?

714
00:55:26,385 --> 00:55:27,573
Doctor Chalothorn.

715
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:29,356
Yes?

716
00:55:29,355 --> 00:55:31,447
Someone wants to see you over there.

717
00:55:32,293 --> 00:55:33,127
Okay.

718
00:55:34,636 --> 00:55:37,607
I’m leaving then. I’ll call you after the event.

719
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:39,425
Okay.

720
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:41,105
This way, please.

721
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:49,287
Probably just a friend.

722
00:55:50,499 --> 00:55:52,202
He’s still single, isn’t he?

723
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:56,762
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

724
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,750
Hmm, are you sure?

725
00:56:03,036 --> 00:56:04,693
Look at your face first.

726
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,099
Your face and eyes just say it all.

727
00:56:08,453 --> 00:56:09,745
Tell me honestly,

728
00:56:10,419 --> 00:56:12,602
why would you resist your own feelings?

729
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:14,305
Love is love.

730
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:20,865
I want to see you happy again, Tharn.

731
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:25,025
I want to see you smile like you used to.

732
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:30,693
If you’re afraid that loving him would put him in danger,

733
00:56:31,093 --> 00:56:34,015
I’ll also help you protect him.

734
00:56:37,676 --> 00:56:38,922
No need.

735
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:44,693
I’ll do it because I want to see my brother happy.

736
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:46,750
Got it?

737
00:57:10,925 --> 00:57:14,510
Don’t forget to remind the others to keep an eye on the artworks too.

738
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:15,779
(Something drops)

739
00:57:16,362 --> 00:57:17,310
I’m sorry.

740
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,847
It's OK.

741
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:54,339
What a pleasure to meet you again, Inspector.

742
00:57:54,745 --> 00:57:56,247
Hello, Mr. Montree.

743
00:57:56,865 --> 00:58:00,105
Have we met before? You look so familiar.

744
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:02,967
Let me remind you again that your job today...

745
00:58:02,985 --> 00:58:06,853
is to protect the safety of important guests who attend the event.

746
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:11,465
Arghhhh!!!

747
00:58:12,005 --> 00:58:15,779
Love doesn’t exist. They are all lies.

748
00:58:16,105 --> 00:58:20,739
You must pay for what you did.

749
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:43,230
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

750
00:58:43,225 --> 00:58:50,670
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

751
00:58:50,665 --> 00:58:59,059
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

752
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:09,205
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

753
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:16,922
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

754
00:59:16,915 --> 00:59:21,379
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

755
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:24,522
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

756
00:59:24,515 --> 00:59:31,973
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

757
00:59:31,973 --> 00:59:36,205
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

758
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:44,125
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵

759
