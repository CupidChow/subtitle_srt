00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,650
But I kept dreaming about the same thing...

2
00:00:02,651 --> 00:00:04,500
and you were always there in those dreams.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,108
Don’t you think it’s the same as when you have your vision?

4
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:08,640
Do you remember what I told you earlier?

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,148
That you are in danger.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,514
That’s why I want you to stay by my side so that I can protect you.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,900
But it’s Doc that I’m going with.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,068
I will take him away from you if even he has to die.

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,360
What the fuck are you saying?!

10
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:20,720
Let me go!

11
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:24,820
Are you going to the art exhibition too?

12
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:25,690
Yes.

13
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,222
Please go to the exhibition with me.

14
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:28,560
Yes, Grandma.

You don’t have to do this.

I want you...

to cherish the feeling we have for each other...

40

42

I put my soul into my work.

00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:10,617
I am your art.

I belong to you.

Please promise me.

Even when everything changes,

never change the way you look at me.

Never forget the time we have spent together.

Why did you do this to me?

72
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,302
- Why?
- Because I love you.

73

Inspector, the VIP guest will arrive in less than an hour.

91
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,438
Tharn and Yai, go back to your position.

92
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:34,330
Yes, sir.

93
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:41,490
Tharn, I think you should stop looking for that man.

94
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:44,158
What else can you do when you’ve found him?

95
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:48,272
Are you going to tell him that you saw a vision that he is the culprit...

96
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,404
and then arrest him?

97
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,450
I’m not going to arrest him.

98
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:55,107
I just want to ask him something so that he might come to his sense.

99
00:11:56,935 --> 00:11:58,855
Can’t you just let it go?

100
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:01,952
But we are a police officer, Yai.

101
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:04,135
Are you going to let innocent people get hurt or die?

102
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:07,130
But I can’t let you die either.

103
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,564
How many times have you risked your life to save the others because of your vision?

104
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,672
Just do your best and let it be.

105
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,027
Don’t you remember what the Abbot told us?

106
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,512
That sometimes you have to let the karma does its work.

107
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,484
I can’t do that.

108
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:30,181
Now that I know what’s going to happen, I have to help him.

109
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,661
What about the VIP guest? You agreed to take this job...

110
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,501
because you want to see him, didn’t you?

111
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:41,450
Think about it and choose wisely, Tharn.

112
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:00,364
Who are you looking for?

113
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,232
Oh, just my friend.

114
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:06,090
Hmm, a friend?

115
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:12,490
Oh, is that Wi? We’re here!

116
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:18,935
I haven’t seen you for ages. I thought you already disappeared.

117
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:23,084
- Good evening, Grandma.
- Good evening.

118
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,078
How are you doing?

119
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:28,512
I’m doing well. I haven’t seen you for so long. You hardly come visit me.

120
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,112
I just open my art gallery so I’m a little busy.

121
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,895
Hello, Phaya.

122
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,741
Hello.

123
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:38,627
And this is...

124
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:43,872
Oh, her name is Dujdao. She’s my junior friend when I studied in France.

125
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:49,690
Hello, I’m Dao. You must be Wi. He often told me about you.

126
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:51,690
Really? What did he tell you?

127
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:54,364
She’s my friend too.

128
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,718
You can ask me if you want to know anything about her.

129
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,055
I know a lot more than he does.

130
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,507
I’ll tell you later then.

131
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:05,152
Hold on. Before you’re going to disclose my personal info, have you asked for my permission?

132
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:10,032
Serve you right, cheeky monkey.

133
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:16,067
Grandma, please help. They are ganging up on me.

134
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,438
I also agree with them.

135
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,552
Awwww

136
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,964
Why is everyone ganging up on me?

137
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:26,387
Wait, is that Phaya?

138
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,970
Why is he here?

139
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:30,455
I don’t know.

140
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,747
Is she the girl who came to see him at our unit?

141
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,341
But who’s the other girl?

142
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:39,015
No idea too.

143
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,598
Maybe she’s also his friend.

144
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,710
I don’t think so. As a relationship guru,
I’m sure both of them are not his friends.

145
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,838
One is probably his girlfriend. The other must be his fling.

146
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,501
Let’s get to work.

147
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:04,100
Please excuse me,
I have to get ready for the exhibition. It’s going to start soon.

148
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,010
- See you later then.
- Okay

149
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,890
See you.

150
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,358
Tell everyone to get ready in their position.

151
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,364
Yes, Inspector.

152
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,324
The VIP guest is going to arrive in 10 minutes.

153
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,170
Yes, sir.

154
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,181
Tharn, stay focus. Don’t try to do something silly, okay?

155
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:36,592
Don’t worry. If I could, I would’ve already done it..

156
00:15:37,507 --> 00:15:40,295
I know better than to mix work with personal matters.

157
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:11,838
I never thought the Commisioner would send you to take care of me.

158
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:15,000
How I’m glad to meet you again, Inspector.

159
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:17,998
I’m sure we’ll meet again more often.

160
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:22,390
My condolences to you and your team, Inspector.

161
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,592
For losing your favourite assistant.

162
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,021
I’m really sorry that our country has lost another decent man.

163
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:29,701
He died in the line of duty.

164
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:34,330
I pray for all of them to rest in peace.

165
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:39,541
They all lost their lives to serve the law.

166
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:43,667
I also hope the law would be powerful enough to punish those who have done wrong.

167
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:52,695
Yes. I too hope their sacrifices wouldn’t be a waste.

168
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:57,564
Please excuse me, Inspector.

169
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:58,330
Okay.

170
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:05,484
Good evening, Mr. Montree.

171
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:13,232
Have we ever met before? You look very familiar.

172
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:17,010
Probably my father. He was also a police officer.

173
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:19,198
You probably met my fathre before.

174
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,112
Hmm, a police officer?

175
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:29,358
He was an inspector. He and my mother died...

176
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,735
after being framed in a car accident 10 years ago.

177
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:41,872
Ladies and gentlemen, please come inside. The exhibition is about to start in 5 minutes.

00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:49,244
Well then, if you need any help, please let me know.

179
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:04,192
Hey, didnt I tell you to calm down?

180
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:11,800
Tharn, can I have a word with you?

181
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,050
Yes, sir.

182
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,152
What is it, Inspector?

183
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:26,558
Let me remind you again that our job today...

184
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:30,844
is to protect the safety of the VIP guests.

185
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:32,364
Yes, sir.

186
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:37,312
I just didn’t expect that the VIP guests also include the Minister.

187
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,878
Inspector knows, right? The story behind Mr. Montree and the drug trade.

188
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,267
Our job requires us to strictly follow the rules and code of conduct.

189
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:47,210
He attends this event as a guest.

190
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,821
Or have you found any evidence which points out that he is the suspect in this event?

191
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:53,918
No, sir.

192
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:55,998
Then just do your job.

193
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:57,370
Yes, sir.

194
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,267
Phaya, where are you going? The exhibhition is about to start.

195
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:36,592
Where are you going?

196
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:38,341
Are you going to see your colleague?

197
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:42,352
But today you’re here as a guest.

198
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:44,410
Let them do their job.

199
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:48,078
She’s right. The most important moment of the exhibition is about to start too.

200
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,130
I heard that this is going to be the last solo exhibition of the artist.

201
00:19:53,164 --> 00:19:54,432
Really?

202
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:59,770
That’s a pity. This is going to be the last solo exhibition of Mr. Art Phakin too.

203
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,270
No, that’s too evil.

204
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:30,192
Ouch!

205
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,630
(Crying)

206
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:43,187
That man.

207
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:45,552
Are you sure you don’t have it?

208
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:51,404
Yes. I’m sure. My gallery has never purchased any of your artwork.

209
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:17,278
Love has a great way to find you.

210
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:21,495
It might push lovers...

211
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:25,118
to walk on a different path.

212
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:29,810
But with undenying faith,

213
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:34,950
love...

214
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,747
will always bring us together.

215
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:45,758
(Screaming)

216
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:57,670
Bounded by...

217
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,690
destiny...

218
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:10,055
and burning flames of passion and yearning for each other.

219
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,060
Love Eternity.

220
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:23,004
Written by Paulo Coelho, a Brazillian writer.

221
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:10,261
(Applause)

222
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:25,427
Tharn, can we talk?

223
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,061
I don’t have anything to talk to you.

224
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,570
Can you stop sulking and be a grown-up?

225
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,930
Me? Sulking?

226
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,470
Fine, I’m wrong.	I’m an idiot.

00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:45,533
The Sign

229
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,650
Thank you for coming

230
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:00,998
Can I please have an autograph?

231
00:25:00,993 --> 00:25:01,810
Sure

232
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:03,970
Here you go.

233
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,655
Thank you

234
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:08,987
Thank you for coming

235
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:16,998
Finally, I get to meet you, Mr. Art.

236
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:20,278
Mr. Montree.

237
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:31,741
(Pushing someone off)

238
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:36,393
(Crying in pain)
Arghhh!

239
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:46,324
(Pushing someone off)

240
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:48,027
- Kao!   /   - Get out!

241
00:25:48,023 --> 00:25:48,873
Kao! Where are you?!

242
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:49,661
Ouch!

243
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:52,507
What did you do to him? Where did you take him?!

244
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:53,753
What the heck are you talking about?

245
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:55,090
Where did you take Kao?

246
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,073
I don’t know.

247
00:25:56,813 --> 00:25:58,453
(Crying)
Liar!

248
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:01,433
Stop fooling yourself that he’s yours.

249
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:04,073
He’s going to marry me

250
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:05,970
Stop fooling yourself!

251
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,615
Fooling myself?

252
00:26:08,255 --> 00:26:09,341
Fooling myself?

253
00:26:09,787 --> 00:26:11,695
How dare you said that to me?
Who is it?

254
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:14,393
Who is it that’s actually fooling other people?!

255
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:18,495
Kao told me he went to see you that night.

256
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:22,175
He went to tell you that he was going to marry me

257
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:24,233
We’re going to build a family together.

258
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:26,964
(Crying)

259
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:30,541
(Crying)
I’m begging you. Can you please leave us alone?

260
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,690
Can you get out of my life?

261
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:34,290
What about my life?!

262
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:37,913
My life that you both have already ruined!

263
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:40,815
Who will pay for it?!

264
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:43,673
You will? What’s wrong with you?

265
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:46,301
Do you think you’re the only one who is hurt?

266
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:51,393
I want it too, a happy life and a family with the one I love.

267
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:52,941
I want it too!

268
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,027
Go look for your boyfriend somewhere else.

269
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,723
He’s not with me anymore

270
00:26:58,461 --> 00:27:00,735
To me, a guy named Kao…

271
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:02,255
is already dead

272
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:05,490
- Ouch!!
- What did you do to him?!

273
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:06,713
Ouch!! Stop!!

274
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:08,278
- Stop!
- What did you do?!

275
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:12,781
I’m sorry

276
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:17,810
- Did you kill him?!
- Calm down.

277
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:20,027
- Get off me!
- Stop!

278
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,301
Tell me!

279
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:57,913
Turn right and go straight for the exit.

280
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:04,564
All is clear here.

281
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:06,758
Okay.

282
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:10,815
Can’t believe something like that would happen. So scary

283
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:14,084
Let’s not talk about it. The elders might worry about us.

284
00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:15,547
Okay.

285
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:18,267
Every time when I saw Kao and Art together,

286
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,347
I could tell that Kao really loved Art.

287
00:28:20,343 --> 00:28:23,147
I never knew he already has a girlfriend. How could he do this to Art?

288
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:24,701
(Sigh)

289
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,518
Girls, you go and take Grandma back home first.

290
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,901
I have to stay behind to help my colleagues.

291
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:31,558
Phaya

292
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:35,204
Grandma, please go home first. Don’t worry about me.

293
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,238
I think you should go with her

294
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:38,975
I’ll take care of it here

295
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:41,638
But then I’d worry about you

296
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:43,135
I’d rather stay

297
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,181
Then please take a good care of yourself. I’m worried.

298
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:50,130
Please take care of him fo rme, Tharn.

299
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:51,250
Yes, Grandma

300
00:28:52,324 --> 00:28:54,038
Come, let’s take her back home.

301
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:55,963
- Grandma
- I’ll see you back home, Grandma

302
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:13,135
I already wrote down the names and contact numbers of all the guests

303
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:14,964
Mr. Art has already been taken to our unit.

304
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:16,781
Miss Ning’s wound has already been attended to.

305
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:17,798
Okay.

306
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:19,718
Miss Ning’s wound has already been attended to.

307
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,507
He said he’d only agree to give us an interview if we go to his place.

308
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,570
Khem, you and Tongthai go interview him at his place tomorrow.

309
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:28,975
Yes, sir.

310
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:31,581
Can I go with them too?

311
00:29:31,573 --> 00:29:32,370
No.

312
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,295
You and Yai have to come back here to gather evidence tomorrow.

313
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,398
And try to find more evidence at Art’s house too.

314
00:29:40,187 --> 00:29:41,558
Why do you want us to go to Art’s place?

315
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:45,101
I suspect that he might have something to do with Kao’s disappearance

316
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:46,621
I’ll go with him

317
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:49,707
Why don’t you just go home?

318
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:51,844
I’d like to be put on this case too.

319
00:29:58,838 --> 00:29:59,764
Inspector

320
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:03,444
it seems like Mr. Art is losing his mind right now.

321
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:06,964
Let's go.

322
00:30:08,027 --> 00:30:08,895
- Get off me!   /  - Stop!

323
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:10,495
Get off me!

324
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:11,650
- Get off me!   /   - Stop!

325
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,621
- Let me go!   /    - Stop!

326
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:15,650
- Get off me!   /   - Stop!

327
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:19,318
- No!   /    - Stop!

328
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:20,210
- No!   /    - Please calm down.

329
00:30:22,713 --> 00:30:24,941
No!!

330
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:27,055
Let me go!

331
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:29,238
Ouch!

332
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:31,570
Ouch!

333
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,101
Ouch!

334
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:34,518
Please let me help

335
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,707
The situation is in chaos right now

336
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,490
Better let us handle it

337
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,758
He used to be my patient

338
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:45,135
Please let me talk to him

339
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,004
Arghhh!. Ouch!

340
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,198
Mr. Art, please look at me

341
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:30,187
Everything that happened today...

342
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:34,095
you didn’t mean to make it happen

343
00:31:35,318 --> 00:31:40,370
No, no. I didn’t

344
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:43,753
- You didn’t mean it
- No, I didn’t

345
00:31:43,973 --> 00:31:45,478
- That’s right    /     - No.

346
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,918
Please calm down and look at me, Mr. Art.

347
00:31:51,947 --> 00:31:53,547
You did not mean it.

348
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:56,450
I was just an accident

349
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:01,798
(Crying)

350
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,581
Ouch!

351
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:08,484
(Crying)

352
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:11,341
It’s all right now, Mr. Art

353
00:32:11,353 --> 00:32:13,193
(Crying)

354
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:16,313
Don’t be afraid

355
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:19,078
I will be right next to you

356
00:32:19,073 --> 00:32:19,970
I’m sorry

357
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:22,233
No one is going to hurt you

358
00:32:22,313 --> 00:32:23,238
I’m sorry

359
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:24,724
I promise

360
00:32:26,893 --> 00:32:28,013
Please calm down

361
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,213
Calm down

362
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:32,747
Take him

363
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:54,838
Mr. Art used to come see me for a Hysteria treatment

364
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:59,078
He tried to involve art as a tool in line for his medical treatment

365
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:02,415
In the end, he informed us that...

366
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,307
he wanted to stop the treatment with us and tried to cure the sickness by himself.

367
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:13,707
Being sick is not an excuse to be exempted from a punishment

368
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:20,667
No mental patient would ever want to tell everyone about their mental sickness.

369
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:25,010
I think the reason he’s experiencing this disorder again...

370
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,701
is probably becauase he was aroused by something.

371
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:32,518
So much that he could hardly control himself.

372
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,147
You used to experience something like that too, didn’t you?

373
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,210
Being unable to control yourself

374
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,033
But in your case,

375
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:43,958
I’m afraid it might not be because of the sickness.

376
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:47,003
It’s more likely because of your traits...

377
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,084
and personality

378
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:53,547
Phaya.

379
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:01,250
Thank you so much for your kind assistance, Doctor.

380
00:34:02,393 --> 00:34:03,853
My pleasure, Inspector.

381
00:34:04,347 --> 00:34:06,324
Please let me know if there’s anything I can do

382
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:07,113
That’d be all.

383
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,718
I’m leaving then, Tharn

384
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:15,341
Okay

385
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:42,987
Tharn

386
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:44,301
Tharn

387
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,335
Can we talk?

388
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:48,781
What is it?

389
00:34:48,773 --> 00:34:50,530
I called you so many times. Why didn’t you answer your phone?

390
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:51,798
I don’t have anything to talk to you

391
00:34:51,821 --> 00:34:52,655
Hey, wait.

392
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,530
Can you stop sulking and act like a grown-up?

393
00:34:56,523 --> 00:34:57,947
Me? Sulking?

394
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:02,061
Fine. I’m sorry

395
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,924
I’m wrong. I’m an idiot

396
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:05,763
I’m sorry

397
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,490
Suit yourself

398
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:10,358
Listen to me

399
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:13,490
I’m like this because I’m too worried about you

400
00:35:14,107 --> 00:35:17,043
I don’t know how to say it. Something makes me feel that...

401
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:20,210
you are going to leave me, Tharn

402
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,587
I just don’t feel good about it

403
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:26,655
I keep having more bad dreams

404
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,227
Hearing voices from the girl who looks so much like you.

405
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:31,273
And all those things that the Abbot used to tell us.

406
00:35:31,935 --> 00:35:33,707
All those things make me feel that...

407
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:37,353
you and I have been bonded for a very long time

408
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:40,895
Now that something bad is about to happen to you

409
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:43,547
I have to do something otherwise I’d lose you

410
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:44,427
And I can’t bear to lose you, Tharn

411
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:45,353
Calm down

412
00:35:45,387 --> 00:35:46,404
Hey, calm down

413
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:50,747
It’s going to be all right

414
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:53,867
Easy there

415
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:57,090
You’re losing control of yourself

416
00:35:59,261 --> 00:36:00,763
Just tell me you forgive me

417
00:36:01,147 --> 00:36:03,113
And all these symptoms would probably go away

418
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,143
Please forgive me

419
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:10,243
Yeah. Let’s get to work

420
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:19,293
(Sigh)

421
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,787
This is Mr. Art’s patient record

422
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:33,398
per your request, Inspector.

423
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:35,284
Thank you

424
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:39,478
He has an anger management problem

425
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,381
He cannot deal with anxiety

426
00:36:43,295 --> 00:36:46,815
And also has a problem in controlling his behaviours...

427
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:48,813
unlike normal people like us

428
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:58,027
So, what is the cause of this illness?

429
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,353
It depends, Inspector

430
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:05,010
Hysteria is caused...

431
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:08,073
mainly when patients feel that they are being neglected

432
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,621
The feeling might start to form since when they were still very young

433
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:14,358
Or when they have experienced a big disappointment

434
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,833
It can also occur due to the genetic problem

435
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,495
Or a lack of care and attention when they were being raised up

436
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:23,455
Patients with Hysteria tend to demand more love

437
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,763
and attention from people around them than usual

438
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:26,653
I see

439
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,124
Well,

440
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,970
the reason I’ve asked you to come here today...

441
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:33,924
is because I’m going to interrogate Mr. Art

442
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:37,318
I’d like you to help observe his behavior

443
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,135
during the interrogation

444
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:41,033
To observe his mental condition

445
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:43,773
Whether he’s able to be interrogated

446
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:47,890
Or whether he has any unusal behaviour during the interrogation.

447
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:49,673
That’d be my pleasure, Inspector

448
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:50,598
Thank you

449
00:37:54,883 --> 00:38:00,015
Inspector, Mr. Montree urgently flew out of the country. He won’t be back for our interview until next week

450
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,878
From what I’ve investigated,

451
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:06,107
it looks like Mr. Montree has bought a lot of Mr. Art work...

452
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:08,461
and also sent them abroad

453
00:38:08,781 --> 00:38:10,221
The strange thing is...

454
00:38:10,484 --> 00:38:13,250
Mr. Montree didn’t make a purchase with Mr. Art directly

455
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,215
He bought all the work from someone called Ning

456
00:38:15,478 --> 00:38:17,741
She’s a girlfriend of Kao’s, the one who is missing right now

457
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:20,483
Montree probably sensed his danger and tried to run away

458
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,381
He’s definitely running away

459
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,610
I find the relationship between these two very strange

460
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:26,027
Ning and Art seem to hate each other

461
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:29,101
But why Ning is the person who sells Art’s work?

462
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:39,853
Have you found Kao?

463
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:41,387
Not yet.

464
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:47,364
Then why did you call me here?

465
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:49,833
I have some questions to ask you.

466
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:53,570
They are only for our references in this case.

467
00:38:54,763 --> 00:38:56,473
Do you know Mr. Montree?

468
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:57,695
Montree?

469
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,015
Which Montree? I don’t know him.

470
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:04,084
Mr. Montree whom you met at the exhibition yesterday.

471
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,215
yesterday

472
00:39:06,895 --> 00:39:09,043
I was only there to look for Kao.

473
00:39:10,404 --> 00:39:12,484
If you don’t know Mr. Montree,

474
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:17,181
then how come there’s a record of you selling Mr. Art’s work to Mr. Montree through his secretary?

475
00:39:19,261 --> 00:39:20,313
Miss Ning?

476
00:39:21,124 --> 00:39:23,970
I already asked the bank to send me all transactions incurred on your bank accounts.

477
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:28,130
A few months ago, there was a deposit of many hundred thousand baht in your account.

478
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,867
I don’t know about that.

479
00:39:30,655 --> 00:39:31,863
I don’t know anything.

480
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:34,324
Kao just took care of everything.

481
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:37,764
He is the one who deals with Art

482
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:40,747
He asked me open an account under my name.

483
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:44,690
He said he’d deposit some money in there...

484
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,895
for our wedding.

485
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,330
(Crying)

486
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,010
Are you sure?

487
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:55,673
If you lied to us,

488
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,833
it wouldn’t do you any good.

489
00:39:58,141 --> 00:40:00,164
I’m...I’m not lying.

490
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:02,804
If you want to know anything,

491
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:05,398
you should go find Kao and ask him.

492
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:07,581
You might get all the answers you’re looking for

493
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,353
Find him.

494
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:18,667
(Shutter sound)

495
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:22,244
(Shutter sound)

496
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:24,333
(Shutter sound)

497
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:25,810
(Shutter sound)

498
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,953
I think Art and Kao...

499
00:40:37,953 --> 00:40:39,695
aren’t just friends or colleagues.

500
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:44,610
I found some clothes and personal belongings that might belong to Kao’s.

501
00:40:46,004 --> 00:40:47,810
So, what Ning said

502
00:40:47,803 --> 00:40:49,398
about Kao and Art being together...

503
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,135
might be true.

504
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:52,941
Yeah.

505
00:40:53,764 --> 00:40:56,884
And what the inspector has suspected about Art...

506
00:40:57,158 --> 00:40:59,753
having something to do with Kao’s disappearance, might also be possible.

507
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:10,873
This is not just a simple assault case

508
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:13,170
It might also be related to Kao’s disappearance

509
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:16,781
According to the traces of evidence, bloodstain, and the crime scene...
Where is Kao?

510
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:18,213
Only Art knows.

511
00:41:18,213 --> 00:41:25,173
The Sign
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

512
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:32,281
The Sign

513
00:41:40,112 --> 00:41:43,609
(Thrill Sound)

514
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:39,529
Hey

515
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:40,832
Tharn.

516
00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:42,523
What did you see?

517
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:47,072
I can feel something about this picture.

518
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:01,141
Hey.

519
00:44:02,135 --> 00:44:03,735
I think we’ve found a key evidence.

520
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:17,792
We have done the lab test on Art’s DNA and the bloodstain that Phaya found at Art’s place,

521
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,866
the bloodstain doesn’t belong to Art.

522
00:44:22,032 --> 00:44:23,151
Whose is it?

523
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:24,398
We don’t know yet.

524
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:29,289
But it matches with the dried bloodstain on the pen.

525
00:44:29,281 --> 00:44:30,786
The one Art used to hurt Ning.

526
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:37,501
From our interview with Ning,
she said Kao has disappeared 3 days ago.

527
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:40,523
So, I asked Sing to track down Kao’s phone.

528
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:42,718
The last place where he went...

529
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:44,158
is Art’s house.

530
00:44:44,546 --> 00:44:45,289
Here.

531
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:49,323
This is the file from a CCTV camera in the alley where Art’s house is.

532
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:53,518
Three days ago, Kao did go to see Art.

533
00:44:53,621 --> 00:44:57,803
This is not just a simple assault case.

534
00:44:58,249 --> 00:45:01,758
It might also be related to Kao’s disappearance.

535
00:45:08,946 --> 00:45:10,821
The traces of evidence, the bloodstain,

536
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,438
and the crime scene…

537
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:18,546
Everything that points out to what happened on that night.

538
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:20,981
Where is Kao?

539
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:25,266
Only Art knows.

540
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:39,541
Mr. Art.

541
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,803
Do you recognize this pen?

542
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:47,689
You used it to hurt Miss Ning.

543
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,141
Did you also use to hurt anyone else?

544
00:45:55,015 --> 00:45:56,535
I am talking to you, Mr. Art.

545
00:45:57,895 --> 00:45:59,666
Can you please cooperate?

546
00:46:00,306 --> 00:46:03,221
Did you use this pen to hurt anyone else?

548
00:46:24,558 --> 00:46:26,021
You don’t have to say anything.

549
00:46:27,563 --> 00:46:28,901
You didn’t do anything wrong.

550
00:46:30,592 --> 00:46:31,689
It’s all my fault.

555
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:15,151
I’m sorry.

556
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:17,038
I didn’t mean it.

557
00:47:19,209 --> 00:47:20,112
Kao.

558
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:24,626
I’m not mad at you.

559
00:47:29,038 --> 00:47:32,363
From now on, we’ll be together.

560
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:35,918
We’ll never part again.

561
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:41,746
That night, he went to your house, didn’t he?

562
00:47:42,421 --> 00:47:46,695
He wanted to break up with you because he was going to marry Miss Ning.

563
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:51,141
We’ve already found...

564
00:47:52,466 --> 00:47:56,821
a bloodstain of someone else’s on this pen...

565
00:47:58,009 --> 00:47:59,426
other than that of Miss Ning’s.

566
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:04,089
Did you kill Kao?

567
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:05,529
No.

568
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:09,449
I didn’t do it.

569
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:19,518
- You knew all along.
- I didn’t do it!

570
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:22,009
You knew, didn’t you?

571
00:48:23,312 --> 00:48:27,003
That Kao secretly sold your work to Mr. Montree behind your back.

572
00:48:32,649 --> 00:48:35,918
That night, what did Mr. Montree whispered to you?

573
00:48:36,123 --> 00:48:37,152
Did he threaten you?

574
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,106
Are you sure you’re not going to sell it to me?

575
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:47,929
Hmm, is this the pen that you used to hurt Kao?

576
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:49,381
Love?

577
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:51,861
That’s sick.

578
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:55,221
I didn’t do it.

579
00:48:55,521 --> 00:48:58,649
You were angry that Kao betrayed you.

580
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:00,283
He used your love for money.

581
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:04,809
He sold all the works you gave him.

582
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:13,792
No.

583
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:15,403
No.

584
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:19,861
No, I didn’t do it.

585
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:21,815
It was an accident.

586
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:24,478
I didn’t do it.

587
00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:27,621
No.

588
00:49:27,655 --> 00:49:29,769
- Is Kao already dead?
- I’m sorry.

589
00:49:30,043 --> 00:49:31,426
I’m sorry.

590
00:49:32,078 --> 00:49:33,769
Can you stop calling me?

591
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:35,586
I’m trying to get everything done.

592
00:49:36,238 --> 00:49:37,118
That’s right.

593
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:39,941
I don’t love him.

594
00:49:40,843 --> 00:49:42,398
I just want to use him.

595
00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:45,518
Is that what you want to hear?

596
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:50,775
Art, please let me explain.

597
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:51,838
You’re an asshole.

598
00:49:52,078 --> 00:49:54,021
- Art.    /    - Get off me.

599
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:55,141
Get off me!

Art.

601
00:49:57,118 --> 00:49:58,981
Have you ever been honest with me?

602
00:49:59,815 --> 00:50:00,855
Have you?

603
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:01,941
Just for once.

604
00:50:02,203 --> 00:50:04,089
Was that also true?

605
00:50:04,352 --> 00:50:06,386
Or was it just another lie?.

606
00:50:06,752 --> 00:50:07,803
No, Art.

607
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:09,792
I really love you.

608
00:50:10,432 --> 00:50:11,358
I do.

609
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:12,101
Love?

610
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:13,621
Please listen to me, Art.

611
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,201
Please.

612
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:16,192
Please calm down.

613
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,209
- No. / - Art.

614
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:19,278
- Please listen to me. / - No.

615
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:20,409

616
00:50:20,421 --> 00:50:21,541
Ouch!

617
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,198
I thought I’d be able to give you a chance.

618
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:30,089
I thought if you really loved me, I might be able to give you a chance.

619
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:32,146
But this is too much.

620
00:50:33,415 --> 00:50:36,638
I’m going to take back all my works.

621
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:39,346
I’ll press charges...

622
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:42,112

623
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:44,878

You have to pay for what you did.

635
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:36,041
For all those lies.

636
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:39,106

639
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:55,529
There is no love.

640
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,051
There’s only lies.

641
00:52:03,815 --> 00:52:05,392

646
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:42,615
Tharn, why do you think Art has nothing to do with Kao’s disappearance?

647
00:52:43,049 --> 00:52:46,855
Do you still remember when Art talked about love during the openining at the exhibition?

648
00:52:46,878 --> 00:52:51,918
I think he said it because he missed him. He felt sad.

649
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:55,401
He was yearning for someone he loved.

650
00:52:55,849 --> 00:52:58,855
I couldn’t feel any anger or hatred from him at all.

651
00:52:59,461 --> 00:53:02,123
Are you saying that...

652
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:05,986
Art still loves Kao?

653
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:11,758
There are many lovers who have to stay apart.

654
00:53:12,158 --> 00:53:13,518
I know that.

655
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:18,832
But for me, if I love someone...

656
00:53:20,523 --> 00:53:22,432
I’ll never let that person go.

657
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:24,581
I’ll keep looking for him.

658
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:28,089
And do everything that I can to make him stay with me.

659
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:29,815
No matter what it takes.

660
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:33,918

It’s all my fault.

679

00:55:23,918 --> 00:55:25,141
I didn’t love him.

684
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:35,849
I chose to be with you, to marry you.

702
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:28,866
despite how little you’d be able to share those love with me...

703
00:56:30,192 --> 00:56:34,615

00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:20,981
Please listen, Art.

725
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:22,226
Get off!

726
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:23,941
Get off me! Or I’ll kill you!

727
00:57:25,129 --> 00:57:26,935
(Thunder Sound)

728
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:40,958
No.

729
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:45,403
No. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.

730
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:19,826
(Crying)

731
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:25,998
(Wailing)

732
00:58:43,758 --> 00:58:45,801
(Thunder Sound)

733
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:50,921
(Thunder Sound)

734
00:58:55,346 --> 00:58:57,681
(Thunder Sound)

735
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:15,426
Art is not the culprit.

736
00:59:15,598 --> 00:59:17,346
(Thrill Sound)

737
00:59:17,341 --> 00:59:18,386
How do you know?

738
00:59:26,912 --> 00:59:29,655
Singh, find me the info quickly.

739
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:31,506
(Shutter Sound )

740
00:59:34,455 --> 00:59:35,278
(Shutter Sound )

741
00:59:37,552 --> 00:59:38,001
(Shutter Sound )

742
00:59:40,321 --> 00:59:40,969
(Shutter Sound )

743
00:59:41,723 --> 00:59:42,466
(Shutter Sound )

744
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:51,495
(Shutter Sound )

745
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:57,621
Found the bloodstain.

746
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:01,689
Photo it.

747
01:00:01,712 --> 01:00:02,441
(Shutter Sound )

748
01:00:04,238 --> 01:00:08,146
If this blood matches with the one on the pen,

749
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:11,483
then we’d know if Kao is still alive.

750
01:00:11,872 --> 01:00:14,352
Or whether Art has already killed him.

751
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:15,381
Photo it.

752
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:16,371
(Shutter Sound )

753
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:19,266
Give me a hand. Hold this.

754
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:20,101
(Shutter Sound )

755
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:25,758
(Shutter Sound )

756
01:00:30,398 --> 01:00:31,266
(Shutter Sound )

757
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:42,481
I really want to go back to sleep. Let’s call it a day.

758
01:00:42,512 --> 01:00:43,678
Hey, wait.

759
01:00:44,489 --> 01:00:44,969
Let’s go.

760
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:45,586
- What? / - Come with me.

761
01:00:45,581 --> 01:00:46,546
No.

762
01:00:46,695 --> 01:00:47,986
I have a surprise for you.

763
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:48,683
What is it?

764
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:50,101
It won’t be a surprise if I tell you.

765
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:57,241
The Sign

Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

766
01:00:57,351 --> 01:01:04,331
The Sign

767
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,933
About the bloodstain that we found on the taxi

768
01:01:11,956 --> 01:01:13,819
It matches with the one on the pen

769
01:01:13,842 --> 01:01:15,693
Does it belong to Kao’s?

770
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:17,785
- Yes.   /   - Oh!!!

771
01:01:17,968 --> 01:01:21,396
We have compared the DNA of bloodstain with those clothes and belongings Phaya had found at Art’s place.

772
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:22,768
the DNA matches

773
01:01:23,236 --> 01:01:24,528
It belongs to Kao’s.

774
01:01:24,813 --> 01:01:29,271
A camera on the taxi also showed that Kao called for a cab and took this taxi.

775
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:32,291
But the driver said that Kao was on the phone

776
01:01:32,311 --> 01:01:34,173
I’ll do everything exactly as I said

777
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,762
Then he got off in the middle of the road

778
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:38,731
Excuse me? Can you please turn right at this junction?

779
01:01:38,731 --> 01:01:41,716
(Raining)

780
01:01:49,465 --> 01:01:52,733
I asked Sing to check around that area. It’s an abandoned land with no residences nearby.

781
01:01:53,065 --> 01:01:55,225
So, we had no idea where he went after that since there aren’t any CCTV camera around there.

782
01:01:56,139 --> 01:01:58,322
Oh, just in time. The inspector has called for a meeting.

783
01:01:58,436 --> 01:01:59,111
Okay

784
01:02:02,471 --> 01:02:03,533
Wait.

785
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:08,345
Can we release Art now?

786
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:13,316
He doesn’t have anything to do with Kao’s disappearance anyway.

787
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:16,882
Let the inspector decide

788
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,516
Let’s go for a meeting first

789
01:02:22,413 --> 01:02:27,316
(Classical Music)

790
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:49,488
(Classical Music)

791
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:55,051
How serious is it?

792
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,533
It might escalate from one level to another

793
01:03:01,682 --> 01:03:03,442
Oh, hello Doc

794
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:11,716
Doctor...

795
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:15,145
Can he be cured?

796
01:03:15,396 --> 01:03:17,202
If so, how long will it take?

797
01:03:17,373 --> 01:03:19,431
He has experienced a severe breakdown

798
01:03:19,819 --> 01:03:22,459
I’m afraid it might take quite some time, Inspector

799
01:03:22,562 --> 01:03:24,905
Is Mr. Art going to be in trouble because of Kao’s disappearance?

800
01:03:26,231 --> 01:03:29,213
Although he might not be involved with Kao’s disappearance,

801
01:03:29,236 --> 01:03:31,545
he would still be charged with physical assault

802
01:03:33,453 --> 01:03:36,011
If Mr. Art chose to walk away when he knew that Kao already had a girlfrirend,

803
01:03:36,482 --> 01:03:38,025
this tragic incident wouldn’t have happened

804
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:43,111
Love is like that. You don’t always get what  you want

805
01:03:43,693 --> 01:03:46,585
But you’ve already fallen for someone,

806
01:03:46,581 --> 01:03:48,276
it’s probably not that easy to give up on it.

807
01:03:48,585 --> 01:03:50,013
Even if it’s not easy,

808
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:52,688
but if it’s necessary, then you should do it

809
01:03:52,893 --> 01:03:54,893
Because what’s not ours will never be ours

810
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:57,259
There’s no use to keep being persistent

811
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:58,105
That’s right

812
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:00,905
No use at all.

813
01:04:01,168 --> 01:04:04,825
You better let them live together happily. Don’t get in the way.

814
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,591
Walk away now so that you won’t waste your time

815
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:08,996
But if I really love someone,

816
01:04:09,911 --> 01:04:11,876
I’m willing to waste my time, Phaya.

817
01:04:12,505 --> 01:04:14,619
And I’ll do everything...

818
01:04:14,722 --> 01:04:17,511
to make the one I love stay by my side.

819
01:04:17,751 --> 01:04:19,511
Even if that person doesn’t love you?

820
01:04:20,345 --> 01:04:22,333
Isn’t that too selfish?

821
01:04:22,356 --> 01:04:24,071
Calm down, Phaya.

822
01:04:25,533 --> 01:04:26,836
I’m sorry, Inspector.

823
01:04:27,248 --> 01:04:29,522
I got a little carried away.

824
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:32,368
Someone is trying to take away something dear to me

825
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:42,973
Well, lucky for me that I obey what the Abbot said and live my life by the Five Precepts.
That’s why my love life is so happy as it is.

826
01:04:42,996 --> 01:04:46,379
Kamesu-micchacara – one should abstain from a sexual misconduct.

827
01:04:46,371 --> 01:04:49,819
And also, Musavata – to abstain from false speech

828
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:52,973
- Sathu.    /  - Sathu.

829
01:04:52,971 --> 01:04:55,282

01:04:56,281 --> 01:05:03,796
(Thrill Sound)

831
01:05:57,339 --> 01:06:00,051
Are you going home? Do you need a lift?

832
01:06:00,219 --> 01:06:01,659
Don’t bother, Doctor.

833
01:06:04,505 --> 01:06:08,425
Tharn, we need to gather more information and find more evidence

834
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,253
It would take some time

835
01:06:10,528 --> 01:06:11,613
So don’t let him wait

836
01:06:12,242 --> 01:06:13,225
I’ll drop you off.

837
01:06:13,248 --> 01:06:16,985
Then you go ahead and head back home

838
01:06:17,476 --> 01:06:19,042
I’ll go back with him

839
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:20,093
Did you hear that?

840
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:21,625
He will go back with me

841
01:06:22,459 --> 01:06:23,545
So, don’t worry

842
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:27,145
I’ll see him to his bed

843
01:06:28,653 --> 01:06:30,491
Thank you, Phaya

844
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:32,471
My pleasure

845
01:06:33,351 --> 01:06:34,333
Let’s go

846
01:06:49,899 --> 01:06:52,459
(Phone Ringing)

847
01:06:54,665 --> 01:06:56,048
Yes, Doc?

848
01:06:56,185 --> 01:06:58,573
[Chalothorn's voice: Hi Tharn, I'm at home now]

849
01:06:58,711 --> 01:07:00,059
Okay.

850
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:01,636
Please rest well.

851
01:07:06,413 --> 01:07:08,356
Does he really have to keep checking on you?

852
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,861
So annoying.

853
01:07:13,248 --> 01:07:15,762
Let’s talk about Art’s case tomorrow

854
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:17,465
I want to go home and get some rest

855
01:07:17,682 --> 01:07:18,711
Let’s call it a day.

856
01:07:18,711 --> 01:07:19,911
Hey, wait

857
01:07:21,236 --> 01:07:25,019
Huh? Do you really forget it?

858
01:07:25,568 --> 01:07:27,305
You said you will go back with me.

859
01:07:29,481 --> 01:07:33,008
I said that so that you two would stop fighting

860
01:07:37,591 --> 01:07:38,071
Let’s go

861
01:07:38,105 --> 01:07:39,076
- Hey. / - Come with me.

862
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:40,219
No.

863
01:07:40,699 --> 01:07:43,728
Hey, I really want you to come with me

864
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:46,448
I have a surprise for you

865
01:07:50,459 --> 01:07:51,453
What is it?

866
01:07:52,071 --> 01:07:53,293
It won’t be a surprise if I tell you

867
01:07:58,322 --> 01:07:59,065
Please.

868
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:06,836
(Oh yes!)

869
01:08:08,288 --> 01:08:09,533
Hey, wait for me

870
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:20,859
Why did you take me to your home?

871
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:23,876
I just want you to come visit my place

872
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:27,533
I’ve already been to your place for so many times

873
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,871
Is this how you invite someone to your house?

874
01:08:31,339 --> 01:08:32,208
Yeah.

875
01:08:38,608 --> 01:08:41,739
Oh, wow! Your house is so grand

876
01:08:45,011 --> 01:08:50,425
Oh, hello. What’s your name?

877
01:08:51,842 --> 01:08:53,259
It’s Namami.

878
01:08:54,241 --> 01:08:54,916
I see

879
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,345
(Meow)

880
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:57,293
Hello

881
01:08:57,419 --> 01:08:58,331
Namami.

882
01:08:58,331 --> 01:09:00,951
No, I mean the cat’s name is Namami

883
01:09:01,031 --> 01:09:02,813
I’m Paranee

884
01:09:03,011 --> 01:09:06,185
(Laughing)
Ah, hello Paranee.

885
01:09:06,311 --> 01:09:07,716
Hello, Tharn.

886
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:09,853
Is she your little sister?

887
01:09:14,425 --> 01:09:15,328
No.

888
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:17,551
My mother.

889
01:09:18,379 --> 01:09:20,516
Welcome to our house

890
01:09:20,801 --> 01:09:23,682
- Hello, Grandma.
- Hello.

891
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:28,048
You arrive just in time for dinner

892
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:33,031
Your family knows that I’d be coming?

893
01:09:34,082 --> 01:09:35,031
Meow

894
01:09:36,996 --> 01:09:39,168
How is it going with the case? Is everything all right now?

895
01:09:39,385 --> 01:09:43,179
I’ve been watching the news about it. You guys are so great

896
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:45,171
- Right, Grandma?
- Yes.

897
01:09:45,751 --> 01:09:49,911
People are losing their minds more and more these days

898
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,631
In the old days when I watched the news,

899
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:56,802
I could still understand the reason why those people did something evil like that

900
01:09:57,076 --> 01:10:01,522
They probably experienced something so terrible...

901
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:05,922
that caused them to act on impulse.

902
01:10:06,185 --> 01:10:11,808
But people these days are different. Their minds are beyond understanding.

903
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:14,116
I totally agree with you, Grandma.

904
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,196
They are nothing like Namami, right?

905
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:18,471
Namami...

906
01:10:21,545 --> 01:10:25,785
Actually, it mostly revolves around only just one or two things

907
01:10:26,356 --> 01:10:27,591
Being dishonest

908
01:10:28,105 --> 01:10:30,345
or lying.

909
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:34,665
And also a sexual misconduct driven by obsessions and desire.

910
01:10:36,173 --> 01:10:37,853
Wow!

911
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:42,516
You’re so cool. You know about all those things too.

912
01:10:44,105 --> 01:10:45,396
The Abbot taught me well.

913
01:10:46,265 --> 01:10:47,248
(Laughing)

914
01:10:49,236 --> 01:10:52,528
Now that I’ve already invited him to our place

915
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:55,865
Are you going to let him stand here all night?

916
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:57,408
I’m so hungry, Grandma.

917
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,842
Well, so am I.

918
01:10:59,865 --> 01:11:02,116
I’ve prepared something delicious for your friend

919
01:11:02,311 --> 01:11:04,996
You, stay here. Don’t move.

920
01:11:05,522 --> 01:11:07,899
Tharn, let’s go and have dinner with me.

921
01:11:07,891 --> 01:11:10,859
I’m so glad you finally came.

922
01:11:11,191 --> 01:11:13,431
I often heard Phaya

923
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:15,499
talking about you.

924
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:17,716
Wait, not talking actually.

925
01:11:17,991 --> 01:11:19,819
He often dreamt about you.

926
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:21,911
Let’s go. Don’t you dare move.

927
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:23,561
Come, let’s eat.

928
01:11:23,561 --> 01:11:25,202
- Leave him be.
- Okay.

929
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,939
Serve you right. You’re no longer her favourite nephew

930
01:11:31,111 --> 01:11:32,413
Namami, scratch her.

931
01:11:32,411 --> 01:11:34,676
Let’s go eat, Namami.

932
01:11:40,745 --> 01:11:44,619
Hey, are you really going to leave me here?

933
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:48,231
Fine, I’ll go there myself.

934
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:49,705
I made

935
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,025
this myself.

936
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:59,682
Oh, I was about to give you that.

937
01:11:59,933 --> 01:12:01,716
- Grandma.   /    - Yeah

938
01:12:03,533 --> 01:12:07,465
- Tell me, has he ever done something funny to you?
- Huh?

939
01:12:07,461 --> 01:12:09,396
(Laughing)

940
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:13,042
Wow, this is so good.

941
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:16,051
I made it myself.

942
01:12:22,413 --> 01:12:26,651
(Lovely Sound)

943
01:13:07,328 --> 01:13:08,093
Go on.

944
01:13:23,019 --> 01:13:25,282
I often come here to draw.

945
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:41,156
I’ve been afraid of water since then.

946
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:47,968
So, I tried to stay close to it – to get used to it.

947
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:53,579
I’m trying too.

948
01:13:55,682 --> 01:14:01,831
(Eternity Remembrance Melody)

949
01:14:14,356 --> 01:14:15,419
Tharn.

950
01:14:16,505 --> 01:14:17,248
Here.

951
01:14:22,962 --> 01:14:24,191
Ow!

952
01:14:35,408 --> 01:14:36,402
Do you remember...

953
01:14:39,076 --> 01:14:41,099
the first time we met at the camp?

954
01:14:43,499 --> 01:14:44,402
Do you know...

955
01:14:45,636 --> 01:14:47,076
that I really wanted to hug you then?

956
01:14:51,385 --> 01:14:52,562
Liar.

957
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,391
You couldn’t even recognise me.

958
01:14:59,339 --> 01:15:00,745
But it was such a coincidence.

959
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:08,891
But the end, wasn’t it me who took your hand and led you out of that place?

960
01:15:15,362 --> 01:15:16,596
Do you really think

961
01:15:19,808 --> 01:15:21,362
all this is a coincidence?

962
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:27,065
Tharn.

963
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:34,291
I like you a lot.

964
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,191
I really do.

965
01:15:46,756 --> 01:15:48,516
I don’t know

966
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,133
why I’m like this too.

967
01:15:53,853 --> 01:15:55,385
But then I’ve come to realise about it.

968
01:15:58,711 --> 01:16:00,322
Even though I’ve just met you...

969
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,693
the closer I get to know you,

970
01:16:08,802 --> 01:16:10,208
the more I feel that...

971
01:16:12,128 --> 01:16:14,311
I’ll never be able to lose you.

972
01:16:20,813 --> 01:16:25,991
I really want to have you by my side in every day of my life.

973
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:33,945
It’s as if...

974
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:37,613
I’ve felt like this for so long.

975
01:16:40,699 --> 01:16:42,208
Very long.

976
01:16:48,402 --> 01:16:50,128
I can’t love anyone, Phaya.

977
01:16:53,179 --> 01:16:54,608
If I love someone,

978
01:16:59,122 --> 01:17:00,665
I’ll lose that person in the end.

979
01:17:05,773 --> 01:17:07,728
And I don’t want to lose you.

980
01:17:09,971 --> 01:17:12,105
I want to have you by my side.

981
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:18,768
But this is the best I can do.

982
01:17:22,585 --> 01:17:24,368
Please don’t force me.

983
01:17:27,991 --> 01:17:30,011
Because I really don’t want to lose you.

984
01:17:38,539 --> 01:17:39,465
Tharn.

985
01:17:41,362 --> 01:17:43,842
I’ll do everything to be with you.

986
01:17:45,511 --> 01:17:46,653
I’m not going anywhere.

987
01:17:47,716 --> 01:17:49,031
I’ll stay by your side.

988
01:17:56,802 --> 01:18:00,825
I’ll do whatever it takes so that you won’t be sad or lose me.

989
01:18:03,431 --> 01:18:04,431
I promise.

990
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:09,796
(Romantic Music)

991
01:20:25,693 --> 01:20:36,333
(Romantic Music)

992
01:21:24,711 --> 01:21:28,425
(Thrill Sound)

993
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,421
(The sound of the wind blowing)

994
01:21:30,611 --> 01:21:32,611
(Book flipping open)

995
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:53,491
Idolfactory

996
01:21:53,968 --> 01:21:58,253
You and Phaya should be more careful during these days.

997
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:00,893
The Abbot asked me to tell you...

998
01:22:00,991 --> 01:22:02,859
to try to stay away from water.

999
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:05,259
Tharn! Tharn!

1000
01:22:09,111 --> 01:22:10,642
(Thrill Sound)

1001
01:22:10,642 --> 01:22:12,851
(Praying)

1002
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:15,088
Tharn! Wake up!

1003
01:22:15,213 --> 01:22:16,121
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:22:16,253 --> 01:22:17,179
Tharn.

1005
01:22:19,731 --> 01:22:20,653
Ouch!

1006
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:45,648
🎵I will always cherish this love in my heart.🎵

1007
01:22:45,641 --> 01:22:53,111
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always want to see you.🎵

1008
01:22:53,111 --> 01:23:01,522
🎵I want you to know that you are the one that I want.🎵

1009
01:23:01,521 --> 01:23:11,933
🎵I’m going to love you and only you.🎵

1010
01:23:11,931 --> 01:23:19,351
🎵No matter for how lond, it will never change.🎵

1011
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:23,876
🎵Whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.🎵

1012
01:23:23,871 --> 01:23:26,928
🎵I’ll never forget you.🎵

1013
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:34,208
🎵No matter for how long, I’ll always love you.🎵

1014
01:23:34,441 --> 01:23:38,619
🎵Love you with all my heart.🎵

1015
01:23:38,619 --> 01:23:46,411
🎵No one can take your place because my heart belongs to you.🎵
