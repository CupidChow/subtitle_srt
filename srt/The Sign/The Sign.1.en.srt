00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,500
The chicken have been released. Over.

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,980
(Exciting sound)

4
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,680
Listen up, you only have 15 minutes.

5
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,540
Team A will rescues the hostage.

6
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,880
While Team B will try to defuse a bomb. And most importantly,

7
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:12,560
remember we have a hostage…

8
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,740
do not fire your guns if not necessary.

9
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:17,300
Got it?

10
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:21,560
Go!

11
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,980

22

Hey, cover me.

28
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:56,466
go!

29
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,840
(Shooting sound)

30
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,480
Phaya

31
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,240
Phaya, go!

32
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,400
Okay.

33
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,500
(Bomb ticking sound)

34
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,260
You go and handle upstairs.

35
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,460
I’ll take care of them here.

36
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,460
Okay.

37
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:04,680
Bastard!

38
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:08,120
Need any help?

39
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,960
Shut up.

40
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,740
(Door breaking sound)

41
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,640
A dummy.

42
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,940
Son of a bitch!

43
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,940
Where’s the hostage?

44
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,980
He’s not here.

45
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,380
We were fooled.

46
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:41,580
You two try to defuse the bombs here and in that room.

47
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,940
I’ll go rescue the hostage.

48
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,560
Got it?

49
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,260
Let’s go with the yellow one.

50
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:06,920
Hey!

51
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,260
(Fighting sound)

52
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,720
Hey!

53
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,960
Hey! Yai!

54
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:59,173
I’m here.

55
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:05,026
Cleared.

56
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Section 3, cleared.

57
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,600
Let’s go and rescue the hostage.

58
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,060
Okay.

59
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,380
There are two bombs on this floor.

60
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,100
You two stay here then.

61
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,600
I’ll go rescue the hostage. Go!

62
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:53,960
Khem.

63
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,760
What?

64
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,840
How much time do we have?

65
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,540
7 minutes.

66
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,560
Got it.

67
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,280
Cleared.

68
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,960

69
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,140

70
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,660
Fuck! The hostage isn’t here.

71
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,740
Okay.

76
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:09,740
How much time do we have left, Tharn?

77
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,860
5 minutes.

78
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,720
What to do?

79
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,260
Tharn.

80
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,260

You are about to receive a training from hell.

120 hours from now on…

100
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,800
…we’d be training non-stop.

101
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Got it?

102
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,160

Tharn.

106
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:30,578
Tharn!

107
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:37,398
(Shooting sound)

108
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,404
What the fuck, Chart?

109
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,298
The hostage is mine!

110
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:47,278
(Shooting sound)

111
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:51,538

Stop it, Chart!

116
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:56,791
Hey!

117
00:14:58,438 --> 00:14:59,838
Stop!

118
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:03,658
(Fighting sound)

119
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,478
That’s enough!

120
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,578
Time’s up.

121
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:21,178
Team A and B, both of you failed to rescue the hostage.

122
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:23,758
So, both teams will be punished.

123
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:35,318
The main goal of this training is to create unity among both teams.

124
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:37,658
If any of you fail,

125
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,098
Everyone on the team also fails.

126
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,318
No one will take the responsibility alone.

127
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,978
Working as a team…

128
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:47,938
…means that you have to stick together.

129
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:52,358
And help watch each other’s back.

130
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:55,078
No one stands out.

131
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:57,298
No one is better than the others.

132
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,238
You both lose…

133
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:04,278
…because you don’t know how to work as a team.

134
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:07,178
But if we were competing, there must be a winner.

135
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:11,138
Shouldn’t we play by the rule?

136
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:19,418
Yes.

137
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:25,138
But not by doing something nasty like what you did today.

138
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:29,218
Although the mission always comes first…

139
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,058
…especially when you are on a real mission.

140
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:35,238
But I taught you how to fight to protect yourself and others.

141
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:38,038
Not to destroy one another.

142
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:46,138
Prepare for push-ups!

143
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:46,918
Ready!

144
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:48,318
Hooya!

145
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:53,758
300 push-ups! Go!

146
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,178
Hooya!

147
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:57,798
One

148
00:16:58,298 --> 00:16:59,578

Six

153
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:10,278
Can you feel the unity among the team now?

154
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:12,618
If not…

155
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:15,858
…then we’ll keep training like this without any sleep.

156
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,038
Two

157
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,578

158
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:19,718

159
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:20,958
Five

160
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:21,698
Six

161
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,378
- Do you get it now?
- Seven

162
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:26,378
- Eight , Nine
- Can you feel the unity among you now?

163
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:27,478
Ten

164
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:28,578
If not…

165
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:30,378
Let me help you.

166
00:17:31,778 --> 00:17:33,098
Prepare for push-ups!

167
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:34,198
Ready!

168
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:35,938
Hooya!

169
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:54,138
Ouch!

170
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:55,498
What’s wrong?

171
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:57,278
Baby, my back hurts.

172
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:59,318
You cry like a dog.

173
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:01,098
Ouch!

174
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:02,578
Baby, wait for me.

175
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:06,878
So annoying.

176
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:12,798
Baby

177
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:16,698
Did you go to help Phaya…

178
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:18,818
…because you saw that he would be stabbed with the iron rod?

179
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:23,138
Let’s not talk about it.

180
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:25,218
Tharn.

181
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,758
If you don’t clarify yourself,

182
00:18:26,758 --> 00:18:28,618
our team might misunderstand…

183
00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:30,298
…and think that you betrayed us.

184
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:32,758
Misunderstand?

185
00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:35,138
That’s better those who think I’m crazy.

186
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:36,658
Like when I was still in school.

187
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:45,038
- Hey!
- Hey!

188
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,098
What the fuck is wrong with you, Chart?

189
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,958
It’s your fault.

190
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:52,598
My team lost because of you!

191
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:55,798
You shouldn’t even be here!

192
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:58,658
- Hey!
- Hey!

193
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,138
What the fuck?

194
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:03,398
Tharn.

195
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:04,118
Hey!

196
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:09,538
Stop it, Chart!

197
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:10,838
Get off me!

198
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,298
That’s enough!

199
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:14,638
It’s over. Why can’t you admit it?

200
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:16,098
I never lose!

201
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:19,098
Tharn butted in to save you.

202
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:22,478
You told him to do that, didn’t you?

203
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:24,498
- Did you?!
- What are you talking about?

204
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,538
Then don’t butt in.

205
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:27,698
Let me go!

206
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:30,838
Just stop it!

207
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:36,358
Hey! The instructor is coming.

208
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:52,098
(Showering sound)

209
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:54,718
(Showering sound)

210
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:12,238
Ouch!

211
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:16,738
Every part of my body hurts. Ouch!

212
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:21,978
Will I make it to the end?

213
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:23,458
- Hey!
- Ouch! My leg.

214
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,758
Are you okay, Khem?

215
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:26,758
Baby, please help me.

216
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:31,698
Go help him, Yai.

217
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,178
Fine.

218
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:40,558
He forgot his shoes.

219
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,618
Geez.

220
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,198
What the fuck are you looking at?

221
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:56,378
Bastard.

222
00:20:56,378 --> 00:21:00,278
Hey, leave him.

223
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:09,858
Let’s gets some sleep.

224
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:23,618
Ouch.

225
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:27,318
My leg hurts so much.

226
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:30,198
And we still have to do that training from hell tomorrow.

227
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:32,418
Will I survive it, Tharn?

228
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,958
Come on, Yai.

229
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:40,098
When Sand found out that you sneaked out to have fun…

230
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:43,138
…you ran over 10 km. without complaining about your legs.

231
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:46,278
I wasn’t afraid that my legs would fall off.

232
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:48,318
I was more afraid that my wife would chop my head off.

233
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:49,558
(Laughing sound)

234
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:57,178
Where is he now?

235
00:21:57,738 --> 00:21:59,198
It’s all because of him…

236
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:00,798
…that makes us in trouble like this.

237
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:03,278
You shouldn’t have helped him.

238
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:09,918
Then what? Should I just stand there and watch him die?

239
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:14,838
Well…

240
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,058
But did he even thank you?

241
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:24,118
Tharn.

242
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,378
I’m starting to wonder…

243
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:30,238
Why do your visions often involve Phaya?

244
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,618
You’ve never…

245
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,238
…had a vision about me at all.

246
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:37,998
You already have that amulet you got from the abbot to protect you.

247
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,398
You don’t need my protection.

248
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:43,438
Fine. But I’m still your brother.

249
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:47,018
You hardly care about my well-being.

250
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:48,278
But you seem…

251
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:49,878
to care about him a lot.

252
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:53,398
(Sigh)

253
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:55,738
Ouch!

254
00:22:57,338 --> 00:22:58,238
Hey.

255
00:23:00,698 --> 00:23:01,818
Can we talk?

256
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:17,798
How did you know I was going to be stabbed with the iron rod?

257
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,698
It was surely not a coincidence.

258
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:24,078
You came to rescue me at the right moment.

259
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:26,878
You know…

260
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:29,738
…that it would happen.

261
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:34,678
I wasn’t going to help you.

262
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:36,418
It was a mistake.

263
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:40,958
I was going to rescue the hostage to end the game.

264
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:43,958
But then I saw you two fighting like cats and dogs.

265
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,518
I couldn’t help cutting in since both of you are my friends.

266
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,298
Otherwise, I would have won.

267
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:53,258
Are you sure?

268
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,718
I already told you.

269
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:01,338
So,  you’re saying that it was a coincidence.

270
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:03,398
I was saved from getting stabbed by the iron rod…

271
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,238
because you made a mistake?

272
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:09,898
What’s done is done. Why don’t you just leave it be?

273
00:24:35,578 --> 00:24:38,758
(Whistle sound)

274
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:39,938
Hey.

275
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:41,084
Hurry up.

276
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:08,658
I’ll give you 1 minute.

277
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:10,658
We’ll go swimming today.

278
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:12,538
Hooya!

279
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:16,358
Swimming at 3 in the morning?

280
00:25:17,178 --> 00:25:19,118
Hurry up.

281
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,438
You are about to receive a training from hell.

282
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:31,498
120 hours from now on…

283
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:33,598
or 5 days and 5 nights from now on…

284
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:36,298
we’d be training non-stop.

285
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:37,518
Got it?

286
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:38,818
Hooya!

287
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,138
If you think you can’t do it…

288
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:42,838
and want to quit,

289
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,778
you can always come out and ring that bell behind me.

290
00:25:46,098 --> 00:25:46,898
Got it?

291
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:48,398
Hooya!

292
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:52,998
Does anyone want to quit now?

293
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:58,558
If not…

294
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:03,358
Let’s start with some activity to cool down your hot temper.

295
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:06,918
Take off your clothes. Now!

296
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:08,498
Hooya!

297
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:36,478
Fill this tank with ice.

298
00:26:42,198 --> 00:26:43,618
This one too.

299
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:49,218
This one is good.

300
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,598
So is this one.

301
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:01,978
This is only one of the scenario you will face in the future.

302
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:05,258
On a real mission, it would be a hundred or thousand times tougher.

303
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:07,058
What you have to do is endure it.

304
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:09,378
Use your patience and strength.

305
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:10,898
And get through it.

306
00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:11,978
Got it?

307
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,438
Hooya!

308
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:17,238
Baby,

309
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:18,398
I’m cold.

310
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:20,398
Hang in there.

311
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:24,578
(Breathing sound)

312
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:28,958
Instructor.

313
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:39,738
(Bell sound = Someone quit)

314
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:55,918
(Breathing sound)

315
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:31,618
Stab the neck!

316
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:32,244
Aye!

317
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:32,878
Slice!

318
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:33,538
Aye!

319
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:34,258
Slice!

320
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:35,124
Aye!

321
00:28:42,258 --> 00:28:43,618
Chest out!

322
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:44,978
Out!

323
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:49,158
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

324
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,258
If you can’t do it, just go home!

325
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:00,318
(Whistle sound)

326
00:29:02,178 --> 00:29:03,998
Hooya! Hooya!

327
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:21,518
Line up!

328
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:31,078
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

329
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,158
Slice!

330
00:29:34,158 --> 00:29:34,838
Aye!

331
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:35,418
Slice!

332
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:36,118
Aye!

333
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:40,938
One.

334
00:29:40,938 --> 00:29:41,618
Two.

335
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:42,238
Three.

336
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,018
Four.

337
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,018
One.

338
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:44,798
Two.

339
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:53,478
(Bell sound)

340
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:57,918
(Exciting sound)

341
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:15,538
Is everyone on board there?

342
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:16,258
Yes, sir.

343
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:16,958
What about that one?

344
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:17,758
Yes, sir.

345
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:19,578
One person is missing here.

346
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:23,998
Phaya.

347
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:30,998
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

348
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:38,106
The Sign

349
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:48,126
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

350
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:53,026
Hey!

351
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:03,166
Hold it.

352
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,786
Ouch.

353
00:31:05,786 --> 00:31:06,946
What happened?

354
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:09,666
If you can’t do it, throw the log away and all of you can leave.

355
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:12,786
What’s wrong, Tharn?

356
00:31:14,026 --> 00:31:15,626
I saw it again, the vision.

357
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:17,626
What did you see?

358
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,646
Are you okay, Chart?

359
00:31:24,046 --> 00:31:25,526
Fuck off.

360
00:31:26,446 --> 00:31:28,826
You’re trying to slow us down so that Phaya would win, right?

361
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,346
Asshole.

362
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:34,806
Enough. Let’s move. Go!

363
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:44,766
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

364
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:57,186
- Hooya! Hooya!
- Oh!

365
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:59,566
Oh!

366
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:02,126
Instructor! Someone fell down the hill!

367
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:04,346
Move!

368
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:05,666
Stand back!

369
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:09,426
- Shit!
- Get out of the way!

370
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:13,992
Stay still. Don’t move.

371
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,166
Anyone hasn’t got it?

372
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:37,386
Hey, don’t look so serious.

373
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:45,246
This is not the first time, isn’t it?

374
00:32:46,286 --> 00:32:48,506
That you saw a sign in your vision but couldn’t prevent it.

375
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:55,446
But Chart had to leave the training because of me.

376
00:32:57,526 --> 00:33:01,286
Why couldn’t he just endure it until after tonight.

377
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:08,006
Tharn, can’t you remember what the abbot said?

378
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:11,166
You can’t help save everyone from facing their own karma.

379
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:24,326
Too bad we couldn’t stay and watch the fire balls with the abbot this year.

380
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:28,006
He’d probably feel lonely without us.

381
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,152
Captain, how is Chart?

382
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:44,206
Time’s up. Go stand in a row of 3.

383
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:46,566
- Hooya!
- Quick!

384
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:50,486
One, two, three! One…

385
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:54,586
- Lift up the log.
- Hooya!

386
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:01,066
One, two, three!

387
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:04,166
Take your log back to the unit.

388
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:06,166
- Go!
- Hooya!

389
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:35,766
Pull him up.

390
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:39,926
(Sigh)

391
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,286
(Sigh)

392
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:08,786
- Is everyone on board there?
- Yes, sir!

393
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:10,526
- What about that one?
- Yes, sir!

394
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:13,346
One person is missing here.

395
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:15,566
Phaya.

396
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,186
Phaya!

397
00:35:39,026 --> 00:35:40,026
Phaya!

398
00:35:43,446 --> 00:35:45,246
Hang on, Tharn!

399
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:50,666
We can’t help him. We’re still on a training.

400
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,386
But I saw it.

401
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:55,086
What did you see?

402
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,466
Master Sakuna-naparuj, come this way.

403
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,786
Pull him up!

404
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:39,026
Phaya.

405
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:41,246
Phaya.

406
00:36:51,486 --> 00:36:53,686
Geez! I thought I was watching Jack and Rose.

407
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:57,886
Stop joking around.

408
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:06,166
The training is over.

409
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:10,666
You all are the survivors who passes the training.

410
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:13,766
Congratulation.

411
00:37:23,986 --> 00:37:32,186
Whoopy! Yay!

412
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:34,686
Yah!

413
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:41,506
Hooya! Hooya! Hooya!

414
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:44,986
Congrats, Tharn.

415
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,346
You finally become a police officer like you’ve always wanted.

416
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:55,606
Apart from becoming a police officer,

417
00:37:56,246 --> 00:37:58,226
there’s one more thing that I’ve always wanted to do.

418
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:00,546
But I don’t know if I’d be able to make it happen.

419
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:15,906
Yes, sweetie. I’m going to turn in. I’m so exhausted.

420
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:18,686
Okay. I’ll give you a call tomorrow.

421
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:20,726
- Hey, careful.
- Bye Bye. Sweet dream.

422
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:21,906
Careful. Easy there.

423
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:28,306
Geez, what are you doing?

424
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,866
Are you playing game? Sorry, babe.

425
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:46,566
What are you looking at?

426
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:49,046
I was just looking around.

427
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:51,946
I don’t think so.

428
00:39:07,786 --> 00:39:10,646
Hey, who is this girl you’re drawing?

429
00:39:10,646 --> 00:39:11,986
She looks so much like Tharn.

430
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,986
- Let me see.
- Look.

431
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:17,386
- Shit! It’s the same.
- Wow, it’s the same.

432
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:20,726
Look, Tharn. She looks exactly like you.

433
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:22,406
- Let me see.
- Oh.

434
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:23,246
Wow

435
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:25,086
- She’s beautiful.
- They look the same.

436
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:28,626
- Exactly.
- It’d be good to look this nice with my hair long.

437
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:35,386
Wansarut?

438
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:37,406
Let me see.

439
00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:38,646
Hey!

440
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:41,186
I still haven’t seen it.

441
00:39:41,186 --> 00:39:44,166
Booooo.

442
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,126
What’s wrong with him?

443
00:39:45,126 --> 00:39:49,166
Wansarut? If she has a name, that means she exists.

444
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,506
Hold on, Wansarut?

445
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,006
Wansa.

446
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:57,866
Why is her name similar to Tharn’s?

447
00:39:58,786 --> 00:39:59,506
What?

448
00:39:59,506 --> 00:40:00,786
She also looks like him.

449
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:02,006
The name is quite similar too.

450
00:40:02,006 --> 00:40:03,906
Do you like Tharn?

451
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:06,326
Awww.

452
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:07,499
Is your name Wansa?

453
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:09,666
Yes.

454
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:14,366
Awww.

455
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:18,666
You like him so much that you even draw his picture.

456
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:25,926
Seriously, why did you draw a picture of him?

457
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:30,446
Why do I have to tell you guys anything? It’s personal.

458
00:40:30,706 --> 00:40:35,886
Awww, personal? I see.

459
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:41,586
This should be the talk of the town.

460
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:42,946
(Whistle sound)

461
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:43,906
Go to bed!

462
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:46,606
Wait for me.

463
00:40:48,606 --> 00:40:50,066
You won’t get away that easily.

464
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:53,186
Phaya.

465
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:55,146
Phaya would probably have a wet dream tonight.

466
00:40:58,286 --> 00:41:00,406
Geez, just quit it.

467
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:10,506
Maybe he really likes you. That’s why he drew that girl who looks so much like you.

468
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:18,466
You and him were probably soul mates in the past life.

469
00:41:20,246 --> 00:41:25,566
I knew it. It all began from the incident that day.

470
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,726
(Car horn sound)

471
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:37,726
Let’s go.

472
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:41,906
Woohoo! We’re finally here.

473
00:41:42,846 --> 00:41:44,026
Off you go.

474
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:47,046
I think it’s that way, Tharn.

475
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:51,226
Let’s get something to eat. It’s over 2 hours before the car will arrive.

476
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:52,466
Okay.

477
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:07,246
Hi, babe. We’ve just arrived. I haven’t laid my eyes on any girls, trust me. I’m with Tharn.

478
00:42:07,246 --> 00:42:08,666
Do you want to speak with him?

479
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:12,906
Tharn, go and find something to eat first.

480
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:18,966
I have a hunch that someone might get into trouble before we become a police officer.

481
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:20,966
Just go.

482
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:23,766
Hello, sweety. No, I swear I didn’t look at anyone.

483
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:25,726
Oh, there’s no signal here.

484
00:42:25,906 --> 00:42:27,946
Babe, the signal is really bad here.

485
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:36,706
Can I have Stir-fried Pork with Holy Basil but without basil leaves and chilli please?

486
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:42,046
Oh, no MSG too. And only add half a spoon of salt and sugar. No cooking oil.

487
00:42:42,046 --> 00:42:44,926
No long beans, carrot, or any mushrooms.

488
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:48,866
If you’re going to have it like that, why don’t you just cook it yourself?

489
00:42:48,906 --> 00:42:52,026
Every single year, I have to deal with those pain-in-the-ass PTO like you.

490
00:42:52,026 --> 00:42:53,846
I guess this year it’s you guys then.

491
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,146
Here, just write it down, you rascals.

492
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:04,406
Excuse me? Is there a table for one?

493
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:10,266
Open your eyes and look around. If you can’t wait, then go eat somewhere else.

494
00:43:10,926 --> 00:43:15,926
Go find some place to sit down or else you’d get in the way of the food riders.

495
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,926
Um, you can sit with me if you don’t mind.
- quick

496
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:23,566
Are you done? So that I can take the order from other tables. Make it quick.

497
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:29,086
Hurry up. Other people are waiting. They are hungry too.

498
00:43:29,086 --> 00:43:32,026
You rascals are so annoying.

499
00:43:32,186 --> 00:43:34,746
Here you go. Just write down whatever you want to eat.

500
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,866
Be good though. Don’t be a pain like those rascals.

501
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:42,666
Ma’am, is Order no.138 ready?

502
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:47,432
Just a second. I’m going to do it now.

503
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:49,192
Why is it so busy today?

504
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:58,872
Auntie, can I order something to drink?

505
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:05,486
Hey, lower your voice. Can’t you see that drinks are self-service?

506
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:08,966
- So stupid.
- He’s probably blind.

507
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:10,192
Or can’t read.

508
00:44:16,206 --> 00:44:18,866
There’s an update on a murder case where the victim was found dead with his hands and feet bound.

509
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:22,846
The victim is a male Caucasian with the age of around 30 years old.

510
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:28,626
He was found dead with his hands and feet bound. The police suspect that he was killed…

511
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:31,786
…before his body was hung up in this area of the woods.

512
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:37,106
The police are now gathering witnesses and evidence for the special investigation unit…

513
00:44:37,246 --> 00:44:41,739
…to track down the killer behind this brutal murder.

514
00:44:45,046 --> 00:44:46,826
- Oops!
- Hey!

515
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:51,386
- I’m so sorry.
- It’s all right.

516
00:44:51,546 --> 00:44:56,466
He probably wanted to know whether his jacket is waterproof or not.

517
00:44:57,246 --> 00:44:58,746
Why did you do that?

518
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:06,566
Why did I do what?

519
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:09,379
You stuck out your foot and made me tripped.

520
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:13,346
Do you have any evidence?

521
00:45:16,706 --> 00:45:20,146
I can sue you for falsely accusing me.

522
00:45:21,726 --> 00:45:23,166
Sue me my foot.

523
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:27,856
Did you just push me?

524
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:31,146
- Eat this.
- Hey!

525
00:45:32,926 --> 00:45:34,186
Fuck off.

526
00:45:34,186 --> 00:45:36,496
Ouch!

527
00:45:36,496 --> 00:45:37,566
Damn you.

528
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:39,296
Hey!

529
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:42,096
Ouch.

530
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:43,846
Hey!

531
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:47,539
Let’s go.

532
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:04,856
Go!

533
00:46:08,096 --> 00:46:09,676
My shop is ruined, you rascals!

534
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:13,106
Scumbags! Why did it have to be at my shop?!

535
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:23,856
I have a hunch that my little brother is about to fall in love.

536
00:46:37,476 --> 00:46:39,366
Ouchhhh.

537
00:46:48,076 --> 00:46:50,636
You guys seem to be destined for each other.

538
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:56,236
Let’s ask the abbot to look at your birthdate tomorrow, shall we?

539
00:46:56,766 --> 00:46:59,966
- Just go to sleep.
- Ouch. You rascal.

540
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,236
Is that a corpse?

541
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:26,476
I overheard the instructors talking that it’s a suicide.

542
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,586
I suspect that Lieutenant Tam didn’t kill himself.

543
00:47:30,786 --> 00:47:34,266

545
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:44,730
The Sign

546
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,520
Guys.

547
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,320
The instructor told me that Chart is all right now.

548
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:59,030
He’s coming to pack his things today.

549
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,230
Too bad he has to leave the training.

550
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,430
He’s quite skillful.

551
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,920
He’d have been a great asset to our police force.

552
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,680
He isn’t only skillful but also pretty nasty.

553
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,170
I agree.

554
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,460
Yeah.

555
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,260
Let him be.

556
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,190
Just chuck it. We’re here to train so there must be those who pass and fail.

557
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,010
Yeah, chuck it.

558
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:35,720
I think…

559
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,550
There’s something more interesting.

560
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,370
Tharn

561
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,630
Do you want to know more about the picture that Phaya drew?

562
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,550
Do you want to know where he got the idea from?

563
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,320
Hey.

564
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,680
Aha

565
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,520
- Hey.
- What?

566
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,390
Let’s throw him into the sea.

567
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,610
- Okay.
- I’ll take the arms.

568
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,210
- I’m in.
- Me too.

569
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,700
Shhh!

570
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:11,900
(Stretching)

571
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:16,700
It’s so hot.

572
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,210
What are you guys up to?

573
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,210
(Stretching)

574
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,130
(Stretching)

575
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:31,320
Let’s go!

576
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,630
What the hell are you doing?! Let me go!

577
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,060
- Yai! Let me go!
- Yai!

578
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,100
Let me go!

579
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,210
- Stop it!
- What the fuck’s wrong with you?!

580
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,830
- Go, go!
- Let him go!

581
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,680
- Let’s throw him!
- Let me go!

582
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,880
- Let’s go!
- Stop!

583
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,190
Stop it!

584
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,080
Yai, let me go!

585
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:50,320
-Then you have to tell Tharn where you got the idea for that picture you drew.
- Yeah.

586
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,210
That’s right.

587
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,900
I have nothing to do with this.

588
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,790
- Let him go right now, Yai.
- Fine! Just get off me!

589
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,920
- Get off me!
- Okay.

590
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,010
- You got what you asked for.
- Let’s go.

591
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,630
(Laughing sound)

592
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,950
What the fuck?!

593
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,880
Awww.

594
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,090
What’s wrong with you guys?!

595
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,550
Guys…

596
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,100
Is that a corpse?

597
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,660
Shit!

598
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:43,683
Don’t touch it.

599
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,660
Have you informed the authority?

600
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,880
Call the authority.

601
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,520
Are you sure? I don’t think so.

602
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,850
Yai, what’s wrong?

603
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,920
I know the identity of that corpse.

604
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,590
Who is it?

605
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,630
Lieutenant Tam.

606
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,230
Really?

607
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:29,570
Didn’t he take leave to visit home in Phuket since last week?

608
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,090
Dio you know how he died?

609
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,430
I’ve known it for quite some time. I’m about to tell you guys too.

610
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,430
- Eww, Khem!
- Oops! Sorry.

611
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,120
Go and finish your business first!

612
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,300
Geez.

613
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,570
(Flushing sound)

614
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:56,630
I overheard Captain Akk and the instructors talking that it’s a suicide.

615
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:02,300
When they informed his wife, she said she found a suicide note there.

616
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,920
It said that he was stressed because he couldn’t pay back the gambling debt. So, he killed himself.

617
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:12,030
Lieutenant Tam had a gambling debt?

618
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,350
That’s weird.

619
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,770
Why did he have to come all the way to the camp kill himself here?

620
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,210
Stop chatting

621
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,430
and get ready for the class!

622
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,370
Later then.

623
00:52:56,243 --> 00:52:58,056
- Let’s go.
- Yes, sir.

624
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,280
From now on, the training will be divided into 2 parts.

625
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:25,810
In the morning, you’ll learn some techniques and skills in fighting, and how to use special weapons.

626
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,550
You’ll also have to do a field investigation.

627
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,520
In the afternoon,

628
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,500
you’ll learn the theory of special investigation.

629
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,300
The whole training program will take 200 hours.

630
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,970
There’ll be an exam to evaluate your performance at the end of the training.

631
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,280
I want you all to pay attention and do your best.

632
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:55,320
Your score will affect your chance to be on the special investigation unit.

633
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:00,480
We’d only take 5 of you this year.

634
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:04,860
Yes?

635
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,460
What about those who couldn’t pass the exam?

636
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:11,150
They’ll be allocated to other units.

637
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,610
Any questions?

638
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,660
Yes?

639
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,770
I have doubts about Lieutenant Tams’ death.

640
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,030
Do you really believe that he killed himself?

641
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:45,860
What makes you think he didn’t?

642
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,720
I think it doesn’t make sense.

643
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,750
You can’t rely on your feelings during the investigation.

644
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,810
You need evidence.

645
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,970
Find the evidence to confirm or contradict your feelings.

646
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,770
Okay

647
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:14,790
I’ll find the evidence to confirm whether he killed himself or not.

648
00:55:58,770 --> 00:55:59,830
Phaya.

649
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,060
Wait up

650
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:09,230
I want to talk about what happened this morning.

651
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,320
Which one?

652
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:17,410
The one where Yai threw me into the sea, or the one where you stole a kiss from me.

653
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,790
I didn’t kiss you. It was an accident.

654
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,170
Do you really think I want to kiss you so badly?

655
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,210
Hey!

656
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:30,860
Why didn’t you tell me you’d stop?

657
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,590
My butt hurts because of you.

658
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,880
Do you want me to help carry you back? Looks like it really hurts.

659
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,370
Come on.

660
00:56:41,576 --> 00:56:42,856
I can walk by myself.

661
00:56:45,123 --> 00:56:47,256
You’re such an ass!

662
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,920
You know what? When you’re whining like a kid like this…

663
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,970
you actually look cute somehow.

664
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,880
Cute my foot.

665
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:02,260
I don’t give a damn if you’re angry with me because of what happened this morning.

666
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,990
I forgave you since when you stole my kiss

667
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,280
Hey!

668
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,520
Asshole.

669
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,370
Where are you going, Phaya?

670
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,480
Hey!

671
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,810
Hey!

672
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:25,550
Wait up!

673
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,480
Hey, stop stop!

674
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,120
Why are you in a hurry? Where are you going?

675
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:44,790
Tharn.

676
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,480
We’re going to celebrate surviving the training from hell tonight. Do you want to join us?

677
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:50,750
Do you want to join us?

678
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,170
Yeah. Are there boozes too? I want to drink.

679
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:01,060
You? You want to drink?

680
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,880
Wow

681
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,280
Why? Did you have a quarrel with someone?

682
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:11,590
I had a quarrel with a jellyfish. It stung me by getting on my nerve.

683
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,280
Hey, what the heck? What’s wrong?

684
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,030
Whom did you quarrel with? Just tell me.

685
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,060
How can you quarrel with a jellyfish? Do you think he’s nuts?

686
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:26,900
The one who’s nuts is you. How can you believe what he said?

687
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,520
- Is there a brain in there?
- Ouch.

688
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,390
It hurst as if I was stung by the jellyfish.

689
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:33,230
How do you know? Have you ever got stung by a jellyfish?

690
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,790
No, but I have tasted it. Boo!

691
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:36,320
Boo, my foot.

692
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,920
Why do you have to be so serious?

693
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:40,100
You’re starting to like me again, aren’t you?

694
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,630
Stop fooling around.

695
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:45,060
I can’t because my life is like a fool.

696
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,280
Baby, wait for me.

697
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,120
Shrimps, shells, crabs…where’s fish?

698
00:59:00,896 --> 00:59:01,990
Squid?

699
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,230
Look how he smells them.

700
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,550
Thank you!

701
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,060
Just sit down!

702
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:16,680
I was wondering why Sergeant granted us permission to come out.

703
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,730
It’s actually because he wants us to eat at his wife’s restaurant.

704
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,300
Shhh! Keep your voice down.

705
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,970
Yai, take care of him.

706
00:59:23,896 --> 00:59:24,880
- Got it, Sergeant.
- Just smack him in the head.

707
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,460
Hang on. Let me do it.

708
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,880
- Yai
- Just smack him in the head.

709
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,570
Hang on. Let me do it.

710
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,190
- Okay then.
- Please enjoy your meal.

711
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:40,300
Why are you bickering? How nice it is that we can get out of the camp tonight?

712
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,300
Okay, guys. Cheers!

713
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,410
For the survivors of the training from hell!

714
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,700
Let’s stand up!

715
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,990
Cheers!

716
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:56,520
- I’m all wet.
- Ahh, feeling so fresh.

717
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,730
This is what I call life.

718
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:07,650
By the way, where is Phaya? Didn’t we invite him too?

719
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,590
- We did. We invited everyone.
- I already told him.

720
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:13,700
He was playing hard to get. Leave him be.

721
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,970
- Baby, do you want to eat anything? I’ll get it for you.
- No need.

722
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:27,430
Can I ask you guys something? Are you two broken up?

723
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:28,950
- No.
- Yes.

724
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,260
Huh?

725
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,660
So, what is it? Are you guys still together?

726
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:35,920
Of course not. I was so tired while we were still together.

727
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,860
Tired of getting hurt because I was cheated.

728
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,790
If you know anyone who is single, please recommend him to me.

729
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:44,990
Okay.

730
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,830
Maybe I might not want to stay single any more.

731
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:49,080
Don’t listen to him, Yai. Forget it.

732
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,790
- What’s that?
- Baby, don’t be like this.

733
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:57,590
Tharn is my type too. But I’m not sure if you’re still single.

734
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:01,860
My bro is not only single. He’s a virgin too.

735
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,500
He’s never done it with anyone before.

736
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:09,280
Really? You’ve only done it with your hands, right?

737
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,080
Hey,

738
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,860
watch your mouth.

739
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:13,520
Ouch, baby.

740
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:18,810
Are you really single? Why?

741
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,950
I haven’t met the right one yet.

742
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:24,390
I like being alone too.

743
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:30,720
It’s okay, bro. Don’t look so sad. You’re having it quite bad, huh?

744
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,550
Let’s not talk about love.

745
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,550
Let’s talk about something else.

746
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,720
He’s quite unlucky in love.

747
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,150
As if he were cursed.

748
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,480
It’s you who have cursed me.

749
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,320
I was just kidding.

750
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,570
- Hey.
- Where’re you going?

751
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:51,550
I was just pulling your leg. Are you really going to leave?

752
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:52,460
I’m going to wee.

753
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,120
Let’s drink to that then.

754
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,950
- Down in, Thongthai.
- Yeah.

755
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,610
Okay.

756
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:16,280
Geez, what’s wrong with the zipper?

757
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,230
Let me help you.

758
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,260
What the fuck are you doing?

759
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,300
If you don’t need my help then do you want me to zip it back down?

760
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,920
- my help then do you want me to zip it back down?
- No.

761
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,970
What took you so long?

762
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:00,550
I’ve been here for a while. I went smoking outside.

763
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,280
Is it true that you are still single?

764
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,350
Why are you interested?

765
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,080
I didn’t at first.

766
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:22,390
But when I found out that you’re still single, you suddenly become interesting to me.

767
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:27,920
(Tharn’s thought: What are you saying, Phaya?)

768
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:32,990
(Tharn’s thought: Stop looking at me like that.)

769
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,430
(Tharn’s thought: And why am I blushing?)

770
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:41,610
Why are you interested in me?

771
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:46,060
Well, I just wonder…

772
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:51,720
that you’re quite grown up but still single and virgin too.

773
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:56,030
I never know that a virgin would look like this.

774
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,260
Hey!

775
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,630
Asshole!

776
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:03,100
You evil nasty jellyfish!

777
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,770
I’ve got a lot queuing up for me. I just don’t want to be with them.

778
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,230
Damn it!

779
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,570
What’s up, guys?

780
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,550
Phaya, where have you been?

781
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:29,320
I just went to the loo.

782
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,150
Cheers!

783
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:35,120
- You’re late. I’m so drunk already.
- Cheers!

784
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:39,100
Serg! Bravo!

785
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:43,830
Awesome, Serg!

786
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,920
- He’s so drunk.
- Serg! Hey, hey, hey…

787
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,430
Khem!

788
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,170
- Khem!
- Yai, look at him.

789
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,370
Khem!
- Yai, get him back here.

790
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:56,120
You guys, come out and dance with me.

791
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:56,950
Geez!

792
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,890
Yai, get him back here.

793
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:03,010
Geez,

794
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,880
he’s so drunk.

795
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,030
- Go back to your table.
- Oh, come on.

796
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:07,720
Go sit down.

797
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,810
Hey, cheers.

798
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:10,810
Okay.

799
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:13,770
Come on, Yai.

800
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,900
- You’re too loud.
- Just sit down.

801
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,520
- Sit down, Khem.
- Sit down.

802
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,950
Let’s play a game.

803
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,080
- What game?
- Clear the table.

804
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,860
- Move that away.
- What game?

805
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:34,030
It’s called ‘Spin the Bottle’ game.

806
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,300
Spin the bottle?

807
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:40,250
If the bottle points towards anyone,

808
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:45,080
that person must answer the question asked by the others.

809
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,350
If that person refuses to answer,

810
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:52,080
he must down the glass.

811
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,030
Down it?

812
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:56,010
- Got it?
- Okay, let’s play.

813
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:57,700
- Bring it on.
- Yeah.

814
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,100
First, let’s fill up your glass.

815
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,210
What? Again?

816
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:03,590
- Fill up his glass too.
- You go first.

817
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:06,680
Now, we’re all even.

818
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,610
You’re so wasted, Khem.

819
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,750
Come, come.

820
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:18,260
Tharn.

821
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,390
Who’s going to ask?

822
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:21,700
Khem, you ask him.

823
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:31,700
Do you like anyone in this table?

824
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:39,170
- Answer me.
- Answer, answer, answer!

825
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,320
Oh, come on.

826
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,460
Then you spin it.

827
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,480
- Down it.
- Spin it.

828
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:49,520
Spin it, Tharn.

829
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,350
- Oh, Yai.
- It’s your turn.

830
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:56,790
Why me?

831
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,810
- I’ll ask you.
- Okay.

832
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,720
What is he like when he’s drunk?

833
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,030
Why are you laughing?

834
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,350
- Do you really want to know?
- Yeah.

835
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:09,880
- I don’t want to imagine it.
- You know?

836
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,610
I just went out with him. He got drunk and jumped into the canal naked.

837
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,430
Ohhh!

838
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,060
- Naked?
- Yes.

839
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,460
Do you want to see it today?

840
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,480
Then, let’s get him drunk!

841
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,410
- Mine is empty.
- Let’s fill it up.

842
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,610
Cheers!

843
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:37,010
It’s Yai again.

844
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:41,790
Down it.

845
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:50,990
Shhh! Keep it down.

846
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,520
Are you okay?

847
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,970
Let’s go.

848
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,010
Let’s go.

849
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,060
Aren’t you going to help?

850
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,120
He’s your brother, not mine.

851
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:15,550
But he’s so drunk because you encouraged him to drink and play that stupid bottle game.

852
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,900
Why are you so interested in his life?

853
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,750
Everyone already left but you still stuck around and encouraged him to drink.

854
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:24,410
Everyone already left but you still stuck around and encouraged him to drink.

855
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:35,210
- Phaya.
- Shhh!

856
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,630
Keep your voice down, Yai.

857
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:40,430
Geez, is he going to be all right?

858
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,810
The instructor’s coming this way.

859
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:47,190
Shhh!

860
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,830
About Lieutenant Tam’s case, what are you going to do next?

861
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,260
They told us to close the case and treat it as a suicide.

862
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,900
They already took away all the forensic evidence.

863
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:06,700
Tell our men to collect more data and evidence.

864
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:11,170
Both around the place where the body was found, and the surrounding area.

865
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:17,430
Thoroughly check all the surveillance cameras, both in land and water.

866
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,700
Make sure you send all the data to me first.

867
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,680
What about the request from the authority to explore the area for gathering more evidence?

868
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:32,720
Tell them that we’d gather all the info and evidence and will forward it to them.

869
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:34,630
But not right now.

870
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:42,900
I’m going to keep it confidential first.

871
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:44,950
Please gather all the data for me.

872
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,230
Yes, Captain.

873
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:17,260
I’m not going to force any of you to go with me.

874
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,880
But if I turn a blind eye to this matter, I don’t think I’d deserve to become a cop

875
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:22,190
I’m in.

876
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:24,460
If you’re in, I’ll do it too.

877
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:25,880
Me too.

878
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,880
What are they doing here?

879
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,550
They said they lost something at the beach,

880
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:33,260
so they want to look at the surveillance camera dated 2 days back.

881
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:39,430
Master Sakuna-naparuj, come this way.
