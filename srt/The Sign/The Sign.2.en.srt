We’d be training non-stop.

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,940
- Got it?
- Hooya!

4
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:08,340
We’re missing one person.

5
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:16,540
Who’s this girl you’re drawing? She looks so much like Tharn.

6
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:17,826
Wansarut?

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,280
Why is it similar to Tharn’s name?

8
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,786
Is your name Wansa?

9
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:22,240
Yeah.

10
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:23,533
Is that a corpse?

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,306
About Lieut Tam case, what are you going to do next?

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,546

I’m going to keep it confidential first.

00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,346
Please give me the file.

32
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:10,546
Yes, Captain.

33
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,226
Tharn, take Yai to back to our dorm first.

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,813
I have to find out about something.

35
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:31,346
Where are you going?

36
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,700
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:09,700
What about Yai?

38
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:11,880
He already passed out.

39
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:15,400
Are you curious about Lieut Tam case?

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,546
So am I.

41
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:22,160
Fine, you keep watch then.

[Door unlocking sound]

45
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,440
Why are you getting so close?

46
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,480
I can’t see it.

47
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,040
Why didn’t you find a better place, somewhere with more space?

48
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,660
Shh! Do you want Captain to find out and sack us out of the camp?

49
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,900
The cause of death is drowning because there were trace of water found in the lungs.

50
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,573
He probably died from suffocation because of the water in his lungs.

51
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:41,333
High possibility of suicide.

52
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,626
But Captain Akk thought he was silenced.

53
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,520
So, Captain Akk definitely knows what operation Lieut Tam was doing.

54
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,213
But in this case file, it says that…

55
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:03,580
there are bruises around his body, arms, and legs. There’s a mark that looks like he was hit by a solid object too.

56
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,240
But it doesn’t say what the actual cause is.

57
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,240
If Lieut Tam was killed…

58
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,460
why did the culprit dump his body around our camp?

59
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:22,746
Wasn’t that too risky?

60
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,560
It might be a warning…

61
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,386
to let us know that they knew about Lieut Tam’s real identity, that he disguised himself as a drug dealer.

62
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:42,013
Yeah.

63
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:52,600
What did you find?

64
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,573
I think this knot on his ankles…

65
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,826
Lieut Tam didn’t tie it by himself.

66
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,120
How do you know?

67
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:13,880
I just know.

68
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,120
Tell me.

69
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
[Sound of door opening]

70
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,200
Where are you going? Come back here.

71
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,480
I’m sleepy. Go back to your bed.

72
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,266
No, I’m not leaving…

73
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:14,933
until you’d tell me.

74
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:26,480
Then sleep here tonight.

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,813
I happen to be in need of a bolster.

76
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,620
Let me go.

77
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,546
Let me go.

78
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:35,613
Let me go.

79
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:37,400
Sleep here.

80
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:40,560
The instructor is coming!

81
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,413
Are you going to be my bolster?

82
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:07,826
Just get your sleep.

83
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,400
Where are you going, bolster?

84
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,613
Sleep!

85
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,400

86
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:29,146
Hooya!

87
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:48,506
Go!

88
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,240
Tharn.

89
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:23,173
I dreamt that you and Phaya were cuddling on his bed.

90
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:26,760
As if you guys were doing something intimacy.

91
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,986
It was just a dream.

92
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:34,933
Cut it out and get ready for the class.

93
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:36,666
Fine, fine.

94
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,440
Sit down.

95
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:34,453
Open your book and turn to page 24.

96
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,200
Section 4: Criminal Liability.

97
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,980
Let’s see the definition of deliberated or intentional act or behaviour.

98
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,026
It’s the act or behaviour committed intentionally while being well aware of such act or behaviour.

99
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,653
If such act or behaviour is committed by negligence, it is not considered as deliberated act or behaviour.

100
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,220
Left, left, left, left…

101
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,580
- 8, 9, 10.
- Together.

102
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,546
That kick was really awesome.

103
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:02,746
I almost couldn’t get back up.

104
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,613
Tharn.

105
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,960
Water.

106
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,026
Thanks.

107
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:09,840
No problem.

108
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:14,933
Hey.

109
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,200
You guys are getting better.

110
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:19,653
Let’s hear it for yourself.

111
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:21,880
- Thank you, sir. / - Thank you.

112
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,026
Keep trying

113
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:23,893
I’m sorry about earlier, sir.

114
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,746
It’s all right. You did good.

115
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,733
Geez, I thought we’d be able to relax a bit after that hellish week of training.

116
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,106
Nothing has come into my head since the morning class.

117
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:36,533
Holding a gun and hunting down criminals is enough for a police officer.

118
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,920
Can we talk?

119
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:55,480
What do you want?

120
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,293
Don’t you want to find out more about Lieut Tam case? About that knot?

121
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,373
Sit down.

122
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:00,173
Sit.

123
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,080
- I’m leaving.
- Sit down, Tharn.

124
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:03,200
Sit.

125
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:06,506
Sit still.

126
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,560
Put your legs together.

127
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,733
What are you doing?

128
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:18,140
Just stay still and watch. Don’t you want to know the truth?

129
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:26,320
If Lieut Tam really wanted to kill himself, he’d have tied a knot like this.

130
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,026
But look.

131
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:33,940
This is the photo I took from the case file.

132
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:40,706
The knot tied by yourself and by the other will look completely different.

133
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:47,506
If Lieut Tam committed suicide, the knot must be at the front.

134
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,426
But in this photo, the knot is at the back.

135
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,813
This means someone else must tie it for him.

136
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,000
Exactly.

137
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:58,733
Let’s tell Captain Akk about this.

138
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,200
We still don’t have enough evidence.

139
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:05,746
Didn’t you hear what Captain said? The authority ordered him to have this case closed.

140
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:11,586
This means the one behind Lieut Tam’s death must be very powerful.

141
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:14,400
We must gather more evidence.

142
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:20,373
But if we need more evidence, will just the two of us capable enough?

143
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,200
It’s five of us.

144
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,880
Spill everything out right now.

145
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:53,706
Did you know Lieut Tam before coming to this camp?

146
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,813
He was my senior at the university.

147
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,664
When I heard that he killed himself because of the gambling debt, I didn’t believe a single word of it.

148
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:04,448
Before Lieut Tam joined the special investigation team,

149
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,544
he was one of the best in arresting the criminal gangs for operating online gambling and drug trafficking.

150
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,104
And from what I heard from other instructors,

151
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,640
on the night before his death, he was seen around his lodging.

152
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,752
But he didn’t report himself at the camp.

153
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:25,568
Khem, are you investigating about this case too?

154
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:29,580
Thongthai and I sneaked out to

155
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:34,100
The door was locked. There was lots of dust on the lock too.

156
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:39,792
If Lieut Tam was really seen around there that night, he should be back in his lodging, shouldn’t he?

157
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:45,024
What if it wasn’t Lieut Tam who was at the lodging?

158
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:48,448
It was probably someone who tried to fabricate the false evidence.

159
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,080
Then we have to start from finding out who that person is.

160
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,272
But it’s not easy at all.

161
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:05,952
How are we going to find some time to investigate on this?

162
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:09,980
We barely have enough time to rest with all those trainings and classes.

163
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,808
Also,

164
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,420
If Captain Akk finds out, we’d probably get sacked.

165
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,192
I’m not forcing anyone to do it.

166
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:34,416
But I’m going to do it.

167
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:37,648
I’ve decided to become a cop.

168
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:40,224
If I ignore this,

169
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:42,928
I won’t deserve to be called a police officer.

170
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:50,496
Then I’ll do it too.

171
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,240
If he’s in then I’m also in.

172
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,992
Me too.

173
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:18,860
Tharn, are you sure?

174
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,696
Just one false move,

175
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,944
your dream for joining the special investigation force in order to investigate about your dad’s death would all be shattered.

176
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:32,400
If you do something good, some good things will surely happen to you.

177
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,568
Think of it as a test before we’d officially become a cop.

178
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:19,260
Master Sakunanopparuj, this way please.

The Sign

181
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,359
What are they doing here?

182
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:03,703
They said they lost something at the beach.

183
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,855
So, they asked if they could check the CCTV camera dated 2 days back.

184
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:09,799
2 nights ago?

185
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,735
I’ve checked the CCTV camera.

186
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:41,785
I couldn’t see Lieut Tam anywhere.

187
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,460
What did you say? Thongthai and Kem wanted to see the island map?

188
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:57,026
Yes, sir.

189
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:32,432
Baby

190
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:36,752
Baby and I got new information.

191
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:39,106
Baby, tell them what we’ve got.

192
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:42,843
Don't you see it?

193
00:21:57,837 --> 00:22:00,752
I did some research on the tidal pattern of the sea level.

194
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:07,677
There are 2 tidal patterns in the Gulf of Thailand
Diurnal tides and Mixed tides.

195
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:12,555
In the Andaman, it’s only Semidiurnal tides.

196
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:19,315
Wow, you’re so good at this, Baby.  How come I never knew it before.

197
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,195
Because you were always falling asleep in class.

198
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,140
Absolutely right.

199
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,015
Geez.

200
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:33,355
I checked the CCTV on the day
that Lieut Tam was said to be seen near his lodging.

201
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:35,837
I couldn’t see him anywhere.

202
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:43,026
Let’s compare the info you’ve got with the night
that Lieut Tam was said to commit suicide.

203
00:22:44,203 --> 00:22:45,792
There was a depression that night.

204
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:52,969
Suppose Lieut Tam did commit suicide on the beach,
it was impossible to find his body on the shore.

205
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,883
Unless…

206
00:22:57,045 --> 00:23:01,780
he killed himself at the other side of this island.
The tide would then carry his body back to shore.

207
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:09,795
Then we need to find more evidence there.

208
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:13,917
Do you really think there’d be anything left for you to find out there?

209
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:16,706
Well, in case the evidence lies under the sea.

210
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:20,592
The body was carried by the tides, wasn’t it?
It didn’t fall down from the sky.

211
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:25,609
Why are you surprised?

212
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:28,592
I did learn about it, you know.

213
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:29,929
Shut up, Khem.

214
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:31,963
I need to think.

215
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:05,083
Master Phaya.

216
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,995
Master Phaya.

217
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:34,595
Master Sakunanopparuj, this way please.

218
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,769
Phaya!

219
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:03,140
Phaya!

220
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:05,175
What the hell are you doing, Phaya?

221
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,603
Phaya.

222
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:12,155
Phaya.

223
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:19,060
Th…Tharn.

224
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:25,952
That voice…

225
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,706
Was it you?

226
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,512
What are you talking about?

227
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,860
Get yourself together.

228
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:44,672
Tharn.

229
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:54,157
Why do you look like that person in my dream?

230
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:03,346
What are you trying to do?

231
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,946
Do you think you’re a real officer now?

232
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,420
No, sir.

233
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:14,795
But isn’t it our job as a police officer to find out the truth?

234
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:15,609
Is it?

235
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,837
But I don’t see any police officer here.

236
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:21,929
Being a cop isn’t just about showing off or being mister smarty pants.

237
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:28,706
Do you really understand the meaning of ‘duty’?!
Or ‘rules and regulations?! Or even ‘discipline’?!

238
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:34,112
Just do your job and mind your own business!

239
00:28:36,077 --> 00:28:42,155
But we did all that
because we wanted to proof Lieut Tam didn’t kill himself.

240
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:44,695
You also think the same too, don’t you.

241
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,923
What I think about this case is none of your business.

242
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:57,015
If you want to become a real cop,
you must learn to be responsible for your job.
Know your job and do your best with it.

243
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:05,115
What you did tonight is a serious breach of discipline.

244
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,569
If I find you doing anything like this again,

245
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:12,306
you will not get another second chance.

246
00:29:14,957 --> 00:29:16,877
you will be expelled immediately!

247
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:18,055
Got it?

248
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:20,055
Hooya!

249
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:21,563
Do you get it?!

250
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:22,660
Hooya!

251
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:29,655
And not just the two of them.

252
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:34,729
But including everyone who takes part in this silly game too.

253
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:44,260
If you know that your name is in here,

254
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:46,306
come to the front.

255
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:48,992
NOW!

256
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:13,552
You all have committed a shameful act
by violating the camp regulations…

257
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,363
and disobeyed your superior’s orders.

258
00:30:21,312 --> 00:30:24,066
It is considered a serious breach of discipline.

259
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,215
You have no rights to stick your nose
into the official authority’s business.

260
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:35,460
If you really think you are good enough…

261
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:40,957
and want to bring justice to Lieut Tam,

262
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:44,192
just do your best in what you’re assigned to do.

263
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,500
Pass the exam and become a real cop.

264
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:52,969
I’ll keep watching to see…

265
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:59,675
if a smartass who is crying for justice like you…

266
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:03,140
Would only bark but not bite.

267
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,963
And since you’ve done something wrong tonight,

268
00:31:10,695 --> 00:31:15,075
you will be punished so that the others will not follow suit.

269
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,335
Prepare for stress position!

270
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:20,557
Hooya!

271
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:35,849
Captain, I’ve looked at the evidence that
those kids could find. They were quite good.

272
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:42,355
It’d be great if they can join the special investigation team.

273
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:50,169
It doesn’t matter how talented they are,
if they can’t follow the rules and be disciplined…

274
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:53,323
those talents are just a waste.

275
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,192
Guys,

276
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:26,855
I’m…

277
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,392
I’m really sorry.

278
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,586
for making us all in trouble.

279
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:42,352
It’s all right.

280
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:45,997
Just forget it.

281
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:47,872
What’s done is done.

282
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:49,015
Yeah.

283
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:54,215
We were acting like a smartass just like what Captain said.

284
00:32:58,717 --> 00:33:00,923
I think what he said was actually right.

285
00:33:02,245 --> 00:33:07,220
For us to become a good cop, we stick to the rules

286
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,426
Starting from passing the exam first.

287
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:20,169
I will definitely pass it.

288
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:26,066
Then I’ll shout in his face that I’m on the special investigation team.

289
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,369
Me too.

290
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,635
Let’s do our best to pass the exam.

291
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:39,517
Let’s do it.

292
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:40,203
Yeah.

293
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:44,169
Hooya!

294
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,180
Hooya!

295
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:53,643
Bring it on.

296
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:57,895
Go on, Tharn!

297
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,043
Go!

298
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:28,500

299
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:30,043
(Shooting sound)

300
00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:06,877
Time’s up.

301
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,535
It’s a tie.

302
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:28,066
Hey, why didn’t you tell me first that you’d take a selfie?

303
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:29,997
So that I could pose for it.

304
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:30,946
You already look nice.

305
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,500
I like it.

Are you filming an MV or what? It’s time to bed.

309
00:36:08,142 --> 00:36:10,655
I was just pondering about something.

310
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:14,739
Does a person like you have anything to ponder about?

311
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:22,622
I have a question that needed an answer.

312
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:26,681
Oh, you’re quite serious, aren’t you?

313
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:43,661
Tharn, do you believe in the past lives or reincarnation?

314
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:49,565
I do. The Abbot often told me about it.

315
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:56,489
That what we did in our past life will affect us in this life.

316
00:36:57,076 --> 00:37:00,266
Like what people said,

317
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:05,043
Everything happens for a reason. There’s no coincidence.

318
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:13,448
It happens because it has already been destined by something called…

319
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:15,168
Commitment.

320
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:18,702
Yeah.

321
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:26,248
You were born into this family of yours, and surrounded by your friends…

322
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:31,368
Because you might have had some commitment with those people in the past life.

323
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:42,121
So, you’re telling me that the reason I’ve you in this life…

324
00:37:42,582 --> 00:37:47,547
is because we had a commitment in our past lives.

325
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:56,754
What if it’s true?

326
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,196
What did you promise me?

327
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:05,731
Is that why you’re always there to rescue me?

328
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:13,827
That’s the question that I need to know an answer.

329
00:38:14,665 --> 00:38:17,343
What’s the reason behind this?

330
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:30,753
In the past life, I was probably a rich and kind-hearted man who liked to rescue cows like you from the slaughter house.

331
00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:33,525
Asshole.

332
00:38:34,017 --> 00:38:41,499
Or you were probably a caring wife who always took a great care of a good-looking hubby like me.

333
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:49,492
I see. This is what a handsome cow looks like.

334
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:52,568
- Now, you’re pissing me off.
- Ouch! I was just kidding.

335
00:38:53,795 --> 00:38:55,608
Just stop thinking about it.

336
00:38:58,412 --> 00:39:02,688
What are you going to do after the training is done?

337
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:12,288
If I can pass the exam, I’ll surely have something more interesting to do.

338
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:15,977
What about you?

339
00:39:17,946 --> 00:39:24,950
If I pass the exam, I’ll do what I’ve always wanted to do.

340
00:39:29,928 --> 00:39:31,262
What is it?

341
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:34,982
Can you stop being nosy?

342
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:41,995
Let’s go. It’s time for bed or else we’d get punished again.

Mr. Wansa Raksil.

353
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:33,128
Salute!

354
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:38,115
Turn around!

355
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:41,888
Salute!

356
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,328
Captain.

357
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:57,608
What is it?

358
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:00,862
We did it.

359
00:41:08,412 --> 00:41:11,968
You just passed the training. Don’t be so full of yourself.

360
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,075
You haven’t been on a real mission yet.

361
00:41:14,995 --> 00:41:16,635
It’s a lot more tough.

362
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:20,262
You couldn’t believe it, could you?

363
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:24,608
That people like us would be able to pass the exam and be on the special investigation team.

364
00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:28,715
Thank you, Captaion.

365
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,622
We’re looking forward to working with you, Captain.

366
00:41:35,835 --> 00:41:39,982
One day, we’d proof it to you that we are able to be a great cop.

367
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:43,595
I’ll wait for that day.

368
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:45,502
Yes, sir.

369
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:54,448
- Well done.
- Thank you.

370
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:56,582
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

371
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:57,382
Bravo!

372
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:11,875
What a relief.

373
00:42:13,928 --> 00:42:17,302
Hello, grandma.  I finally did it.

374
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:18,942
I’m now a police officer.

375
00:42:20,002 --> 00:42:22,782
Next, I’m going to find out about my parent’s death.

376
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:26,902
I’ll find some time to visit you soon.

377
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:29,248
Please take care.

378
00:43:11,982 --> 00:43:13,288
Tharn.

379
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:16,688
Can I borrow your phone?

380
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:18,728
Phone?

381
00:43:19,142 --> 00:43:20,102
Yeah.

382
00:43:30,612 --> 00:43:33,088
That’s my number.

383
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:36,248
But I didn’t ask.

384
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:41,462
But I want you to have it.

385
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:51,062
Are you stalking me?

386
00:44:21,262 --> 00:44:22,902
I want to give you this cap.

387
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:32,555
Are you copying me?

388
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:37,555
If you could do it to me, why can’t I do it too?

389
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,075
Did you just take a photo of me?

390
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:56,968
I’m going to use it as a calling ID.

391
00:44:59,128 --> 00:45:03,142
Why didn’t you tell me first so that I could pose for it?

392
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:10,422
You already look nice.

393
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:13,942
I like it.

394
00:45:19,955 --> 00:45:22,742
I’ll store your number as…

395
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,448
Bolster.

396
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:30,262
I’ll give you ca call. Let’s go out and find something to eat.

397
00:45:30,782 --> 00:45:34,755
Think of it as returning the favor for always helping me.

398
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:39,915
No need.

399
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,382
I don’t want to see you that often.

400
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:49,035
But I do.

401
00:45:55,528 --> 00:45:56,422
So what?

402
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,342
Hey

403
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:04,848
Hey, are you guys going to stay over at the camp?

404
00:46:05,168 --> 00:46:06,568
Don’t you want to go home?

405
00:46:06,982 --> 00:46:09,515
Go pack your things. I want to go home so badly.

406
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:13,008
I’ll call you.

407
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:14,875
Bolster.

408
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:20,244
- Let’s go, Yai.
- ‘kay.

409
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:40,648
Bolster?

410
00:46:46,968 --> 00:46:50,275
You like him, don’t you?

411
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,355
No.

412
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:56,408
He’s so annoying. Why would I like him?

413
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:00,648
Just tell me honestly if you like him.

414
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:03,608
I’m going to help protect him too.

415
00:47:07,902 --> 00:47:13,168
Tharn, I really hope you’d find that someone you like.

416
00:47:14,155 --> 00:47:15,488
And be with someone you love.

417
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:19,862
I thought you already know…

418
00:47:21,102 --> 00:47:22,675
that if I love someone,

419
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:25,955
that person will die.

420
00:47:29,035 --> 00:47:31,182
I don’t want anyone to die because of me.

421
00:47:32,048 --> 00:47:34,115
I don’t want to feel that kind of grief anymore.

422
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:52,328
We have a week to rest before starting our work at the unit. Let’s go party, shall we?

423
00:47:53,355 --> 00:47:56,942
I’m in. We were stuck in this training camp for 7 months.

424
00:47:57,132 --> 00:47:59,335
I really miss all those fun and the crowds.

425
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:01,062
I miss the old days.

426
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:07,162
Khem, are you thinking about your ex?

427
00:48:07,995 --> 00:48:11,595
I like that. But you’re getting me in trouble.

428
00:48:11,728 --> 00:48:14,848
Right now, I only have eyes for my baby.

429
00:48:17,955 --> 00:48:20,115
So, are we going?

430
00:48:21,622 --> 00:48:23,702
Yai and I have to go back to Nong Khai province.

431
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:28,555
I’m worried about the Abbot. We’ve left him alone for too long.

432
00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:31,408
And we won’t have much time to look after him once we start working.

433
00:48:31,902 --> 00:48:35,142
You’re from Nong Khai?

434
00:48:35,968 --> 00:48:37,142
Yeah.

435
00:48:39,522 --> 00:48:41,248
So, do we have to go to Nong Khai?

436
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,235
You seem interested in him a lot.

437
00:48:45,368 --> 00:48:47,648
Okay, listen up.

438
00:48:48,608 --> 00:48:50,288
Just come to Nongkai with us tonight.

439
00:48:52,448 --> 00:48:55,515
I’ll send you the time and place.

440
00:48:56,448 --> 00:49:01,648
But first, let me tell my wife that I’m going home.

441
00:49:03,372 --> 00:49:04,355
See you.

442
00:49:04,755 --> 00:49:08,062
- Bye.
- See ya.

443
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:12,262
Tharn, let’s meet at the car.

444
00:49:12,368 --> 00:49:13,262
Hi, sweety.

445
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:16,142
- See you.
- Okay.

446
00:49:18,728 --> 00:49:19,715
See you.

447
00:49:27,222 --> 00:49:28,195
Tharn.

448
00:49:28,952 --> 00:49:29,768
Tharn!

449
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:32,955
Shit, I’m sorry.

450
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:36,642
Wait! It’s not what you think.

451
00:49:36,642 --> 00:49:43,602

452
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:50,697
The Sign

453
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:53,377
Cheers!

454
00:49:57,687 --> 00:50:00,850
- Are you okay, Tharn?
- Yes.

455
00:50:00,863 --> 00:50:02,743
- It’s just one bottle.
- I’ve just arrived.

456
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:03,943
Are you okay?

457
00:50:04,737 --> 00:50:07,077
Aren’t you the one who’s not good at drinking, Khem?

458
00:50:07,897 --> 00:50:14,837
This way, Phaya! He’s here.

459
00:50:15,103 --> 00:50:16,303
Wow, he’s looking good.

460
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:20,503
Oh, what a head turner. All the girls are looking at him.

461
00:50:21,377 --> 00:50:26,450
- Come sit down. Hey, scoot over.
- Hey, scoot over.

462
00:50:27,497 --> 00:50:29,077
Here, take a swig.

463
00:50:29,077 --> 00:50:31,297
- Now?
- You’re late so take a swig.

464
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:37,970
If anyone got you as a boyfriend, he or she would surely have a headache. You’re so popular.

465
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:41,383
- Yeah, so handsome.
- Babe, don’t make fun of him.

466
00:50:41,383 --> 00:50:44,297
Listen, I’m telling you right here…

467
00:50:44,743 --> 00:50:46,297
I only have eyes for the one I love.

468
00:50:46,597 --> 00:50:48,170
If I love anyone…

469
00:50:48,383 --> 00:50:49,983
I’ll never…

470
00:50:49,977 --> 00:50:51,903
(Phone ringing)

471
00:50:51,897 --> 00:50:53,183
Talking about the devil…

472
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:58,050
Wow, who’s she? So gorgeous.

473
00:50:58,047 --> 00:51:00,090
- So beautiful.
- Khem.

474
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:01,090
Gorgeous, isn’t she?

475
00:51:01,087 --> 00:51:03,690
- Is your girlfriend calling?
- Khem, you jerk.

476
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:05,503
He’s embarrassed.

477
00:51:05,497 --> 00:51:07,970
- Where are you going?
- I have to take this call.

478
00:51:08,047 --> 00:51:10,757
So sweet.

479
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,527
What a sweet couple.

480
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,970
- Cheers!
- Okay.

481
00:51:21,343 --> 00:51:23,277
Do you want anything? I’m going to place an order.

482
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:26,463
- I want one of this.
- Me too.

483
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:30,370
- Make it three.
- Okay, three bottles then.

484
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:31,730
Hurry up and get back.

485
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,397
Five bottles of beer, please.

486
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,170
Can I have two on the rock, please?

487
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:51,037
Hello.

488
00:51:51,717 --> 00:51:52,530
Hello.

489
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:53,637
Are you here with your friends?

490
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,303
Yes.

491
00:51:55,297 --> 00:51:56,797
They seem to enjoy it a lot.

492
00:51:59,063 --> 00:52:00,277
My name is Oat.

493
00:52:01,343 --> 00:52:02,223
I’m Tharn.

494
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:03,743
Nice to meet you.

495
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:04,850
Same here.

496
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,117
This one is on me.

497
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,543
Did you order this for me?

498
00:52:22,063 --> 00:52:23,463
Thanks a lot, pal.

499
00:52:23,663 --> 00:52:25,317
You really know what I like.

500
00:52:30,877 --> 00:52:31,677
who’s this?

501
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,417
I’m Oat.

502
00:52:34,303 --> 00:52:37,937
Excuse me, but I’m talking to my friend, not you.

503
00:52:39,543 --> 00:52:40,837
So, are you done ordering?

504
00:52:44,157 --> 00:52:44,997
Let’s go.

505
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:00,130
Does any of you want to come up and sing a song together?

506
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,610
I do, I do.

507
00:53:02,023 --> 00:53:04,610
- ‘I’m a local girl from…’
- Khem!

508
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:05,837
- What?
-  Sorry.

509
00:53:05,837 --> 00:53:06,877
Anyone?

510
00:53:06,877 --> 00:53:07,823
I can do it, Yai.

511
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,423
- Thongthai, you go then.
- No

512
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:12,357
- Go on.
- You go, Phaya.

513
00:53:12,377 --> 00:53:13,943
- What?
- You’re good at singing.

514
00:53:14,097 --> 00:53:15,810
- What are you talking about?
- I heard you sing before.

515
00:53:15,807 --> 00:53:16,930
- I can’t sing.
- I’ll go then.

516
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,237
- ‘I’m a local girl from Chiangmai…’
-Excuse me? My friend wants to join you.

517
00:53:20,237 --> 00:53:21,583
Come on up here.

518
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:23,983
- Go, Phaya. / - Yeah.

519
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,197
Are you chicken out?

520
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:31,130
That’s my boy. Just a swig to boost up your guts.

521
00:53:31,357 --> 00:53:36,017
- I’ll show you.
- Yeah, that’s my friend, everyone.

522
00:53:39,903 --> 00:53:41,450
Do you need anything, I’ll go get it for you.

523
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,257
- Mine is done. Get me one of this.
- Me too. I’ll have one too.

524
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:48,570
Make it five, Tharn. Five bottles of beer.

525
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:58,903
(Music)

526
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:26,103
Let’s play some game.

527
00:55:26,097 --> 00:55:27,090
What game?

528
00:55:27,087 --> 00:55:28,623
Spin The Bottle game.

529
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:32,263
- Let’s clear the table.
- Okay

530
00:55:32,257 --> 00:55:35,370
- But I’m going to alter the rule a bit.
- How?

531
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:40,657
If the bottle points toward anyone, that person can ask anyone a question.

532
00:55:42,137 --> 00:55:43,183
- Okay
- Let’s do that.

533
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:47,703
If the you couldn’t answer the question, you must down the glass.

534
00:55:54,657 --> 00:55:56,957
- We’ll surely get drunk.
- Who’s it?

535
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,517
- Who’s it?
- What the fuck are you doing, Yai?

536
00:56:00,143 --> 00:56:02,943
Don’t worry, my bro. I’ll take care of it.

537
00:56:02,937 --> 00:56:05,303
- Come on
- Bring it on.

538
00:56:05,303 --> 00:56:07,857
- Let’s start.
- Who’s first?

539
00:56:09,297 --> 00:56:11,330
It’s me.

540
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:12,423
Go on then.

541
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:13,463
Whom do you want to ask?

542
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:17,463
I’m going to ask Tharn.

543
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:21,903
Go on.

544
00:56:22,487 --> 00:56:26,463
Do you have anyone you like right now?

545
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:34,450
Answer, answer, answer!

546
00:56:34,737 --> 00:56:38,743
- Booo.
- What a waste.

547
00:56:44,857 --> 00:56:45,730
I’ll ask Tharn.

548
00:56:47,397 --> 00:56:48,783
It has to be like this, bro.

549
00:56:48,777 --> 00:56:49,757
Here we go.

550
00:56:49,757 --> 00:56:50,530
Again?

551
00:56:50,527 --> 00:56:51,677
Go on.

552
00:56:51,677 --> 00:56:57,730
What’s your type? Is it someone around here?

553
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:04,097
Answer, answer, answer!

554
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,210
Geez.

555
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:11,130
You!

556
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:13,297
I’ll ask Tharn.

557
00:57:14,157 --> 00:57:16,530
Hold on. That’s enough.

558
00:57:16,527 --> 00:57:18,290
Easy there.

559
00:57:18,287 --> 00:57:21,170
Let’s stop. Look at him, he’s all red.

560
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:23,823
Fine, I won’t ask him then.

561
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:26,277
- I’ll ask you instead.
- Oh, it’s your turn now.

562
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:27,743
Just sit down.

563
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,687
Listen.

564
00:57:30,687 --> 00:57:33,757
If you can pick anyone in this table to go home with you,

565
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:37,703
whom will you choose?

566
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:40,543
Answer it.

567
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:44,497
Answer, answer, answer!

568
00:58:19,657 --> 00:58:22,037
- I’m going to choose…
- Yes?

569
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,957
- Shit!
- Oh, shit!

570
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:33,850
Tharn!

571
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:37,177
Tharn! Are you okay?

572
00:58:38,143 --> 00:58:39,690
We shouldn’t have picked on him.

573
00:58:40,263 --> 00:58:41,530
Tharn, are you all right?

574
00:58:41,877 --> 00:58:43,703
I’ll take him to wash up first.

575
00:58:43,903 --> 00:58:45,517
No more drinking, okay?

576
00:58:45,837 --> 00:58:47,050
Let’s go.

577
00:58:47,377 --> 00:58:50,290
Geez. I was afraid he’d puke all over me.

578
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:52,543
Are they actually….?

579
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,570
Are you okay?

580
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:01,757
Wash your face first.

581
00:59:11,277 --> 00:59:12,330
Geez.

582
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,063
Sit down. Sit.

583
00:59:15,423 --> 00:59:16,410
Already.

584
00:59:17,823 --> 00:59:19,583
- Hey.
- Huh?

585
00:59:20,663 --> 00:59:22,783
- Are you okay?
- Yeahh.

586
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,423
If you want to feel better,

587
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:28,397
I have this.

588
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:29,957
It’d help.

589
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,417
I’ll make it for you.

590
00:59:33,597 --> 00:59:34,557
Just stay still.

591
00:59:35,503 --> 00:59:36,423
Don’t move.

592
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:44,850
Open your mouth.

593
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:45,757
Drink it

594
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:57,103
- Feel better?
- Umm, yeah.

595
00:59:58,317 --> 01:00:00,037
Very good.

596
01:00:00,037 --> 01:00:05,257
- Let’s freshen you up a bit.
- Geez, what’s wrong with you?

597
01:00:05,823 --> 01:00:06,677
Take this.

598
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,197
You really like for bugging me.

599
01:00:12,247 --> 01:00:14,530
- Get off me.
- No.

600
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:19,863
I’m not going to let you go. I’ll hold on to you tight.

601
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:23,743
You, evil jellyfish.

602
01:00:26,317 --> 01:00:31,047
Are you sure? This jellyfish’s sting is very painful.

603
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:33,797
It will go directly to your heart.

604
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:40,023
The heart, the heart, the heart.

605
01:00:40,023 --> 01:00:43,577
Stop it.  You’re like a baby when you’re drunk.

606
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:47,717
Let me return the favor.

607
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:19,010
What’s wrong?

608
01:01:21,663 --> 01:01:23,277
Where did you get this necklace from?

609
01:01:27,757 --> 01:01:28,903
This amulet?

610
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,130
It’s the same.

611
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,687
Same as what?

612
01:01:36,663 --> 01:01:41,717
Same as the amulet that I used to give to a boy.

613
01:01:44,377 --> 01:01:46,397
You used to give a boy an amulet like this?

614
01:01:47,357 --> 01:01:48,477
Yeah.

615
01:01:50,983 --> 01:01:52,650
When? Where?

616
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:54,223
Tell me more about it.

617
01:01:54,217 --> 01:01:56,263
It was when…

618
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,783
Yes?

619
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:01,103
When…

620
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:04,717
Hey, wake up. Talk to me first.

621
01:02:08,743 --> 01:02:10,423
Geez, Tharn.

622
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,037
Sit down first.

623
01:02:15,137 --> 01:02:19,383
- Wake up. Tell me where was it?
- It was…

624
01:02:19,657 --> 01:02:20,570
Tharn.

625
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:21,797
Tharn.

626
01:02:22,397 --> 01:02:23,290
Tharn.

627
01:02:24,183 --> 01:02:25,527
Talk to me first.

628
01:02:25,527 --> 01:02:28,143
Shit! I’m sorry.

629
01:02:28,137 --> 01:02:31,903
Wait! It’s not what you think.

630
01:02:32,143 --> 01:02:35,930
It’s good that you’re here. He’s already passed out. What to do now?

631
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:41,250
I thought so. He drank a gallon of it.

632
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:43,703
Now, what?

633
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:46,837
Okay, I know what to do.

634
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,810
You go and drop him off at his condo.

635
01:02:52,247 --> 01:02:55,583
But I’m drunk too. I can’t do that.

636
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:58,217
So am I. I’m going to call a cab for you.

637
01:02:58,477 --> 01:02:59,237
Come here.

638
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:03,983
- Sit down.
- What the heck are you doing?

639
01:03:03,977 --> 01:03:06,437
Ouch!

640
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:11,877
- Geez, he’s heavy.
- Yai!

641
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:15,703
- Hang on.
- Now, go.

642
01:03:15,957 --> 01:03:16,583
Where?

643
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:19,657
Wait for me in front of the club.  I’ll let you know when the cab is here.

644
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:32,063
Tharn, my bro. I’ve done everything I could for you.

645
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,930
Geez, what’s wrong with him?

646
01:03:38,423 --> 01:03:40,210
Where are you taking me?

647
01:03:40,343 --> 01:03:41,717
Your place.

648
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:45,023
Go back and get Yai too.

649
01:03:45,343 --> 01:03:47,157
I don’t want to sleep alone.

650
01:03:47,663 --> 01:03:49,183
I’ll stay with you.

651
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,543
But first, get off me.

652
01:03:55,423 --> 01:03:56,263
Where’s the cab?

653
01:03:57,143 --> 01:03:59,050
Just wait here.

654
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,210
Sorry

655
01:04:02,543 --> 01:04:03,437
Just wait here.

656
01:04:08,397 --> 01:04:11,010
Shit, whose car is it?

657
01:04:19,597 --> 01:04:22,050
- Dr. Chalothorn.
- Tharn.

658
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,537
Excuse me?

659
01:04:46,277 --> 01:04:50,223
Tharn and I have known Dr. Chalothorn since we were young.

660
01:04:50,497 --> 01:04:54,237
Good for him.  Now, he’d someone to take care of him when he’s drunk.

661
01:04:56,537 --> 01:05:02,623
Grandma, maybe it’s time for me to find out…

662
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:05,217
what those dreams actually mean.

663
01:05:05,517 --> 01:05:09,677
I’m going to start from where it begins – where all those dreams started.

664
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:11,037
Phaya.

665
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:15,503
Tharn.  Why are you here?

666
01:06:36,017 --> 01:06:42,177
