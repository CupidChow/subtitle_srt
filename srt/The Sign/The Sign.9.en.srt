- Tharn.

No!!!

6
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:26,960
It really is Kao’s body.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,040
He was killed and dumped here.

8
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:32,685
The knot on his ankles looks exactly like the one on Lieut Tam’s.

Help!

12
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,102
Please stop.

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,148
If you kill Phaya, your human form will also disappear.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,657
I don’t care. I will never let them be together.

If I love someone, I will end up losing that person.

And I don’t want to lose you.

41
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:41,771
I want to have you by my side but this is all I can do.

42

I’m not going anywhere. I’ll always stay by your side.

43
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,754
I will do everything to make sure you won’t regret it or lose me. I promise.

44
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:55,988
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:56,948 --> 00:03:57,737
Yes.

46
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:02,925
I won’t make the same mistake twice, sir.

47
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:04,285
Yes.

48
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:05,097
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:06,114

I’m sorry, sir.

54
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:36,377
I thought you said you could handle it.

55
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:38,937
Are you sure no one saw you?

56
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:40,834
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:52,297 --> 00:04:56,400
Piphop, you son of a bitch.

58
00:04:57,737 --> 00:05:00,080
I killed you long ago.

59
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,760
But you still send your son to come after me.

60
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:13,565
Yes, sir.

61
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:17,462
I already have evidence of the location where Montree produces drugs.

62
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:23,051
I’m going to take my wife and kid back to Nong Khai first.

63
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:26,228
Then I’ll come back to hand over the evidence to you.

64
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:29,177
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,170
Got it, sir.

66
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:32,891
Thank you, sir.

67
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:37,554
I’m done, Dad.

68
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,800
Let’s go then.

69
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,022
Dad, tell me honestly...

70
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,937
why do Mum and I have to stay at Grandma’s place?

71
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,422
Tharn.

72
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,217
I promise I’ll often come visit you.

73
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,548
I’m not going to leave you and your mother there forever, okay?

74
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,622
Don’t worry about me. All you care about is work anyway.

75
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:10,651
That’s not true, Tharn.

76
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,708
Then why do you take me to stay with Grandma?

77
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,131
Why can’t I stay home in Bangkok?

78
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,080
Well, I...

79
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,700
Tharn, listen to me. He will also be left alone there without anyone to take care of him.

80
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:25,314
Please try to understand him.

81
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:28,137
He does everything to protect us.

82
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,302
He does it because he loves us.

83
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:33,314
If he really does, then he should have stayed with us.

84
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,257
Tharn, I love you so much.

85
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:41,097
But right now, you and your mother won’t be safe if you stay close to me.

86
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:44,491
Let’s go.

87
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:52,260
(Exciting Sound)

88
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:26,011
Come help us quickly.

89
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,440
Can anyone please call the police?

90
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:42,571
Both of you are so nosy. Like father, like son indeed.

91
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:45,771
I’ll do you a favour and send your son to live with you.

92
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,177
Do you want me to take care of it now?

93
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,205
Not yet.

94
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:56,468
Go and take care of Kao’s case first.

95
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:01,805
And also keep an eye on Ning.

96
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:05,382
Find out if she knows about Kao’s fraud.

97
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:07,380
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:19,097
Tharn.

99
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,582
How is Phaya?

100
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,371
I don’t know. He’s still in there.

101
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,828
Has anyone told his grandma and sister?

102
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,708
I already did. They are probably on their way here.

103
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:53,702
So, what happened?

104
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:58,502
Why was he drowned?

105
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:02,548
I don’t know either.

106
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,320
How did Phaya drown?

107
00:09:21,737 --> 00:09:23,474
How is he, Doctor?

108
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:27,885
The patient is experiencing a lack of oxygen in his brain.

109
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:30,605
He’s been transferred to the ICU...

110
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,062
and is now getting oxygen via a respirator.

111
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,062
I’ve also prescribed a vasopressor to increase his blood pressure.

112
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:37,954
I’m afraid you won’t be able to see him tonight.

113
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:40,514
Is he going to be okay?

114
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:42,948
I will do my best.

115
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,371
These belong to the patient’s.

116
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,354
Tharn! Tharn! Tharn!

117
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,817

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,640
Tharn! Tharn!

(Crying)

120
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:32,822
Are Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases related to your parents’ case?

121
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,760
I believe in the evidence.

122
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,300
If you can’t separate work from your personal matter,
I will have you removed from this case.

I heard about Phaya.

Don’t overthink about it, okay?

129
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:55,052

I don’t want you to blame yourself.

It has nothing to do with you at all.

136
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,144
But you already know...

137
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,818
that if I love anyone,

138
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:41,086
that person will be taken away from me just like before.

Tharn.

140
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,469
It might not be the same with Phaya.

141
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:51,052
I want you to believe in this love.

142
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,212
He probably doesn’t want to see you cry too.

143
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,726
Let’s not overthink about it.

144
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,298

If you’re worried about Phaya, you can go visit him.

148

We’ll give you a recap of the meeting later.

00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:22,378
He’s already moved out of the ICU.

152
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,144
His grandma and sister are looking after him.

153
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,144
They’ll call if they need anything.

154
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:30,378
I want to get this case done as soon as possible.

155
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:36,115
Everything is going to be all right. I’m sure he’ll get well soon.

156
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:38,114

00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:43,555
You scared me.

The picture on the left is the knot on Kao’s ankles.

160
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:55,349
The one on the right is the knot on Lieut Tam’s ankles.

161
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:58,195
They are the same.

162
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,418
And the forensic team has also confirmed that...

163
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:03,738
both victims have the same cause of death.

164
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,955
They were dead before being dumped into the water.

165
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:09,761
Have you gone back to examine the crime scene once again?

166
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:13,738
We’ve examined the area which is around 900m away from the crime scene.

167
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,544
We have found traces of car tyres tracks.

168
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:20,344
After analyzing the tracks and the data from the CCTV cameras…

169
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:22,104
around the shop in the area,

170
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:26,824
we have identified a suspected car coming out of the area around the crime scene.

171
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:28,469
What about the plate number?

172
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,904
It’s a fake one.

173
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:37,201
On the day that we found Kao’s body,

174
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:41,086
I encountered the suspect who was ambushing on us.

175
00:16:42,364 --> 00:16:45,224
While I was about to arrest him,

176
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:47,955
he resisted and tried to fight back.

177
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:51,624
It was then that I got a glimpse of the tattoo on his arm.

178
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,006
It’s the same tattoo I saw on the person who killed my parents.

179
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:06,564
Hold on.

180
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:12,378
Are you saying that Lieut Tam’s and Kao’s cases are related to your parents’ case?

181
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:14,298
Yes.

182
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:18,469
And the person behind these cases...

183
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:20,698
is Montree.

184
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,675
Do you have any evidence to confirm that Montree is the culprit?

185
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:27,749
Those victims are also somewhat conneted to Montree.

186
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:30,641
I think we should issue a warrant and summon him for interrogation.

187
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:31,818
I only believe in evidence.

188
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:35,864
If you want me to believe in what you said,

189
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:38,652
go and find me the evidence.

190
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:45,246
I’m going to warn you for the last time.

191
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:48,366
If you can’t separate work from personal matters,

192
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:52,035
I’ll have you removed from this case.

193
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:58,058
You have to calm down, Tharn.

194
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:00,054
Don’t argue with Inspector Akk or try to challenge him.

195
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:03,384
I don’t know if you’d listen to me.

196
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:05,669
But please calm down and think twice about that gunman.

197
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:09,624
Otherwise, Inspector will give you an earful about it again.

198
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:12,675
You still don’t have a solid evidence too.

199
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:14,915
So, stop overthinking about it.

200
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:16,869
But I’m sure it’s the same person.

201
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:21,201
And I will find the evidence to confirm it.

202
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:22,926
Where are you going?

203
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:27,441
To see someone who can help me find the evidence about my father’s case.

204
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:40,949
I’ve gathered all the information about your father’s case.

205
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,246
They’re all in here...

206
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:46,824
including the list of your father’s colleagues too.

207
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:51,669
Don’t tell anyone especially the Inspector that I did this for you.

208
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:54,092
I know that.

209
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:57,109
I promise not to get you into trouble.

210
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:59,486
Inspector will never know about this.

211
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:02,344
Hold on.

212
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:07,132
What is it?

213
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,835
I don’t know if I should tell you this.

214
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:13,258
I think this case is...

215
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:16,538
probably connected to a much bigger one.

216
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:21,338
The Inspector’s older brother…

217
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:26,926
was your father’s right-hand man, the one who took care of Montree’s case.

218
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:34,001
Are you serious?

219
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:46,984
Is this Inspector’s brother?

220
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:52,641
Why doesn’t Inspector tell you that he knew your father?

221
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:54,664
Lieut Itt killed himself...

222
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:57,612
because he was caught for taking bribe.

223
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,961
And the one who looked after this case...

224
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:04,355
was your father.

225
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:01,064
Are you sure you’re not going to come and live with me?

226
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,629
Thank you so much, Uncle.

227
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:06,492
But I really don’t want to bother you.

228
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,081
It’s not a bother at all.

229
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,355
Both you and Itt are like my own sons.

230
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,446
You’re like a family to me.

231
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:15,909
Itt also asked me to take care of you.

232
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:20,572
You have done much enough for me, Uncle

233
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,401
And don’t worry about your education.

234
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:26,401
I’ll take care of that.

235
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:30,115
I already told you that you’re like a son to me.

236
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:32,046
Okay?

237
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,326
Is it Korn who did this?

238
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,835
Yes.

239
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,766
Do you want me to arrest him?

240
00:22:39,784 --> 00:22:40,709
Not yet.

241
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:42,686
I don’t want to ruin our big case.

242
00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:45,509
Keep investigating on the drugs case.

243
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,572
And try to be especially careful during this time.

244
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:52,241
One of our teams is investigating about Korn.

245
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:53,806
Yes, Inspector.

246
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:21,966
Doctor, how’s my brother doing?

247
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:24,435
He’s stable right now.

248
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,669
Please excuse me.

249
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:37,315
Phaya.

250
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:44,972
Nee.

251
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:48,344
I’m starting to agree with you.

252
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:51,909
That he shouldn’t have become a cop.

253
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:54,846
Only bad things happened to him.

254
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,058
You have to stay strong, Nee.

255
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:01,235
So that at least Grandma can lean on you.

256
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:04,264
I’m scared for Grandma too.

257
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:08,321
When I see him like this,

258
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:13,029
I don’t know if I’d be able to stay strong for her.

259
00:24:13,612 --> 00:24:15,201
Then let’s do this.

260
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:19,669
When you’re with Grandma, you have to try to be strong.

261
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:27,064
But when you’re with me,
you can be yourself and cry as much as you want to.

262
00:24:27,806 --> 00:24:29,692
I’ll be a shoulder for you to lean on.

263
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:58,081
I’m sorry…

264
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:01,406
for not taking a good care of him.

265
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:04,046
So, he has to be like this.

266
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:07,029
I thought you gave us your words that you’d take a good care of him.

267
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:09,224
Why did you let this happen?

268
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:17,384
We never wanted it to happen either.

269
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:19,932
We are worried about Phaya too.

270
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:24,664
Let’s go outside, Nee.

271
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:52,435
Hey, are you faking sleep to prank us?

272
00:25:52,606 --> 00:25:53,784
Get up, man.

273
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:58,604
Yeah. Get up and help us with the case rigth now.

274
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:00,515
Don’t just lie there like a log.

275
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:04,058
I...

276
00:26:05,795 --> 00:26:07,018
I’m sorry.

277
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:10,629
I’m sorry.

278
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:15,601
It’s all my fault.

279
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,572
You’re like this because of me.

280
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:21,726
I shouldn’t have left you alone.

281
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:33,006
Tharn, it’s not your fault.

282
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:36,024
It was an accident.

283
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:38,618
More importantly,

284
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,269
he’s still alive.

285
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:44,774
And I really believe that...

286
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:48,446
he’s also trying to find his way back to you.

287
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:52,046
Hasn’t he already promised you?

288
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:54,252
That he will always stay by your side.

289
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:58,595
A man like him will always be true to his words.

290
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,544
He won’t give up so easily.

291
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:04,709
He will be okay, trust me.

292
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,366
If he knows that you’re crying like this because of him,

293
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:11,235
I’m sure he wouldn’t like it.

294
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:17,235
He wouldn’t want to see the person he loves crying...

295
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:19,132
and blaming yourself like this.

296
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:29,818
Tharn.

297
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,564
Tharn.

298
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:34,084
Listen to me.

299
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:35,955
Listen to your brother.

300
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:38,961
If you love him,

301
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:42,092
you have to believe in him.

302
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,744
And you must not give up.

303
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:50,161
We write our life with our own hands.

304
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:53,532
You too, Phaya.

305
00:27:55,315 --> 00:27:57,498
I already gave Tharn to you.

306
00:27:58,686 --> 00:28:00,446
And you already promised to take care of him.

307
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,321
I’m not taking him back.

308
00:28:07,784 --> 00:28:11,498
If you don’t wake up soon, I’m going to find him a new boyfriend.

309
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:13,544
And make sure he’s better looking then you.

310
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:15,989
Phaya.

311
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:34,961
I’ll take care of this case.

312
00:28:35,178 --> 00:28:38,926
I’ll let you choose whether you’d take us with  you or else I’ll call the Inspector.

313
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:40,389
(Fighting)

314
00:28:40,474 --> 00:28:43,052
Tell me! Who has this spider tattoo?

315
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:50,404
The Sign
MingErTeamSub
Eng Trans @ThesignIDF

316
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:57,493
The Sign

317
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:05,758
Hello? Do you have any lead?

318
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,090
Okay, thanks a lot.

319
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,621
I know a friend who is an ex-cop.
He has asked around about the gunman.

320
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:15,918
He said some of the gunmen...

321
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:20,581
use tattoos to identify which gang they belong to.

322
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:24,673
Which gang uses a spider tattoo?

323
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:27,415
I sent him the spider tattoo that you sketched,

324
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,307
he said this gunman is probably one of the ex-soldiers gang.

325
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,421
But he couldn’t find out who exactly it is.

326
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:34,124
How are we going to investigate further then?

327
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:38,958
My friend said you should go to this place in Ekkamai.

328
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:42,021
And ask for a manager there named ‘Mon’.

329
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,890
He used to be a gunman.

330
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:47,301
We might get some useful information from him.

331
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:50,044
Let’s report Inspector about this.

332
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:52,753
He might agree with us to go talk to the manager.

333
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:54,250
No need.

334
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:56,455
Why not?

335
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:58,113
I’ll do it on my own.

336
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,633
Are you crazy?

337
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,330
Inspector will eat you alive if he finds out.

338
00:30:03,213 --> 00:30:06,181
Leave it to me. I’m going to do it alone.

339
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:08,375
I don’t want to get you guys in trouble.

340
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:12,844
Tharn, I can’t let you do something risky like this.

341
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:15,450
But if you report this to the Inspector,

342
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:17,918
he might have me removed from the case.

343
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,301
He would think that I’m mixing my personal matter with work.

344
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:22,787
What if something bad happen to you?

345
00:30:23,393 --> 00:30:25,484
The Abbot and your grandma would definitely kill me.

346
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:31,141
I promise I’ll be very careful.

347
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,158
Then, we’ll go.

348
00:30:39,293 --> 00:30:42,010
You stay here and look after Phaya.

349
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,741
If my babe is going, then I’m going too

350
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:51,130
Then I’ll go too.

351
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:55,564
I don’t want to get hit on the head with the Abbot’s alms bowl.

352
00:30:58,547 --> 00:30:59,404
So will I.

353
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:01,918
What do you wanna do?

354
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:03,918
It’s a family matter.

355
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:06,433
I don’t want you guys to be in trouble because of me.

356
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:08,433
Just let me handle it.

357
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,187
But you’re like a brother to me, Tharn.

358
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:14,113
Your parents are like mine too.

359
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:16,935
You stay here and take care of Phaya.

360
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,141
So that you’ll be the first one he sees when he wakes up.

361
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:22,810
I agree with you.

362
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:23,598
I agree

363
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,421
Tharn.

364
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:32,890
Hey. I’ll let you choose whether you’ll let us go with you...

365
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:34,883
or I’ll call the Inspector.

366
00:31:56,593 --> 00:32:00,695
You no longer have the Naga Amulet to protect you, Phaya.

367
00:32:16,444 --> 00:32:19,221
- Mr. Mon, the VIP guest has arrived.
- Um

368
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,924
Okay. Both of you, take care of everything down here.

369
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:25,198
I’ll go upstairs to take care of the guest.

370
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:32,090
Hey, that’s Mon, the manager of this place.

371
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:34,673
But the owner of this place is Pong.

372
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:37,450
My friend said the gunmen will come here to get their orders.

373
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:40,238
They are guarding the place right now.

374
00:32:48,478 --> 00:32:49,427
Hey. He's here.

375
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,375
Cheers!

376
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:06,223
Shit!

377
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:09,518
So sorry.

378
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:13,290
- Give it to me.
- Really sorry.

379
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:19,221
Go take care of the guest for me first.

380
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:20,924
I’ll go down to clean up a bit.

381
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:25,655
I’m sorry. Really sorry.

382
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:29,975
Tharn. Khem.

383
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:33,347
(Vomiting)

384
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:34,993
Look at your brother.

385
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:39,953
Let’s go.

386
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:52,764
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to bump into you.

387
00:33:53,884 --> 00:33:55,918
That’s all right.

388
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:01,827
Hey.

389
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,267
Who are you? What do you want?

390
00:34:23,107 --> 00:34:24,055
Let me go!

391
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,053
Stay still.

392
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,010
Ouch!

393
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:52,113
Tell me, who has this spider tattoo?

394
00:34:53,278 --> 00:34:54,318
I don’t know.

395
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,055
But your face says otherwise. You know.

396
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:01,690
I don’t want to trouble you.

397
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,683
Just tell me his name.

398
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:09,004
Give us his name.

399
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:12,353
Or we’ll dig up more and put you behind bars.

400
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:16,238
I really don’t know whose tattoo it is.

401
00:35:17,975 --> 00:35:20,421
Don’t try to play innocent with us.

402
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:25,438
Tell me, or I’ll find a way to shut down this place.

403
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:28,273
Fine, I’ll tell you.

404
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:30,558
Let me ask my men first.

405
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:33,393
Hey, what are you doing?

406
00:35:33,427 --> 00:35:34,615
I’m taking out my phone.

407
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:39,918
Ouch!

408
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:51,793
Tharn!

409
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,335
Dammit!

410
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:58,387
What happened?

411
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:07,267
Go get all of our men!

412
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,678
Get them!

413
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:38,798
Tharn, follow him! Quick!

414
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:51,038
Tell me! Who has this tattoo?

415
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:52,364
I don’t know!

416
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:53,484
You don’t?

417
00:36:56,787 --> 00:36:58,707
Run!

418
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:14,307
Chart!

419
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:25,358
Tharn! Tharn! Are you okay?

420
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:28,364
The man with the spider tattoo is Chart.

421
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,404
Chart?

422
00:37:31,403 --> 00:37:32,364
Follow him!

423
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:48,215
Phaya.

424
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:11,964
Finally, we meet face to face, Garuda.

425
00:38:11,963 --> 00:38:14,215
Chalothorn, why are you here?

426
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:15,461
Make way, please.

427
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:17,633
Prepare for CPR.

428
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:18,890
Phaya!

The Sign

431
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:46,084
(Fighting)

432
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,427
Do you really believe Tharn will love you if you kill me?

433
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,456
But it wouldn't be hard for Tharn to love me without you.

434
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:53,330
(Fighting)

435
00:38:53,326 --> 00:38:56,164
You can't make Tharn love you no matter how many lives you live.

436
00:38:56,156 --> 00:38:58,153
(Fighting)

437
00:38:58,146 --> 00:38:59,673
I will imprison you here.

438
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:01,993
When Tharn and I fall in love, you'll see.

439
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:05,676
(Fighting)

440
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,633
Please stop.

441
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:12,678
This is the last warning from me.

442
00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:14,676
Don’t commit any more sin.

443
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:16,244
The one who should stop is you.

444
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:17,456
Mind your own business.

445
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:21,604

446
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:25,604
(Body tremor)

447
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,438
Phaya!

448
00:39:27,673 --> 00:39:28,564
Phaya!

449
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:30,118
What’s wrong?

450
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:39,036
(Seizure)

451
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:40,476
(Pushing)
Ouch!

452
00:39:41,398 --> 00:39:42,370
What are you doing?

453
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:43,170
Phaya

454
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,141
What happened?

455
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:47,467
Stop it!

456
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:48,736
(Pushing)
Back off!

457
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,576
I have to put this necklace on him.

458
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:52,553
(Crying)
Phaya!

459
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:54,884
Phaya!

460
00:39:56,747 --> 00:39:57,570
Hey!

461
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,753
Phaya!

462
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:01,296
- Phaya!     /     - Doc

463
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:02,107
Phaya!

464
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:05,227
Phaya! Do you hear me? What’s wrong?

465
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:06,930
(Crying)
Phaya!

466
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:08,530
Phaya!

00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:29,558
(Crying)

468
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,861
Prepare for CPR.

469
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:33,387
Phaya!

470
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:40,061
(Crying)

471
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:46,747
His pulse is back.

472
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:48,964
(Crying)

473
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:50,758

Phaya.

Tharn

479
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:20,716
Ouch!!

480
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:35,878
(Smashing the table)
Dammit!

481
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:44,370
Do you realise that your reckless actions will get us all into trouble?!

482
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:45,890
I’m sorry, sir.

483
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,056
Sorry? Isn’t it too easy?

484
00:41:51,307 --> 00:41:53,513
Our team will be investigated by the disciplinary committee.

485
00:41:53,506 --> 00:41:55,330
There will also be punishments.

486
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:56,690
All because of your...

487
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:01,878
All because of your brainless acts.

488
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,370
What happened last night...

489
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:09,136
is all my fault. They have nothing to do with it.

490
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:12,473
I will take responsibility alone.

491
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,284
Inspector.

492
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:16,301
Please.

493
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:24,221
I want them to stay on the case and keep investigating.

494
00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:28,061
If you guys really want to help me,

495
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:31,650
then find out who the real culprit is.

496
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,078
I will take all the punishments alone.

497
00:43:11,396 --> 00:43:18,896
(Fighting)

498
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:45,650
Tharn.

499
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,758
Ouch.

500
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:52,530
Ouch.

501
00:44:14,016 --> 00:44:15,318
The spider tattoo.

502
00:44:17,456 --> 00:44:19,764
Why does he also have the spider tattoo?

503
00:44:38,073 --> 00:44:38,953
Phaya?

504
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:42,793
You’re still recovering. Why did you leave the hospital?

505
00:44:43,196 --> 00:44:45,456
Tharn.

506
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,918
What’s wrong?

507
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:52,747
I’m sorry I couldn’t recognise you.

508
00:44:53,718 --> 00:44:55,181
If I had recognised you a little earlier,

509
00:44:56,576 --> 00:44:58,324
I wouldn’t have let you stay close to that man.

510
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:01,730
What do you mean?

511
00:45:03,346 --> 00:45:06,644
From now on, always stay close to me.

512
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:08,758
You have to stay by my side.

513
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:11,776
Because you are only mine.

515
00:46:20,816 --> 00:46:24,196
Tharn and I, we are dating each other.

516
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:26,153
I want you to come stay with me here...

517
00:46:26,146 --> 00:46:28,553
until the Day of Judgement has passed.

518
00:46:28,546 --> 00:46:30,644
We have to gather as much information as we can.

519
00:46:30,636 --> 00:46:32,484
Do you know my father, Inspector?

520
00:46:32,496 --> 00:46:33,741
He already knew.

521
00:46:33,736 --> 00:46:36,141
Why does he have to hide it from us?

522
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,078
Tharn, Ning agrees to be our witness.

523
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:41,056
(Strangling / Gasping for air)

524
00:46:41,056 --> 00:46:42,416
Did you just see a vision?

525
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,396
Korn is going to kill Ning.

526
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:46,586
Chai must be killed by the tiger-man.

527
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:47,616
Tiger-man is not real.

528
00:46:47,616 --> 00:46:49,156
