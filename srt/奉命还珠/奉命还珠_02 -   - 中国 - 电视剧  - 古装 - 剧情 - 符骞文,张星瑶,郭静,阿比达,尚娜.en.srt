1
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Li Ling

2
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,640
Three

3
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,680
Two

4
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,800
One

5
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,320
Why did you leave again?

6
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Li Ling

7
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
You went gambling again.

8
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,200
I will never marry a hopeless gambler like you.

9
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,560
Li Ling

10
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,840
You’ve really let me down.

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,440
Rong’er

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,760
I won’t lose this time.

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Trust me.

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
Li Ling

15
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,560
We’re not finished yet.

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,320
Are we gambling or not?

17
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,920
Shopkeeper Wang

18
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,760
Let’s begin.

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
Damn.

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,960
I’m not ready for this right now.

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,880
Young Master Li

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,520
If you’ve chosen, reveal it.

23
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,760
Don’t rush.

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,200
Oh, right.

25
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
I still remember.

26
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,120
Which shells Wang Cheng picked that had pearls.

27
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,600
What’s he trying to do?

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,440
Li Ling

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,480
What are you up to now?

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,520
These are my shells.

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,880
Shopkeeper Wang

32
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,120
I just think

33
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,520
the shells on my side

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,720
are all worthless.

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
I want to pick a few I like from your side.

36
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,320
Shopkeeper Wang, are you not willing?

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,880
Or is it

38
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,080
that the shells on my side

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,320
have all been tampered with by you?

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,280
Ridiculous.

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,560
Then

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,240
This one, this one, this one.

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,080
I don’t want it.

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,560
I want it.

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,400
This one.

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,880
Since

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,840
Since Young Master Li thinks this batch is suspicious,

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
let’s switch to another batch.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,480
To keep things fair.

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
How am I supposed to play now?

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,080
We didn’t switch shells last time.

52
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
How am I supposed to guess?

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,200
Young Master Li

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Go ahead.

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,440
Wait.

56
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,880
What trick are you trying now?

57
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,320
If I remember correctly,

58
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,400
in the last two rounds,

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
I already beat Shopkeeper Wang

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,560
for two hundred thousand coins.

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
And this round,

62
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
Shopkeeper Wang is betting his life.

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
I’m betting everything I own.

64
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,720
But those two hundred thousand coins

65
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,840
haven’t been settled yet, right?

66
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,120
Cash

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Two hundred thousand

68
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,760
Then I'll add another hundred thousand coins

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Li Ling

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,120
You're shameless

71
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,320
Why are you so aggressive, Young Master Li?

72
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,240
Relying on your family's status

73
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,040
Are you just bullying us ordinary folks?

74
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,320
Wow

75
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Isn't that Hepu's top beauty

76
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,040
Shao Wanru?

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Didn't expect Shopkeeper Wang to pursue her for years

78
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,280
And finally win her over

79
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,760
Since she's Wang Cheng's longtime beloved

80
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Shopkeeper Wang doesn't need money then

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,000
We can bet on something else

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
For example

83
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,120
Hepu's top beauty

84
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,880
Shao Wanru's indenture

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,880
How about it?

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,080
This wastrel is ruthless

87
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,080
Shopkeeper Wang spent a fortune back then

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,040
Just to get Shao Wanru's indenture

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,640
Wang Cheng definitely won't agree

90
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,640
She's the apple of his eye

91
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,360
Fine

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,880
The indenture is here

93
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
And she's here too

94
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,680
If you win

95
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,520
She'll be yours

96
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,240
Wait, hold on

97
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,600
That's Shao Wanru

98
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
You worked so hard to get her indenture

99
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,120
You'd just give her away?

100
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,960
Have you really thought this through?

101
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,880
Enough nonsense

102
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,000
Are you betting or not?

103
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,600
Miss, did you see that?

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,080
This kind of person

105
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,520
He's not worth your trust

106
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,160
Gambling with the one you love

107
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,000
That's inhuman

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,080
Shopkeeper Wang

109
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,680
I'm not like you

110
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,520
Someone like him

111
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,840
Isn't worthy to gamble with me

112
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,600
Li Ling

113
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,040
What trick are you playing?

114
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,640
We had an agreement

115
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm not in the mood today

116
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,160
See the guests out

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,280
What kind of person is that?

118
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,000
Exactly

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Says he's done and just quits

120
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,040
Everyone got scared and ran off

121
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Why are you still here?

122
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,520
She doesn't even care about you

123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,600
Finally sent them away

124
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,320
I need to find a way

125
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,840
To get my special skill back

126
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,840
No, no

127
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm not tricking you

128
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,040
Wang Cheng

129
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,160
Shopkeeper Wang, don't

130
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,320
In my previous life

131
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,560
I lost everything I owned

132
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,480
Wang Cheng broke both my arms

133
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,960
Only then did I gain my special skill

134
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,880
Could it be

135
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,680
Wait a minute

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,520
This could work

137
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,360
Young Master

138
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,400
Young Master

139
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,880
What are you going to do?

140
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,080
I won't let you hurt yourself like this

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,760
Li Zhong

142
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Oh, Young Master

143
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,120
How much did you lose this time?

144
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,840
How could I possibly lose?

145
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm your young master, after all.

146
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,280
Yes, yes, that's right.

147
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,520
Young master never loses.

148
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Young master always wins.

149
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,160
Bah, nonsense!

150
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,200
Good, you're here.

151
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,840
Do me a favor.

152
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,200
Come on, hand it to me.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,440
Come.

154
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:51,840
Take this.

155
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,480
Break it.

156
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,160
Hey!

157
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
I can't believe you'd say that.

158
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,640
You want me to break it?

159
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,160
Yeah.

160
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,560
Young master.

161
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,200
This was left by the master and madam before they passed.

162
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,480
No.

163
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,080
Today, Miss Jia Rong'er

164
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
is very angry for some reason.

165
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,680
She said if she sees you again,

166
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,600
she'll break your hand.

167
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,960
And then break my legs.

168
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,800
What did you say?

169
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,360
That's right.

170
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,440
Why would she want to break my legs?

171
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,800
Let's go.

172
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,800
Young master, why are you walking so fast? Where are you going?

173
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,320
It's pouring outside.

174
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,080
How dare you!

175
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Do you know who I am?

176
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,640
Move aside.

177
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240
I know.

178
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,440
Young Master Li.

179
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
Future son-in-law.

180
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,320
If you know, why are you still pushing me?

181
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,480
I need to see your young lady.

182
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,360
Sorry, Young Master Li.

183
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,680
Miss said,

184
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,600
Young Master Li and dogs

185
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,760
are not allowed inside.

186
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,520
Please don't make things difficult for us.

187
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,720
Rong'er!

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,480
Didn't you say you'd break my hand if you saw me?

189
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,440
I'm right here.

190
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,120
Come out!

191
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
Why have people blocking me?

192
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,120
Come out!

193
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,600
What was that noise outside just now?

194
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,400
I know you can hear me.

195
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,920
Young Master Li is here.

196
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,960
He insists on seeing you.

197
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,240
The gatekeepers stopped him.

198
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,160
Miss.

199
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,240
If you ask me, you shouldn't bother with him.

200
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,640
He's either out partying every day

201
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,320
or getting fooled like an idiot.

202
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,200
No matter how big the Li family business is,

203
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,680
he'll squander it all sooner or later.

204
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,320
When uncle and aunt were alive,

205
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,640
they treated me very well.

206
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
And I'm engaged to him.

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,360
So I can't just ignore him.

208
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,600
He's not a bad person by nature.

209
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,240
He only changed after uncle and aunt passed away.

210
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,760
That's when his personality changed.

211
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,120
I don't know

212
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
when he'll finally turn over a new leaf.

213
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,200
Rong'er, come out!

214
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,440
I really need to talk to you.

215
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,800
Come out, please!

216
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,960
Make him quiet down.

217
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,240
Alright.

218
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,240
Rong'er!

219
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,280
Didn't you say you'd break my hand if you saw me?

220
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,160
I'm right here.

221
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,680
Come out!

222
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,840
Young master, stop shouting.

223
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,560
It's embarrassing.

224
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,600
Let's go.

225
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,160
Don't pull me.

226
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,040
Rong'er! Rong'er!

227
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Stand steady.

228
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,600
Get up, get up, get up.

229
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,640
Young master.

230
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,800
Young master.

231
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,920
Let's not do anything foolish.

232
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
Miss Rong'er will definitely marry you.

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
Don't do anything stupid.

234
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,400
What if...

235
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,240
What are you saying?

236
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,120
I'm serious.

237
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,960
If it's serious, use the main gate.

238
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,920
The main gate?

239
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,320
Can I even get through?

240
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,240
Oh.

241
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,680
Young master, good luck!

242
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Reeds and rushes

243
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,080
What was that sound?

244
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,880
Maybe it was a stray cat.

245
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,080
It's done.

246
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,280
Useless.

247
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
What use are you to me?

248
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,840
Lost two hundred thousand coins.

249
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,920
And you let that Li Ling escape.

250
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,560
Sir,

251
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,600
You saw it yourself.

252
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,760
The bait has already been set.

253
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,880
Li Ling took the bait.

254
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,800
But he didn't get hooked.

255
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,840
So your plan must be flawed.

256
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,240
Why did we set up this scheme?

257
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,520
It's all for the Li family's money.

258
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,920
With the Li family's money,

259
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,600
we can cover this year's deficit.

260
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,760
With the Li family's money,

261
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,040
the appetites of those aristocrats in the capital

262
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,840
can finally be satisfied.

263
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,000
Not to mention,

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,920
the Li family's trade route

265
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
could earn us a fortune.

266
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,120
Ah.

267
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,720
Now,

268
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,240
now we've lost everything.

269
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,480
Everything is gone.

270
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,520
Maybe that Li Ling

271
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,440
is already suspicious of us.

272
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,680
You useless fool.

273
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,760
Tell me,

274
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,680
what use do I have for you?

275
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,720
Sir,

276
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,920
give me one more chance.

277
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
I can definitely do it.

278
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,960
No problem.

279
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,480
Fine.

280
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,040
I'll give you one more chance.

281
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,600
Listen carefully.

282
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,840
I want the Li family.

283
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,960
If you can't get it,

284
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,960
I'll take your head instead.

285
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,160
Understand?

286
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,480
Yes, yes, I understand.

287
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,120
Get out.

288
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

289
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,440
Useless.

290
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,000
Useless.

291
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
Why won't Miss let us in?

292
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,440
How would I know?

293
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,920
I just teased you a little.

294
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,120
Why are you so upset?

295
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,680
When uncle and aunt passed away,

296
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,560
they asked me to take good care of you.

297
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,720
Why are you acting out again?

298
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,960
Since we were kids,

299
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,880
we grew up together.

300
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,800
I know you're not bad at heart.

301
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,720
But these years,

302
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
you've been reckless and refused to change.

303
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,600
It's not that I'm bullying you.

304
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,000
It's those people outside flattering you.

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They're all after your family's wealth.

306
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,640
I discipline the servants

307
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,280
for your own good.

308
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,200
A-Ling,

309
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,560
when will you

310
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,880
understand my good intentions?

311
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,760
This

312
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,520
was handed to me by aunt herself.

313
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,640
Together with your blue bead,

314
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
they're a matching pair.

315
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,120
They're also a token between us.

316
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,560
I hope aunt, watching from above,

317
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,640
can bless you with safety.
