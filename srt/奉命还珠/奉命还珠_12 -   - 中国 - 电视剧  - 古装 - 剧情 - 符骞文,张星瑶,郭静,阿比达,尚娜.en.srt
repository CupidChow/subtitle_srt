1
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,000
What should we do now?

2
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,560
Wait.

3
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,920
Come here.

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
Sir!

5
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,240
Please stand up for us, sir!

6
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,680
The Sea God is angry!

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge!

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,640
Looks like the advisor has things to do.

9
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,440
Go ahead.

10
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,120
Excuse me.

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,600
No one's here.

12
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,200
Let's go.

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,560
Hurry.

14
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:17,960
Wait.

15
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,680
What are you doing?

16
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,640
Rong'er, what are you doing?

17
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,160
There's no time, Rong'er.

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,320
What are you doing?

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,000
Ah!

20
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,560
Sir.

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,520
Sir.

22
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,800
Something's wrong!

23
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,960
Oh my goodness!

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,280
Why are you here?

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,480
Madam!

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,920
They're all waiting for me outside.

27
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,360
Kana has arranged everything.

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,680
The people and carriages are all outside.

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,840
If you don't hurry out,

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,960
we'll run out of time.

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
What do you think we should do?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,280
What if Zhang He comes back?

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
I found the list.

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,600
What list?

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,080
Zhang He is so arrogant

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,960
because someone powerful in the capital

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,440
is supporting him.

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,280
I think the people on this list

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,080
are connected to those forces behind him.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,160
This should be useful.

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,640
What do you mean "should"?

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,720
This is very useful!

43
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,360
Rong'er, you're amazing!

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,560
Kana can't wait any longer.

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,240
Let's go!

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,720
I can't wait either.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,360
Let's go!

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,000
Next time, next time.

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,840
Coming!

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,400
Come in!

51
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,680
What's this about pearls not passing Mei Ridge?

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,480
What's going on?

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,680
Recently, Hepu pearls have had low yields.

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,640
Rumor has it the Sea God is angry.

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,880
He no longer blesses Hepu.

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Now pearl households are crowding the entrance.

57
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,400
They say if pearls can't pass Mei Ridge,

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,160
they won't collect shells anymore.

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,200
They also say those pearls

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,800
can't pass Mei Ridge.

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,680
Looks like Prefect Zhang has things to do.

62
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,400
Go ahead.

63
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,720
Recently, merchant caravans heading to Mei Ridge

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,720
as long as they carry pearls,

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,040
either die or go mad.

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,600
Those pearls turn to dust.

67
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,120
Ridiculous!

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,400
Where do these superstitions come from?

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,960
Oh!

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,800
Sir!

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,160
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge!

72
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,440
Please stand up for us, sir!

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,920
Quiet!

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
Everyone, quiet!

75
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,720
What's this about pearls not passing Mei Ridge?

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
It's all nonsense.

77
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,200
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge!

78
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,520
Sir.

79
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,440
Enough!

80
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,440
If you keep causing trouble, you'll all be arrested.

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,280
Where's the son-in-law?

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,760
With his personality,

83
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,920
such a lively scene,

84
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,040
he wouldn't miss it.

85
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,760
Where is he?

86
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,200
Uh...

87
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,960
I don't think we've seen the son-in-law from the start.

88
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,480
Darn it.

89
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
Giddy up!

90
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,000
Sir, we've checked everything.

91
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,160
Only when Miss Kana delivers the pearls

92
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,280
could they possibly escape.

93
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,880
You useless fool.

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
What use are you to me?

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
Take your men and chase them now!

96
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,320
Yes.

97
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,360
Go!

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,680
Go!

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,280
This is outrageous!

100
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,840
Whoa.

101
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,520
Ouch.

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,880
Miss, something's wrong!

103
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,080
What happened?

104
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,040
The son-in-law escaped with Madam Jia.

105
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Which way did they go?

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,640
The sea merchants took them away.

107
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,880
They headed toward the docks.

108
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,440
I'll go after them.

109
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Go back and tell Father.

110
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,960
Something's happened at Mei Ridge.

111
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,920
Alright.

112
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,680
Sir.

113
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,920
The Sea God has arrived.

114
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,880
The pearls are gone.

115
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,240
Li Ling.

116
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,960
You liar!

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,640
Even if I have to chase you to the ends of the earth,

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,280
I won't let you go.

119
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,520
Hey.

120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,800
This one looks better than the last.

121
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,360
My craftsmanship is pretty good, right?

122
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,600
It's beautiful.

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Where are we going?

124
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,600
To the ends of the earth.

125
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,160
Shall we go?

126
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,840
Let's go.

127
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,760
Tell me,

128
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,240
There are bandits at Mei Ridge,

129
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,560
and the trade route is blocked.

130
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,680
Yes.

131
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,920
Your daughter is weak and alone.

132
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,840
That's why she had to flee back.

133
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,560
So the tale that pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge,

134
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,520
who started that rumor?

135
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,920
When I returned,

136
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,520
I caught a few people and questioned them.

137
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,360
The rumor came from a man and a woman.

138
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,280
I guess it must be

139
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,480
Li Ling and Jia Rong'er’s former servants.

140
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,360
Well, well.

141
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,880
Li Ling ran away.

142
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,360
And you came back in disgrace.

143
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,360
So, apart from the Li family's assets,

144
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,400
after all our effort,

145
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,720
we got nothing.

146
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,920
It's bad enough Li Ling escaped,

147
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,560
he even took the list linking Hepu and the capital.

148
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,000
If that list is exposed,

149
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
your brother's days in the capital

150
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
will be miserable.

151
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,800
Zhang Ji.

152
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,000
You haven't really fallen for that boy, have you?

153
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,400
No, Father.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,720
Oh dear.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,640
Li Ling is really clever.

156
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't think you're the only one with tricks.

157
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,160
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge.

158
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Fine.

159
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Then I,

160
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,480
will truly make sure pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge.

161
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Zhang Ji,

162
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,640
your good husband has abandoned you.

163
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,760
The Deity of Pearls position that belonged to him

164
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,440
will now be yours.

165
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,760
Issue the prefect’s order:

166
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,480
Li Ling murdered Wang Cheng.

167
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,880
He fled to avoid punishment.

168
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,720
Jia Rong'er aided the bandits.

169
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
She will be punished as an accomplice.

170
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,040
Issue a wanted notice.

171
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,040
Arrest and bring them back.

172
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,320
Seize all assets of the Jia and Li families.

173
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,280
Confiscate everything.

174
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
After such a serious injury,

175
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,960
his power seems to have grown even stronger.

176
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,120
The wind is strong tonight.

177
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Put this on quickly.

178
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,960
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

179
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
Don't catch a cold.

180
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,240
Stop thinking about fighting Zhang He.

181
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,360
The people can't win against officials.

182
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,480
Even as a Han, you don't understand this as well as I do.

183
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,760
You don't get it.

184
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,800
But what if I say

185
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,920
we can still fight back?

186
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,320
If we want to deal with Prefect Zhang,

187
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,880
what's the most important thing?

188
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,720
Pearls, of course.

189
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,200
That's right.

190
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,520
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge.

191
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,440
The trade routes in Hepu are blocked.

192
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,680
My Li family

193
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,200
still has trade routes in the Central Plains.

194
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,280
Now, Hepu's pearl production has dropped sharply.

195
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,520
He took over both the Li and Jia family businesses.

196
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,840
And your last chest of pearls

197
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,040
only solved an urgent problem.

198
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,600
Hepu became a prefecture

199
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,320
because its southern pearls are the best in the world.

200
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,880
If Hepu has no pearls,

201
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,800
how long can he stay as prefect?

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,800
How long can he hold his position?

203
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,720
If Zhang He has no pearls,

204
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,640
and neither do you,

205
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,160
That's right.

206
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,200
We don't have any pearls now.

207
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,080
Zhang He holds all the power.

208
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,760
We still have no chance of winning.

209
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,480
This...

210
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,920
Is this true?

211
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,640
Li Ling,

212
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,240
I'm not dreaming, am I?

213
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
What are you two looking at?

214
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
Every beam of light you see

215
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,800
comes from a pearl-bearing oyster.

216
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,680
Li Ling,

217
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,600
have you noticed

218
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,840
these oysters

219
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,000
are all moving in the same direction?

220
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,240
Oyster migration.

221
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,920
Oyster migration.

222
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,760
Kana,

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,920
let's follow them and see.

224
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,120
Alright.

225
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,640
Kawu,

226
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,520
Yeah?

227
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,360
Full left rudder.

228
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,480
Got it.

229
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,200
Are you still alive?

230
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
Your grandpa is tough.

231
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
I won't die.
