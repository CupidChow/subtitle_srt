1
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,120
Li Zhong

2
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,480
This one.

3
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,280
This one.

4
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
And this one.

5
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,720
Li Zhong

6
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,720
Li Zhong

7
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Young Master

8
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,800
Let me help you.

9
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,680
Swap the pearls.

10
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
You really stop at nothing.

11
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,120
Wang Cheng

12
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,760
Today I'll show you

13
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,520
that in the face of absolute strength,

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,080
all your tricks

15
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,120
are just a joke.

16
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,840
Young Master Li

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
Have you chosen?

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Then open it.

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,000
Shopkeeper Wang

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,560
I suddenly want

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
to change the rules.

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
What trick are you up to now?

23
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,640
I don't want to compare pearl size.

24
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,560
Or value.

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,920
I want to compare

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,160
the pearl yield rate.

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
Li Ling

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,520
You're playing me.

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,040
Pearl yield rate?

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,120
How do we compare that?

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,000
Compare the number of pearls from the chosen shell.

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,680
Shopkeeper Wang

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,120
This bet

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,880
is happening in your shop.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm already at a disadvantage.

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,480
Can't I change the rules?

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,720
Unless

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
all the goods are yours.

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Shopkeeper Wang tampered with them.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,880
Change the rules.

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,520
Shopkeeper Wang is afraid to lose.

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,920
That's why he won't do it.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,080
Can you make him bet everything he owns?

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
Go all in against you?

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,160
It still depends on

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,040
your own skills.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
Where are his shells from?

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
Miss Shao switched his shells

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,800
for junk shells from Nan County.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
Alright.

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Li Ling

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,080
We'll do as you say.

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
The shells in my shop

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,320
have a pearl yield rate

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,040
of over thirty percent.

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
Oh dear.

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,080
If you ask me,

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,160
your shop

59
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,080
is all false advertising.

60
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,200
The goods don't match the description.

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,200
Whether the pearl yield rate exceeds twenty percent

62
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,040
is questionable.

63
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,720
But the shells I choose

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,560
if their pearl yield rate is below fifty percent,

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,920
I lose.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
Fifty percent?

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,240
Li Ling

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,880
Are you crazy?

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,480
If the shells you choose

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,120
have a pearl yield rate over twenty percent,

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,600
I lose too.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,000
If my shells' pearl yield rate is below thirty percent,

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,160
I lose.

74
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,240
Alright.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,840
It's a deal.

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,720
Miss

77
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,480
If you don't stop the Young Master now,

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,400
it'll be too late.

79
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,680
No.

80
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,360
Don't stop him.

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,800
Miss

82
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,560
Why?

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,080
Yeah, why?

84
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,080
Because I've never

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,520
seen him take anything so seriously.

86
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,760
Open it.

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,880
Li Ling

88
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,600
You're bound to lose.

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,960
Shopkeeper Wang

90
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't be so impatient.

91
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,360
A cooked duck still resists.

92
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,760
Alright.

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,440
Continue.

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,560
Two pearls were found.

95
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,920
How is Shopkeeper Wang doing?

96
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,400
Young Master Li found so many.

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,760
Young Master Li got so many pearls.

98
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,040
Why are Shopkeeper Wang's all empty?

99
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,400
None at all, how come?

100
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,280
What's going on?

101
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Why isn't there a single one?

102
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Empty.

103
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,280
This...

104
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,640
That's impossible.

105
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,760
So many.

106
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,280
So many pearls at once.

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,080
They're plentiful and beautiful.

108
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,600
Without makeup,

109
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,400
already a rare beauty.

110
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,600
Precious pearls

111
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,920
should be matched with a fine lady.

112
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,560
A perfect match.

113
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,280
Later, I

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,440
will gather a full set for you.

115
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,280
How about making a pearl necklace for you?

116
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't believe it.

117
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
The pearl yield rate is this low?

118
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
The pearl content percentage is really less than twenty percent.

119
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
Such a low pearl yield rate.

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,600
This Wang's Pearl Shop really is a shady place.

121
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,120
Young Master Li is truly impressive.

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,280
No need to open the rest.

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,320
The pearl yield rate has already exceeded fifty percent.

124
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,320
Shopkeeper Wang.

125
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
You lost.

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,360
Alright.

127
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,680
Li Ling.

128
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,320
You two

129
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,240
colluded to frame me.

130
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,840
Miss.

131
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
I've brought everything you asked for.

132
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,960
These handkerchiefs

133
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,880
were all embroidered by me.

134
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,800
I thought

135
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,520
Shopkeeper Wang truly cared for me.

136
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,400
He would never treat me as merchandise again.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Feigned affection.

138
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,720
False sincerity.

139
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,160
Let it all burn away.

140
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,320
So many love letters

141
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,640
were all from Shopkeeper Wang.

142
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,120
He once told me

143
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,360
every frown and smile

144
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
captivated his heart.

145
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,240
Impossible to forget.

146
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,840
I never expected

147
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,520
it was all fake too.

148
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,560
Burn them.

149
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,720
Burning them is right.

150
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,600
Shopkeeper Wang's affection

151
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
now

152
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,160
is all over.

153
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,600
The past

154
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,080
is nothing but smoke.

155
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,720
Wretched maid.

156
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,920
Nonsense!

157
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,200
I never wrote them.

158
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,320
He really didn't write these.

159
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,400
I receive so many love letters every day.

160
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,920
How would I know who wrote them?

161
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,880
What a convenient lack of evidence.

162
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,320
What a cuckold's hat.

163
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,480
As you wish.

164
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,880
Young Master kills with words.

165
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,080
I wound the heart.

166
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,480
To apologize for the pearl exchange just now.

167
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,320
That's not right.

168
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,480
What if I had lost just now?

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,120
Then the name embroidered on this handkerchief

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,960
would be Li Lang.

171
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,480
Impressive.

172
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,000
Reading the script while riding a donkey.

173
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,760
Alright.

174
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,680
Then...

175
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,880
I'll give Miss Shao a gift too.

176
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,880
Shopkeeper Wang.

177
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,560
Then this indenture contract

178
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,440
should belong to me now, right?

179
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,480
Alright.

180
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,120
Miss.

181
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,600
Young Master is being reckless again.

182
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,320
From now on,

183
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
I belong to Young Master.

184
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Ah!

185
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,280
It's burned.

186
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,120
That's the indenture contract of huakui Shao Wanru.

187
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,560
Just burned like that.

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Miss Shao.

189
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,320
You're free now.

190
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,720
Alright.

191
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,400
The Prefect has arrived.

192
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,880
Master Zhang.

193
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,760
Master Zhang

194
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,200
Save me

195
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,400
Master Zhang

196
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,440
No

197
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,120
Master Zhang

198
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
No

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,240
I did all this for you, Master Zhang

200
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Master Zhang

201
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,080
Master Zhang

202
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,840
His life

203
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,600
now belongs to me

204
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Young Master Li

205
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,600
The Wang Pearl Shop's ten years of business reputation

206
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,440
has been ruined by you in a single day

207
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,800
You really want to take the money

208
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
and even take a life?

209
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
Since the Prefect has spoken

210
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,120
Shopkeeper Wang's life

211
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,720
I can let it go

212
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,000
But this Wang Pearl Shop

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,520
has official documents as proof

214
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,480
Sir

215
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
Surely you won't make things difficult for me?

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,760
This Wang Pearl Shop

217
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,600
is the official shop for government and maritime merchants

218
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,880
Oh

219
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,840
May I ask

220
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,400
which government office

221
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,960
and which official?

222
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
The Prefect's Office

223
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,000
I am the official

224
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Then

225
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,480
According to the Prefect's words

226
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,000
this black-and-white contract

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,320
doesn't count anymore?

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,800
It counts

229
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,600
Of course it counts

230
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,720
Once the government

231
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,280
and the Wang Pearl Shop finish the inventory

232
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,680
what Wang Cheng owes you

233
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,200
I will guarantee

234
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,640
will be repaid in full

235
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,280
Then

236
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,280
I thank you in advance, Sir

237
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,680
Farewell

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,800
Let's go

239
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,560
We'll go too

240
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,080
Miss Shao

241
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
Today

242
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,880
I helped you burn your indenture contract

243
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,400
I also dealt with those people for you

244
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,040
Especially Wang Cheng

245
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,480
When he knelt down

246
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
it was truly satisfying

247
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,960
What do you mean?

248
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,600
Young Master

249
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,200
Why ask when you already know?

250
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,440
Without this document

251
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,560
people

252
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,680
won't see you

253
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,080
as my protector

254
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,960
Wait a moment

255
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
Miss Shao

256
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,400
You say the world is vast

257
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,680
You can go anywhere

258
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,360
You can even join a respectable household

259
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,320
Why do you cling to me?

260
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,760
I

261
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,320
was originally a fisher girl

262
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,400
My mother

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,840
was beaten to death by my drunken father

264
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,920
My brother went to sea with my father to collect shells

265
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,280
but entered deep waters by mistake

266
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,520
and was caught in a storm

267
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,240
never to return

268
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,200
I was left alone and helpless

269
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,440
tricked by relatives

270
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,680
and sold into a brothel

271
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,320
A drunken father

272
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,280
a mother who died young

273
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,480
a brother who died prematurely

274
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,240
a broken family

275
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,160
But what does this have to do with me?

276
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,040
Goodbye

277
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,000
Young Master

278
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,600
How do you know

279
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,920
that our meeting in this life

280
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,040
isn't to make up for past regrets?

281
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,080
Maybe

282
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,480
our meeting in this life

283
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,520
was something we begged for

284
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,680
in our previous lives

285
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,800
Previous lives

286
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Hmm

287
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,680
Our past lives weren't as you say

288
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,040
What are you doing?

289
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,280
Get out of my way

290
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,680
How dare you block my lady's path

291
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,160
No

292
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,480
You can't go in

293
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,640
Oh no.

294
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,680
Don't make such a fuss.

295
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,360
No, you can't.

296
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,920
Miss, hurry and leave!

297
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,200
You can't go in.

298
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,120
Miss!

299
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
You can't go in.

300
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
All of you, leave first.

301
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
All of you, leave first.

302
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,560
You too, get out.

303
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,360
I'll go out too.

304
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
Be careful yourself.

305
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,680
What?

306
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,760
Hurry, hurry!

307
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,600
No, no, no!

308
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,200
Don't!

309
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,760
Get up, quickly!

310
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,840
Let go!

311
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,600
No, that's not it.

312
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,080
Oh dear.

313
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,440
Rong'er!

314
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,680
Let me explain!

315
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,720
Rong'er!

316
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,800
I... I...
