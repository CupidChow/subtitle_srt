1
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,240
Eastern Han Dynasty

2
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,000
A single southern pearl from Hepu

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,400
is worth ten thousand gold coins

4
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,160
Betting on Pearls

5
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,120
The winner gains immense wealth

6
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,240
The loser loses everything

7
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,000
Only one among them

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,120
has never been defeated

9
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,640
is revered as

10
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,280
the Pearl God

11
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,040
This pearl will surely be this year's Pearl King

12
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,920
The title of Pearl God is mine

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,160
Next year's shell price

14
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,600
will also be decided by me

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,080
Li Ling

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
What do you have to beat me?

17
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,320
Shopkeeper Wang

18
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,920
The outcome isn't decided yet

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,920
Such words

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,520
might be a bit premature

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,560
Defeated opponent

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,360
Did you forget three years ago

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,680
how you lost everything?

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,800
Come on

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,920
Let's see what pearl you can reveal

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,240
Empty

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
Li Ling

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,280
You lost

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,960
Impossible

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,040
Wow

31
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,120
Such a big pearl

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,400
That's amazing

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,520
Purple is the most precious

34
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,880
Natural fluorescence

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,040
This one

36
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
is truly this year's Hepu Pearl King

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,520
Shopkeeper Wang

38
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,120
You lost again

39
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,800
Governor

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
Please announce the result

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,880
I hereby announce

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,160
the third Pearl God Convention

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Li Ling defends his title once again

44
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,960
as the Pearl God

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
According to the rules

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,880
The shell origin chosen by Li Ling

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,960
Linhai Village

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,760
is the land of the Pearl King

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
Linhai shells

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,760
are

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
first-class price next year

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
The shell origin chosen by Wang Cheng

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,160
Longkou Village

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,320
will be second-class price

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,400
Other origins

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,960
will all be third-class price

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,920
Pearl God

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,480
Congratulations, my husband

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
for winning the Pearl God crown again

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,840
Young Master Li truly shined today

61
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
In the hearts of the people

62
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
the image of the Pearl God

63
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,640
is truly irreplaceable

64
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,880
It's thanks to your cooperation, Brother Wang

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
If it weren't for Brother Wang and Governor Zhang

66
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,680
acting so well

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,920
how would they believe

68
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,600
I have divine skills in identifying pearls?

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,920
Ah

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,200
My good son-in-law

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,840
You're too modest

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,600
You've held

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,840
the Pearl God title for three years in a row

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Now

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
your prestige among the people

76
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,200
is far greater than mine as governor

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,480
by a wide margin

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,400
This Pearl God Convention

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,640
with our maneuvering

80
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,520
earned us an extra million coins

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,200
Those foolish people really think

82
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,720
the pearl price will rise next year

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,760
Plus the rumor that pearls cannot pass Meiling

84
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,200
Now everyone believes

85
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,480
all the pearls are in our hands

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,920
Governor Zhang's plan

87
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,880
is truly ingenious

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,640
When we mix in shells from other origins

89
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,880
add them in

90
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,160
buy at third-class price

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
sell at first-class price

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,800
we'll make a huge profit

93
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,640
Inspector Meng has arrived

94
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,600
His Majesty has issued an edict.

95
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
Kneel.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
In accordance with the will of heaven and the times.

97
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,760
The Emperor decrees.

98
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,480
Hereby,

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,400
I have heard of strange events in Hepu.

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,440
It is said the Sea God brings disaster.

101
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,840
Pearls cannot pass Meiling.

102
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,200
Refusing to accept Tribute Pearls.

103
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,520
Utterly absurd.

104
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,440
Current

105
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
Inspector Meng Chang

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,920
will escort the Tribute Pearls to the capital.

107
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,200
Pearl God Li Ling

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,280
is said to possess divine skills in identifying pearls.

109
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,080
will accompany the team to the capital for an audience.

110
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,280
By imperial order.

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,080
Pearl God Convention

112
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,600
Excellent pearls appear frequently.

113
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,800
Master Zhang

114
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Please prepare the Tribute Pearls.

115
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,800
Yes.

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
Young Master Li

117
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,160
You will depart with the team tomorrow.

118
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
His Majesty

119
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
is looking forward to seeing

120
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,760
Young Master Li's unbeatable

121
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,560
pearl gambling skills.

122
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,280
Don't disappoint His Majesty.

123
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,640
Commoner Li Ling

124
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,080
accepts the decree.

125
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,000
Receives the decree.

126
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Master Zhang

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,920
Your kindness to me

128
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,480
I have always remembered.

129
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,560
This journey to the capital to meet His Majesty,

130
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,080
I will not let you down.

131
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
When I return in glory,

132
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,360
I will surely repay you.

133
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Li Ling

134
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,600
Is this fool crazy?

135
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,480
He really thinks he's the Pearl God.

136
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,840
If His Majesty finds out

137
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,960
his divine skills are fake,

138
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,520
then...

139
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,040
that's deceiving the Emperor!

140
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
We'll all be doomed!

141
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,240
Silence!

142
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,960
We must not let him reach the capital.

143
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,360
Go!

144
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,480
Go!

145
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,480
Master

146
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Master

147
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,760
Master

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,480
Master

149
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,120
Master

150
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,240
You must not, Master!

151
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,000
Pearls cannot pass Meiling.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,280
The Sea God is enraged.

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,160
The consequences are unimaginable.

154
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,120
Nonsense.

155
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,600
The Emperor has issued an edict.

156
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,680
How can we disobey?

157
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,480
Such superstitions about pearls not passing Meiling

158
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,720
I will personally escort the Tribute Pearls to the capital

159
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
to dispel these rumors.

160
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,760
Set out!

161
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,040
Master, you mustn't!

162
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,480
Pearls cannot pass Meiling!

163
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,800
Pearls cannot pass Meiling!

164
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,640
Darn it.

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,920
Darn it.

166
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,400
The Sea God is enraged.

167
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
We're all doomed.

168
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,560
We're all doomed.

169
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,040
Protect the Master!

170
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,720
Protect the Master!

171
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,000
Keep the Master safe!

172
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,560
Pretending to be supernatural.

173
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
I want to see

174
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,080
what kind of demon or monster

175
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,040
is trying to stop us from passing Meiling.

176
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,600
Everyone, pay attention!

177
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Keep the formation!

178
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,080
Li Ling

179
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,600
Please be safe.

180
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,320
Protect the Master!

181
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Rong'er

182
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
Why are you here?

183
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,480
What's wrong with you?

184
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
What are you doing?

185
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,840
What exactly are you trying to do?

186
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,000
It's not the Sea God.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,080
Zhang wants to kill and silence us.

188
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,680
So it was them causing trouble.

189
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,440
Let me report everything to His Majesty.

190
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,680
Everyone, don't panic.

191
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,240
Someone is deliberately causing trouble.

192
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,520
What are you standing there for?

193
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,720
Run!

194
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Go!

195
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,280
Rong'er!

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,760
My wife!

197
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,560
Why are you here?

198
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,600
Why?

199
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,560
Why?

200
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,760
Why?

201
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,400
I didn't have to kill you.

202
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
As long as Meng Chang

203
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,560
doesn't take you and the pearls out of Meiling.

204
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,040
I didn't expect

205
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,640
you were determined to go to the capital and see the Emperor.

206
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,520
And this lowly maid,

207
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,120
she overheard things in my office she shouldn't have.

208
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,720
Then she came to report it.

209
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,880
Oh.

210
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,640
Speaking of this maid,

211
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,440
she was truly good to you.

212
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,600
Three years ago,

213
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
you lost everything.

214
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,160
To save your life,

215
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,320
she sold off all the Jia family's assets.

216
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,440
She even volunteered to serve in my office

217
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,240
as a lifelong servant.

218
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,920
Master Zhang,

219
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,040
please spare Li Ling.

220
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm willing to give the Jia family's granary

221
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
all to you.

222
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,720
I'll be your servant,

223
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
at your command.

224
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,240
To keep the secret,

225
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,960
she even cut out her own tongue.

226
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,840
I...

227
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,680
I beg you.

228
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Please, I beg you.

229
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,000
Let her go.

230
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,240
I...

231
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
I'll go with you.

232
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,240
I won't say anything.

233
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,280
By the way,

234
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,760
I'm the Pearl God.

235
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm the Pearl God.

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,160
I'm useful to you.

237
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,080
My skills are real.

238
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,160
Pearl God,

239
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,760
have you forgotten how you became the Pearl God?

240
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,400
Do you know why you were made the Pearl God?

241
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,000
Ah...

242
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,240
Because if the Tribute Pearls scandal is exposed,

243
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,160
you, the Pearl God,

244
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,360
are the perfect scapegoat.

245
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,280
All the rumors came from you.

246
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,240
The missing Tribute Pearls

247
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,280
were all taken by you, Li Ling.

248
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,240
You stole them.

249
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,240
Without us,

250
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,840
you're nothing but a pile of mud.

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,760
Remember three years ago,

252
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,520
that pearl gambling match?

253
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,600
I tampered with all the shells.

254
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
I rigged every one.

255
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
That pearl gambling match

256
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,760
was to win all your family's assets

257
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,560
from you, the prodigal son.

258
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,040
Then your Li family business

259
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,120
would belong to us.

260
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,000
And you,

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,240
would be a stray dog.

262
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,760
Left to beg and grovel.

263
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,720
And you'd treat us as your saviors.

264
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,320
Husband...

265
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,440
If I remember correctly,

266
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,520
this woman,

267
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,000
you were childhood sweethearts.

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
You were engaged.

269
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,960
But you,

270
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,640
for wealth and status,

271
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,720
married into my office.

272
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,240
Since you care so little for her,

273
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,080
I might as well send her to her death.

274
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,760
No!

275
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,760
No!

276
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,080
Li Ling

277
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,080
Let me tell you another secret.

278
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,040
I know.

279
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,480
Your incredible skill

280
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,080
is real.

281
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
But

282
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,840
I can't let them know.

283
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,840
If they find out,

284
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,600
they might not want to kill you.

285
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,840
So,

286
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,880
you must die.

287
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,440
Rong'er

288
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,680
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,480
If there's a next life,

290
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,560
I swear

291
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,640
I'll be a man who stands tall.

292
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
What's wrong with the Li family young master?

293
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,600
Young Master Li

294
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,960
Why are you spacing out?

295
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,120
Are you still betting or not?

296
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
This Li family wastrel

297
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,040
only won two rounds.

298
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,840
He's gotten carried away.

299
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,480
Why is he just standing there?

300
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,560
This is...

301
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,200
My family's pearl mark.

302
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,680
This is...

303
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,560
the match from three years ago

304
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,360
that ruined my family.

305
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,240
Could it be

306
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
I've gone back three years?

307
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,960
Li Ling

308
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Your Li family,

309
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,240
including your life,

310
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,240
from now on,

311
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,120
will all belong to me.

312
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,080
Li Ling

313
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,440
What's wrong with you?

314
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
I've already lost two rounds to you.

315
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,920
For the last round,

316
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,440
I bet all your family assets.

317
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,960
Do you dare?

318
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,040
Li Ling

319
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,320
What do you mean?

320
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,760
You...

321
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,320
What are you doing?

322
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,360
Darn it!

323
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,360
I'll beat you to death!

324
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,680
I'll beat you to death!

325
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll beat you to death!

326
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,280
That felt good!

327
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,480
Come on!

328
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,840
Are you okay?

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,560
Li Ling

330
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,680
Are you still betting?

331
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,360
Alright.

332
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,880
I'll bet with you.

333
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,680
What are we betting?

334
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,680
I bet...

335
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,080
I bet...

336
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,040
I bet all my assets.

337
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,480
That's right.

338
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,160
I want to bet all your assets.

339
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,800
My Li family is the top pearl family in Hepu.

340
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,480
Our wealth is worth millions.

341
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,520
You think you can bet against all my family's assets?

342
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,800
Are you worthy?

343
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,080
You're just a nouveau riche who made some money recently.

344
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,120
You want to gamble away generations of my family's fortune?

345
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
What gives you the right?

346
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,600
Fine.

347
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
If Shopkeeper Wang wants to bet,

348
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,080
that's fine.

349
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,000
But I want to add one more condition.

350
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,920
Betting our lives.

351
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,760
Is this Li family young master crazy?

352
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,880
Shopkeeper Wang let him win two rounds earlier.

353
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,680
He really thinks he can win.

354
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,120
Alright.

355
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,360
He must have a death wish.

356
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Betting lives.

357
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,160
I accept.

358
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,120
Do you remember the pearl gambling match three years ago?

359
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,120
I rigged all the shells.

360
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,560
Even if you rigged them all,

361
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,160
so what?

362
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,880
Wang Cheng

363
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,920
I want your life.

364
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,320
Darn it.

365
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,120
I don't have the ability yet at this time.
