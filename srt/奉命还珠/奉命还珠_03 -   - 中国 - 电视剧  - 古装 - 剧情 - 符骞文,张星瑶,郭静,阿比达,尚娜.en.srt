1
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,640
Li Ling

2
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,680
Your Li family

3
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,960
Including your life

4
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,920
From now on

5
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,760
will all belong to me

6
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,440
Li Ling,

7
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,680
This official

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,080
will surely make you prosperous

9
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,000
and bring honor to your ancestors

10
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,760
When my arm was broken back then

11
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,880
you actually returned my mother's

12
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,400
token that she gave you

13
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,920
You heartless, ungrateful wench

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,880
deserve to be a servant for life

15
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,200
Tell me,

16
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,560
what is Miss doing?

17
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,680
Yeah

18
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,520
No

19
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
It's not what you think

20
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,440
Rong'er, let me explain

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,880
Pervert!

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,760
Ah!

23
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,960
This is my home

24
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,680
I didn't go to the wrong place

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,280
You...

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,160
Why are you here?

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,680
That day, Young Master said

28
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,720
Wang Cheng

29
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
is not someone to be trusted

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,080
This humble one wants to ask

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Young Master

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,280
are you someone I can trust?

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,360
Keep your distance

34
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
What are you doing?

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,440
Such a beautiful night

36
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,560
Just a man and a woman alone

37
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
Young Master, tell me

38
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,600
what else could we do?

39
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,760
Though I was born in a brothel

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,360
but

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,960
I am still an untouched courtesan

42
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,400
Untouched courtesan

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,520
Untouched courtesan, that's good

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,320
But

45
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,680
Unfortunately, today

46
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,800
I am not convenient

47
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,520
Miss Shao

48
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
please leave

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,440
Young Master

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,920
Young Master

51
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,680
Just enjoy yourself

52
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,960
This humble one

53
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,640
will serve you well

54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,800
Young Master, please

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,280
be gentle with me

56
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,520
Miss Shao

57
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,160
You're not sincere

58
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,600
It's too fake

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,440
For someone like me

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,040
whether it's true or false affection

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,560
does it matter?

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,440
Your hand isn't injured

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,040
Wang Cheng sent you here

64
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,960
Everyone says

65
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,120
the Young Master of the Li family is a wastrel

66
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,120
Who would have thought

67
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,200
they were all wrong

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,320
Young Master, please save me

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,360
Why should I?

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,200
Wang Cheng

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,920
wants me to seduce you

72
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,080
If I succeed

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,040
with your profligate nature

74
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,680
you would surely buy my freedom

75
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,560
Then

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,200
he would get his hands on

77
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,640
my indenture contract

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
He would then lure you

79
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,200
to gamble everything you own

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,680
This Wang Cheng

81
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,800
what does he want from my Li family?

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,120
Why won't he let go?

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
I don't know

84
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,880
But Wang Cheng said

85
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,520
even if he fails

86
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
he'll find another way

87
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,800
You can't guard against a thief forever

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,360
You want me to save you

89
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,080
Fine

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,680
But it depends

91
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,960
on what you can do

92
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,040
I am at your command

93
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,960
But

94
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,480
Wang Cheng's men

95
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,480
are still watching us outside

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,080
Then, Miss

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,720
please dance with me

98
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
I'll keep watch here.

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,960
You go back and report.

100
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
Then I'll go back and report.

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,840
You stay here and keep watch.

102
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,960
Escort me down.

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,960
I'm scared, it's so high.

104
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,480
You're skilled in lightness techniques.

105
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,160
Are you sure?

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,800
That wastrel will come tomorrow.

107
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,960
The top profligate of Hepu.

108
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,680
I've already given myself to him.

109
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,800
But if he wants to truly have me,

110
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,600
he still needs to get the indenture contract you hold.

111
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,560
So,

112
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,960
he will definitely gamble.

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
So you're saying,

114
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,800
he's still that dissolute Young Master.

115
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,960
But,

116
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,240
whether he will risk his entire fortune,

117
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,040
and gamble against you to the end,

118
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,400
still depends on

119
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,160
your own abilities.

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,800
This humble one doesn't think

121
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,600
she's worth him risking everything.

122
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,240
But why did he suddenly refuse to gamble that day?

123
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
Could it be

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,640
I'm overthinking it?

125
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,600
Tell me all the details of that night.

126
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,520
Tell me everything.

127
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,720
His broken hand made things difficult.

128
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,080
Yet he still insisted on sharing the bed with me.

129
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,960
Manager Wang.

130
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,480
Do you still want to hear the details?

131
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,680
What,

132
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,240
do you want to as well?

133
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,680
You dare show me attitude after being tainted?

134
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
I...

135
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
If he comes tomorrow,

136
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,200
you know what to do.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,800
Once it's done,

138
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,200
the indenture contract will be returned to you.

139
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,400
This is all that's left of the Li family's fortune.

140
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,640
Young Master,

141
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,600
please stop gambling on pearls.

142
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,520
If you keep gambling on pearls,

143
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,160
you'll lose everything we have.

144
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,480
No wonder in my previous life,

145
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,560
they took the Li family and even broke my hand.

146
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,960
Wang Cheng,

147
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,800
it's time to settle your debt.

148
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
There must be pearls.

149
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,160
Pearls, pearls, pearls!

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,280
Shopkeeper Wang,

151
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,720
come out and greet your guests.

152
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,720
Why is he coming over?

153
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,400
Isn't that the courtesan Shao Wanru?

154
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,840
And the one beside her,

155
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,320
is that the wastrel from the Li family?

156
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,480
Didn't Shao Wanru go with Shopkeeper Wang?

157
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,000
Li Ling.

158
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
So it's Young Master Li.

159
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,240
He brought his lackey too.

160
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,360
No wonder I felt unlucky today.

161
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,840
Turns out my old shoes

162
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,480
were picked up by you.

163
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,240
The shoes may be worn,

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,560
but they're still new.

165
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,400
As long as Young Master Li likes them,

166
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,120
it's better than some people

167
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,800
who buy but never wear them.

168
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,240
Or maybe

169
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,320
they can't even put them on.

170
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,480
Wretch.

171
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,160
Enough, Shopkeeper Wang.

172
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,640
Let's speak plainly.

173
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,200
The two hundred thousand coins you owe me,

174
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,080
I don't want them anymore.

175
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,880
Give me Wanru's indenture contract instead.

176
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
Hand it over.

177
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
Two hundred thousand coins for a woman?

178
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,680
Li Ling truly is the top wastrel of Hepu.

179
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,720
Money—

180
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,920
I've got plenty.

181
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
But our match that day wasn't settled.

182
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,480
I don't recall owing you any money.

183
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
As for this wretched maid,

184
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,680
as long as her contract is with me,

185
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,880
even if I don't want her,

186
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,360
I still don't have to give her to you.

187
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,680
Ah!

188
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Wanru,

189
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,720
you heard it yourself.

190
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,880
It's not that I don't want to,

191
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,160
but Shopkeeper Wang is a master of shameless tricks.

192
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
He's perfected the art.

193
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,400
There's nothing I can do.

194
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,200
Farewell, then.

195
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,920
Let's go.

196
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
This humble one is not blessed.

197
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,560
I have no fate to serve you again, Young Master.

198
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
What are you doing?

199
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,200
This humble one

200
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,760
cares deeply for you.

201
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,920
But alas,

202
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,640
fate plays cruel tricks.

203
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,920
Enough with the drama.

204
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,400
Alright, Shopkeeper Wang.

205
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,200
Name your terms.

206
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,960
The unfinished match from that day—

207
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,440
today,

208
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,520
let's wager all we have, even our lives.

209
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,240
Shao's indenture contract is included.

210
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,480
Young Master Li,

211
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,400
do you accept

212
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,840
or not?

213
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,600
Ah?

214
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,960
Shopkeeper Wang,

215
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,800
you're betting this big?

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,760
I accept.

217
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,440
Darn it, it's over.

218
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,760
Young Master is being reckless again.
