1
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,600
Be careful climbing the ladder.

2
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,960
Slow down, slow down.

3
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,600
Father really wants me to marry that useless Li Ling?

4
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,320
How dare you!

5
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
It's your father's decision.

6
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,160
You must obey.

7
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,400
No questioning allowed.

8
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,760
But...

9
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,520
But what?

10
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,160
Do you really dislike him?

11
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Not really.

12
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,880
It's just...

13
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,360
My daughter,

14
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you truly not understand,

15
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,880
or are you just pretending in front of me?

16
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,520
I'm talking about the Li family's pearl business.

17
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you think if they hand over the Li family,

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,320
we can fully control everything?

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,920
Especially their trade route.

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,840
A list alone is useless.

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,000
Without the Li family's involvement,

22
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,240
they won't do business with us.

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,600
Think again.

24
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,480
But what if you become the Li family's daughter-in-law?

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,520
Zhang Ji,

26
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,120
you should thank Li Ling.

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,240
I told you before,

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,520
your last mission was your final chance.

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,880
You messed it up completely.

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
If Li Ling didn't want to marry you,

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,680
I...

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Daughter,

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,040
I know you feel wronged.

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,720
But think carefully.

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,880
If we truly

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,600
gain control of the Li family's wealth,

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,840
the appetite of those noble families in the capital

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
will finally be satisfied.

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,120
Your brother

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,000
will have a better life.

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,960
I understand, Father.

42
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,280
If this succeeds,

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,120
then a mother's status is elevated by her daughter's marriage.

44
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,840
Your mother's memorial tablet

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,040
can naturally

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,880
be placed in our Zhang family ancestral hall.

47
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,240
Thank you, Father.

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,800
Congratulations!

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,320
Madam Huang, you're too kind.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Steward, greet the guests.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,480
Alright, alright.

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,320
Congratulations!

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,880
Please come inside.

54
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,440
Miss has still entrusted herself to the wrong person.

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,680
Li Ling is so ungrateful.

56
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,560
Stop calling him young master.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,320
He married the governor's daughter,

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,360
but he could still marry Miss Rong'er.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,560
Ah!

60
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,000
What did you say?

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
Please calm down, madam.

62
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,960
Ouch.

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,960
Ouch.

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,560
The tasks Miss and Young Master assigned

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,320
we still have to do well.

66
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
Hurry up and go.

67
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Go quickly.

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,800
Woguan Ceremony (a traditional wedding ritual)

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,880
Duixi Ceremony (a traditional wedding ritual)

70
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,160
Tonglao Ceremony (a traditional wedding ritual)

71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,120
Hejin Ceremony (a traditional wedding ritual)

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,400
Let me ask you,

73
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,320
If one day you leave Hepu,

74
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,560
where would you most want to go?

75
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
To the north, I think.

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,640
I want to see the snow in the north.

77
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,600
It rarely snows in Hepu.

78
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,280
I've never seen snow before.

79
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,280
Alright.

80
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,560
Then, after we get married,

81
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,720
I'll take you there.

82
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,000
We'll see all the snow in the north.

83
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
I know, I know.

84
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,560
Peishou Ceremony (a traditional wedding ritual)

85
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,880
Jieying Ceremony (a traditional wedding ritual)

86
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,400
The ceremony is complete.

87
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,120
Escort them to the bridal chamber.

88
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,880
May you have a long and happy marriage.

89
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,880
They say a night of spring is worth a thousand pieces of gold.

90
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
But I feel in your eyes,

91
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,040
tonight isn't worth a penny.

92
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,640
Listen to yourself.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,120
I've been lying here for ages.

94
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,000
What are you doing?

95
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,480
Me?

96
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,560
Why are you staring?

97
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm not feeling well.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,080
I can't move easily.

99
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,760
Fine.

100
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,080
Then I'll do it.

101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,520
Oh!

102
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
The sky over Hepu

103
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,960
hasn't seen snow in years.

104
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
This is auspicious snow.

105
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,560
It foretells

106
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,960
Li Ling and Zhang Ji

107
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,120
will surely bring blessings to Hepu.

108
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,160
Since fate has decided,

109
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,760
you two are destined to be apart.

110
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
Why be sad about it?

111
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,760
Master Zhang,

112
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,040
will you marry me?

113
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,520
That's it?

114
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,320
Go on.

115
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,280
Li Ling,

116
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
Why aren't you pretending anymore?

117
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,400
You fooled my father,

118
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,960
but can you fool me?

119
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,360
You...

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,160
I...

121
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,000
Do we have a choice?

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440
If Li Ling wasn't marrying you,

123
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,520
I...

124
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,920
We're just people hurt by the governor.

125
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
All of us.

126
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,880
Since none of us have a choice,

127
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,240
why hurt each other?

128
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,920
If we get married,

129
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
at least we'll live a bit longer.

130
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,720
Isn't that right?

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,080
Husband,

132
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,520
I think you're right.

133
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,640
Greetings, Father-in-law.

134
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Greetings, Father.

135
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,520
Daughter.

136
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,880
Good son-in-law.

137
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,000
Come, come.

138
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,920
I have happy news to announce.

139
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,640
Soon,

140
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,360
I will marry

141
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,080
Miss Jia Rong'er.

142
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,320
Congratulations, Father!

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
With this,

144
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
our governor's residence

145
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,880
will have double happiness.

146
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
Congratulations, Father-in-law.

147
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,840
Congratulations, Miss Jia.

148
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,600
Miss Jia,

149
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,120
after my mother and mistress passed away,

150
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,680
Father has been busy with official duties.

151
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,560
He never remarried.

152
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,960
I never thought Miss Jia

153
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,000
would marry my father.

154
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,360
From now on,

155
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,280
please take care of Father.

156
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Once you are officially married,

157
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,520
I'll call you

158
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,480
Mother.

159
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,080
Once the Central Plains trade route is open,

160
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,800
the Zhang, Jia, and Li families will be united.

161
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040
Then Hepu

162
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,200
will belong to the Zhang family.

163
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,240
Daughter,

164
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,840
this is your husband,

165
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,360
and the list from Miss Jia.

166
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,720
Set out immediately.

167
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,400
While investigating,

168
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,280
do your best to keep the trade route

169
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,440
clear and unobstructed.

170
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,280
for our use.

171
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,440
Yes, Father.

172
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,240
Xiao Hong,

173
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,440
I'm hungry.

174
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,600
Bring some refreshments.

175
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,520
Yes.

176
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,760
Ouch.

177
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,160
Seriously.

178
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,120
Didn't I tell Kana to take you away first?

179
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,960
Why did you come to the Governor's residence?

180
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,880
And you're marrying that old bastard?

181
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,360
Hurry up and leave.

182
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,880
Go, quickly.

183
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,840
What are you doing?

184
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,880
Is it proper for the new son-in-law to speak of his father-in-law like that?

185
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,400
That's not appropriate, is it?

186
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,240
No, madam.

187
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,400
Stop teasing me.

188
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,200
I told you to leave first, I have my own way.

189
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,880
Your way is to marry Zhang Ji.

190
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,160
Then...

191
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,000
On your wedding night,

192
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,600
I waited outside your bridal chamber all night.

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,520
Do you know how I felt?

194
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,160
Since you can marry another woman,

195
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,720
why can't I marry another man?

196
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,400
Is that really another man?

197
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,200
That's an old man.

198
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,520
Do you know he's an old man?

199
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,800
What can he give you?

200
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,360
After your uncle and aunt passed away,

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,080
I've taken care of you for so many years anyway.

202
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,240
Changing my role

203
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,960
might not be so bad.

204
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,880
If I can't be your wife,

205
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,760
being your mother is fine too.

206
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,760
Rong'er

207
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
What I'm about to say

208
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,520
might sound crazy to you.

209
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,680
But I've decided

210
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,600
to tell you everything.

211
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,520
Actually, I've died once before.

212
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,600
In my previous life, I was killed by Wang Cheng.

213
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,520
You were killed by Zhang Ji.

214
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,640
But I know behind all of this

215
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,240
is Zhang He.

216
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,120
Heaven gave me a chance to live again.

217
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,760
But I know

218
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,560
the Li family's business still exists.

219
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,920
The alliance between the Li and Jia families remains.

220
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,080
He will never let me go.

221
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,360
So I gave up the Li family's business.

222
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,120
I abandoned the trade route.

223
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,160
I asked Kana to take you away first.

224
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,560
I just want you to live well.

225
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,800
But Zhang He

226
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,280
is truly cunning and deceitful.

227
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,560
If I don't fully join his scheme,

228
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,840
he will never trust me.

229
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,480
That's why I had no choice

230
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,080
but to marry Zhang Ji to gain his trust.

231
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,040
But then you showed up

232
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,200
at the governor's mansion.

233
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,120
You couldn't escape.

234
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,880
You should know, in our past lives,

235
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,520
you overheard their plot

236
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,440
and tried to warn me.

237
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,680
That's why you were killed by them.

238
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,360
It's as if everything is repeating itself.

239
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,960
I can't let this happen again.

240
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,680
When I came back to life, I thought

241
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,280
in this life,

242
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,040
I will never let you down.

243
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,720
I love you.

244
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,280
I want to marry you.

245
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,760
I want to be with you forever.

246
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,280
Do you know that?

247
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,720
You said you liked me.

248
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,600
You wanted to marry me.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,920
I told you so much,

250
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,680
but all you heard was

251
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,000
"pain."

252
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,720
That's how I knew this wasn't a dream.

253
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,960
You said you wanted to marry me.

254
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,320
I just knew

255
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,080
I just knew

256
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,880
you wouldn't believe what I said.

257
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,640
I believe you.

258
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,160
I trust you.

259
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
But I can't let you

260
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,840
take risks alone anymore.

261
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,440
Just think about it.

262
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,040
I know

263
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,560
you and Kana

264
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,960
must be planning something.

265
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
But Zhang He isn't so easily fooled.

266
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,120
Even if you give him the trade route,

267
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,200
he will still investigate.

268
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,280
Even if Zhang Ji

269
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,520
claims to be your wife, Li Ling,

270
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,960
in everyone's eyes before,

271
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,640
only I, Jia Rong'er,

272
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,240
am your true wife.

273
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,200
So unless everything is foolproof,

274
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,360
Zhang He won't let me go.

275
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,160
I have to give him more leverage.

276
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,680
Only then will you be safer.

277
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,760
But you can't marry him.

278
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,880
Zhang He stood guard outside your bridal chamber all night.

279
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,280
If I don't give him more leverage,

280
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,960
all our efforts will be wasted.

281
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,080
That old pervert.

282
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,200
Check carefully over there.

283
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,680
Yes.

284
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,040
Go quickly.

285
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,000
He ordered the servants not to let you near me.

286
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,160
Rong'er

287
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,520
I want you to be my wife.

288
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Not my mother.

289
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,760
Wait for me.

290
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,440
Hearing you say that

291
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,800
is enough for me.

292
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,160
Husband.
