1
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,680
Sister Rong'er

2
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,120
Did you find that foreign woman?

3
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,520
I went to the dock to check.

4
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,360
The boat is there.

5
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,400
But she's gone.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,040
Those foreigners

7
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,640
don't know where she went either.

8
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,960
What should we do now?

9
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,400
Sigh...

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,120
Sister,

11
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,480
where are you going?

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,080
I'm going to turn myself in.

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,280
I'll say

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,560
I killed Wang Cheng.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll exchange myself to get Li Ling back.

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,320
Oh no, Sister,

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,720
that's definitely not going to work.

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,360
Their real target is the young master.

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,840
But we can't just sit and wait.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,160
If there's no other way,

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,120
we'll hire bandits with money

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,360
to get the young master

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,240
out of the prison.

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Can you find someone for that?

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,200
Young mistresses,

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,880
breaking into the prison means execution of nine generations.

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,000
If you can't help,

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,040
don't make things worse.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,720
Let's go.

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,280
I...

31
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,960
Oh!

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,640
So this is the famous Li family, the top pearl house.

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,600
Doesn't look so impressive.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,440
Miss,

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,880
how dare you act so arrogantly in my Li family's shop?

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,560
Jia Rong'er from the Jia family.

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,400
She hasn't even married in yet,

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,200
and she's already acting like the head of the Li family.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,080
You...

40
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,760
Sister,

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,800
she's Zhang He's concubine's daughter.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,000
Zhang Ji.

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,520
A lowly courtesan from the brothel

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,800
really thinks she's a respectable lady.

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,760
You...

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,760
I know my own status.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,200
I don't need Miss Zhang to remind me.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,160
But Miss Zhang,

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,440
you barged in here by force.

50
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,640
How is that justified?

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,640
Justified?

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,360
Here in Hepu,

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,200
the Zhang family

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
is the law.

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,760
Miss Zhang, that's quite bold of you.

56
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,120
Oh?

57
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,600
Since Miss Jia

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
already says I'm bold,

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,520
then I won't hold back.

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
Hand over the Li family.

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,480
Why should we?

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,480
If you do,

63
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,920
he lives.

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,840
If you don't,

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,160
he dies.

66
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,560
How do we know

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,680
if you're telling the truth?

68
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,480
Guards!

69
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,440
Go to the prison

70
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,400
and bring out some of Li Ling's belongings.

71
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,280
Show them to the two ladies

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,600
as proof.

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,760
No!

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,520
Sister,

75
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
don't fall for her trick.

76
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,960
How come I didn't know?

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,760
Hepu

78
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,760
had someone as formidable as Miss Zhang.

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
In broad daylight,

80
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,920
openly seizing whatever she wants.

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,080
I heard you two were looking for me.

82
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,200
Miss Kana.

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
The affairs of the Li family

84
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,560
shouldn't concern you, a sea merchant.

85
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Hey,

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,400
the pearls from Hepu

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,360
are all with the Li family's pearl shop now.

88
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,200
You're about to cut off my source of income.

89
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,560
And you say it has nothing to do with me?

90
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,680
As for Li Ling,

91
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,080
murder is a crime.

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,440
Confiscation and imprisonment

93
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,880
are what he deserves.

94
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,640
But you, a foreigner,

95
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,720
do you want to break the law yourself?

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
Confiscation and imprisonment

97
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
are matters for your authorities.

98
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,640
But as far as I know,

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
according to your Han laws,

100
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,840
without a conviction,

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,160
confiscating property

102
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,920
seems to be overstepping, doesn't it?

103
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,320
Tell me,

104
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,560
if my trade caravan accidentally

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,720
spread word of this to the imperial city,

106
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
and it reached your emperor's ears,

107
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,880
would your governor's office

108
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,640
get into trouble?

109
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,680
Fine.

110
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,200
Next time, I'll bring official documents.

111
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,120
Then I'll see

112
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,120
how you can still protect him.

113
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,280
Let's go.

114
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,160
Thank you for your help, Miss Kana.

115
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720
Take someone's money,

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,320
solve their troubles.

117
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,320
Miss Kana,

118
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,160
Li Ling is innocent.

119
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,280
I know.

120
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,040
He asked us to find you,

121
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,400
so there must be a way.

122
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
I heard

123
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,160
Li Ling's fiancée

124
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,520
is supposed to be clever.

125
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,320
How did she end up so clueless?

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,160
I...

127
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,680
Miss Kana,

128
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,840
Sister Rong'er is just too anxious.

129
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
She's lost her composure.

130
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,640
Please advise us, Miss Kana.

131
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Whatever they want,

132
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,640
just give it to them.

133
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
The idea of paying to avoid trouble—

134
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,120
don't you understand?

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
But...

136
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,360
even if they get what they want,

137
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,440
they might not release the young master.

138
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,000
But at least it could save his life.

139
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,280
That's what Li Ling said.

140
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,200
Hmm.

141
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,120
The pearls he brought that day

142
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,800
were more than what you saw.

143
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,120
He only showed half of them.

144
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,160
He asked me to help.

145
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,640
He wants you to give up everything.

146
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,000
He wants me to take you away.

147
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,280
I didn't expect you two

148
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,720
to be so valuable.

149
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,280
This is a serious matter.

150
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,040
I must see him.

151
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,680
I want him to tell me in person.

152
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,400
I knew this money wouldn't be easy to earn.

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,760
Let's go.

154
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,120
Go.

155
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,840
Oh dear!

156
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,680
You two, open the door.

157
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,960
Go out first.

158
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,360
Ah!

159
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
If it weren't for your sake,

160
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,400
after what Li Ling did to trick me last time,

161
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,200
I would've killed him long ago.

162
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,480
Remember,

163
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
you only have the time it takes for one incense stick to burn.

164
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,680
Li Ling.

165
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Li Ling.

166
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Young Master Li.

167
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,280
What should we do?

168
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,280
Li Ling.

169
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,640
Li Ling.

170
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,800
Young Master Li

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
Li Ling, wake up.

172
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
It's me, Rong'er.

173
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,520
Rong'er

174
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,520
Wanru

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I knew it.

176
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,640
Kana can't refuse you.

177
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
Kana

178
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,000
I told you to take them away.

179
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,920
You didn't do it.

180
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
I'll have to deduct your pay.

181
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,680
Just focus on getting out alive first.

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,920
Li Ling

183
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,560
What's going on?

184
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,920
Merchants' profits

185
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,840
are seized by power.

186
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,320
Zhang He

187
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,920
wants to take over all my family's assets.

188
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,160
How Wang Cheng died doesn't matter.

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,360
What matters is

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,440
he's dead.

191
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm the biggest beneficiary.

192
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,880
So

193
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,560
I'm the prime suspect.

194
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Then

195
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,840
Should we just give him all our money?

196
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,800
Zhang He is very greedy.

197
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,480
Even if I give him everything,

198
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,040
he still won't let us go.

199
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,560
Is there

200
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,320
no law left in this land?

201
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
Sister Rong'er

202
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,080
This Hepu

203
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,280
is on the border of Han.

204
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,080
The emperor is far away here.

205
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,920
As long as the southern pearls tribute goes smoothly each year,

206
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,960
no one pays much attention.

207
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,560
A single prefect

208
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,480
can truly control everything.

209
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,760
Wanru is right.

210
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,040
Now

211
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,480
you're involved with me.

212
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,280
Zhang He definitely won't spare you.

213
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,800
That's why I asked Kana to take you away.

214
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,520
The merchant ships

215
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,000
won't be stopped.

216
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
You should leave.

217
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,520
The farther you go, the better.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Once you're somewhere safe,

219
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
I'll find a way.

220
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
You'll have to pay more.

221
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,800
This Li family

222
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,160
is a renowned pearl family.

223
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,040
Yet there are only a few pearls in the collection.

224
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,080
Are you joking?

225
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,480
Because of the pearl contract issue recently,

226
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,000
all the Li family's stock pearls

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,480
and the treasured pearls

228
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,960
were sold to the sea merchants.

229
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,800
Just barely got through it.

230
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
Is that true?

231
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,880
You may verify it, sir.

232
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,280
What about the Li family's trade routes?

233
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,320
We can't give up the trade routes.

234
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,600
The trade routes are the lifeblood of the Li family.

235
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
If we hand them over,

236
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,120
the Li family will never recover.

237
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
I only want Li Ling to be safe.

238
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,960
Have you thought about the rest of the Li family?

239
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,800
How will the others survive?

240
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,960
How am I supposed to live?

241
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,400
I can't worry about all that.

242
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,200
Shao Wanru

243
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm the one Li Ling is supposed to marry.

244
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,800
You're just someone he brought back

245
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,520
from the brothel as a servant.

246
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,920
In the Li family,

247
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,800
you have no right to question me.

248
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,400
You

249
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,040
Shao Courtesan

250
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,640
You've seen the Li family's situation now.

251
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,560
We're a fallen household.

252
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,840
We can't afford someone like you.

253
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,280
Do as you wish.

254
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,040
Jia Rong'er

255
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,440
You're just a merchant yourself.

256
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,120
What right do you have to judge me?

257
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,200
Even if I'm a merchant,

258
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,560
I rely on my own abilities.

259
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
Not on my looks.

260
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,720
See the guest out.

261
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,760
Miss Shao

262
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,720
Please leave.

263
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
Let's go.

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,880
Master Zhang

265
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,160
Oh dear.

266
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,840
How am I supposed to know

267
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,400
if this is real or fake?

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,080
Master Zhang, you can verify it.

269
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,600
How do I verify it?

270
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,040
A round trip to the Central Plains takes several months.

271
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
I have no patience for that.

272
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,600
Unless...

273
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
Lord Zhang, please speak freely.

274
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,800
Your Jia family must guarantee it.

275
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,600
You’re unwilling?

276
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,960
How can I be sure

277
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,080
that here

278
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,160
is all of the Li family's assets?

279
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,960
Are you hiding anything?

280
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,080
As long as you keep your word,

281
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,680
and stop making things difficult for Li Ling,

282
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,360
my Jia family is willing to guarantee it.

283
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,080
Before the investigation of the trade routes is complete,

284
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,680
I, Jia Rong'er,

285
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,400
am willing to enter the governor’s residence as a hostage.

286
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,520
Good.

287
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,280
I appreciate straightforward women.

288
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,080
Then, Miss Jia,

289
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,760
come with me to the residence.

290
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,400
They should have already been taken away by Kana.

291
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,720
Now I have nothing to worry about.

292
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
According to my memories from my previous life,

293
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Zhang He wants complete control over my Li family's trade routes.

294
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,160
He definitely won’t let me go.

295
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,720
He’ll try every trick to drag me into his schemes.

296
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,880
This

297
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,640
is my chance to survive.

298
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,880
Lord Zhang.

299
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,760
Lord Zhang.

300
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
Have you found the items?

301
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Lord Zhang.

302
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,760
Can you let me go now?

303
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,120
I thought you had changed completely.

304
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,480
But you’re still

305
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,040
the same useless person.

306
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,880
You want to leave?

307
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,040
Stay here.

308
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,040
Wait until the trade routes are clear.

309
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,400
No,

310
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,160
Lord Zhang,

311
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,520
what will it take for you to let me go?

312
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,880
Lord Zhang.

313
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,880
Foster father.

314
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,160
Foster father.

315
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,480
You have no sons.

316
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,520
I wish to acknowledge you as my foster father.

317
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,840
Who says I have no sons?

318
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,760
My son

319
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,680
is outstanding among men.

320
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,200
He has already entered the service of a noble in the capital.

321
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,520
His future is limitless.

322
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,320
Unlike you, a useless person.

323
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,800
You can’t compare to him.

324
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,240
Father-in-law.

325
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,640
Father-in-law.

326
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,400
Zhang Ji once expressed her feelings to me.

327
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,880
At that time,

328
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,400
I didn’t understand anything.

329
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
Now I’ve finally realized.

330
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,120
I wish to marry Zhang Ji.

331
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,720
I hope you will approve.
