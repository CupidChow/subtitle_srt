1
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,120
Open the door.

2
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,400
It's Li Ling.

3
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,480
Manager Wang was driven to death.

4
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,240
Now no one will buy our seashells.

5
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,480
Smash this crooked shop.

6
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,800
Smash this crooked shop.

7
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,640
Smash it.

8
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,240
Are you ready?

9
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,280
To become the manager of Li Family Pearl House?

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,000
Miss Shao.

11
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,560
Do you dare?

12
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,000
Everyone knows about you and Manager Wang.

13
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,200
Now that Manager Wang has just died,

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,160
you show up at Li Family Pearl House.

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,520
Once you step out this door,

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,640
there's no turning back.

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,600
Miss Rong.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,880
Isn't it just for this proof of allegiance?

19
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,320
Open the door.

20
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,040
Smash it.

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,720
If you don't want your shells to rot in your hands,

22
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,160
stop right now.

23
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,840
Shao Wanru.

24
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,680
That courtesan, Shao Wanru.

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,760
She's really here.

26
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,560
She's the one who caused Manager Wang's death.

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Manager Wang is dead.

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,720
No one wants our shells now.

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,120
She's ruining us.

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,280
Adulterers!

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,040
Beat her to death!

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Drag her to be punished by pig cage drowning!

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Beat her to death!

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
Drag her to be punished by pig cage drowning!

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,640
Beat her to death!

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,880
Drag her to be punished by pig cage drowning!

37
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,680
Beat her to death!

38
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
Miss.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
Should we go out and take a look?

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,960
Drag her to be punished by pig cage drowning!

41
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,040
The courtesan is in the past.

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,840
I have no ties with Wang Cheng anymore.

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,640
Standing before you now

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,280
is the Li Family Pearl House's

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,360
Manager Shao.

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,080
Wang Cheng treated me like merchandise,

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,360
gambling and trading me at will.

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,080
Everything I, Shao Wanru, have done

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,040
was only seeking a way to survive.

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,120
If you think that's wrong,

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,840
then I stand here today

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,600
and let you beat or scold me as you wish.

53
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,080
But if you want to sell your shells,

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,600
you must stop now.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,960
Today, as Manager Shao,

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,760
I can help you.

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,600
Then tell us,

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,480
what can you do to help us?

59
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,440
How can you help us?

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,920
Fine.

61
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,040
Then listen to my solution.

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,120
The Prefect's Office

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,040
since when does it handle

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,000
the funerals of merchant houses?

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,240
All are under my father's jurisdiction.

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,040
How could we stand by and do nothing?

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,320
The Wang Family Pearl House

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,680
has officially been renamed Southern Pearl House.

69
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,080
I will temporarily act as manager.

70
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,520
Once Manager Wang's affairs are settled,

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,080
the business will reopen.

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,440
When that time comes, I hope you,

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,640
will not hesitate to offer your guidance.

74
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,840
Whether the house is renamed

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,120
or Manager Wang's affairs are handled,

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,840
none of it concerns me.

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Prefect Zhang once promised

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,280
that after everything is settled,

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,320
Manager Wang would return all my money.

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,080
Every last coin.

81
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,000
I

82
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,560
am here to collect my debt.

83
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
The authorities

84
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,760
after settling accounts with Wang Family Pearl House,

85
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,080
found some losses.

86
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,080
Even if there's anything left,

87
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,760
it belongs to the authorities.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm afraid Manager Wang

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,360
couldn't bear this and took his own life.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,440
So, debts die with the debtor.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,960
This Pearl House

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,160
probably can't compensate Young Master Li.

93
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,720
So, debts die with the debtor, huh?

94
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,920
So all the debts were Manager Wang's.

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,040
Alas.

96
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,560
Manager Wang,

97
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,680
died a truly miserable death.

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,240
While he was alive,

99
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
he was insulted by debt collectors.

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
He couldn't even protect his own woman.

101
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,680
Such a vast family business,

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,120
and no one to inherit it.

103
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,000
However,

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,160
Manager Wang still left a letter saying

105
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,760
it was his own incompetence.

106
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,800
Do not blame Young Master Li.

107
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,240
Fine.

108
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,680
Then Manager Wang could have

109
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,640
transferred the Pearl House to me.

110
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,400
Why choose death instead?

111
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
That, I do not know.

112
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,160
But the Wang Family Pearl House

113
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,360
had close ties with sea merchants.

114
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,360
Its reputation was at stake.

115
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,560
The Wang family had no heirs.

116
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
So my father

117
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,520
let me temporarily manage it.

118
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,120
Alright, alright.

119
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,520
Today, I,

120
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,600
have truly learned something new.

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
This invitation

122
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,280
I won't accept it.

123
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,040
And I must trouble Miss Zhang

124
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,760
when you have free time,

125
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,560
to light incense for Manager Wang

126
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,840
on my behalf.

127
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,520
With Manager Wang's temperament,

128
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,880
at this hour,

129
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,920
he would surely seek out Miss Zhang

130
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,640
to settle accounts.

131
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,680
I forgot to inform you, Young Master Li.

132
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
The Wang Family Pearl House

133
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,680
is now history.

134
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,360
As for my Southern Pearl House,

135
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,320
it has yet to open.

136
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,600
We are not accepting pearls for now.

137
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,920
However,

138
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,840
before Manager Wang passed,

139
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
he said everything

140
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,080
started because of Young Master Li.

141
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,360
I wonder

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,240
if Manager Wang's friends

143
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,640
will come to settle accounts with Young Master Li.

144
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,680
I hope

145
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,200
you take care.

146
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,320
Go outside and shout

147
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,120
that Young Master Li, who caused Manager Wang's death,

148
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,960
has come to collect debts again.

149
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,600
Yes.

150
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,480
You.

151
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,640
What do you want?

152
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,680
That's my approach.

153
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
May I ask everyone,

154
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,200
are you satisfied?

155
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,680
How do we know

156
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,440
you can actually deliver?

157
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,640
Speak up.

158
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,240
Why should we trust you?

159
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,040
Smash her!

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,400
Open the door!

161
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
Smash her!

162
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,800
Speak up!

163
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
Just answer this:

164
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,880
Are you involved in Manager Wang's death?

165
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,120
Smash her!

166
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,800
Say something!

167
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,000
Why should we believe you?

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,840
Smash her!

169
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,000
Smash!

170
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,040
Alright.

171
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,160
Miss.

172
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,080
I

173
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,880
have severed ties with my past.

174
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,960
From now on,

175
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,360
I will never waver again.

176
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,840
Is that enough?

177
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,360
Speak up.

178
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,520
What gives you the right to guarantee this for us?

179
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,680
Because of the combined wealth of the Jia and Li families.

180
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,000
The Li family

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
is the largest Pearl Merchant House.

182
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,760
The Jia family

183
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,560
is the largest grain merchant.

184
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,440
With both Jia and Li families

185
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,520
acting as guarantors for Manager Shao's plan,

186
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,080
is there any problem?

187
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,920
If they're the guarantors, there's definitely no issue.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,720
Alright then.

189
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,040
We agree.

190
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,800
Tell us,

191
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,720
Li Ling only paid 30 percent of the price

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
to get those pearl dealers

193
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
to sell all their pearl-bearing shells.

194
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,800
That's right.

195
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,040
They promised

196
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,320
to buy the shells at 30 percent of the pearl content.

197
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
The dealers get 70 percent,

198
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,440
they only take 30 percent.

199
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,800
The Jia family also acts as guarantor for the Li family.

200
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,280
The biggest grain merchant and the largest Pearl Merchant House joined forces.

201
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,880
Everyone trusts them.

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,880
Even if they join forces,

203
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,040
there are so many shells in Hepu,

204
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,840
they can't possibly buy them all.

205
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,640
They only accept

206
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,320
those who previously worked with Wang Family Pearl House,

207
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,280
those with contracts.

208
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,480
No contract,

209
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,560
or forged contracts,

210
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,920
they and their villages

211
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,800
are all rejected.

212
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,680
So,

213
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
so,

214
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,520
Wang Cheng's death

215
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,440
didn't change anything.

216
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Then,

217
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,160
Father, do you want to...

218
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Fool.

219
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,240
Wang Cheng hanged himself.

220
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,320
There was a reason.

221
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,640
Besides,

222
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,120
he was an outsider.

223
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,400
No one would notice his death.

224
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,240
But Li Ling is different.

225
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,160
He's the son of Hepu's renowned pearl family.

226
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,720
If he suddenly died,

227
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,680
there would be trouble.

228
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Wang Cheng is dead.

229
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,680
So Li Ling

230
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,320
is the best candidate.

231
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Bring him to me.

232
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,400
I understand your intention, Father.

233
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,720
Ah.

234
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,960
Ah.

235
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
Sea merchant leader,

236
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Kana.

237
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,160
You know me?

238
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
I...

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,840
Of course I know you.

240
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,120
You're the famous overlord of the seas.

241
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,800
The governor's office appointed you

242
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
to work with Wang Family Pearl House.

243
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,840
Everyone in Hepu knows you.

244
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,120
Speaking of which,

245
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,720
I admire you greatly.

246
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,040
Then do you know

247
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,320
how much you made me lose?

248
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,280
Ah.

249
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,720
That's not my concern.

250
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,920
Wang Cheng died because of you.

251
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,440
That's really not true.

252
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,320
How can you prove you're not involved?

253
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,640
Idol,

254
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,920
you can't expect me to prove

255
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,160
something I didn't do.

256
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,480
But my business has been ruined.

257
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,640
So I want you to compensate me.

258
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,080
I...

259
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,440
I have no money.

260
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,800
No money?

261
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,240
The dignified son of the Li family

262
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
has no money?

263
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,280
Everyone knows I'm a wastrel.

264
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
I've nearly squandered the entire Li family fortune.

265
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,880
But you just won over the whole Wang Family Pearl House.

266
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
That's where you're mistaken.

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
Wang Family Pearl House has changed its name

268
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
to Southern Pearl House.

269
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,840
I didn't get a single coin out of it.

270
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
You have no money.

271
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,440
Then it seems keeping you here

272
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,040
is pointless.

273
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,640
What do you mean, pointless?

274
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,240
Ah!

275
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,800
Hey, explain yourself, idol!

276
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,560
I...

277
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,720
What are you doing?

278
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,240
Let go of me!

279
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,760
I...

280
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,240
Go.

281
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,400
No wonder I feel dizzy.

282
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Tie him up.

283
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,560
Yes.

284
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,520
Hey!

285
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,240
No, no, no!

286
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,480
Throw him.

287
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,080
Me...

288
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,920
Stop!

289
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,120
Ah!
