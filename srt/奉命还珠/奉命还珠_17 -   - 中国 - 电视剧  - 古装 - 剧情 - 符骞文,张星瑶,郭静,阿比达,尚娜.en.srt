1
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,440
Grain

2
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,320
Where did Li Wenshun get the grain?

3
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,040
Yes

4
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,200
It was given by the maritime merchants.

5
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,200
Maritime merchants?

6
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,240
How did Li Wenshun get involved with the maritime merchants?

7
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,120
It seems

8
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,800
The foreigner from the Lingyun Pearl was the go-between.

9
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,280
That little witch again.

10
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,880
Now she's linking Li Wenshun with the maritime merchants.

11
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,120
With just one word from Li Wenshun,

12
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,280
those commoners were pardoned for their looting.

13
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,720
This infuriates me!

14
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,400
Go

15
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,640
Write a letter.

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
I want to ask Zhang He myself.

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,440
Lord Zhang of Hepu.

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,000
He's always had dealings with the maritime merchants.

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,680
That woman

20
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,520
is also from Hepu.

21
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,080
I suspect he's behind this.

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,240
But we're allies with Lord Zhang.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,600
Allies?

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,360
Hmph.

25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,000
Hepu is short on pearls now.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,640
But they've had their eyes on our Nan Commandery pearls.

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,880
Using tribute pearls

28
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,920
to trade for a governor's life.

29
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,760
Taking advantage while I have no pearls.

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,320
When the tribute pearls are in crisis.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
That Wang Lie

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,440
is trying to take advantage of our misfortune.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,400
Father

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
But the Pearl God Festival is approaching.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,360
Is it necessary for us to deal with them now?

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,360
He's trying to threaten me.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,760
The aristocratic families in the capital

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
never respect the governors.

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,800
Including me.

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,120
Besides,

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
your brother's life

42
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,880
is still in their hands.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,480
Send someone over.

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,040
If it can't be done,

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,240
Yes

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,880
My lord

47
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,000
Zhang He received a letter from Nan Commandery.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,960
Do you know the contents?

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,680
No

50
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,320
My lord

51
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
Do these files contain solid evidence?

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,480
They were sent by Zhang He.

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,080
How could he leave any flaws?

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,480
But these files basically prove

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,040
what Li Ling told me

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,520
was not a lie.

57
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,720
But as for the migration of the sea shells,

58
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,800
I sent frogmen

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
to investigate the coastal villages personally.

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,040
So far,

61
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,520
Li Ling's words are true.

62
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
If everything he said is true,

63
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,400
then the grain disaster in Nan Commandery

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,840
is a real catastrophe.

65
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,320
Did Lord Zhang send you?

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,480
Yes

67
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,440
Alright

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,680
Go tonight and get Li Wenshun

69
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,520
and kill him for me.

70
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,760
Young Master

71
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,720
Li Zhong

72
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,880
These bandits

73
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,480
are far too brazen.

74
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,440
They even dared to break into the Governor's residence.

75
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,320
Intending to harm me.

76
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,320
Oh dear

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,400
Lord Li

78
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,160
Why do you say "break in"?

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,040
Didn't you say anyone can enter the Governor's residence

80
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,200
as long as they pay?

81
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,560
Even the night clothes are worn openly.

82
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,360
Oh dear

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,000
I owe you my life again.

84
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,080
But right now,

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
I truly have no one to rely on.

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,600
Sigh

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,840
How can you say that?

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,760
Isn't someone right here for you?

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
Didn't this person come to you himself?

90
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,400
Young Master

91
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,760
He calls you Young Master.

92
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,320
Why is that?

93
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,520
Oh dear

94
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,480
It's a long story.

95
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,040
I'll explain it to you later.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,160
Let's first figure out

97
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,720
what exactly happened this time.

98
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,120
Wang Lie

99
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,160
ordered the Governor of Hepu

100
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,720
to hire assassins.

101
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,560
This is unbelievable.

102
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,840
Unbelievable.

103
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,760
My life, Li Wenshun's life,

104
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,600
is so easily dismissed by them?

105
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,360
At that time,

106
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,840
did you really plan to kill Lord Li?

107
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,680
How could I dare?

108
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,640
I just sent my men to do it.

109
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,800
Besides,

110
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm smart enough

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,120
to see it was just a pillow.

112
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,200
Anyway, Zhang Ji said

113
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,280
if we failed,

114
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
just blame it all on Wang Lie.

115
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,720
No one said we had to kill Lord Li for sure.

116
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,880
So Zhang He

117
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,360
isn't afraid of being exposed

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
and getting implicated?

119
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,000
Lord Li

120
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,960
People like Li Zhong,

121
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,640
alive, their words mean nothing.

122
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,600
Dead, and dead men tell no tales.

123
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,160
Young Master

124
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Why do I feel

125
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,680
so miserable when you say that?

126
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,080
When can I return?

127
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,520
What,

128
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,000
don't you want your Jianjia anymore?

129
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,520
Lord Li

130
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,400
These merchants

131
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,120
hiring assassins to kill a Governor

132
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
is a capital crime.

133
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,200
Whether this is

134
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
true

135
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,200
or false,

136
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,160
no matter how powerful the aristocratic families behind it are,

137
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,080
Lord Li

138
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,760
shouldn't you take action?

139
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,280
Well...

140
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Lord Li

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,120
This grain

142
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
can't get past Meiling.

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,440
And news

144
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,240
can't leave Nan Commandery either.

145
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,720
Hmm

146
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,240
It's done.

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,400
Hmm

148
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,680
Master

149
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,440
The Governor's residence is in chaos now.

150
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,640
Seems something big happened.

151
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,840
Li Wenshun

152
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,040
You dared to offend me.

153
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,480
This is your fate.

154
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,320
You may leave.

155
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,440
One more thing.

156
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,800
I wonder if you

157
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
are interested.

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,240
Speak.

159
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,760
Near the eastern suburbs, not far from the Governor's residence,

160
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,960
we found a granary.

161
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,880
It stores

162
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,320
a large amount of grain.

163
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,520
Really?

164
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,080
You run a grain business.

165
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,120
This kind of news

166
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,480
should fetch a good price.

167
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,000
Wait.

168
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,280
The rules of the underworld.

169
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,880
The information sold to you

170
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,560
must not be passed to a third party.

171
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

172
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,280
Someone, come!

173
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,800
Guards!

174
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,880
Don't move.

175
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,880
Let me go!

176
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,080
How dare you betray me!

177
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,440
I'll kill you all!

178
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,200
Young Master.

179
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,040
I've done something great this time, right?

180
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,880
Li Wenshun.

181
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,720
Do you really dare to touch me?

182
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,840
You're about to die,

183
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,720
and you still act so arrogant.

184
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,520
And who are you?

185
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,200
Oh?

186
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,200
You forgot about me, sir.

187
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,440
Oh, right.

188
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,160
Hmm.

189
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,280
Oh.

190
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,480
So that little witch sent you.

191
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
If you say so,

192
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,680
that's fine.

193
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,640
But,

194
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm afraid you won't leave here alive today.

195
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,400
If you dare touch me,

196
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
can you handle the consequences?

197
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,800
Wang Lie.

198
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,440
I'll kill you!

199
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,800
What's wrong?

200
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,320
Ah!

201
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
That jerk!

202
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,760
He sent people to sink the ships.

203
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,640
All three of my big ships sank.

204
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,080
All the grain is gone too.

205
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
So many people haven't eaten yet.

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,720
What?

207
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,160
The ships sank?

208
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,240
The grain is gone?

209
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,840
Li Ling.

210
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,040
You owe me ships.

211
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,960
You owe me grain.

212
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,240
Did you think

213
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,640
I didn't have a backup plan?

214
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,400
and still dared to come here?

215
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,360
I've prepared a big surprise for you.

216
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,640
Report!

217
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,120
Report!

218
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,880
The Nan River levee broke!

219
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,920
Floods for miles around!

220
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
This year's crops

221
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,080
are all ruined.

222
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,640
You're insane!

223
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,200
You're insane!

224
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,400
Wang Lie.

225
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,560
For your own selfish desires,

226
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
you ignore the lives of the people.

227
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
Your crimes are unforgivable.

228
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,040
Li Wenshun.

229
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
You're just my dog, Li Wenshun.

230
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,640
Do you dare kill me?

231
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,440
Do you dare kill me?

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,160
Wang Lie.

233
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,520
Darn it, Wang Lie!

234
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,840
This grain disaster

235
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,960
has come after all.

236
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,320
We were unloading cargo at the time.

237
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,440
Only half the grain made it ashore.

238
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,400
The rest sank with the ship.

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,280
Even if I urgently transfer grain from Jiaozhi now,

240
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,600
and bring it here quickly,

241
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,160
the round trip will take time.

242
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,000
The people of Nan Commandery can't wait that long.

243
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,400
The pearls from Lingyunzhu

244
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,200
could have been traded for a lot of grain.

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But now,

246
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,080
there's no grain to exchange.

247
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,080
The breach and the shipwreck

248
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,440
can't be kept secret.

249
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,200
The grain disaster

250
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,280
will surely cause panic among the people.

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
If we have no good solution,

252
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,800
all of Nan Commandery

253
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
will suffer greatly.

254
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,360
Nan Commandery has pearls but no grain.

255
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,400
Where are pearls most needed?

256
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,560
Are you referring to

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,880
Hepu?

258
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,400
How much grain is sold to Hepu

259
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,600
by the maritime merchants?

260
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,080
No one knows better than I do.

261
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,920
Even counting the reserves from when trade routes were open,

262
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,520
to sustain

263
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
both Nan Commandery and Hepu,

264
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,480
the livelihoods of the people in both regions,

265
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,960
won't last long.

266
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,440
Can it last until

267
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,880
you bring grain from overseas?

268
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,360
Sigh.

269
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,520
Maybe if we sail at full speed.

270
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,240
But you forgot my ship sank.

271
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,360
I'll send an official vessel

272
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,920
to take Miss Kana out to sea.

273
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,920
Alright.

274
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,400
Then I'll set out now.

275
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,920
Wait for my return.

276
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,280
Young Master,

277
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,320
did you notice

278
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,640
that this time Kana

279
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,200
didn't mention money to you?

280
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,800
Talking about money

281
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
hurts relationships.

282
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,760
Lord Li,

283
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,480
there's one more thing

284
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,520
I need your help with.

285
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,760
Please, go ahead.

286
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,880
We need to gather all the pearls

287
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
and take them to Hepu to exchange for grain.

288
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,480
But this time,

289
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,480
the pearls

290
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,040
can't be handed to Zhang He.

291
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,440
Then who can we give them to?

292
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,800
The Imperial Inspector,

293
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,800
Meng Chang.
