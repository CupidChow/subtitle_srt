1
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,560
Mei Ridge

2
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,840
The trade route from Hepu must pass through Mei Ridge.

3
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,120
In the previous life, Zhang He hid tribute pearls for himself.

4
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,920
He spread Sea God rumors to keep pearls from leaving Mei Ridge.

5
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,640
So this time,

6
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,240
if I take the initiative first,

7
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,600
Ah,

8
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,240
tell me,

9
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,200
we're just married,

10
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,960
the wedding night isn't even over,

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,560
are you really leaving?

12
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,280
Isn't that exactly what you want?

13
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,920
How can you say that?

14
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,320
Lately I've heard,

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,680
Hepu has no shells to export,

16
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,480
so the people, forced by hardship,

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
have turned into roaming bandits.

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,720
They wander between

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,240
Mei Ridge and Hepu.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,320
And Mei Ridge

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,320
just happens to be the only way for Hepu's trade.

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,320
Are you worried about me?

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,800
You're my wife.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,000
Caring for you

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,760
and helping you

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,880
is my duty as your husband.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,040
If that's how you see it,

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,160
you already have a plan.

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,160
I just want to ask you,

30
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,040
do you want to go?

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
If not for my father's orders,

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,560
I wouldn't want to travel so far.

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,760
Risking my life.

34
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,480
But if I don't go,

35
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,600
I'll be whipped every day in this house.

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,680
Ah,

37
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,440
I do have an idea.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,880
Oh?

39
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,280
These refugees have become bandits

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,240
only recently.

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,440
They're not a real threat yet.

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,080
But if one day

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,440
these bandits grow more rampant,

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,520
blocking Hepu's trade route,

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Mei Ridge,

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,280
then you'd have a reason not to go.

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,640
But these refugees run around every day,

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
they might not stay in Mei Ridge.

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,200
That's true.

50
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,760
With your influence,

51
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,840
raising bandits shouldn't be hard.

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
Then when the time comes,

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
how should I deal with my father's crackdown?

54
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,880
Ah, my dear,

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,680
tell me,

56
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,720
if the bandit problem isn't real,

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,240
but the Sea God is angry and brings divine punishment,

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,920
forbidding pearls from leaving Mei Ridge,

59
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
do you think your father

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,680
would truly act for the people,

61
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,000
sending troops to suppress bandits,

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,880
or would he

63
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,160
go along with it,

64
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,120
using the Sea God's name

65
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,040
to keep the pearls in Mei Ridge?

66
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,200
A rare commodity is worth keeping.

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,720
Greetings, Father-in-law.

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,200
Li Ling.

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,960
You arrived just in time.

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,800
You, as a father-in-law, are abusing your power.

71
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,640
You want to buy a whole cart of my finest tribute pearls for just a hundred thousand coins?

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,000
These pearls—

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,760
If I resell them overseas,

74
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,680
I could make at least another hundred thousand coins.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,880
My good son-in-law,

76
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Come, tell us—

77
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,320
What price did you originally set

78
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,680
when you sold them to Miss Kana?

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,840
Father-in-law,

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Eighty thousand coins.

81
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,000
See?

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,120
Miss Kana,

83
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
You resold them

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,720
and made a profit of twenty thousand coins.

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
Plus, you saved yourself

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
the trouble of traveling around.

87
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,960
Li Ling,

88
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,000
those pearls back then—

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,240
why did you sell them to me at such a low price?

90
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,960
Don’t you know the reason yourself?

91
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,680
And the task I gave you,

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,320
didn’t you fail to handle it properly?

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,080
I haven’t even deducted your payment yet.

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,160
Birds of a feather.

95
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
I’m not selling anymore.

96
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,880
I’ll ship them overseas myself.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,080
I can sell them for double the price.

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,760
Miss Kana,

99
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,720
without an official pass from the governor’s office,

100
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,200
your ship

101
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,160
can’t leave Hepu.

102
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,400
Is that so?

103
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,880
This batch of pearls

104
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,720
is indeed worth two hundred thousand coins.

105
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,120
But the price I sold them to you for

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,280
was truly low.

107
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,960
If you ship them overseas to sell,

108
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,440
there will be plenty of costs along the way.

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
How about this—

110
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,520
Let me make a suggestion.

111
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,720
Let’s compromise.

112
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,200
One hundred twenty-eight thousand coins.

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,400
This way, everyone

114
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,200
can prosper all year round.

115
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,200
Father-in-law,

116
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,560
what do you think?

117
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,200
Since my son-in-law has spoken,

118
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,080
how could I refuse?

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,720
So, Miss Kana, what do you say?

120
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,200
You—

121
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,600
You’re all working together,

122
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,360
all of you are villains.

123
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,960
Bring the contract.

124
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Miss Kana.

125
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
Once you bring the pearls over,

126
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,120
I will have everything ready.

127
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
Alright.

128
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,520
Okay.

129
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,520
Once the contract is signed,

130
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,240
give me the travel permit immediately.

131
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,760
This lousy place of yours,

132
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,480
I don't want to stay here a moment longer.

133
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,440
Kana, let's go.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,480
Father-in-law.

135
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,000
Hmm.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,960
Why buy so many pearls?

137
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,800
Ah, this is all thanks to you.

138
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,960
We're about to pay tribute soon.

139
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,160
The tribute pearls from the prefecture

140
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
are completely gone.

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,240
I wanted to use your family's pearls

142
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,160
as tribute to send to the capital.

143
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,120
But you,

144
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
sold them all to the sea merchants.

145
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,480
Tell me,

146
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,200
if I don't buy them back from them,

147
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,120
do you have a better solution?

148
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
This matter

149
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,600
isn't entirely my fault.

150
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,280
After all, I'm just a pearl seller.

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
But

152
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,080
buying pearls from the sea merchants

153
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,680
is only a temporary fix.

154
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,760
Do you think I haven't considered that?

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,880
I've already ordered

156
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,040
the pearl households

157
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,560
to hurry and harvest more oysters.

158
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
Try to make up for this year's shortage.

159
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,800
But now,

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:35,840
the pearl yield in Hepu has dropped sharply.

161
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,920
The pearl yield in Hepu has dropped sharply.

162
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,960
If we increase harvesting now,

163
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,120
we'll only be draining the pond to catch the fish.

164
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
Ah.

165
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
My good son-in-law,

166
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,120
you're still too young.

167
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,520
There are many ways

168
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,200
to maximize profit from pearls.

169
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,840
To

170
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,440
motivate the pearl households,

171
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm planning to hold a Pearl God Festival.

172
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,960
Just wait,

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,520
you'll be the Pearl God.

174
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,160
Pearl God, Pearl God, Pearl God.

175
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
If the tribute pearls issue is exposed,

176
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,880
you, as the Pearl God,

177
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,120
will be the perfect scapegoat.

178
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,000
Pearl God.

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
The Pearl God Festival is happening earlier than expected.

180
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,280
My plan has to move up too.

181
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Xiao Hong.

182
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,680
It's getting cold.

183
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,200
Go get me a coat.

184
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes.

185
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,880
Rong'er

186
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,960
Your handwriting is really ugly.

187
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,520
Practice more.

188
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,440
What does this mean?

189
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,320
It means I've checked it.

190
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,080
Our flower umbrellas are really good quality.

191
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,600
Miss, buy one, please.

192
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,280
Sure.

193
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,640
Alright, alright.

194
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,000
Miss

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,880
Have you heard of the Sea God?

196
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,800
Are you crazy?

197
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,640
Have you heard about it?

198
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
Get lost.

199
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,080
Hey.

200
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,360
Did you hear?

201
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,680
Mei Ridge is haunted.

202
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,360
You're nuts.

203
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,000
Do you know?

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
Mei Ridge is haunted.

205
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,120
You look more like a ghost.

206
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,240
It's true, it's haunted.

207
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,920
Do you know?

208
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,200
Mei Ridge is haunted.

209
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,520
There's a Sea God.

210
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,480
Really.

211
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,520
His tongue is super long.

212
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,320
He even carries a hammer.

213
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,880
Bang bang bang.

214
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,320
That Sea God eats people and pearls.

215
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,680
Quick, tell everyone.

216
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,200
Hurry, hurry!

217
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,280
You haven't seen it.

218
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,760
It has big wings on its chest.

219
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
It's taller than a person.

220
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
It's terrifying.

221
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,400
Let me tell you a story, kids.

222
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,680
What story?

223
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,360
What kind of story?

224
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,560
Well, it's like this—

225
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,840
The Sea God is here!

226
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,160
We need the official to help us figure something out.

227
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,960
Right?

228
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,440
Sir,

229
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,240
Sir, the pearls can't cross Mei Ridge.

230
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,960
All the money is right here.

231
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,600
Miss Kana,

232
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,640
Let's settle payment and goods.

233
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
Come, take it away.

234
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,520
Hey!

235
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm selling pearls,

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,960
not the boxes.

237
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,240
Bring your own boxes to pack them.

238
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,520
You—

239
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,000
What do you mean?

240
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,040
Do you know how much

241
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,080
your Lord Zhang made me lose on this deal?

242
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
These two boxes are made of nanmu wood.

243
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,600
They're expensive!

244
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,240
Fine, whatever.

245
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,320
Go.

246
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,160
Bring two boxes.

247
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,360
What do you want me to do?

248
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,120
Help me sell this batch of pearls

249
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,840
to the prefecture at a low price.

250
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,360
Then spread the word

251
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,000
that they were all bought from me.

252
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,240
The prefecture is selling pearls.

253
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,160
Why would they buy pearls from me?

254
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
From now on,

255
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,280
Hepu will have no pearls.

256
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,520
The prefecture will have no pearls.

257
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,240
Only you will have pearls.

258
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,720
The end of the year is near.

259
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Hepu must offer tribute pearls to the court.

260
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,640
Lord Zhang will have to buy from you.

261
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,280
What will it cost me?

262
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,200
Help me take a few people away.

263
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,280
May you have a long and happy marriage.

264
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,040
Your plan is to marry Zhang He's concubine's daughter.

265
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,800
If I don't join their scheme,

266
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,600
I'm as good as dead.

267
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,320
What do you know?

268
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,640
Oh.

269
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,960
You mean

270
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,560
you want to find their weakness.

271
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,480
At least make sure everyone survives.

272
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,320
You're still here,

273
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,760
so you haven't taken them away.

274
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
You've broken your promise.

275
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,080
Fine.

276
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,360
I broke the deal first.

277
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,320
Go ahead.

278
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,280
What do you want me to do this time?

279
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,080
Still want me to take people away?

280
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,080
Who?

281
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,160
Me.

282
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,280
Hey, wait!

283
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,160
And Jia Rong'er.

284
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,240
When?

285
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,520
Let's set a code word.

286
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,360
The selling price of the pearls

287
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,240
will be the final date.

288
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,800
I have a suggestion.

289
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,200
Let's compromise.

290
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,440
128,000 coins.

291
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,560
Bring the contract.

292
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,520
Xiao Hong,

293
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,960
I'm sorry.
