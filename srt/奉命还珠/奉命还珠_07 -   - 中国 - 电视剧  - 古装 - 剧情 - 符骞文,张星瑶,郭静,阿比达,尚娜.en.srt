1
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,640
Throw.

2
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,880
Stop.

3
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,880
Got money or not?

4
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,000
I have no money.

5
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,560
Continue.

6
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,760
Stop.

7
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
Got money or not?

8
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,800
I really don’t have any money.

9
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,160
This...

10
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,960
I’ve squandered all the Li family’s fortune.

11
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,040
Who doesn’t know that?

12
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
I’ll ask you one last time.

13
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,160
If you don’t have money,

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
you’ll be fish food.

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,600
I-I have money.

16
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,760
I don’t have money right now.

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,720
But I will have money.

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
Alright, alright.

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,320
You, Li family and Jia family, joined forces.

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,120
At thirty percent of the price.

21
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,400
You bought all the pearls from Wang’s shop.

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,880
You bought all their pearls.

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,560
With this,

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,840
your Li family dominates Hepu’s pearl trade.

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,120
You’re the only big player now.

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,360
Now,

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,080
you still claim you have no money?

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,440
I do, I do, I do!

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,320
I have money.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
Then tell me,

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,800
how are you rich?

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,040
I have pearls.

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,560
I have them.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,720
I have pearls.

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
Ordinary pearls

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,840
don’t interest me.

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,480
I only want premium ones.

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,800
They’re all premium.

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
You really have premium pearls?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,160
You’re just making things up.

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,720
The pearls from Hepu these days

42
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,880
are getting worse and worse.

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,760
How can you offer me premium pearls?

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
My Li family has been in pearls for generations.

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,200
Others may not know,

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,920
but my family has plenty of premium pearls.

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,840
Wait a moment.

48
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,960
Pull me up!

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,840
Look,

50
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,080
he can’t hold on anymore.

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
Hurry and pull me up!

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,120
Hey!

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,440
Kawu.

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,120
Yes.

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,040
Eh?

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,480
Did you find him?

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,920
No.

58
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,960
The young master is nowhere to be found.

59
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,000
What should we do?

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,080
I searched so hard.

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,800
I’ve looked everywhere.

62
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
But he’s just not here.

63
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,160
Where could he have gone, tell me?

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,760
I even checked under the flowerpots.

65
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,920
Went behind the rockery too.

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,880
Even checked the bun shop.

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,160
The world’s so big, so many people.

68
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,640
How can we find him?

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,320
Make way.

70
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:31,960
Young master.

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,600
Li Ling.

72
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,520
Why are you here?

73
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,640
Why wouldn’t I be here?

74
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,720
Li Ling.

75
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,600
Where did you go?

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,640
Why are you only back now?

77
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,400
Don’t mention it.

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,240
I got kidnapped.

79
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,520
Young master.

80
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,000
I...

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,560
I know about your joint shell collection.

82
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,080
These are the shells we collected this time.

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
We opened some.

84
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,720
But...

85
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
The pearl yield is extremely low.

86
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,040
Ah.

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,720
Hmm.

88
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,080
With such a low pearl yield,

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,520
it’s not even twenty percent.

90
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,040
Someone!

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Open all the shells for me.

92
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,960
Come on, come on.

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,120
These pearls of ours

94
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,240
come from those pearl households

95
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
using inferior shells

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,600
Are they just mixing fake pearls in?

97
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,200
Probably not

98
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,840
But there have been rumors lately

99
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,960
that shells from all Hepu villages

100
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,120
have sharply decreased in pearl yield

101
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,080
and the quality of pearls is much worse than before

102
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,800
So that's what's going on

103
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,160
If the pearl yield wasn't so low

104
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,240
these pearl households

105
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,480
would never have agreed

106
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
to sell at thirty percent of the usual price

107
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,480
Given the current situation

108
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,480
even if we

109
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,640
calculate with triple the pearl yield

110
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,760
when settling accounts with the pearl households

111
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,400
even if we give up ten percent

112
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,800
we'd still suffer heavy losses

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,200
Young master

114
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,480
Should we stop collecting shells for now?

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,760
It's fine

116
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,240
As long as we can still get pearls

117
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,960
and sell pearls

118
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,920
what you’re worried about won’t happen

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,360
But

120
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,520
where will the pearls come from?

121
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
If Li family's pearls aren't enough

122
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,000
then we'll use all the pearls from Hepu to make up for it

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,640
This started because of me

124
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,680
What comes next

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,000
leave it to me

126
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
Stop eating

127
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,760
Hurry, keep up

128
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,200
Keep up

129
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,360
Young master

130
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,760
You’re something, Li Ling

131
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,640
You still haven’t paid me back

132
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,200
and now you want to borrow my clothes

133
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,600
Aren’t I stylish?

134
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,280
It’s my clothes that look good

135
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
I’m going to get some pearls

136
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,120
Premium ones

137
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Interested?

138
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Come with me

139
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,200
Have you noticed

140
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,360
that this shop’s pearls

141
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,720
are getting fewer and fewer lately?

142
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,880
Don’t talk nonsense

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
I run an honest business

144
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,200
But lately

145
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,480
the pearl yield from the shells

146
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,560
has been dropping

147
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,880
We’re at a loss too

148
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,160
If this keeps up

149
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,960
the jewelry trade in Hepu

150
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,200
won’t be able to continue

151
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,320
Boss

152
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
I’ll open one

153
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,680
Excuse me, excuse me

154
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,960
Knife

155
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,640
What are you staring at?

156
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,360
Pay up

157
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,240
You opened it for free?

158
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Hurry, hurry

159
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,160
Here, boss

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,560
Alright

161
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,040
Let’s see what he gets

162
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Hey

163
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,840
Whoa

164
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,760
So good

165
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,480
He really found one

166
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,520
He actually got it

167
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,200
Is his luck really that good?

168
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,280
Boss

169
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,360
Give me a few more

170
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,520
Give me a few

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,440
Where are you going?

172
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,920
Not opening anymore

173
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Pack them all up

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,680
Take them away

175
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,480
Load them up

176
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,440
Why are you leaving?

177
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,480
I’ve already picked out all the shells with pearls

178
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,560
I’ve sorted them all

179
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,120
No

180
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,800
Let’s go, hurry

181
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,840
Where are you going?

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,080
To the next shop

183
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,160
Let’s go

184
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,360
This is the one

185
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,000
Get out, get out, get out.

186
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,960
Where did these barbarians come from?

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,240
You took all the good pearls.

188
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,680
Come again,

189
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,400
and I’ll break your legs.

190
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,120
Hey!

191
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,920
Believe it or not, I’ll smash your shop.

192
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,640
No, no, no, no, no!

193
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,480
We need another way.

194
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,560
You’re something, Li Ling.

195
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,520
Shh.

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
So you wore my tribe’s clothes

197
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,400
just to use us as a shield, right?

198
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,880
Listen to yourself.

199
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,840
If they find out I took the pearls,

200
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,160
how will I survive in Hepu?

201
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,880
What are you thinking?

202
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,280
Tch.

203
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,080
No,

204
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,240
I need to survive too.

205
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,880
Sis,

206
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,680
should we call a couple more people?

207
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,040
Here, here.

208
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,240
Take it.

209
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
Take, take, take this.

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,280
Sis, slow down.

211
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,680
That looked like the young master just now.

212
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,480
Young—

213
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,480
That makes no sense.

214
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,320
The young master isn’t into that kind of thing.

215
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,440
Young master!

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Where are you, young master?

217
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,960
Yes.

218
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,160
No.

219
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,440
Yes.

220
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,080
No.

221
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:11,960
Yes.

222
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,760
No.

223
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,400
Yes.

224
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,960
No.

225
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,120
Yes.

226
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,040
No.

227
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,800
Yes.

228
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,680
No.

229
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,480
Yes.

230
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,400
Meow.

231
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
Yes.

232
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,760
No.

233
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,320
All the shells bought from Hepu today—

234
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,280
if even one doesn’t yield a pearl,

235
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,200
they’re all yours.

236
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,800
Wow.

237
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,000
How do you have all of them?

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
How did you manage that?

239
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,560
Family secret technique.

240
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,640
Don’t pry around.

241
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,160
You’re telling me all this,

242
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,000
aren’t you afraid I’ll take you away?

243
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,840
I trust Miss Kana.

244
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,480
She’s not someone short-sighted.

245
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,800
Just these few pearls

246
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
aren’t even a tenth

247
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,520
of what we supplied to the court in previous years.

248
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,800
Besides, what Miss Kana and I want to do

249
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,120
is much bigger than this.

250
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,040
Hey.

251
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,600
I’m not getting involved

252
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,440
in your business with the governor’s office.

253
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,440
You Han people have a saying,

254
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,800
“The people do not fight with officials.”

255
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,520
But in my view,

256
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,360
merchants are even less likely to fight with officials.

257
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,160
Because we can’t win.

258
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,200
May I ask, Miss Kana,

259
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,760
what kind of business did you do with Manager Wang before?

260
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,680
We did anything that made money.

261
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,320
Grain,

262
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
pearls,

263
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,440
silk and porcelain.

264
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,320
Yeah.

265
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
If there’s profit, we do it.

266
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,360
Isn’t the porcelain and silk business

267
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,640
hard to get into?

268
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,560
Yeah.

269
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,600
Even though your emperor issued a decree

270
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,760
allowing us to trade with Han people,

271
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,080
all the good stuff

272
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,160
is monopolized by a few big families.

273
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,360
If we want to buy,

274
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,040
we have to pay high prices and buy secretly.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,920
My Li family

276
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,280
has been in business for generations.

277
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,640
Our trade routes in the Central Plains are extensive.

278
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Why does Governor Zhang keep targeting me?

279
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,160
He wants my family’s wealth,

280
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,400
but what he really wants is our trade routes.

281
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,920
If these routes open up,

282
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,080
the benefits

283
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,000
will far exceed your imagination.

284
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,520
If you work with me,

285
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,720
whatever the Central Plains have,

286
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,960
you’ll have it too.

287
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,240
And in between,

288
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,680
no one will take a cut.

289
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,840
Are you serious?

290
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,200
Miss Kana,

291
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,520
you can check for yourself.

292
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,680
Miss Kana,

293
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,960
take your time to consider.

294
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,640
All the pearls here,

295
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,160
I’ll give you a twenty percent discount.

296
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,520
What do you want me to do?

297
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,360
Where did the young master go again?

298
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,040
If I can’t find him, I’ll get scolded again.

299
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,880
The weather is so clear today.

300
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,600
Everywhere looks beautiful.

301
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
Buy one more.

302
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,920
Li Zhong.

303
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,120
Here we go again.

304
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,960
The weather is so clear today.

305
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,600
Everywhere looks beautiful.

306
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,960
Young Master Li is awake.

307
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,680
Zhang Ji.

308
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,520
Me.

309
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,880
Why is it you?

310
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,640
Me.

311
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,120
You.

312
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,400
Why are you here?
