1
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
Me.

2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,800
Why is this happening?

3
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,040
Why can't I untie it?

4
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,560
Oh no.

5
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,960
Rong'er.

6
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,480
Don't.

7
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't be impulsive.

8
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,600
You can't stop hugging me.

9
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,400
Me.

10
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,360
Rong'er.

11
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,120
Let me explain.

12
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,360
Get out.

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,720
Fine.

14
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,960
Miss Shao.

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,360
You burned books and buried the owner at Wang's Pearl Shop.

16
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,560
You're quite a heroine among women.

17
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,120
But once you returned to Hualou,

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,920
you became a courtesan again.

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,600
I

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,120
just wanted to rely on Young Master Li.

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,760
and live a peaceful life for a few days.

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
If Young Master Li isn't interested,

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
then naturally,

24
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,680
he wouldn't have come to my room.

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Miss Rong'er,

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,320
if you can't control your own man,

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,520
why blame me?

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
You want someone to rely on,

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,200
in Hepu and all the southern regions,

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,280
there are plenty of talented men.

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,520
Why cling to Li Ling?

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,000
Today at Wang's Pearl Shop,

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
what did Young Master Li do?

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,560
Miss Rong'er,

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,240
do you really not know,

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,440
or are you pretending?

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
Are you saying

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,400
he burned your indenture contract?

39
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,120
Miss Rong'er is a noble lady,

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
so of course she doesn't know

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
the hardships of women like me.

42
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
A courtesan

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,040
has her contract where

44
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,320
her support is.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,680
That's where her backing is.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
But now,

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,560
my contract has been burned.

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,960
I'm like a drifting leaf again.

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,360
With nowhere to go.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,360
You, this drifting leaf,

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,120
are quite unique.

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,360
Just regained your freedom,

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,640
and you're already eager to cling to another man.

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,120
It's not that I want to cling to Young Master Li,

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,960
but today, Young Master Li

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,720
stood up for me in public,

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,360
defended me,

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,120
and helped redeem me.

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,080
If I seek another man for support,

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
and word gets out,

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,720
Young Master Li's reputation

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,960
won't be much better than Wang Cheng's.

63
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,240
Miss Shao,

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,000
you're truly sharp-tongued.

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,800
Everything I said

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,320
is true.

67
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,480
Wait, Miss Rong'er.

68
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,840
Don't drink this tea.

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,920
There's something in the tea.

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,800
It was just now

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
prepared for Young Master Li.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Young master.

73
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,440
Ah.

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,680
Why is your face so red?

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
I don't know.

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
I'm so hot.

77
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,720
If Young Master Li truly won't take me in,

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
then this tea

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,160
is my last resort.

80
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
Rather than dying without knowing when,

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,480
I'd rather

82
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
shamelessly

83
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,640
make what's done cannot be undone.

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,880
In a good man's house,

85
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,520
become a concubine.

86
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,800
Today at Wang's Pearl Shop,

87
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,920
since I left with Young Master Li,

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,400
there's no turning back.

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,360
But I know my place

90
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
and respect the hierarchy.

91
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,280
Miss Rong'er,

92
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,160
if you truly don't want me to follow Young Master Li,

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,000
then keep me by your side

94
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,440
as a maid.

95
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
A maid?

96
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,400
You already have a maid.

97
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,320
A maid raising another maid?

98
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
How am I so wealthy?

99
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
With my skills,

100
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,480
I surely won't disgrace Miss Rong'er.

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,440
The skills you've learned

102
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
are all meant to please men.

103
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
Whether it's the Jia family

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,440
or the Li family,

105
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,840
they don't keep idle people.

106
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,120
Please rest assured, Madam.

107
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,480
What did she just call me?

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,920
Madam.

109
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,360
I'm not just a pretty face.

110
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,280
I know the ways of business.

111
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,520
I understand them as well.

112
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,640
Very well.

113
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,160
Then tell me,

114
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,400
what can you do?

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,440
Sit.

116
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,520
Thank you, Madam.

117
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,400
I know quite a lot.

118
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,240
Please listen to me

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
as I explain one by one.

120
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,160
Li Zhong,

121
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,640
has anyone told you your muscles are big now?

122
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,200
Our young master isn't usually like this.

123
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
Jianjia, listen to me.

124
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,480
It's not that kind of relationship.

125
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,880
Young master.

126
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,560
Have you been working out lately?

127
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,280
Young master.

128
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,960
Tomorrow,

129
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,600
let Miss Shao

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,480
manage the shop as the manager.

131
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,960
Young master.

132
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,440
Oh dear.

133
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,320
Miss.

134
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,720
It's my fault.

135
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,400
I couldn't stop them.

136
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,560
It's all right.

137
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440
Everything is over now.

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,880
From now on,

139
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,520
we won't have to live in fear anymore.

140
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,840
Young Master Li agreed to let you enter the household.

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,000
You heard it just now.

142
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,080
I can only go to their shop

143
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,000
to be the manager.

144
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,200
As for

145
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,320
whether I can enter the household,

146
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,960
it's not up to Young Master Li,

147
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,480
but up to

148
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,720
Lady Jia.

149
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,920
Find a box

150
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,960
and pack it up.

151
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,760
Tomorrow,

152
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,120
give it to our Lady Jia

153
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,240
and return it respectfully.

154
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,200
Young master.

155
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,040
I don't know what madness has seized Miss Jia this time.

156
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,560
She wants Shao Wanru to be the manager.

157
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,760
What do you think about this?

158
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,000
What can I say?

159
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,280
Young master.

160
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,680
You...

161
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,520
Your face...

162
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,680
What's wrong with your face?

163
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,320
Oh no.

164
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,440
Wang Cheng, oh Wang Cheng,

165
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,040
years of hard work,

166
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
lost in a single day.

167
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,400
Sir.

168
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,480
This...

169
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
I followed your instructions

170
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
and set a heavy bait

171
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,160
to lure Li Ling in.

172
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,520
But...

173
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,560
who knew he seemed to know

174
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
which shell had a pearl

175
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
and which didn't.

176
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,240
I have no idea either.

177
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,240
But you lost in the end.

178
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,360
Tell me, what should I do

179
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,520
to make sure Li Ling

180
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,320
doesn't get the money?

181
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,560
Sir,

182
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,520
look,

183
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,160
after all these years,

184
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,960
I've served you faithfully.

185
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,000
Even if I haven't achieved much, I've worked hard.

186
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,240
You...

187
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,480
Sir...

188
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,000
Please spare me this time.

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,320
Just this once.

190
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
I can still be of great use to you.

191
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,440
Truly useful.

192
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
Wang Cheng,

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,120
your life

194
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,840
has already been lost to Li Ling.

195
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,320
Take care of it cleanly.

196
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,760
Miss Shao,

197
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
from now on,

198
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,720
this shop

199
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,160
will be managed by you.

200
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,920
Thank you, young master.

201
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you, Miss Rong'er.

202
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,240
But

203
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,520
this shopkeeper

204
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,800
doesn't work for free.

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,120
A shopkeeper needs to set some rules, right?

206
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
And there's this month's wages.

207
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,360
Miss Shao, you might not know this,

208
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
but right now,

209
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,400
I'm actually very poor.

210
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Young master,

211
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,720
I know.

212
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
How do you know?

213
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,320
In the past three years,

214
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,240
you've gambled in 578 pearl games at Hualou.

215
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,560
You've lost a total of

216
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,360
2,560,000 coins,

217
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,240
3,800 strings of cash,

218
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,080
seven pearl shops,

219
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,880
and 6,700 fine pearls,

220
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,800
6,700 pearls,

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and 600 dan of grain.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
And more.

223
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,960
I...

224
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,280
How do you have this information?

225
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,040
In Hualou,

226
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,400
who wins and who loses,

227
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,560
and how much is won or lost,

228
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,080
when I had nothing to do,

229
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
out of boredom,

230
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,760
I kept some records.

231
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,600
I...

232
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,880
Did I really lose that much?

233
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,160
Absolutely true.

234
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,600
Miss never makes mistakes with her records.

235
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,360
Rong'er,

236
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,520
from now on,

237
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,240
all the family assets

238
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
will be managed by you.

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,600
By the way,

240
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,520
I have here

241
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,320
a string of

242
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,360
a pearl necklace made especially for you.

243
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,400
Look.

244
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,080
Pink pearls suit a beauty.

245
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,080
Isn't this

246
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,520
the perfect necklace you promised to Shopkeeper Shao?

247
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,480
Li Ling!

248
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,400
Get out here!

249
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,800
Pay with your life for Wang the shopkeeper!

250
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,400
It was Li Ling

251
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,480
who drove Shopkeeper Wang to death!

252
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,240
Now no one buys our shells because of him!

253
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,480
Smash this crooked shop!

254
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,640
If they want us dead,

255
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,160
we'll take them down with us!

256
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
Make Li Ling come out!

257
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
Pay for Shopkeeper Wang's life!

258
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,120
Pay with your life!

259
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,840
Pay for Shopkeeper Wang's life!

260
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,080
Darn it!

261
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,360
Young master!

262
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,240
Young master!

263
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,040
They say Wang Cheng is dead.

264
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,960
He hanged himself.

265
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,280
Wang Cheng is dead.

266
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,720
Yes.

267
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,640
How is that possible?

268
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,400
No, I have to find out the truth.

269
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,960
Young master!

270
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,800
You can't go.

271
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,120
There are people everywhere out front.

272
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,960
They're saying you killed Wang Cheng.

273
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,400
They're all shouting for you to pay with your life.

274
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,280
I...

275
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Yes.

276
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,920
How could Wang Cheng be dead?

277
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,720
If he's dead, who's going to kill me?

278
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,600
What on earth is going on?

279
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,560
Young master!

280
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,600
There are too many people in front.

281
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,360
Let's use the back door.

282
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,800
I...

283
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,360
It wasn't me!

284
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,360
Someone!

285
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
Someone, come quickly!

286
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,960
The villain who killed Shopkeeper Wang is back!

287
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,240
You killed Shopkeeper Wang!

288
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,400
How dare you show your face here!

289
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,360
Get out of here right now!

290
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,760
Get out!

291
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,560
Get out!

292
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,680
Congratulations, husband,

293
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,960
on winning the Pearl God crown again.

294
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
Since you care so little about this woman,

295
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,520
I might as well send her to her death.

296
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,480
Honored guest, welcome.

297
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
Please, show some respect.

298
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,000
I am Zhang Ji.

299
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
Greetings, Young Master Li.

300
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,520
Why is it you?
