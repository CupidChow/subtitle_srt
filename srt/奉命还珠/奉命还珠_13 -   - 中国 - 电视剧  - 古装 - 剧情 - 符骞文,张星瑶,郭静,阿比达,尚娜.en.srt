1
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,160
Are you still alive?

2
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,760
Your grandpa here is tough as nails.

3
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,120
I won't die that easily.

4
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,720
Technically speaking,

5
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,280
you should call me Madam too.

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,640
Young Master marrying you was just a temporary measure.

7
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,480
It doesn't count.

8
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,040
He held the wedding ceremony and entered the bridal chamber.

9
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,600
How could Li Ling decide that?

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,240
Just because he says it doesn't count, doesn't make it so.

11
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
You really have no shame.

12
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,480
Young Master doesn't want you.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,840
You came here yourself.

14
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,520
When did Miss Zhang become so cheap?

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,600
Jianjia.

16
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,720
Jianjia, are you alright?

17
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,280
Jianjia.

18
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,200
Jianjia, say something, Jianjia!

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,880
Jianjia.

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,000
What did you do?

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm begging you.

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,880
Please let her go.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
Now you know to beg me?

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,560
What did you just call me?

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm begging you.

26
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,080
No, please.

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Madam.

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,440
Madam.

29
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm begging you.

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
Jianjia.

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
Jianjia.

32
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,160
Jianjia.

33
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,440
If you want to save her, fine.

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,920
Help me with something.

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,000
What do you want me to do?

36
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,760
This cut

37
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,400
is your punishment from earlier.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,960
Put it on.

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,560
Go to Meiling.

40
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,880
Become a bandit.

41
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,160
I didn't expect

42
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,320
the Hepu sea shells

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,000
would actually migrate to Nan County.

44
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,680
Back then, Wang Cheng wanted to beat me,

45
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,720
so he deliberately swapped Nan County's worthless shells for mine.

46
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
Who knew the original Hepu shells

47
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,440
had already started migrating to Nan County.

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,080
Impossible.

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,240
Wang Cheng.

50
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,520
You died so unjustly.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,440
Let go already.

52
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,560
This...

53
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,200
What's going on?

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,880
Come with me, quick!

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,320
Slow down.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,600
Hurry!

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,200
So many!

58
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,280
Open it and see.

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,200
Why all the secrecy?

60
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,520
This...

61
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,480
It's all jewelry here!

62
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,080
Yeah.

63
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,720
Where did you get these?

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,160
The real wealth of the Jia and Li families

65
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,200
is all right here.

66
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,680
Rong'er, you're amazing!

67
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,880
Come here, let me give you a kiss.

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,760
I knew

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,120
if Zhang He made a move,

70
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,080
then both the Jia and Li families

71
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,680
would surely face disaster and confiscation.

72
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,640
So after Kana found me,

73
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,160
I asked Kana to help.

74
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,800
I had her send these

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,520
to the merchant ships ahead of time.

76
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,040
Otherwise, do you really think I'd

77
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,680
do a losing deal so easily?

78
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,760
With these things on my ship,

79
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,320
they're collateral.

80
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,800
If you two can't escape,

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,280
these things

82
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,480
will all be mine.

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,280
Thank you, Kana.

84
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,040
But speaking of which,

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,360
aren't you greedy for money?

86
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,400
You...

87
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,560
Why didn't you pocket some for yourself?

88
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm an honest merchant.

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,600
Not a thief.

90
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,840
Can you spare some food?

91
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,400
I haven't eaten in days.

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,360
Why are there so many refugees in Nan County?

93
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,720
Refugees.

94
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,680
The last famine.

95
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,360
It came early.

96
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,240
The bill, please.

97
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
You can keep the change.

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
Coming.

99
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,120
Enjoy your meal, customer.

100
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,160
Hey, wait, waiter.

101
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,480
Here at your place,

102
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,880
do you pay the bill with pearls?

103
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,880
Of course.

104
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
Now you can use pearls not just for meals,

105
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,960
but also to buy grain, cloth, anything.

106
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,280
Wait a second.

107
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,080
We don't know why either.

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Tell me about it.

109
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,400
Busy.

110
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Just tell me.

111
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,520
Customer,

112
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,280
you're from out of town, right?

113
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,440
Mm-hmm.

115
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,360
People used to say,

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,280
Hepu pearls are the best under heaven.

117
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,320
But now it's different.

118
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,720
Now Nan County pearls are the best.

119
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,280
You outsiders might not know this,

120
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,520
but our Nan County pearls

121
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,840
have surpassed Hepu.

122
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,960
Really?

123
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,600
I haven't heard about that.

124
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,760
Never heard of it.

125
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,280
Come on.

126
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,960
Go on.

127
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,400
Nan County used to

128
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,560
not produce many pearls.

129
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,160
But just a year ago,

130
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,120
lots of pearl oysters appeared by the sea.

131
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,520
There were more pearls than we could harvest.

132
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
After a while,

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,240
some people got rich.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,120
Hey,

135
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,440
why didn't you go?

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,280
Who says I didn't want to?

137
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:56,880
I...

138
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,080
That's the key.

139
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,400
Stop messing around.

140
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,160
Hurry up and tell me.

141
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,080
Be serious.

142
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,880
Who wouldn't want to go?

143
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,400
But diving for pearls

144
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,720
is restricted by the authorities.

145
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
All the good coastal land

146
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,720
is leased by the rich and powerful.

147
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,880
Pearl farmers can still earn a bit by working at sea.

148
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
But people like us with no skills

149
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,960
can only rely on

150
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,080
the crumbs that fall from the rich men's tables.

151
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,560
I see.

152
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Thank you, waiter.

153
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,240
Hey,

154
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,800
if we want to buy pearls,

155
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,880
where do we go?

156
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,920
There are government-licensed shops in town.

157
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,600
Now all the pearls in Nan County

158
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,080
can only be traded there.

159
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,800
Otherwise,

160
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,000
it's considered smuggling.

161
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,640
That's punishable by death.

162
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,480
Hey,

163
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,080
Kana,

164
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,560
let's go!

165
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:47,920
Hey,

166
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,520
Wait,

167
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,800
no need to look.

168
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Where are you going?

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You forgot your bag.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,560
Wait for me!

171
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:52,880
Hey!

172
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,400
You...

173
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,880
You...

174
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,840
Hurry up!

175
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,400
Kana!

176
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,480
What are you doing?

177
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,720
You haven't taken your bag yet.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,080
I didn't expect Zhang He to issue a maritime arrest warrant directly.

179
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,560
You can't show your faces anymore.

180
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,280
Why aren't you included?

181
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,640
Why should I be included?

182
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,720
I didn't kill anyone.

183
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,240
Neither of us killed anyone.

184
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,920
Now pearls can't get past Meiling.

185
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
If you want to sell Hepu pearls,

186
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
you have to go through us, the sea merchants.

187
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,720
He wouldn't dare do anything to me.

188
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,520
Hey.

189
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,200
I heard

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,760
you sea merchants

191
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,040
can you bring grain from Jiaozhi?

192
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,920
Transport grain over here?

193
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,480
Yeah.

194
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,240
Grain trading has always been

195
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
the main cargo for our ships.

196
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,760
Hepu doesn't produce grain.

197
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
The pearls you export

198
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,440
can be traded for a lot of grain over there.

199
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,480
Back and forth,

200
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,360
the profits are huge.

201
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,840
Oh.

202
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,720
So after the grain arrives,

203
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,960
is it sold directly at the grain shops?

204
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,200
Yes.

205
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,920
Our Jia family's grain

206
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,760
is mostly bought from sea merchants.

207
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,480
Now,

208
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,800
you only have one way out.

209
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,520
That's to go overseas with me.

210
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,080
Wait.

211
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,160
I have another plan.

212
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,320
But

213
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,240
you have to go to Jiaozhi.

214
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,680
Okay.

215
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,120
Aren't you going?

216
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,600
I have another way.

217
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,280
What way?

218
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,880
Meiling.

219
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,160
Not going.

220
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,360
No,

221
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,720
You're so eager to send Rong'er to Jiaozhi,

222
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,240
but you came to Meiling—what are you up to?

223
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
I'm your employer.

224
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,560
Why do you care so much?

225
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm an honest merchant.

226
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Not a bandit.

227
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,520
What if

228
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,600
I want you to be a bandit?

229
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,080
What kind of person do you think I am?

230
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,600
So now?

231
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,560
When do we set out?

232
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,680
We've waited so many days.

233
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,920
Who exactly are you trying to rob?

234
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,040
You'll know soon.

235
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,600
They're coming.

236
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,920
You want me to rob an official?

237
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,080
And one escorted by Imperial Guards?

238
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,920
Are you crazy?

239
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,320
Yeah.

240
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,960
You—

241
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,080
Go.

242
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,040
Stop!

243
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,720
Nobody move!

244
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,840
Protect the lord!

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,720
Protect the lord!

246
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
Who are you scoundrels?

247
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
How dare you attack the Inspector Governor!

248
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,520
Corrupt official!

249
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,320
Prepare to die!

250
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,560
Protect the lord!

251
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,760
What kind of corrupt official is this?

252
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,160
Why does everyone want to rob him?

253
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
Don't talk nonsense.

254
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,640
He's a good official.

255
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,280
You rob good officials too?

256
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,480
Enough talking.

257
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,760
So what now?

258
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,080
Surround them all.

259
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,640
I—

260
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,640
Uh-huh.

261
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,000
I only brought four people.

262
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,000
Isn't this five?

263
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,760
Kawu is my brother.

264
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,960
He's still a person.
