1
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,640
Why did you call me over in such a hurry?

2
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,320
Hey.

3
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,760
Who are these people?

4
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,040
Zhang Ji told me to

5
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,240
pretend to rob them.

6
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
Then let them all go.

7
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,880
I don't get it.

8
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,280
What do you think?

9
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,240
I don't get it either.

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,280
What are you planning to do?

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,880
Take them all down.

12
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
Just the two of us?

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,440
Knockout drug.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,040
You've gotten smarter.

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,920
I learned it from you, young master.

16
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,840
This trick works well.

17
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,040
Young master.

18
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
These people don't look like merchants.

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
You can tell that?

20
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,040
After robbing here on Meiling a few times,

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
you get to know all kinds of people.

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,200
You can spot them easily.

23
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,800
Young Master

24
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,040
The badge of the prefectural soldiers

25
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,680
I found the list

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,880
What list?

27
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,840
I guess the people on this list

28
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,640
are connected to the forces behind him in the capital

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
The prefectural soldiers have mingled with the refugees

30
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,720
Why is that?

31
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,360
Or perhaps

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,400
they are protecting something

33
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,280
Young Master, stop guessing

34
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Why don't we just ask directly?

35
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Speak

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,600
What's your name?

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,120
I'm asking you, what's your name?

38
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,800
Young Master

39
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,960
They've all had their tongues cut out.

40
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,560
So cruel.

41
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
What exactly are Zhang He and his people planning?

42
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,920
What else is there in Hepu

43
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,880
that makes them go to such lengths?

44
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Could it be

45
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,360
Zhang He

46
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,240
You beast!

47
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,400
Your Excellency Meng

48
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,000
Li Ling

49
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,280
Are you saying inside their thighs

50
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
they're hiding pearls?

51
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,480
Your Excellency

52
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,840
You don't believe me.

53
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,360
How can I trust you?

54
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,640
Are you suggesting

55
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,240
we cut open their thighs?

56
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,240
If someone really hid pearls in them,

57
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,160
they just need to nod and admit it.

58
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,920
Why won't they admit it?

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,640
These commoners

60
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
are all in their prime.

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
There are no elderly or women among them.

62
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,160
Their families must have been taken hostage.

63
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,640
And they

64
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,600
have all had their tongues cut out.

65
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,720
That means

66
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,160
they're not allowed to speak.

67
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,400
They can't talk.

68
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,880
Your Excellency

69
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,720
Where did this come from?

70
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,880
From those merchant caravans disguised by the garrison troops.

71
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
Found on them.

72
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,920
It's almost identical to the list you gave me before.

73
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,480
All from the capital and Hepu.

74
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,920
It's a list of connections to noble clans.

75
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,400
They're all delivery people.

76
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,160
This Zhang He

77
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,440
wants to use

78
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
the pearl smuggling through Meiling

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,520
to promote the Pearl God Festival.

80
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,320
So

81
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,600
he can't allow

82
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,920
the Meiling trade route to be opened.

83
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,360
But the benefits for the capital

84
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,400
still have to be delivered.

85
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,640
These refugees

86
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,520
became his best delivery tools.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,960
This way he can ensure

88
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,240
the rumors about Meiling remain intact

89
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,640
and the pearls

90
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,280
are safely sent out.

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
This is a serious matter.

92
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
I must see it with my own eyes.

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,120
Inside their thighs

94
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
are there really pearls hidden?

95
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,800
Forgive me.

96
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,040
Anesthetic powder

97
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
General Wang

98
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,680
Benevolence and righteousness

99
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,440
I didn't expect these people

100
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,120
to be hiding so many precious pearls.

101
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,800
It's truly appalling.

102
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,360
Your Excellency,

103
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,480
what should we do next?

104
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,040
What do you think?

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,360
Of course, send them back to Nan County.

106
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,800
Have you considered

107
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,200
what will happen to them in Nan County?

108
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,800
And what will happen to their families?

109
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,120
Even if they cross Meiling,

110
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,840
they'll still be silenced.

111
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,640
Actually,

112
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,120
they can't escape death.

113
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,960
What do you mean?

114
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,360
When Wang Qiang took the pearls earlier,

115
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,880
he found that on their bodies

116
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,400
there were strange skin lesions.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,280
And during Wang Qiang's interrogation

118
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,840
of those garrison troops, he learned

119
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,560
they not only had their tongues cut out

120
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,520
but were also poisoned.

121
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,240
Before noon tomorrow,

122
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,400
if they don't leave Meiling,

123
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
the poison will kill them.

124
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,400
This ensures the cruel method of concealing pearls in their thighs

125
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,560
is foolproof.

126
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,720
Moreover,

127
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,960
there is no cure for this poison.

128
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,480
If they leave Meiling,

129
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,640
they won't survive past tomorrow.

130
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,760
If they stay in Meiling,

131
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
they still won't survive past tomorrow.

132
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,920
Is there truly no other way?

133
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,320
Only this method

134
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,760
can let them die with purpose.

135
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,520
And only this method

136
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,680
can uproot the mastermind behind this.

137
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,920
completely.

138
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Your Excellency,

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,480
what about those garrison troops?

140
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,240
Execute them.

141
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,840
Young Master,

142
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,280
all the garrison troops have been killed.

143
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,680
What about those sent to deliver pearls to the capital?

144
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,880
It's fine.

145
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,520
Lord Meng will have garrison troops impersonate them

146
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,360
and deliver the pearls to the capital.

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
By the way,

148
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,000
invite Lord Li as well.

149
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,800
Let him see his people one last time.

150
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,960
Yes.

151
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,400
Report!

152
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,920
Your Excellency,

153
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
Li Gongzi's men request an audience at the city gate.

154
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,360
This...

155
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,120
These are all my people from Nan County.

156
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
How could this happen?

157
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
How could it be like this?

158
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,960
I am guilty.

159
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,560
I have failed my people.

160
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,520
I am guilty.

161
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,840
I have let everyone down.

163
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,040
Lord Meng,

164
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,120
fellow villagers,

165
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,760
please hear me out.

166
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,080
I am Meng Chang, Imperial Inspector.

167
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,520
I was sent to Hepu by imperial order

168
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,800
to oversee the administration

169
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,920
and punish corruption.

170
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,760
I never expected

171
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,520
that right under my nose

172
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,320
such a vicious crime would occur.

173
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,640
I am ashamed before you all.

174
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,400
Please accept my bow.

175
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,400
I see that among you

176
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,080
there are no elders, women, or children.

177
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,440
Your families must have been

178
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,480
taken hostage by villains.

179
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
You were all threatened

180
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,680
and forced to conceal pearls in your thighs.

181
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,720
Everyone,

182
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,760
you are all people of great virtue.

183
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,240
You did this only to protect your families.

184
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,760
Please,

185
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,640
accept my bow once more.

186
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,520
I

187
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,400
have only one way

188
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,000
that may save your families.

189
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,680
Are you willing to try?

190
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,920
I ask you all to decide for yourselves.

191
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,680
Death is your only option.

192
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,640
Once the pearls are removed,

193
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,240
they will be sent to the capital.

194
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
Only then can we gain

195
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,880
time to rescue your families.

196
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,240
Only then can we uproot these corrupt officials and noble clans

197
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
completely.

198
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,280
Those who survive

199
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,160
will see a brighter world.

200
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,600
Your Excellency Meng,

201
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,760
can't we hide them after removing the pearls?

202
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,440
Can’t we keep them hidden?

203
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
They have been poisoned.

204
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,240
They won’t survive the day.

205
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,080
What?

206
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,320
Last night,

207
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,360
I executed all the garrison troops who harmed you.

208
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,880
All were beheaded.

209
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,640
Beheaded.

210
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,320
In my hand

211
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,520
is the imperial decree.

212
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,640
The rest

213
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,720
is up to your decision.

214
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,640
Your Excellency,

215
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,080
these are not stains.

216
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,120
They are the handprints of the people's petition.

217
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Imperial Inspector Meng Chang

218
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,480
Prefect of Nan County

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
Li Wenshun

220
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,160
Imperial Guard Lieutenant

221
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,040
Wang Qiang

222
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,920
Li Family Pearl House of Hepu

223
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,840
Li Ling

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
Lingyun Pearl House of Nan County

225
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,840
Shao Wanru

226
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,920
We

227
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,680
pledge our lives

228
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,000
to protect your families

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,560
eradicate corruption

230
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,560
and honor the trust of all righteous men.
