1
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,680
You really are Li Zhong.

2
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,480
How did you end up looking like this?

3
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,840
Jianjia definitely won't want you now.

4
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,880
Young Master.

5
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,240
Master Li.

6
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,960
So,

7
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
Lord Li really doesn't blame Li Zhong anymore?

8
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,240
He's still one of my people.

9
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,160
Besides,

10
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,200
this time Li Zhong

11
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
has made a great contribution.

12
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,320
That's good.

13
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,720
Alright.

14
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,520
You all go back first.

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,560
I still have something to do.

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,320
I need to talk to Li Zhong.

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,160
Okay.

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,880
Let's go.

19
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,800
So what's going on at Meiling now?

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,960
What's the situation?

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,280
We robbed people and goods.

22
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,760
Then sent a few survivors

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,040
to pretend to be mad and escape back.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
The rest were all hidden away.

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,360
Didn't kill them.

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
But keeping them costs food.

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,880
Sigh.

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,120
I'm not going.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm not going.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,440
What?

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
Do you still want to save Jianjia or not?

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,360
Ah.

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,920
I do.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,960
If you do, then do as I say.

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,720
The people at Meiling,

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,760
how confident are you

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,600
in replacing them with our own?

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,680
Not confident.

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,280
You...

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,720
But for Jianjia's sake,

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,440
I think I can.

42
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,560
That's good.

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,400
Hey, Young Master.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,640
What about Zhang Ji?

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,320
Zhang Ji...

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,040
I'll teach you.

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,760
Li Ling let you come back.

48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,080
Yes.

49
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,280
Did he say anything else?

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,000
He...

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,280
He said...

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
He said, "A servant cannot serve two masters."

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
A servant cannot serve two masters.

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,440
So he acknowledges my status.

55
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Yes.

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,920
That scared me.

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
We mustn't let anyone see.

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,000
How does Young Master guess so accurately?

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Could that woman really be falling for Young Master?

60
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,840
Impossible.

61
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,720
Absolutely impossible.

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,760
Take it over there.

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,000
Put it on top.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,200
Light the candle.

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Move it a bit, move it.

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,800
Put it in the middle.

67
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:41,920
That's right.

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,720
Move it this way, this way.

69
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,160
Move it to the back, the back, the back.

70
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,560
Right now, the pearl oysters in Hepu waters

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,000
are less than a tenth of previous years.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,280
Thousands of pearl divers have lost their livelihoods.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,680
Lord Zhang,

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,800
as the governor of this region,

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,280
you still hold

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,000
this extravagant Pearl God Festival.

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,920
I want to ask you,

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,680
do you still respect the laws of the court?

79
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
Do you care about your people?

80
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,400
Lord Meng,

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
I hold the Pearl God Festival

82
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,320
precisely for the people's livelihood.

83
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,480
The Pearl God Festival

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
can gather the finest oysters from all over.

85
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,840
We seek extraordinary pearls.

86
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,120
Even if Hepu's oysters are gone,

87
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,560
Hepu's pearl industry

88
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,360
can still thrive.

89
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,560
That's nonsense.

90
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,880
You ignore the natural cycle.

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
You force people to overharvest.

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
That's why Hepu's oysters are dwindling.

93
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,040
The pearl industry can't survive.

94
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,600
Should those thousands of displaced pearl divers

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
be grateful to you, Lord Zhang?

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,840
Lord Meng,

97
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
a temporary hardship

98
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,400
for lasting prosperity.

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
I believe

100
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,200
they will understand my intentions.

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Zhang He,

102
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,640
Lord Meng,

103
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,760
this is Hepu's internal affair.

104
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,800
As Censor,

105
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,640
if you are dissatisfied with me,

106
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,440
you may report and impeach me.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,840
If His Majesty gives an order,

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,480
I will obey without question.

109
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,280
Lord Meng,

110
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
you came here

111
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,760
just to reprimand me.

112
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,480
Governor Li of Nan County

113
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,640
brought a cart of fine pearls

114
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,080
hoping to exchange them for grain.

115
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,480
Ah,

116
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,800
Lord Meng,

117
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Hepu's grain is also in short supply.

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,760
Meiling is blocked now,

119
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,240
the grain route is cut off.

120
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,080
Hepu's grain

121
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,120
barely feeds our people.

122
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,160
Lord Meng,

123
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,160
tell me,

124
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,360
what should I use

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,720
to help the people of Nan County?

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Lord Zhang,

127
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,560
Nan County is suffering a famine.

128
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
We should help them.

129
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,920
Do you intend to stand by and do nothing?

130
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,160
Ah,

131
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,120
Lord Meng,

132
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
I

133
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,240
wish to help but am powerless.

134
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,680
Just as you expected,

135
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,080
everything was sent back.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Ah,

137
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
It seems I was right.

138
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,160
This Zhang He

139
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
has bigger ambitions.

140
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,040
What do you mean?

141
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,320
You mean Zhang He

142
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,320
returned all the pearls he received,

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,240
pretending to care for the people,

144
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,880
refusing to sell grain.

145
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
He exploits the people,

146
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,640
a corrupt official who ignores the pearl divers' lives.

147
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,400
How could he be so kind?

148
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,120
You mean

149
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,560
he's after greater profit.

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,280
I guess

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,280
when the people have no grain left,

152
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,720
only he will have grain.

153
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
Then he can

154
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,600
extort great wealth from them.

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,560
That jerk!

156
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,840
So next,

157
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,920
what do you plan to do?

158
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,080
Actually, what I wanted to do

159
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,000
Zhang He has already agreed to.

160
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,640
Then I have a suggestion.

161
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,240
Why not let everyone in the region

162
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,080
join the Pearl God Festival?

163
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,960
Let's hold a true southern

164
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,680
pearl feast.

165
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,920
So you had me collect pearls

166
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,760
and deliver them to Meng Chang

167
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,840
just for a spot in the Pearl God Assembly

168
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,080
Didn't he say

169
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
all counties

170
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,280
including maritime merchants

171
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,320
as long as they're willing

172
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
can send representatives

173
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
to join the Pearl God Festival?

174
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,840
But right now

175
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,880
Nan County's grain reserves are almost gone

176
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,040
What will the people do?

177
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,200
Either

178
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,120
we transfer grain from Meiling

179
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,120
or

180
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,440
wait for the maritime merchants to bring grain

181
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,640
What if neither comes?

182
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,520
Gather all the refugees

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,880
and head to Hepu

184
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,000
to force Zhang He

185
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,040
Even if Zhang He is unwilling

186
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,840
he'll have to provide some grain

187
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,200
either at a high price

188
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,920
or to win people's favor

189
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,120
But at least this way

190
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,640
the people of Nan County won't starve

191
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,800
Father

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,760
I heard you agreed to Meng Chang's proposal

193
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
allowing people from all southern counties

194
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,160
to participate in the Pearl God Festival

195
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,800
His suggestion

196
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,000
can bring all the pearls of the land

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,240
together at the Pearl God Assembly

198
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,400
What's wrong with that?

199
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,840
But I think

200
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,560
Meng Chang has targeted you many times before

201
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,200
He's not that kind-hearted

202
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
You think I don't know?

203
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,520
Hmm

204
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,000
Meng Chang came here to investigate me

205
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,400
If he finds nothing

206
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
everyone is happy

207
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,680
If he does find something

208
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,520
Meng Chang's career will be over

209
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,440
Do you think the nobles in the capital will spare Meng Chang

210
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,200
or me?

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,440
I accepted his proposal

212
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,000
to use his status as Censor

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,840
to boost the Pearl God Festival

214
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,320
No matter what Meng Chang intends

215
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,280
as long as I control the price of pearls

216
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
everything can change

217
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,160
What is it?

218
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,200
Are you afraid too many people will come

219
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
and you'll lose your place as Pearl God?

220
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,120
I've never dreamed of becoming Pearl God

221
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,120
My daughter

222
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
What I give you

223
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
is yours

224
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,840
No one can take it away

225
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
You failed last time

226
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
That was the chance I gave you

227
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,760
When you become Pearl God

228
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,400
your mother's memorial tablet

229
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,280
will be placed in our Zhang family shrine

230
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,880
I'll follow your arrangements

231
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,240
Sir

232
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
Sir, something's wrong!

233
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,320
Why are you panicking?

234
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,040
Many refugees have arrived at the city gate

235
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
They're all coming from Nan County

236
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,680
Let us in.

237
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,280
Let us in.

238
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,920
Let us in.

239
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,400
Sir.

240
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,880
Sir.

241
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,520
Governor, please save us.

242
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,040
Quiet.

243
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Quiet.

244
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,720
Quiet.

245
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,560
You people

246
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,560
are not citizens of Hepu.

247
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,880
Why should I save you?

248
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,280
If you know what's good for you, leave now.

249
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,640
Otherwise,

250
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,960
don't blame me if my sword shows no mercy.

251
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,080
You refuse to leave?

252
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,920
Kill them.

253
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,440
Stop!

254
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Spare us, sir! Please, sir!

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,880
Stop!

256
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,480
Lord Zhang.

257
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,480
Do you intend to slaughter citizens of Han?

258
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,120
Lord Meng.

259
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,480
Didn't I already say

260
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,280
that Hepu's grain is also in short supply?

261
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,680
There is no surplus at all

262
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,880
to give to outsiders.

263
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,800
Lord Zhang.

264
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,080
Even if Hepu's grain is scarce,

265
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,360
we must save lives first and find other solutions later.

266
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,360
How can you just drive people away?

267
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,320
You, as the governor,

268
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,880
is this how you govern so diligently,

269
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,720
caring for the people?

270
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,920
Since

271
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,160
Lord Meng is so righteous,

272
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,400
then please

273
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,680
give us a solution.

274
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,280
The grain I brought

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,880
except what is needed for the Imperial Guards,

276
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,960
the rest will be given out

277
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,720
to aid the victims.

278
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,720
Alright.

279
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,160
Open the granary.

280
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,400
Distribute the grain.

281
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Set up porridge stalls.

282
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
Thank you, Lord Meng.

283
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,280
Thank you, Lord Meng.

284
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,720
Thank you, sir.

285
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,000
It's my grain.

286
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,320
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

287
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,000
A bunch of lowly people.

288
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

289
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,080
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

290
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,800
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

291
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,600
Everyone, please rise.

292
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,360
Everyone, please rise.

293
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,760
Thank you, sir.

294
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
Go and collect the grain.

295
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,480
Thank you, sir.

296
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,280
Thank you, thank you.

297
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,480
The bandits on Meiling Mountain

298
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,080
are your people, aren't they?

299
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
You think if someone goes missing from the prison,

300
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
I wouldn't know?

301
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,320
You think you didn't send your own men,

302
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,080
but sent the Meiling bandits instead,

303
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,880
and I wouldn't know about the attempt on Wang Lie?

304
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,440
I know I was wrong, Father.

305
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,640
I admit my mistake.

306
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm not blaming you.

307
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,440
I just wanted to see if the people you've raised

308
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,680
are actually useful.

309
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
I was just troubled

310
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,720
about how to make the rumor that pearls can't cross Meiling believable.

311
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,360
To create an opportunity for the Pearl God Festival.

312
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,120
Your little scheme

313
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,080
just happened to help me.

314
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,160
Let me ask you,

315
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,760
today,

316
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,680
Meng Chang forced me

317
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,680
to distribute grain and shelter the refugees.

318
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,480
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

319
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,200
A bad thing.

320
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,720
If you think so,

321
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,520
it means my plan

322
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,320
has worked.

323
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,240
But isn't all that grain wasted?

324
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,080
Grain—

325
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
How much is grain worth in normal times?

326
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,840
Only life-saving grain during a disaster is truly valuable.

327
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,000
I have plenty of grain.

328
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't care about that at all.

329
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,480
What I want are those

330
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,000
starving refugees.

331
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,480
Wherever there's grain,

332
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,800
there will be refugees.

333
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,440
Inside Meiling, Hepu has grain.

334
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,000
But outside Meiling,

335
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,720
many counties also have grain.

336
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,600
Some refugees will surely cross Meiling.

337
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,480
When that happens,

338
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,240
the rumor that pearls can't cross Meiling

339
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,440
will collapse on its own.

340
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,120
If there are survivors, the truth will come out.

341
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,080
If there are no survivors,

342
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,720
nothing will change.

343
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,000
If there are survivors,

344
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,680
but they can't speak,

345
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,040
still, nothing will change.
