1
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,200
Lingyun Pearl Shop

2
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,520
Rong'er

3
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,960
Take care of everything.

4
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,280
If things can't be done,

5
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,520
just come back right away.

6
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,360
Okay.

7
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,360
When you return from Meiling,

8
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,080
if you need to go to Nanjun,

9
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,960
go to this place.

10
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,240
Take care.

11
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,840
I forgot about this.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,800
Oh no.

13
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,360
Get lost.

14
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,240
Move aside.

15
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,520
Get out of my way.

16
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,680
Everyone move aside.

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,800
Move aside.

18
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,240
Move aside.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,280
Move aside.

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,920
Hyah!

21
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,760
Move aside.

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,920
Move aside.

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,600
Are you blind?

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,600
Can't you see?

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,600
Bad luck.

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,760
Outsider.

27
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,640
Don't meddle.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,840
You can't afford to mess with him.

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,720
What do you mean?

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,280
Riding horses and hurting people in the street,

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,280
doesn't the yamen care?

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,880
Keep your voice down.

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,360
In all of Nanjun,

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,400
no one

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,880
can afford to cross this man.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,960
Who is he?

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,960
Is he the Prefect?

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,320
This man

39
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,400
is Wang Lie.

40
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,480
He's from a powerful family.

41
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,360
A member of the Wang family.

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,600
He controls

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,400
almost half of the pearl trade in Nanjun.

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
He's also the biggest grain merchant here.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Anyone who offends him

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,160
never ends well.

47
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,440
You dare block my carriage?

48
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,200
Tired of living?

49
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Lowborn.

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
Take it and buy yourself a coffin.

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,280
Wang family.

52
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,040
Now,

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,840
they've set their sights on the proprietress of Lingyun Pearl Shop.

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
Someone's in trouble again.

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,800
Lingyun Pearl Shop

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
Young lady,

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,760
your husband

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
I'm here.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
If you lose again today,

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,760
it's not just this shop

61
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,440
but you yourself

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,480
will also belong to me.

63
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,400
Young Master Wang, you must be mistaken.

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
Between us,

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,280
we agreed on best two out of three.

66
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,960
Even if I lose,

67
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,640
it's only the shop at stake.

68
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,360
When did I ever say

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
I'd wager myself to you?

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,200
Here in Nanjun,

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,720
no woman has ever dared refuse me, Wang Lie.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,560
Being chosen by me

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,960
is a blessing earned from your past life.

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
This blessing

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,600
Young Master Wang, you should go home

76
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
and leave it for your mother.

77
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,720
You—

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
Shopkeeper Shao

79
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,080
is truly lovely.

80
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,480
And when she speaks,

81
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,360
she's quite sharp-tongued.

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,440
Shopkeeper Wang,

83
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
I wonder if you can win this beauty.

84
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
Last time, when we gambled pearls,

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,840
Shopkeeper Shao lost terribly.

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,880
Looks like you reject kindness and choose punishment.

87
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,760
It's a fair contest.

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,120
The loser must accept the result.

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,720
Today, Young Master Wang,

90
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,880
if you beat me,

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,960
this shop

92
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,360
will be yours.

93
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,000
But if you,

94
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,560
try to seize a woman by force,

95
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,640
everyone in Nanjun is watching.

96
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
If word gets out,

97
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,680
Young Master Wang,

98
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
are you really above the law?

99
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,040
Once you lose the shop,

100
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,520
let's see how tough you act then.

101
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,600
Then,

102
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,040
let's begin.

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,480
In this tray,

104
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,840
there are three types of pearls.

105
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,920
One is Eastern Pearl,

106
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
one is Hepu Southern Pearl,

107
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,600
and one is Nanjun Pearl.

108
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,000
If you,

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,480
can sort them correctly,

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,960
I'll admit defeat.

111
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,960
How about it?

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,200
They all look the same!

113
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,800
Can't see the shells.

114
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,120
How can you tell them apart?

115
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,360
Yeah, how do you sort them?

116
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,120
This Nanjun Pearl—

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,040
it's the new Nanjun Pearl, right?

118
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,320
That's right.

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
As everyone knows,

120
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,160
the new Nanjun Pearl

121
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,000
looks almost identical to the Hepu Pearl.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,320
They're nearly the same.

123
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,000
You're trying to cheat.

124
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,440
Shopkeeper Wang,

125
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,280
are you admitting defeat?

126
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:10,960
Fine.

127
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,560
I'll count this round as your win.

128
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,520
But I

129
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,200
want to bet one more round.

130
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,600
Young Master Wang,

131
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,960
that's against the rules.

132
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,040
My rules

133
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,880
are the rules.

134
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
Doesn't Shopkeeper Shao like to test her eyesight?

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,160
Alright.

136
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,760
Then this round,

137
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
let's compete in observation.

138
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,840
Shopkeeper Shao, please judge these pearls.

139
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,080
Which ones

140
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
are Nanjun Pearls,

141
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
and which ones

142
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,360
are Hepu Southern Pearls?

143
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,240
This young lady

144
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
is just hurting herself with her own actions.

145
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,560
That's right.

146
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,760
Miss,

147
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,000
make your choice.

148
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,040
If you admit defeat now,

149
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,920
and become my concubine,

150
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,360
not only will I spare your shop,

151
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,480
but in Nanjun from now on,

152
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,880
whatever you want,

153
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,200
I will give it to you.

154
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,200
How about it?

155
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,920
Morals are truly declining.

156
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,880
Someone dares to treat a lady so rudely.

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Oh dear.

158
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,160
And who are you supposed to be?

159
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,840
Is it your place to speak here?

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,200
I am but a humble man,

161
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,040
under Shopkeeper Shao,

162
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,840
a foreign pearl appraiser.

163
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,800
Just trying to make a living.

164
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,880
Oh.

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,400
Leave.

166
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,080
No wonder you keep refusing me.

167
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,680
So,

168
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,680
you like this kind of outsider.

169
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,800
Oh.

170
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
Young Master Wang,

171
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,360
in Central Plains terms,

172
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,000
could it be

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,120
you're jealous?

174
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,640
You...

175
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,560
Shopkeeper Shao,

176
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,400
I'm starting the appraisal.

177
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,640
Oh!

178
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,720
This one

179
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
is from Hepu.

180
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,560
And this one

181
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,440
is also from Hepu.

182
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,400
This one,

183
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,400
this one,

184
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
and this one,

185
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,480
are all from Hepu.

186
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,360
This last one,

187
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,520
I don't even need to say,

188
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,800
everyone knows

189
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,840
where it's from.

190
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,800
Say it out loud.

191
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,440
Hepu!

192
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,760
That's right.

193
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,280
Young Master Wang,

194
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,320
this betrothal gift is so heavy,

195
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,960
you hauled it over with effort,

196
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,400
now you have to take it back.

197
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,040
How exhausting.

198
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,920
Move aside!

199
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,320
Ouch, Young Master Wang!

200
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,080
Slow down.

201
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,280
Oh my!

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
These pearls...

203
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,920
Don't want the pearls anymore, Young Master Wang?

204
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,080
Sorry,

205
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm late.

206
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,920
Every time I meet a scoundrel,

207
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,400
there's always a gentleman to save me.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,960
Isn't that a coincidence?

209
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,960
And they're all named Wang.

210
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,480
Miss,

211
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
when did you meet this foreign gentleman?

212
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,200
Hmm.

213
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,600
What?

214
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,800
You want me to shut down Lingyun Pearl Shop?

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
Prefect Li,

216
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,040
closing a pearl shop

217
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,760
is just a word from you.

218
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Is it so hard?

219
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,480
Since Lingyun Pearl Shop opened,

220
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,880
they've followed the rules.

221
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,920
Their reputation is excellent.

222
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,680
Why should I shut down their shop?

223
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,720
Because

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,040
I told you to.

225
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,840
You...

226
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,720
Prefect Li,

227
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,120
have you forgotten

228
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,840
how you became Prefect?

229
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,040
I

230
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,080
know what I must do.

231
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Ah!

232
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,960
Ouch, ouch!

233
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,200
Blockhead.

234
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,920
She’s furious.

235
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,560
Young Master.

236
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,040
Sister Rong.

237
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,200
How is she?

238
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,200
I sent her overseas.

239
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,760
It’s safer.

240
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Earlier,

241
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,720
Sister Rong and I pretended.

242
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,920
We fooled Zhang He.

243
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,480
She told me to take some capital and leave first.

244
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,080
And wait for you to find me.

245
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,040
But...

246
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
It’s been months since we parted.

247
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,000
What I got instead

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,640
was a warrant from the authorities.

249
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,960
I thought

250
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,200
I’d never see Sister Rong

251
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,720
or you again.

252
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
So why are you here?

253
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,960
Before,

254
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
Sister Rong and I

255
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
opened all the collected shells,

256
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,400
and marked their origins, right?

257
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,520
Someone!

258
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,920
Open all the shells for me!

259
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
Then I found

260
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,520
the villages under Hepu

261
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,560
no longer produce pearls.

262
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,360
But the shells from Nanjun

263
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,680
yield a lot of pearls.

264
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,480
So I deduced

265
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,960
these shells

266
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,640
must have migrated south.

267
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,000
And arrived in Nanjun.

268
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,120
Impressive.

269
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,320
It took me so much effort

270
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,040
just to learn the shells came to Nanjun.

271
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,560
You already knew.

272
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,320
So good-looking,

273
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,280
and smart too.

274
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,480
I really regret it.

275
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,400
What do you regret, Young Master?

276
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Burned the indenture too soon.

277
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,520
It’s not too late to regret now.

278
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,440
Xiao Cui.

279
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,680
Brush, ink, paper, inkstone.

280
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,160
Hey!

281
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,920
What’s wrong?

282
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,320
Young Master, are you scared?

283
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,080
Coward.

284
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,440
You...

285
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,560
So,

286
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,120
why did you come to Nanjun this time, Young Master?

287
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,840
What’s your plan?

288
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,520
To catch up.

289
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,200
Make up for our Li family’s

290
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,920
weakest lesson in Hepu.

291
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
No one above us.

292
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,360
Li Wenshun.

293
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,280
Li Wenshun.

294
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,920
Tell me,

295
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,120
you traveled so far to be an official,

296
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,080
what kind of official are you really?

297
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,280
Called a Prefect,

298
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,720
but not even a dog in reality.

299
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,520
Come.

300
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
For these rampant villains,

301
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,360
and the hard times for good officials,

302
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,720
let’s drink.

303
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,320
So,

304
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,000
is this world worse than a dog,

305
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,200
or is the Prefect worse than a dog?

306
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,800
Who are you?
