Why is the alarm going off now?

I...

22
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,736
I turned the alarm off earlier.

Well, you seemed really tired.

I wanted you to sleep a bit more.

A bit more, my foot.

Oh, my. Is that you, nanny?

00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,337
You haven't left yet?

31
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:44,937
I'm leaving now.

32
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:46,417
I set up the alarm,

33
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:48,857
but some loser turned it off.

34
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,217
I see.

35
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,577
Did you eat breakfast?

36
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:52,497

00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:54,857
- Nanny! - Good morning, Seo-yoon.

38
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:56,057
Did you sleep well?

39
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:58,897
Nanny. Why are you here so early
today?

40
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:00,897
Your nanny came early as I have an
important matter...

41
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:02,257
to take care of.

42
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:04,577

working?

43
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:05,897
No.

44
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,177
Something much more important than
that.

45
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:13,017
Mommy will definitely get it for you
today.

46
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:14,577
Are you getting me Pinkru?

My apologies.

here.

During this crisis of all times?

174

I know. It just had to happen today.

project,

181

Don't cause trouble.

Seo-yoon is still young.

186
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:12,697
Of course.

You really are the only one who cares
about me.

188
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:41,817
It's raining outside.

189
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:45,017
Don't you like rainy days, Su-chan?

190
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:49,137
I want it to pour down more.

191
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:52,137
A lot more than right now?

192
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:53,937
Yes.

193
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:56,617
If the road disappears,

194
00:10:57,297 --> 00:10:59,417
I won't have to go to the academy.

195
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:03,457
You don't want to go to the academy,
do you?

196
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:07,257
Are you going to tell my mom?

197
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:09,337
No.

198
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,137
It's our secret.

199
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:15,937
Su-chan. Let's go.

200
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:17,257
It's time to go to your academy.

201
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:19,217
Ma'am.

202
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,937
Our class isn't over yet.

203
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:23,937
Park Su-chan.

204
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:46,857
- I'm starving. - What should we get?

205
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:48,257
Have you decided on a menu?

206
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:57,057
(Regarding being a value-driven
consumer...)

207
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:04,457
(Jae-man)

208
00:12:07,457 --> 00:12:08,577
What is it?

209
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:10,017
How will we go today?

210
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:11,297
Go where?

211
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,417
Today's the memorial service.

212
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:15,737
I know.

213
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,937
For a working mom, weekday
memorial services

214
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,017
are like the trifecta of stress.

215
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:20,937
Exactly.

216
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,937
That's why Seo-yoon and I

217
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,537
will head over first and make jeon.

218
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,776
Just the jeon?

219
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,897
Listen. It's your family's memorial
service.

220
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:28,977
Got it?

221
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,017
Wait until I finish talking, okay?

222
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:32,737
Starting with jeon, I will prep
everything...

223
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:34,257
for the memorial service.

224
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,577
Did you have lunch?

225
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,017
Don't tell me you're skipping it.

226
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:42,057
I'm just staring at it.

227
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:44,537
Don't just have a quick gimbap lunch.

228
00:12:44,657 --> 00:12:46,097
Eat something good. Something
healthy.

229
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:47,537
Something expensive. The most
expensive one.

230
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:49,577
Whatever.

231
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:51,537
See you later.

232
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:05,177
What? Darn it.

233
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:08,857
I can't believe myself.

234
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:11,417
(Aaes)

235
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,657
- Director Yoon. - Hey, Ms. Ha.

236
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:15,257
How about a cup of coffee?

237
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,577
Sure. Let's get some.

238
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,177
Thank you.

239
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:20,697
Did you see that? All that sucking up!

240
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,817
How can she let that sly fox fool her?

241
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:24,417
I won't ever put up with it.

242
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,537
She who?

243
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:28,137
My role model, Senior Manager Lee
Jung-eun.

244
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:31,617
She was a legend, making a hit of
everything she did.

245
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:35,257
But now? A senior manager for life,
working like crazy,

246
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:37,297
and never getting promoted.
Unbelievable, right?

247
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,977
Ms. Ha and Director Yoon are from
Hanguk University.

248
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:42,457
And Ms. Lee suffered a loss because of
it.

249
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:44,497
No way.

250
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:47,577
Exactly.

251
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,017
Ms. Lee...

252
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,777
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

253
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:00,057
No.

254
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,257
Everything you said was true.

255
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:07,577
It's okay.

256
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:11,977
I should've acted all sly too.

257
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:14,977
"Director Yoon!"

258
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,017
Something like that?

259
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:21,377
It doesn't suit you. Don't do it.

260
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:22,977
Is that so?

261
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:24,897
Oh, no. Ms. Lee.

262
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:27,737
- Your nose. - Your nose.

263
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:30,417
Darn it. Seriously.

00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:43,777
Okay, everyone.

267
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:47,977
Today, we'll play a game of completing
the sentences.

268
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:50,817
Rearrange all these jumbled words
here...

269
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:52,897
to create two sentences.

270
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:53,937
- Okay? - Okay.

271
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:55,137
- Okay? - Okay.

272
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:56,137
- Okay. - One person...

273
00:14:56,257 --> 00:14:59,337
from each team will run up here and
place one word.

274
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:01,777
- You ready? - Yes.

275
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,417
Three, two, one.

276
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,537
Go!

277
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:08,017
Team A is leading.

278
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:11,577
This team is now in the lead.

279
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:14,617
Today, we're going to...

280
00:15:14,737 --> 00:15:17,337
have a debate class on the topic of...

281
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:20,337
the necessity of zoos.

282
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:23,817
So first, those who agree?

283
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:29,057
Let's start with Claire.

284
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:32,777
I think zoos are absolutely necessary.

285
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:34,537
Why do you think so?

286
00:15:34,897 --> 00:15:38,417
That's because it allows us to observe
animals

287
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,017
so closely and safely.

288
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,177
All right.

289
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:44,177
How about those who disagree?

290
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,297
Stella.

291
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,737
Share your thoughts.

292
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:50,977
I think zoos are not necessary.

(Big Parker Pre-primary Class B)

294
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,337
That's because animals...

295
00:15:54,457 --> 00:15:56,057
are not objects...

296
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,577
but precious lives.

(Today's Topic)

301

With each grade,

302
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,659
exams become a battle against time.

303
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,539
Especially with English essays,

304
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,059
save 30 seconds, you get into the Ivy
League.

305
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,859
Save 10 seconds,

306

it's SKY. You've probably heard of it
before.

307

To save those few seconds,

308
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,459
using cursive writing from a young age
is a must.

309
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,979
Since when did you have Tommy write
in cursive?

310
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:46,139
Tommy had a tutor since he was three.

311
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,299

say?

Okay. You can become one.

371
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:22,059
But you still have to attend Hanguk
University.

372
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:24,539
And to do that, you must go to
Myeongseong Elementary.

373
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:27,938
Did Grandma also graduate from
Hanguk University?

374
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,019
What?

375
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:31,619
Doesn't she start school next year?

376
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:33,699
One of you two should stay at home.

377
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,259
How much longer will you let a nanny
take care of her?

378
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,099
Gosh, Mom.

379
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,139
You can't imagine how much our nanny
loves Seo-yoon.

380
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:43,139
- Right? - Good gracious.

381
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,099
She's still a stranger.

382
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,299
Seriously.

383
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:50,779
Where are you going?

384
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,659
Really. Why did the conversation end
up there?

385
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:01,699
Telling us to quit a perfectly good job?

386
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:04,019
She said one of us two.

387
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,459
Jung-eun. She's my mom. It's
obviously you...

388
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,299
Or maybe not.

389
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,499
I see.

390
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:14,979
I should quit then, right?

391
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,459
With what you earn, we can cover our
expenses...

392
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:18,859
and the cost for Seo-yoon's nanny...

393
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:20,539
as well as her classes?

394
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:21,659
Well...

395
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,259
Jung-eun, come on.

396
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:27,539
Of course your salary is vital to our life.

397
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,379
I can't believe my mom.

398
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:32,379
Next time, I'll make sure she doesn't
nag you--

399
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,379
Can you please just shut your mouth...

400
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,219
in front of your mother?

401
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:38,219
That's how you can help me.

402
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,019
To whatever she says, say that you got
it.

403
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:42,459
Got it?

404
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:45,819
Put Seo-yoon to bed, okay?

405
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:47,459
I'm meeting someone.

406
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,019
At this late hour?

407
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:51,899
It's hardly for pleasure.

408
00:20:57,418 --> 00:21:00,019
Where was it again?

409
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,099
Here it is.

410
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,219
There.

411
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,539
Choose one of the speeches.

412
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:12,819
Last year, So-ra...

413
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:15,619
This one. She won the excellence
award with that.

414
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:20,819
Ji-suk. Jeong Ji-suk.

415
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,418
You know I love you, don't you?

416
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,059
With just your words?

417
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,579
- Thank you so much. - Oh, please.

418
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:33,019
I put her down for the elocution
competition,

419
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:35,299
but I don't want her to be humiliated.

420
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:37,339
As if that's even up for debate.

421
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:38,739
For winning any prize,

422
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,699
she'll automatically get into Class A.

423
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:41,859
Since you entered her,

424
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:43,259
have her see it to the end.

425
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:44,299
Right.

426
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:45,699
By the way,

427
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,499
I heard Tommy was entering too.

428
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:50,379
- Yes. - What's he reciting?

429
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:52,099
"The King's Speech."

430
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:53,219
Unbelievable.

431
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:54,938
"The King's..."

432
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:57,499
As in the challenging speech from the
movie?

433
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,339
- That's the one. - Unbelievable.

434
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:01,699
Hey. He's a shoo-in for first place,

435
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:04,339
so only focus on winning any prize.

436
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:06,219
Sure.

437
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,019
Here's your beer.

438
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:15,259
Please enjoy.

439
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:16,579
- Thanks. - Thanks.

440
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:18,459
- Cheers. - Cheers.

441
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:35,219
Look how sweet they are.

442
00:22:38,178 --> 00:22:39,139
Tell me about it.

443
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:42,459
I was once like that too.

444
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:43,819
Hey.

445
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:47,299
What can you do after motherhood?

446
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:54,259
Excuse me.

447
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:58,059
Don't you ever get married.

448
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:01,178
Stick to dating, okay?

449
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:03,499
You probably think...

450
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:06,099
marriage is all rainbows...

451
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,499
and butterflies.

452
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:13,299
It's bitter.

453
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:14,938
Only bitter.

454
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,418
- Hey. - It's disgustingly bitter.

455
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:20,139
You're drunk. That's enough.

456
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:21,859
Ms. Han, get me the pop-up store
schedule...

457
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:23,418
and budget by the end of this week.

458
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,059
Sure. I'll meet with the partner
tomorrow...

459
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:26,859
and have it done by this week.

460
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:30,339
Ms. Lee, our samples will be out
tomorrow,

461
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,178
so visit the Design Lab to check on
them.

462
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:33,219
Yes, sir.

463
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:35,938
You'll both be working outside the
office tomorrow.

464
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:39,339
Be back by the 3 p.m. meeting.

465
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,379
Yes, sir.

466
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,059
That's it for today's meeting.

467
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,339
What should we have for lunch?

468
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:49,499
By the looks of it, you had drinks last
night.

469
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:52,139
- How about a hangover soup? -
Sounds good.

470
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:54,139
Hangover soup?

471
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:56,938
Yangpyeong, Jeonju, or Cheongjin-
dong?

472
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,019
I'm good with them all.

473
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,699
I drank heavily...

474
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:02,339
after the memorial service last night.

475
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:04,938
- Let's head out for now, Ms. Lee. -
Sure.

476
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:07,459
Go on. I'll catch up later.

477
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,019
- We'll order yours. - They're already
gone.

478
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:10,379
Unbelievable.

479
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:11,539
It's me.

480
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,979
Something urgent came up,

481
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,059
and I can't drive Seo-yoon around
today.

482
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:16,099
I'm sorry.

483
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:18,059
Hello? Hey.

484
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:25,139
What just happened out of the blue?

485
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,299
It's done.

486
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:32,938
What should I do next?

487
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:38,339
Right now? But I'm on the freeway.

488
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:40,099
Fine. I'm hanging up.

489
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:42,619
Why did the nanny suddenly cancel?

490
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,339
What's going on?

491
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:45,579
I said we should hang up.

492
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:46,819
Unbelievable.

493
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:08,019
The receiver cannot be reached,

494
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,099
and you'll be transferred to voicemail.

495
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,379
Of course. As if I can count on my
mom.

496
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:19,819
Ms. Hwang,

497
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:21,619
enjoy the meal with Mr. Kim.

498
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,139
Wait. Hold on!

499
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,979
Hey, it's Mom.

500
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:39,779
Oh, dear.

501
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:43,139
I'm sorry about this. Let's hurry.

502
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:44,459
Come on.

503
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:46,019
Bye, Seo-yoon.

504
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:48,899
Hop in.

505
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:55,499
Where is it? There.

506
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:08,139
Why is no one moving?

507
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:11,899
Mom, aren't we already late?

508
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:15,539
No, we'll arrive on time.

509
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:16,739
Don't worry.

510
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,699
There isn't decent parking around here
though.

511
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:23,259
Darn.

512
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,339
I was going to park there myself.

513
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:29,899
I'll pass for now.

514
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:49,779
Come on.

515
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,059
We have 10 minutes.

516
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:58,179
You're to never let go.

517
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:59,779
- You got it? - Got it.

518
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,019
Let's go. There.

519
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,539
All right.

520
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:06,099
The mommy-coaster will now roll out.

521
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:07,379
Hold on tight, Seo-yoon.

522
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:09,499
Mom, off we go.

523
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:10,539
Go!

524
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,019
Run, Mom!

525
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,659
Just a second.

526
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:46,419
Mom, are you tired?

527
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,659
Gosh, no. I'm...

528
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,419
I'm not tired at all.

529
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,179
Really?

530
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,259
Really.

531
00:27:57,699 --> 00:27:59,979
It's up there, right?

532
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,859
Okay, off we go again.

533
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:04,539
There we go.

534
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:07,819
Hold on tight. Off I go.

535
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:08,859
Go!

536
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:15,939
We're almost there.

537
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:17,739
It won't be long now.

538
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,619
Mom, we actually made it on time.

539
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:38,899
See?

540
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:40,859
There. We weren't late.

541
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:42,939
Head on inside, my daughter.

542
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:44,779
Fighting.

543
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:47,339
It's an F, not a P.

544
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:50,059
What? Oh, right.

545
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:53,739
F... Fighting with an F.

546
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:55,419
There.

547
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:57,779
Go on in.

548
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:58,899
Mom.

549
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:02,059
I love that you drove me...

550
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:03,299
to class today.

551
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:05,939
Oh, good.

552
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:07,779
I was thrilled too.

553
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:09,219
Go on in. You don't want to be late.

554
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:11,739
- See you later. - Sure.

555
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:15,819
Would you like some water?

556
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:18,579
What? Oh, yes.

That's right. Class A for seven-year-
olds.

possible?

but we only have enough for those in
Class A.

Could you perhaps give me 10 minutes
with it?

that?

am.

No, it's not a special day. Are you
against it?

643
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:49,259
Why would I be? I love it.

644
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,699

Open your eyes. Do you know who I
am?

737
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:24,219
It's tough, isn't it?

738
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:30,259
Su-chan,

739
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:33,259
can you hear the rain?

740
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:35,058
- There. - What are you doing?

741
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:37,739
Su-chan.

742
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,099
Listen to the rain and open your eyes.

743
00:39:40,459 --> 00:39:43,139
Repeat after me. Look.

744
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:47,779
Good job. Once more.

745
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:51,739
Good boy.

746
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:56,939
Good job, Su-chan.

747
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:02,899
Doctor.

748
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:06,219
Is my Su-chan all right?

749
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:07,739
He was hyperventilating due to stress,

750
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,299
but he found his breathing again.

751
00:40:10,018 --> 00:40:11,739
- We'll keep an eye on him. - Thank
you.

752
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:13,979
Thank you.

753
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:16,819
Su-chan.

754
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:20,099
I forgot Seo-yoon.

755
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:38,899
Hello?

756
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:41,058
Seo-yoon, where are you now?

757
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:44,179
I took a taxi not to be late for the
academy.

758
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:45,859
Please hurry.

759
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,499
Did you take a taxi alone?

760
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,099
You shouldn't go alone.

761
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:52,899
You should have waited for me.

762
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:54,899
I worried about you.

763
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,499
I'm sorry.

764
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:58,699
No, it's not your fault.

765
00:40:58,819 --> 00:40:59,739
I'm sorry.

766
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:01,579
I'll take a taxi and follow you right
now.

767
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:03,699
Call me as soon as you arrive, okay?

768
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:06,058
Okay. Come quickly.

769
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:10,419
(Emergency Medical Center)

770
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,579
Big Parker Academy at Daechi-dong,
please.

771
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:27,939
The package concept of this spring and
summer season...

772
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:31,619
should look simple and clean.

773
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:35,058
We need to differentiate from other
companies,

774
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:37,179
so you need to check out...

775
00:41:37,299 --> 00:41:38,419
how other companies are doing.

776
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:40,339
And, about this.

777
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,219
Have you all read this marketing
strategy proposal?

778
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:45,099
Yes.

779
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,538
I think it fully reflects...

780
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:49,699
the opinions of Gen Z,

781
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:52,219
but you know how boomers feel
alienated.

782
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:54,099
About consumers in their 40s and 50s,

783
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:56,099
we need to conduct more research.

784
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,099
For those...

785
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:03,459
Hello? Yes.

786
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:07,259
What?

787
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:10,499
Seo-yoon hasn't come to the academy
yet?

788
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,058
No, that can't happen. She surely went
with my mom...

789
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:16,819
Excuse me. Hold on a second.

790
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,018
I'll call you back. Bye.

791
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:24,899
(Mom)

792
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,579
The person you have called cannot
answer now....

793
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:40,219
Why isn't she getting the call?

794
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:44,899
(My Gem)

795
00:42:53,419 --> 00:42:54,659
Your call has been forwarded...

796
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:56,659
to an automatic voice message system.

797
00:42:56,939 --> 00:42:58,499
Please leave your message after the
beep.

798
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:03,659
(Nanny)

799
00:43:20,939 --> 00:43:22,779
(Nanny has left the chat room.)

800
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:52,299
(Mom)

801
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:05,499
Gosh, really.

802
00:44:06,899 --> 00:44:08,819
Please answer the phone!

803
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:14,139
Jung-eun, what is it? What's wrong?

804
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:17,018
Seo-yoon.

805
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:21,139
Seo-yoon has disappeared.

806
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,339
Seo-yoon? Why?

807
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,099
Ms. Lee!

808
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,819
What happened to Seo-yoon?

809
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:31,139
Calm down now.

810
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:32,459
I reported to the police.

811
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:33,538
Jung-eun, get your act together.

812
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:34,899
You might get in a traffic accident.

813
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:36,819
I traced her location,

814
00:44:36,939 --> 00:44:38,139
and she seems to be in Daechi-dong
now.

815
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:41,139
Something urgent came up,

816
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:42,859
and I can't drive Seo-yoon around
today.

817
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:43,819
Nanny hasn't come?

818
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:45,139
No, she hasn't.

819
00:44:45,259 --> 00:44:47,939
(Nanny has left the chat room.)

820
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:50,259
The nanny!

821
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:52,859
I think the nanny took her.

822
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:00,299
Gosh.

823
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,699
(Big Parker)

824
00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:07,259
Yes, Ms. Lee.

825
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:08,859
Yes.

826
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:11,139
- Excuse me... - Seo-yoon hasn't come.

827
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:15,779
Did you just say Seo-yoon?

828
00:45:15,899 --> 00:45:17,018
Hong Seo-yoon?

829
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:18,699
Hold on, Ms. Lee.

830
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:20,339
Please take this call now.

831
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:25,339
Hello?

832
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:27,739
Why aren't you answering the phone?

833
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:30,299
Seo-yoon has disappeared!

834
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:31,659
What?

835
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:05,299
Goodness.

836
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:24,219
Seo-yoon.

837
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:30,659
Seo-yoon.

838
00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:37,538
Seo-yoon.

839
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:49,538
Seo-yoon.

840
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:57,179
Seo-yoon.

841
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:10,899
Are you okay?

842
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:13,459
Are you not hurt?

843
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:15,499
Seo-yoon...

844
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,219
Hello.

845
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:33,899
Is this Hong Seo-yoon's parent?

846
00:47:34,779 --> 00:47:35,819
Who are you?

847
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:38,819
I'm calling from Gongnam Police Patrol
Unit.

848
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,018
Are you not Hong Seo-yoon's parent?

849
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:43,339
I'm Seo-yoon's mom.

850
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,058
How is Seo-yoon? Is she all right?

851
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:48,058
She didn't have an accident, did she?

852
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:51,699
Mom.

853
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:53,499
Seo-yoon!

854
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:00,259
(Police)

855
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:03,538
Seo-yoon.

856
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,379
- Seo-yoon! - Mom!

857
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:07,659
Seo-yoon!

858
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:09,739
Where on earth have you been?

859
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:11,779
You'll never know how much I was
worried.

860
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:13,979
Do you know how many times I called
you?

861
00:48:14,419 --> 00:48:16,459
I'm sorry, Mom.

862
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:19,139
I was waiting for Grandma...

863
00:48:19,419 --> 00:48:21,979
and took a taxi alone.

864
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:37,659
Let me get off here.

865
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:39,339
You need to go further.

866
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:41,018
I know what's around here.

867
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:42,459
I've been here before with my mom.

868
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:45,259
If I walk a bit more, it's my academy.

869
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:58,058
Where am I?

870
00:49:04,379 --> 00:49:05,459
Mom...

871
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:16,659
Excuse me, kid.

872
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:20,058
Here you go.

873
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:24,659
Because your daughter dropped her
phone,

874
00:49:24,779 --> 00:49:26,459
the battery got disconnected.

875
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:27,979
I guess she thought it went out of
order...

876
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,018
Hong Seo-yoon!

877
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:31,219
I did it not to get late.

878
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:33,299
How can you take a taxi alone to go
there?

879
00:49:33,419 --> 00:49:37,339
You don't want me to be late for the
academy.

880
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:39,739
So I tried to go even if I was alone.

881
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:40,899
My goodness.

882
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:45,699
Seo-yoon!

883
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:51,619
Seo-yoon, are you all right?

884
00:49:53,379 --> 00:49:54,499
You say like you were worried.

885
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:56,539
How come you let her stay on the
street alone?

886
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:57,899
I'm sorry, Jung-eun.

887
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,699
It was an emergency.

888
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:00,779
Was it?

889
00:50:00,899 --> 00:50:02,299
What kind of emergency...

890
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:03,899
makes you desert your granddaughter
on the street?

891
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:05,139
Desert her on the street?

892
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,299
That's an exaggeration.

893
00:50:07,419 --> 00:50:09,739
I asked you, and how come you let this
happen?

894
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:10,939
I'm your daughter.

895
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,219
No.

896
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:14,179
You neglected me taking care of other
people's kids.

897
00:50:14,299 --> 00:50:16,579
What are you saying?

898
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:18,739
Although you neglected me,

899
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:22,299
you shouldn't have done that to Seo-
yoon!

900
00:50:22,779 --> 00:50:23,779
What?

901
00:50:24,779 --> 00:50:26,499
Don't cry. We're not fighting.

902
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:27,579
Let her go.

903
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:29,259
Lee Jung-eun!

904
00:50:29,379 --> 00:50:32,139
Now I won't leave Seo-yoon with other
people.

905
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:33,779
Other people?

906
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:35,859
I will quit my job.

907
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:38,739
Quit your job? Because of your kid's
academy?

908
00:50:39,939 --> 00:50:41,299
To imagine...

909
00:50:44,259 --> 00:50:46,539
how scared Seo-yoon must have felt
alone...

910
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:51,539
I won't let her stay alone.

911
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:53,899
I will take care of her.

912
00:50:58,539 --> 00:51:00,539
- I'll take care of Seo-yoon. - No,
thanks.

913
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:02,059
No, thanks?

914
00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:05,139
Don't be stubborn, and do as I say.

915
00:51:06,979 --> 00:51:08,699
I will give Seo-yoon a ride to the
academy.

916
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:11,099
Seo-yoon won't take a taxi alone
anymore.

917
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,139
I will take a half day off and give her a
ride.

918
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:18,099
So, either bring that crazy nanny
back...

919
00:51:18,219 --> 00:51:19,299
or get a new one.

920
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,499
All right?

921
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:30,659
Seo-yoon! Oh, hello.

922
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:34,459
Mother? Honey.

923
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:36,619
Goodness.

924
00:51:48,899 --> 00:51:52,219
(My Gem)

925
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:03,739
Jung-eun, aren't you going to bed?

926
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:11,619
I'm sure what happened today shocked
Mother.

927
00:52:14,419 --> 00:52:15,499
You can go to bed.

928
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:18,619
- Jung-eun. - Go to bed.

929
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,299
I must be crazy.

930
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:48,019
(Mom)

931
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:49,179
(Thank you.)

932
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:54,579
Mom, are you sleeping?

933
00:52:55,779 --> 00:52:57,219
Today, I made a mistake.

934
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,419
I was too shocked.

935
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:19,259
I'm sorry that I got angry at you.

936
00:53:19,379 --> 00:53:21,939
(I'm sorry that I got angry at you.)

937
00:53:24,939 --> 00:53:26,779
(I'm sorry.)

938
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:43,139
Although you neglected me,

939
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:46,739
you shouldn't have done that to Seo-
yoon!

940
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:53,059
A mom doesn't know everything.

941
00:54:04,899 --> 00:54:06,739
Pick her up at 12:55 p.m.

942
00:54:06,859 --> 00:54:08,739
Arrive at Big Parker by 1:55 p.m.

943
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:09,859
You shouldn't be late.

944
00:54:10,299 --> 00:54:12,699
What? Is this all?

945
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:15,939
What a brat.

946
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:31,859
That won't happen.

947
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:36,859
What? Taking her to the academy?

948
00:54:38,419 --> 00:54:39,499
Come on.

949
00:54:39,939 --> 00:54:41,459
How could you ask her to do that?

950
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:44,179
My goodness. I can't believe this.

951
00:54:44,299 --> 00:54:45,499
It's not easy for you, young people.

952
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:46,579
What if your mother-in-law gets
exhausted?

953
00:54:46,699 --> 00:54:48,099
What are you going to do then?

954
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,619
What option do I have?

955
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:51,299
What option do you have? You punk.

956
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,099
What shall we do now?

957
00:55:11,859 --> 00:55:13,059
We're moving.

958
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:16,259
I want to move further.

959
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:19,579
I will get off here.

960
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:21,699
I can get off here and run to the
academy.

961
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:22,859
Here?

962
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:25,179
Do you think you can do that?

963
00:55:30,339 --> 00:55:32,779
You're sure you can get off here?

964
00:55:33,459 --> 00:55:34,859
What if you get lost again?

965
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:36,419
Do you see my academy ahead?

966
00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:38,179
Calvin's grandma goes to the parking
lot

967
00:55:38,259 --> 00:55:39,659
...in the department store.

968
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:41,619
You can go there too.

969
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:43,659
I'll go in and wait.

970
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:45,139
Seo-yoon.

971
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,379
Don't tell your mom that you got off on
the street...

972
00:55:49,499 --> 00:55:51,139
I won't. Don't worry.

973
00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:53,659
You dropped me off in front of the
academy. Right?

974
00:55:53,779 --> 00:55:54,779
See you.

975
00:55:56,259 --> 00:55:57,979
Be careful.

976
00:55:58,539 --> 00:56:00,459
Be careful, Seo-yoon. Here you go.

977
00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:01,979
This is too heavy for you.

978
00:56:02,979 --> 00:56:04,779
It's... Seo-yoon!

979
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:11,579
My goodness. I get it. I'm moving.

980
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:18,299
It's farther than I thought.

981
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:21,339
How much do I have to hurry?

982
00:56:29,939 --> 00:56:30,979
Who's that?

983
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:32,899
I've never seen her before.

984
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:36,299
Why is she sitting there?

985
00:56:36,419 --> 00:56:37,339
- It's a seat for Class A.  - If the traffic

986
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:38,419
is the same on the way back,

987
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:41,419
I'd rather leave my car on the street.

988
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:43,019
Only moms are allowed here.

989
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:00,099
She looks like a grandmother.

990
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:01,259
A grandmother?

991
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:05,819
I guess she has no idea.

992
00:57:20,419 --> 00:57:22,099
Why are they so interested in me?

993
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:38,819
She must be crazy.

994
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:45,059
Mom, it's me. Are you still in there?

995
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:51,699
I'm in front of the academy now.

996
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,139
Don't let Seo-yoon come out in the
middle.

997
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:56,579
You stand in front of her classroom.

998
00:57:57,299 --> 00:57:59,819
What would I do? I'll kill that woman.

999
00:58:13,299 --> 00:58:15,579
- Ms. Lee. - Are you out of your mind?

1000
00:58:16,379 --> 00:58:17,819
You disappeared without giving me
one phone call.

1001
00:58:17,939 --> 00:58:19,579
How shameless are you to come here
like this?

1002
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:23,739
You should have received the call from
the kid.

1003
00:58:24,499 --> 00:58:26,099
Why should I?

1004
00:58:28,499 --> 00:58:29,459
Why?

1005
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,099
Why?

1006
00:58:32,379 --> 00:58:35,259
I might have lost Seo-yoon, because of
you.

1007
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:37,299
What if she was not found?

1008
00:58:37,419 --> 00:58:39,219
Why are you saying that to me?

1009
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:41,259
You're her mom. You're responsible for
what happened.

1010
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:42,659
What?

1011
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:44,899
I can't stand it anymore...

1012
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:45,979
Oh, my!

1013
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:50,819
- Mom! - Are you crazy?

1014
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:52,539
Why did you hit me?

1015
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,579
You should be apologizing for what you
did.

1016
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:55,659
How dare you say so?

1017
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:58,259
How do you feel getting hit in the
back?

1018
00:58:58,899 --> 00:59:01,179
You should feel what we felt. That's
poetic justice.

1019
00:59:01,299 --> 00:59:02,219
Don't you think?

1020
00:59:03,739 --> 00:59:04,739
Darn it.

1021
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:13,979
(We'd like to thank Son Jong-hak and
Miram...)

1022
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:15,019
(for their special appearance.)

1023
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:49,419
(Mother and Mom)

1024
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:51,979
Ju-hee, right?

1025
00:59:52,299 --> 00:59:54,459
You got the wrong person.

1026
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:55,939
Jinny!

1027
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,619
Your daughter intentionally made
you...

1028
00:59:57,739 --> 00:59:58,539
sit your granddaughter.

1029
00:59:58,659 --> 01:00:00,539
You should keep doing this.

1030
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:02,299
That's why I decided to do it.

1031
01:00:02,419 --> 01:00:04,099
May I help you?

1032
01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:05,859
Taking Min-ho to and from the
academy.

1033
01:00:05,979 --> 01:00:07,219
Are you sure, Father?

1034
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:08,859
Who are you?

1035
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,619
Are you a bad guy?

1036
01:00:11,059 --> 01:00:12,419
You must be very happy.

1037
01:00:12,819 --> 01:00:15,379
You'll help her with the speech
competition?

1038
01:00:15,499 --> 01:00:16,939
Let's win first place.
