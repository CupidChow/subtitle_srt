(and were kept safe.)

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,400
- Please. - Now,

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
we'll draw the last lot.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,720
Seo-yoon.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,440
Seven.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,560
Please.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,279
Please.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Seven!

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,200
Really?

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
The last number is...

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,640
number 17.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,400
No.

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,399
I clearly saw it.

23
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,040
It was number seven.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,560
Here.

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,040
I'm number 17.

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Hey.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,560
Wait a minute.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,640
- What? - What's she doing?

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,480
Is she crazy? How can it be seven?

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,880
Let me take a look.

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,080
I saw it was seven.

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,800
What an eyesore.

(Myeongseong Elementary School)

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,400
I checked it. It is 17.

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,960
See? It's 17.

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,040
What a weirdo.

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,200
It can't be.

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,160
I clearly saw seven.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
That is all for the day.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,320
What happened?

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,160
I'm doomed.

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,720
Gosh.

(Episode 4)

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,520
Congratulations, Ms. Song.

46
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,400
You've finally become...

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,999
the official member...

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,600
of Myeongseong Elementary PTA.

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,760
It's all thanks to you, ma'am.

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
No need to thank me.

51
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
By the way,

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,560
when are you going to stop calling me ma'am?

53
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,920
Thank you, Chairwoman.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,879
Oh, about how we went...

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,999
to play golf with Park Jin-yi.

56
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,480
Gosh, I don't know how people found out,

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,760
but everyone's praising...

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,040
about how I cast her.

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,320
I will soon schedule it again with her.

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,720
Good.

61
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,040
I look forward to working with you, Ms. Song.

62
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Oh, right.

63
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,040
Who's that woman with number seven?

64
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,920
She almost scared me.

65
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,800
We were lucky that the dean took care of it.

This place is so nice.

75
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
I used to look for a forest like this...

76
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,320
every weekend...

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,440
and camp out with my daughter.

78
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,400
We talked all night long...

79
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,000
watching the stars.

80
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,560
But after we returned to Korea,

81
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
I didn't take her camping again.

Oh, actually...

84
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,880
my daughter was born in the USA.

85
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,480
You lived in the USA?

86
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,440
Where in the USA?

87
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,920
Well...

90
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,760
I lived there for five years too.

91
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,880
Oh, my. Really?

92
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,040
Yes.

Jinny.

94
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,199
- Yes! I won. - Let's do it again.

95

Let's do it again.

96
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,240

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,959
- Gosh. - Seo-yoon.

98

Do you like it? Is it fun?

99
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,760
Yes, let's set up a tent and play here.

100
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,079
And watch the stars at night.

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,040
I want to see the stars too.

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,959
Do you like watching the stars, Seo-yoon?

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,079
Yes.

104
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
Her mom used to love watching the stars...

105
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,880
when she was young.

106
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,560
She took that from her mom.

107
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,400
I know.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Then I will show you and Min-ho...

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,280
stars sometime.

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,240
- You're the best. - You're the best.

112
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,120
You may look forward to it.

113

Yes!

114
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,360
Let's run to the top.

115
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,760
Hey, wait for me.

116
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,079
Wait.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
Why not play with them?

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,079
Those two are having fun alone.

119
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,680
Don't you know why I'm here?

120
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,560
Because of the pain in your back?

121
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,560
Two's company, three's a crowd.

122
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,480
You need to know that.

123
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,000
How can you not know that?

124
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,959
"Two's company, three's a crowd?"

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,560
I mean,

126
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,440
I clearly saw it was seven.

127
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,360
Jung-eun, that's enough.

128
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,440
You checked it yourself.

129
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,639
That's why it's strange.

130
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,480
You saw things...

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,040
because you were desperate.

132
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,160
What am I going to do about Seo-yoon?

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
What else?

134
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,320
Are you going to be this down...

135
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,640
just because you didn't get into Myeongseong?

136
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,640
Gosh, you're coming with me.

137
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
To where?

138
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,120
I was going to send my child to Gongnam...

139
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
if I didn't make it to Myeongseong.

140
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,120
One second.

141
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Here it is.

142
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
Forget what you missed...

143
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,880
and put yourself on the wait list in Gongnam-dong.

144
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Gongnam-dong?

145
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,360
Are you telling me to move?

146
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,480
If you fail private school, what other alternative...

147
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,880
do you have than public school?

148
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,080
Then it's got to be Gangnam.

149
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,760
Gongnam Elementary is as good as most private schools.

150
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
Get moving first.

151
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,120
I'm not sure if there are any houses available now,

152
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,320
but you have to move first.

153
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,920
- Okay. - I'll get my car.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,920
Wait here.

155
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,480
Gosh.

156
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
I expected Myeongseong...

157
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,400
to be my daughter's start line.

158
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,840
Hi.

159
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,640
Congratulations on entering Myeongseong Elementary.

160
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,960
Yet you did that?

161
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,720
About earlier...

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

163
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,080
Now I see that you have a habit...

164
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,560
of making a scene everywhere you go.

165
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Pardon?

166
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,040
Do you want to stop going to Big Parker?

167
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,600
I'll never let that happen again.

169
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,840
(Myeongseong)

170
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,800
This is beautiful.

171
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,080
Oh, my.

172
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
Are you okay?

173
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Oh, yes.

174
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:01,040
I'm just checking out the view.

175
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,760
One, two, three.

176
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,640
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

177
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
Don't run.

178
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,359
Okay.

179
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,320
- Grandma. - Yes.

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
Hey.

181
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,479
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,200
How fun was it?

183
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,840
- As big as the universe. - It was so much fun.

184
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,840
Yes?

185
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,800
- Mi-chun. - Yes?

186
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,920
This place is so nice.

187
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,080
- Yes? - Yes.

188
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,800
Don't be surprised already.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,240
Hello, ma'am.

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,200
Hi.

191
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,720
Is everyone here?

192
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,200
- They're all here. - I will show you the way.

193
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:56,320
Let's go. Come on.

194
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,080
Hurry.

195
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,560
Come in.

196
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,920
Cool.

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,400
Do you want to play bubbles outside?

198
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,560
- Yes. - Yes.

199
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,920
Come on.

200
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,520
Thank you.

201
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,680
- Thank you. - Take a look around.

202
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,320
- Thank you. - Nice.

203
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,120
Yes, thank you.

204
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,240
Freeze.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,040
- Unfreeze. - Here.

206
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,479
What's this for?

207
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,000
Haven't you seen an apron before?

208
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,520
When you come to a place like this,

209
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,440
men are supposed to cook.

210
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,440
- I... - No.

211
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,359
You should sit down and rest over there.

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

213
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,359
It's just one meal. Why did you buy so much?

214
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,479
Then eat a lot.

215
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Oh, how pitiful.

216
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,960
You look like you have a sad story or something.

217
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,680
Is slicing the onion that sad?

218
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,880
Gosh, you should get some fresh air.

219
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,240
How sad your story is.

220
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh, you're good at it.

221
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,880
Let me try.

222
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,320
(You did it.)

223
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,440
(Camera)

224
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,800
Here.

225
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,920
- Take a picture. - Take a picture.

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,720
Take a picture. Here.

227
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
- Look. - Hi.

228
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,479
You should try this. Yes.

229
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,000
- It's going up. - It's going up.

230
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,560
Can you take a picture of me?

231
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
I'll take a picture of you.

232
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,160
So pretty.

233
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,440
Good job.

234
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,160
My goodness.

235
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,160
See? Isn't that beautiful?

236
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,040
Yes, it's beautiful.

237
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,880
Grandma.

238
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,120
If Seo-yoon and Min-ho get married later,

239
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,320
do they become a family?

240
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,520
Seo-yoon and Min-ho?

241
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,840
They should wait for their turns.

242
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,560
Min-ho's grandpa and Seo-yoon's grandma...

243
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
should get married first.

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,880
What? Then only one couple?

245
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,120
They can both be couples.

246
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,760
They can be each other's in-laws.

247
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,040
Then it will be Seo-yoon and Min-ho.

248
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,720
Why do you have to say that?

249
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,840
Look.

250
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,440
They can all get married,

251
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,360
but if there can be only one couple,

252
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,000
then the grandma should get the chance first.

253
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,480
But Grandma.

254
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,040
If you say that, I'm a little disappointed.

255
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,200
You already got married once before.

256
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,880
Then you should make concessions to us children.

257
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,200
Oh, my gosh. Listen to your words.

258
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,160
I raised a tiger's baby, didn't I?

259
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,760
I have a point, don't I?

260
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,120
You do have a point, but think about it.

261
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,040
Here.

262
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,560
I lived alone longer than your whole life.

263
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,080
I don't care about that.

264
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,320
Since Seo-yoon and Min-ho met first,

265
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,200
they have my support.

266
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,600
Oh, how frustrating.

267
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
Jung-eun.

268
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,400
Hi.

269
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,800
(Gongnam Palace)

270
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,000
I guess Seo-yoon

271
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,040
should go to Gongnam Elementary School.

272
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,400
Of course.

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,800
It's Gongnam over Myeongseong.

274
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,040
Forget Myeongseong.

275
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,480
Tell them you refuse even if they beg you.

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,600
So what are you worried about?

277
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Money.

278
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,120
This is in Gangnam.

279
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,280
Should I let my ladies...

280
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
live in Gongnam-dong?

281
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,760
Seriously.

282
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,120
By the way, Divine General that son of...

283
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,080
Be quiet.

284
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,640
Give me the address. I'll send him to the divine.

285
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,160
- Seriously... - Stop it.

286
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,800
Still, he got the babysitter right.

287
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,760
Hey, he only got half right. That's cheating.

288
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,040
What if you ordered something from home shopping,

289
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,960
but you only got half of it? Isn't that upsetting?

290
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,200
Even my work gives a full refund in 15 days.

291
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,120
I'll get a refund today. So don't worry.

292
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,120
Real estate. That's our highest priority.

293
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,520
(Gongnam Real Estate)

294
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
On the wait list.

295
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,400
Oh, yes. Wait for the real estate. Let's go.

296
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,280
You sprained your ankle.

297
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,800
Does she have to get surgery?

298
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,400
Stay at the hospital for tonight,

299
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,840
and you can go home tomorrow.

300
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
And you should get a treatment.

301
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,640
You should've been careful.

302
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,640
I'm glad that we got into Myeongseong,

303
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,160
but who's going to drive Min-ho?

304
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,800
Father agreed to drive him for a while.

305
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,000
Dad?

306
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,520
But he's so busy. What's gotten into him?

307
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,240
- Nice. - Amazing.

308
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,280
Enjoy.

309
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,880
- Thank you. - Thank you.

310
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,600
- This is really good. - Yes.

311
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,360
Even though I made it, it's good.

312
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,120
There are no houses available these days.

313
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Now we even say you must hit a jackpot...

314
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,320
to find something available.

315
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,840
But...

316
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,440
there happens to be one house...

317
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,160
that's within Gongnam Elementary district.

318
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,440
What's the condition?

319
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,800
Rent? Lease?

320
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,640
It's on sale. It's around 132 square meters.

321
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,560
That's too big.

322
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,960
There are only large homes here.

323
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,840
That leaves me no option.

324
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,040
Why only one?

- What? - What else?

Follow them and check...

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,120
all the real estate offices in this area.

329
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,160
If there's anything available, call me. Okay?

330
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,360
What's wrong?

331
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,200
We have to hurry up.

332
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,800
I already checked everywhere.

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,680

Well, there will be a smaller one available soon.

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,440
Why? Keep pushing me for some more.

374
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,560
For some more?

375
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,480
Jung-eun, did you gain weight?

376
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,840
You feel different from Seo-yoon.

377
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,320
My arms are getting pumped up...

378
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,200
from a few pushes.

379
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,280
Just kidding.

380
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:45,000
You must be tired.

381
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,000
I have a name too.

382
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,800
Do you not remember it?

383
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,360
You said it was Lee Young-wook.

384
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,080
Just in case you forgot.

385
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,960
I remember it.

386
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm honored, Ms. Yoon Ji-a.

387
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,800
Why did you go to North Carolina?

388
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,040
I went to graduate school there.

389
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
Oh, my.

390
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,880
Maybe we've run into each other.

391
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,640
Do you remember the clock tower...

392
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,440
in the campus?

393
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Of course.

394
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,560
I miss that place around this time of the year.

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
I want to visit it again.

396
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,399
I probably can't, right?

397
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,040
Do you think that place is still the same?

398
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,760
Check it yourself.

399
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,200
What?

400
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,320
Do you want to go check it together?

401
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,360
I have to go there soon.

402
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,960
As you can see, I'm busy.

403
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,399
When are you going?

404
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,640
If I tell you,

405
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,800
will you come with me?

406
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,640
Never mind.

407
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,520
I won't tell you when I'm leaving then.

408
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
My goodness.

409
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,680
You should go together.

410
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,560
I'm sleeping.

411
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,080
Gosh, I must be tired.

412
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,240
I'm talking in my sleep.

413
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,040
Are you sure we got everything?

414
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,360
Gosh.

415
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,159
No, you must be more tired from driving.

416
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,760
- We're here. - Yes.

417
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,800
Mi-chun, drive safe.

418
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,360
Yes, drive home safe.

419
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,560
- Bye. - Bye, kids.

420
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,399
- Bye. - Come on. Let's go.

421
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,560
- Bye. - Let's go home.

422
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,320
- Bye. - Bye.

423
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,640
- Bye. - Bye.

424
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,800
See you tomorrow.

425
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,159
Isn't she pretty?

426
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,240
Yes.

427
00:21:58,399 --> 00:21:59,840
She's pretty.

428
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:04,919
Seo-yoon shines brightly.

429
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,800
Yes.

430
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,000
She shines brightly.

431
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,080
Oh, right, Min-ho.

432
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,760
If your mom asks...

433
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,399
I know it's a secret.

434
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,560
Yes, and...

435
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,680
the pictures we took with Seo-yoon's grandma...

436
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,800
I already sent them to your phone.

437
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,080
Did you?

438
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
Good job.

439
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,080
It's your dad.

440
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,200
What brings you to call me?

441
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
- Mom. - Seo-yoon.

442
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,240
Welcome home.

443
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,159
- What about dinner? - I already had it.

444
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,560
How did the draw go?

445
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,200
We decided to send her to Gongnam.

446
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,040
Gongnam?

447
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,040
Isn't that in Gangnam?

448
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,120
Seo-yoon, I'm sorry.

449
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,520
You'll have to go to Gongnam instead of Myeongseong.

450
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,720
Tae-rin's going to Gongnam too.

451
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,240
Yes! Do I get to go to school with Tae-rin?

452
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,159
Are you that excited?

453
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,640
Yes, I love it.

454
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
You're the best.

455
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Right?

456
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,960
Mom chose your favorite school.

457
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,880
Mom's the best.

458
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:29,280
Seo-yoon.

459
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,640
What did you do with Min-ho today?

460
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,040
We went on a cable car,

461
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,360
we saw alpacas,

462
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,960
and we made bubbles.

463
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,919
Mom, we had so much fun today.

464
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,159
Really?

465
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,159
Did you get close to Min-ho?

466
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,520
It's not that we got close.

467
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,320
We had always been close.

468
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:48,360
But I'm closer to Tae-rin.

469
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,040
Why?

470
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,399
Why are you closer to Tae-rin?

471
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,919
You should stay closer to Min-ho.

472
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,640
Min-ho and I are close,

473
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,280
but I'm closer to Tae-rin.

474
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,000
Yes, I know.

475
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,399
But what I'm saying is,

476
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,320
you should get way closer to Min-ho.

477
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:08,640
Why do you only talk about Min-ho?

478
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
Okay. Then...

479
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,800
stay close to Tae-rin at school,

480
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,280
and only hang out with Min-ho at Big Parker.

481
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,040
You must stay closer to Min-ho, okay?

482
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
How can you say that to your child?

483
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,120
I'm leaving.

484
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,919
- Now? - Oh, Mother.

485
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,960
- You should sleep over. - Yes.

486
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,000
- You have to come back again tomorrow. - Yes.

487
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,520
You should sleep over.

488
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,120
Why sleep here when I have my own house?

489
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Okay.

490
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,240
Call me when you get home.

491
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Bye, Jinny. See you tomorrow.

492
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,800
Bye.

493
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,000
Bye. Thank you.

494
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,720
Seo-yoon, what's my English name?

495
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,280
Call me by my English name.

496
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
- You? - Yes.

497
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,919
Ask Mom.

498
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,640
- Honey, what's my English name? - Yes?

499
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,880
Is it Leonardo DiCaprio?

500
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:55,320
I can't wait. What is it? Tell me.

501
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,360
Shush.

502
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,400
Jim. She said it was Jim.

503
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,360
Jim?

504
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,400
- Jim? I like it. - Yes.

505
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,720
Isn't that cool?

506
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,640
That means you're a burden.

507
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,120
- Oh, a burden? - Jim.

508
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,800
- Jim. - Let the burden show you...

509
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,120
what it can do.

510
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,960
(Hanguk University Hospital)

511
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,200
(Santa)

512
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,960
(Ms. Yoon, I miss you and I love you.)

513
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,440
(Ms. Yoon Ji-a, the world's prettiest...)

514
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,120
When did they prepare this?

515
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
(Ms. Yoon, I miss you and I love you.)

516
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,960
(Ms. Yoon Ji-a)

517
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,360
Mom.

518
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,360
How is she? Is it bad?

519
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
No.

520
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,320
I only fell, and this is what happened.

521
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,800
I'm sorry, Father.

522
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,560
Mom, are you okay?

523
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,120
It's not a big deal.

524
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,800
When you go to Myeongseong,

525
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,560
you have to do even better.

526
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,200
Starting with the upcoming speech contest.

527
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,240
Okay.

528
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,920
I heard you went to see Professor Hwang...

529
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,520
with Min-ho today.

530
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
What?

531
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,520
Yes.

532
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,800
Yes.

533
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,800
He praised...

534
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,280
how smart Min-ho was.

535
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,040
What now?

536
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,280
I'm in this condition.

537
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,560
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

538
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,520
Actually, I heard all about driving kids today.

539
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,120
From Professor Hwang?

540
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,280
No, well...

541
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,120
Oh, yes. Professor Hwang's...

542
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,560
daughter-in-law.

543
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,240
She told me.

544
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,840
Isn't Professor Hwang's daughter-in-law...

545
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,080
in the USA?

546
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,200
Right.

547
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,720
I heard she lives in San Jose.

548
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
Oh, yes.

549
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,600
But it's the vacation season.

550
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,560
So she was...

551
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,200
Which sanctions the use of force,

552
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,960
or threat of force,

553
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,280
against the sovereignty...

554
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,840
and independence of other states.

555
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,560
What do you think, Mom?

556
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,560
I practiced it more than 100 times today with Grandpa.

557
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,240
- Thank you so much, Father. - Yes.

558
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,800
Practice makes it better.

559
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,800
Anyway, don't worry about driving him...

560
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,240
and take care of yourself.

561
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,800
Bye now.

562
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,400
Goodnight.

563
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
See you tomorrow, Grandpa.

564
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,720
Bye.

565
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,840
(Sophisticated surgery with cutting-edge technology)

566
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,800
What?

567
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,160
- Do you need help? - My goodness.

568
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,600
What are you doing here?

569
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,280
Have you been chasing me?

570
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,640
I got a call that Min-ho's mom was hurt,

571
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,920
so I was stopping by.

572
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,680
Min-ho's mom?

573
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,400
Is it bad?

574
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,800
Luckily, it's not serious.

575
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,840
By the way,

576
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,640
what brings you here at this hour?

577
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,840
(I wanted to see it with you.)

578
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,160
(I was sad that you weren't here.)

579
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,520
I worked here as an art therapist.

580
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,880
Today is my last day.

581
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,200
I stopped by to take my things.

582
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,240
Now that I don't work here anymore,

583
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,920
I'm going to dedicatemy time...

584
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,200
to drivingaround my granddaughter.

585
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,360
Why are you lookingat me like that?

586
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,240
Thank you for your work, Ms. Yoon Ji-a.

587
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,400
Had I known in advance, I would've brought you flowers.

588
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,080
It's a shame we only got to know each other today.

589
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,000
Right?

590
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,120
Why don't I dedicatemy time...

591
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,440
to drivingaround my grandson too?

592
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,760
- Please give it to me. I can carry it. - No.

593
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Please just tell me whichway you're going...

594
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,840
becausethat's where I'm goingtoo.

595
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,360
You don't know which way I'm going.

596
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,200
It doesn'tmatter. That's where I'll go.

597
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,040
I'll follow you carefully,so I don't lose you.

598
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,280
Wait.

599
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,920
Father?

600
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
And who is that?

601
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,120
What do you think? Perfect, right?

602
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,280
You look so cool.

603
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,120
You're the best.

604
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,080
You know that I alwaysdo my best at everything.

605
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,280
How would I have survivedwithoutyou?

606
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,760
Actually,work has been super stressfullately.

607
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,160
Go to work now. You mightbe late.

608
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,680
What time is it? I'm leaving.

609
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,960
- Be careful when you drive. - Okay. Bye, Seo-yoon.

610
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
My goodness.

611
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Jinny.

612
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,440
This is Mom.

613
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,000
Hey! How will she get into her officethen?

614
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,440
Jung-eun!

615
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,480
I'll buy you a meal.

616
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,920
("Let the Natural ComponentsSpeak for Themselves")

617
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yes.

618
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,000
You've met with the CEO of TR?

619
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,200
Yes. Give me the CEO's phone number.

620
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,480
Not the CEO. The CEO's secretary?

621
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,160
But still.If you saw the CEO from afar,

622
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,040
you must know how the CEO looks.

623
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,200
Just tell me...

624
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,400
- A woman? - A woman?

625
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
What else?

626
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,240
In her mid or late 30s?

627
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,880
(Woman, mid to late 30s)

628
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,080
What about her looks?

629
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,320
She's tall? I see.

630
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
(Tall)

631
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,640
What? A woman in her mid to late 30s.

632
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,480
And if she's tall at that too,

633
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,840
she's you.

634
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,880
Darn it.

635
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,640
- That's not enoughto go on with. - Okay.

636
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Thank you.

637
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,200
My goodness.

638
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,360
But we did learn somethingnew.

639
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,520
That the CEO isn't a man.

640
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,240
I actuallyfiguredthat out earlier.

641
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,280
Hold on.

642
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,040
Lee Jung-eun.

643
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,560
You got a hunch, didn't you?

644
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,440
Tell me. What is it?

645
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,160
Aloe.

646
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,640
- Aloe? - Look.

647
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,080
The aloe vera leaf juice.

648
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,040
This one also contains aloe vera leaf juice.

649
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,880
- What about that? - Most productsuse...

650
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,920
aloe veraextract...

651
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,200
becauseit's easierto store...

652
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,560
comparedto the aloe vera leaf juice.

653
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,760
And it can safelymaintainthe effect of the extract.

654
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
But...

655
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,280
the fact that the aloe vera leaf juice is used...

656
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,039
She will need a lot more aloe.

657
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,200
Right. The productsare targetingkids and infants.

658
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,720
And the CEO of TR is knownto be picky.

659
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm sure she'll personallyoverseethe process...

660
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,999
of procuringthe raw ingredients.

661
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,080
Then we can just go and search the aloe farms.

662
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,080
Min-hee.

663
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,360
Search related posts about TR...

664
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,560
and aloe vera leaf juice.

665
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,519
- Could you look through them? - Yes, ma'am.

666
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,640
I knew you could do it.

667
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,160
Then what shouldI do?

668
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,640
Well, actually...

669
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,640
Okay. What is it?

670
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,120
Just tell me what it is. Go on.

671
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,160
You stilllive in Gongnam-dong, right?

672
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,800
Do you think we can declare our residenceunder you?

673
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,600
Did you not get into Myeongseong Elementary?

674
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,320
Yes or no?

675
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,640
There's no way I'd let you do that.

676
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,680
Darn it.

677
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,800
Come on. You couldget us in big trouble.

678
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,280
If this goes south, you couldbe convicted. Got it?

679
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,760
You could serve up to three years in prison...

680
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,720
- or be fined up to 30,000,000 won. - Whatever.

681
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,440
Don't even thinkabout it.

682
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Good grief.

683
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,640
Come on. That pettyguy.

684
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,760
You just wait until we get somethingconcrete.

685
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,120
Hold on.

686
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,999
- I don't think that's it. - Darn it. That's not it.

687
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
What's this?

688
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,680
What is it?

689
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,320
Look over here.

690
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,320
(Sun Aloe)

691
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,519
This logo...

692
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,200
Right here. Check this out.

693
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,160
What is it?

694
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,760
(Woman, mid to late 30s, tall)

695
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,640
She does fit the description.

696
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,280
Where is this place, Min-hee?

697
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,320
(Sun Aloe)

698
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,160
Keep scrolling.

699
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,640
- Get the phonenumber. Right here. - Gosh.

700
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,480
There it is. Bingo. We found it.

701
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,519
My gosh.

702
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,240
Zero, zero, four...

703
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,999
Zero, zero, four, five, two, two, six...

704
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Three...

705
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,999
Yes?

706
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Hello?

707
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,640
"The person you have called cannot answerthe phone."

708
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,400
- Where is this place? - Darn it.

709
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,720
My goodness.You now look properlyready...

710
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,960
to drive around your granddaughter.

711
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,160
Didn't I tell you?

712
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,120
Having good gear to raise and drive childrenis key.

713
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,720
That's it.

714
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,560
Just as expected.You guys are learningquickly...

715
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,880
as you're both well-educated.

716
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,920
How's your daughter-in-law?

717
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:58,800
She can see her doctor as an outpatientnow.

718
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,920
Your daughter-in-law? As in Tommy's mother?

719
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,440
Yes, she hurt her ankle yesterday.

720
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,480
Is that so?

721
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,240
We all said goodbyeat the same time yesterday.

722
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,560
How did you know about that?

723
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,800
That's strange.

724
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,640
Mi-chun. Well, last night...

725
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,560
Why are you so flustered?That's understandable.

726
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,039
My gosh. Where's my head at?

727
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,480
I must pay the tuitiontoday. I forgot.

728
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,760
Oh, my. Time just flies by.

729
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,280
A month has gone by already.

730
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,320
My gosh. This...

731
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,440
Yes. It's the bell tower at ChapelHill.

732
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
I thoughtlong and hard about it...

733
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,760
on my way home last night.

734
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,440
I wanted to give you somethingbetter than flowers.

735
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,840
So I gave it some thought.

736
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,720
I rememberedI had taken a pictureof the tower before.

737
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,080
I hope you like it.

738
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,519
It's the best present.

739
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,160
Oh, my gosh.

740
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,280

924
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,640
about the cosmeticbrand for children?

925
00:48:56,999 --> 00:48:59,320
Yes. That's the one.

926
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,039
My gosh, you shouldhave told me then.

927
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,480
The CEO of that brand came by yesterday.

928
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,560
What?

929
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,400
Sir, why are you onlytellingus that?

930
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,680
Then...

931
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,440
when will she come back?

932
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,560
I wouldn'tknow.

933
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,480
Then can you give me her phonenumber?

934
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,880
Gosh, no.

935
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,600
What if I lose a client?

936
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,039
Besides,I don't have the CEO's phone number.

937
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,480
When she needs to come by,

938
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,440
her secretaryor whoeverthat is...

939
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:28,920
gives me a call instead.

940
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,880
The CEO doesn't personallycall me.

941
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,120
Then the next time you get a call about her visit,

942
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,080
could you pleasecall us too?

943
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,120
- Please. - Fine.

944

Hey, let's go back for now.

946
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,560
Let's come back. We must hurry.

947
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,880
- Yes. Seo-yoon must be waiting.- Yes.

948
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,200
Let's go back.

949
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,880

953
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,480
must truly be our own.

954
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,600
Thank you.

955
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,640
- My gosh. She did well. - Oh, my. She did a great job.

956
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,040
I'm proud of Tae-rin.

961
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,600
Show a good performance, Min-ho.

962
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,040
You're number one among us.

Hi, everyone. My name is Lee Min-ho.

969
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,160
In this grave hour,

970
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,120
perhaps the most fateful in our history,

971
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:23,080
I send to every household of my people,

972
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,960
which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force,

973
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,080
against the sovereignty...

974
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,840
and independence of other states.

975
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,520
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it,

976
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,120
- ready for whatever service... - She's not here yet.

977
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,400
I hope Mom definitely watches this.

978
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,000
Then, with God's help, we shall prevail.

979
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,800

980
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,240

Thank you, Father.

984
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,760
No, I didn't do anything.

985
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,000
Min-ho worked hard to practice this.

986
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,080

Hi, everyone.

My name is Hong Seo-yoon.

1001
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,840
The topic of my speech is "My Best Friend."

1002
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,880
- What did she say? - Having a friend is so much fun.

1003
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,120
What happened?

1004
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,640
Did you change to the free topic?

1005
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,840
We live together.

1006
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,200
- Why? - And sometimes...

What are you going to do?

1008
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,600
Watch how Seo-yoon does first and talk again.

But they're best friends.

Don't you think Seo-yoon is doing a very good job?

1019
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,760
I also have a best friend.

1020
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,160
- I don't think so. She's ruined. - My best friend...

1021
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,080
- is a doctor... - She can't win an award with this.

1023
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,120
But she left the hospital because of me.

1024

I feel terrible she had to leave her career.

1025
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,400
But it turned out for the better...

1026
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,360
because I can meet my friend every day.

There she is.

my best friend is Yoon Ji-a.

1033

Thank you!

00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,960
Now all the contestants' presentations are over.

1038
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,360
We'll take a 15-minute break...

1039
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,360
and announce the award winners.

1040
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,400
Why?

1041
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,000
Why on earth did you change the script?

1042
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,760
You should have asked me.

1043
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,440
If I had, would you have allowed it?

1044
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,840
Didn't you see how Seo-yoon did it?

1045
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,280
She was good.

1046
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,800
She was good.

1047
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,440
But a free topic speech is scored low.

1048
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,880
I did my research.

1049
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,240
I couldn't find anyone saying...

1050
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,720
a free topic speech is scored low.

1051
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,600
You'd know if you did your research.

1052
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,720
A free topic speech is rarely awarded.

1053
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,200
There was only one winner two years ago.

1054
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,560
Is winning an award that important?

1055
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,560
It's enough if Seo-yoon speaks...

1056
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,120
what she wants to speak with fun.

1057
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,400
I told you.

1058
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,200
She can join Class A when she wins an award.

1059
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,760
That's why she entered this contest.

1060
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,240
Mom!

1061
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,960
- Seo-yoon, you were great! - Seo-yoon.

1062
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,040
You did a wonderful job.

1063
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,560

00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,800

1065
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,960

- to Min Tae-rin! - Goodness.

1067
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,560
- What is it? - What? Me?

1068
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,000
Did he call Tae-rin?

1069
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,120
Oh, my. Tae-rin, what's happening?

1070
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,040
Goodness.

1071
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,640
Oh, my goodness!

1072
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,520
Go out quickly!

1073
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,640
Go now. What's happening?

to Lee Min-ho.

1083
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,760
Well done, Min-ho.

1084
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,960
Lee Min-ho?

1085
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,680
Mom?

1086
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,280
Stay here. You don't need to go there.

1087
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,800
Is Lee Min-ho here?

1088
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,880
He's here.

1089
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,560
Stand up, Min-ho. Let's go home.

1090
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,680
He won an award, though.

1091
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm sorry, Father.

1092
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,040
Come here.

1093
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,120
Let's go.

1094
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,120
What's going on?

1095
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,840
What's with that woman? She's strange.

1096
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,120
- That's so rude. - What's the matter?

1097
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,040
All right.

1098
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,240
Lastly, the Grand Award.

1099

Oh, my.

00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,120
Mom, thank you.

1108
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,440
You lost your temper only a moment ago.

1109
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,480
Forget what I said.

1110
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,440
Oh, my. Take her picture now.

I'm sorry, Mom.

00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,840
I'll do better next time.

Are you going to accept them in Class A?

01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,560
Have you gone mad?

1128
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,360
I'm scared.

1129
