(Final Episode)

12
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:44,223
No.

13
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,223
Let's talk outside.

14
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:50,223
Why would I?

15
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:51,703
What is this?

16
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:55,863
- What is it?
- What is it?

17
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:57,303
Move.

18
00:00:57,383 --> 00:00:59,063
I think that's a seven.

19
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:04,503
My goodness.

20
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:07,543
Isn't that the number seven?

21
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,102
What are you talking about?

22
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:10,503
Are you crazy?

23
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:12,503
Then what is this?

24
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:14,903
Why did you have...

25
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:17,223
two balls in your bag?

26
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,623
Do I have to explain that to you?

27
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:21,223
Of course.

28
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:26,183
What are you doing?

29
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:29,263
Director, listen.

30
00:01:31,102 --> 00:01:32,143
Watch this.

31
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,863
Director. Don't mind it.

32
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,703
There was a misunderstanding.

33
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,343
- I'll take...
- A misunderstanding?

34
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:41,023
You think this is a misunderstanding?

35
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:42,103
You two.

36
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:45,783
Let's have a moment together.

37
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:56,879
That looks like the parking lot...

38
00:01:56,903 --> 00:01:58,223
at Myeongseong Elementary School.

39
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:00,783
What happened?

40
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:02,863
It's not a big deal.

41
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:04,223
I can explain it to you.

42
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:05,503
Is that how you want to play?

43
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:07,863
You think that's the only evidence?

44
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:09,983
Will you stop, both of you?

45
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:13,263
This isn't Myeongseong.

46
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:14,783
This is Big Parker.

47
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,662
What happened at
Myeongseong Elementary School...

48
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:19,903
stays between you.

49
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:22,422
Sure.

50
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:25,119
But what if the admissions corruption...

51
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:27,023
at Myeongseong Elementary
is proven to be true?

52
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,303
What are you going to do then?

53
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:31,023
If that's true,

54
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,543
you'll have to leave this academy.

55
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:36,343
Ma'am.

56
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:38,463
How could you...

57
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:40,303
For Big Parker's dignity,

58
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:41,743
there is no option.

59
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:44,303
- I will discharge him.
- No.

60
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:47,303
Nothing's been revealed yet.

61
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:49,743
I'm busy. I have to go.

62
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:55,183
Wait.

63
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:56,982
What do you want?

64
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,063
Please let it slide.

65
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:03,143
If Claire moves to Class A,

66
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:04,543
I'll take care of everything.

67
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,743
You know who I am.

68
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,423
Class A's curriculum,

69
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:11,463
and every class teacher's information.

70
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:14,783
I'll give you everything you want.

71
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:16,983
It's game over for you.

72
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:27,743
(Myeongseong Elementary
Parent Leader Seo Ji-hui's Mom)

73
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:33,783

Darn it!

77
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:09,263
<i>I saw it that day.</i>

78
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:27,863
(Myeongseong Elementary School)

79
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:28,943
Number 17.

80
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,062
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:48,623
I'll remove the dean immediately.

82
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:52,143
What are you doing?
Apologize to her already.

83
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:53,303
Yes.

84
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:55,863
I'm sorry, ma'am.

85
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,623
I'll cancel Lee Min-ho's admission...

86
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:01,783
and accept Hong Seo-yoon.

87
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,023
But sir...

88
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,863
Then now she's the only one left.

89
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,983
I'm heading to the police station now.

90
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,143
Ma'am, wait.

91
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:14,622
Seo-yoon will be attending this school.

92
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:16,079
If the school appears in the media...

93
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:17,463
for a disgraceful event like this,

94
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:20,263
it won't do any good for either of us.

95
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:23,823
That's right. If this gets out,

96
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:26,062
it'll be the end of Myeongseong.

97
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,863
Right, Ms. Lee?

98
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:40,343
Ms. Lee.

99
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:44,503
It's all my fault.

100
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:50,783
Please...

101
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:54,343
help Min-ho.

102
00:05:56,143 --> 00:05:57,823
He didn't do anything wrong.

103
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:02,983
If this gets out...

104
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,103
because of me...

105
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:12,062
Can you at least help
him go to another school?

106
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:14,103
Please.

107
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:16,463
I beg you.

108
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:19,383
Please.

109
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:30,343
Okay.

110
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:33,823
But...

111
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:36,423
make sure this doesn't cause any harm...

112
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:39,023
to Ms. Yu So-yeon.

113
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:40,943
Of course.

114
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:48,743
Why can't he go there?

115
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,463
What happened to his school isn't enough,

116
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:52,863
now he has to find a new academy?

117
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:56,503
Gossip won't last any
longer than three months.

118
00:06:58,463 --> 00:06:59,783
Aren't you worried about Min-ho?

119
00:07:00,263 --> 00:07:01,783
That's why I'm saying this.

120
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,103
No academy is better than
Big Parker in Daechi-dong.

121
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:07,783
Still.

122
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:09,823
This is your fault.

123
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:11,343
Min-ho didn't do anything wrong.

124
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:13,583
Let him keep going there.

(Lee Jung-eun)

126
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,743
Seo-yoon.

127
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:39,903
What?

128
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:44,463
Can you give Mommy a hug?

129
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:54,783
Only for a second.

130
00:07:56,023 --> 00:07:58,183
I still appreciate it.

131
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,623
You're all I have.

132
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:09,943
Are you patting me?

133
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,343
I thought you were hugging
me only for a second.

134
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:16,903
I'm only doing it...

135
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:18,623
because I always did it.

136
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:20,743
Then...

137
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:23,503
can you stroke me too?

138
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:30,263
Are you happy now?

139
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:36,383
Just a little bit more.

140
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:40,143
That's too long.

141
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:50,023
Grandma did it for me too.

142
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:55,663
Did she?

143
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:57,462
Yes.

144
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,783
So let's tell her to come now.

145
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:04,023
So she can pat...

146
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,623
and stroke...

147
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:09,183
Seo-yoon.

148
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,183
Yes?

149
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:14,623
She doesn't need to come anymore.

150
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:16,783
You have Mommy.

151
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:19,263
From now on,

152
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,703
I'll stay next to you.

153
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,103
But you have to go to work.

154
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,383
Not anymore.

155
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,863
Why not?

156
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:35,143
From now on,

157
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:37,342
I'll look after you.

158
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:41,263
I'll drop you off at preschool every day,

159
00:09:42,423 --> 00:09:45,063
and I'll take you to the academy too.

160
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:48,943
I missed out on so much of your life...

161
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:51,783
because I was busy with work.

162
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,543
Now, I'll be there for everything.

163
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,623
You're going to be late. Let's go.

(Letter of Resignation)

00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:08,063

167
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:15,063
I know it's tough, but this is wrong.

168
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,503
You know...

169
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:20,303
this is when everyone quits.

170
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:22,342
What?

171
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:25,023
I have to get her ready
for elementary school,

172
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:27,903
and she has to go to more academies.

173
00:10:28,383 --> 00:10:30,423
What about your career?

174
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:34,143
You loved working as a marketer.

175
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:36,423
You felt like dying...

176
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:37,719
when you had to skip meals and run around.

177
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:39,223
Then when a new product was released,

178
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:41,263
you were happy as if
it were your own child.

179
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:42,943
Yes.

180
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:44,943
But I think it ends here.

181
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,143

182
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:48,783
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:50,623
I'll get going now.

184
00:10:57,903 --> 00:10:58,983
Ms. Lee.

185
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:08,342
I'm sorry, Ms. Han.

186
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:29,743
Why aren't you coming home, Dad?

187
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:32,543
Right?

188
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:35,063
You want me at home, right?

189
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:36,503
Yes.

190
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,103
Okay.

191
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,023
I'll stay next to you...

192
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:42,783
no matter what.

193
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,903
I was about to leave.

194
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:57,543
But I couldn't just ignore...

195
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:59,103
the pile of dirty dishes.

196
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,783
- I was...
- Okay. Leave.

197
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,943
What about dinner? Did you have dinner?

198
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:06,863
I only asked you to watch Seo-yoon.

199
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:08,863
I didn't ask you to worry about me.

200
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:10,503
Leave.

201
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:12,423
Okay. I'll leave.

202
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:13,943
What about Mother?

203
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:16,582
It's none of your business.

204
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:20,303
I said I'll leave,

205
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:23,063
but you should still pay her a visit.

206
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:24,703
I won't see her anymore.

207
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:26,303
What?

208
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:27,823
What are you talking about?

209
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:29,063
You won't see your mom?

210
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:33,823
Why do you care?

211
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:35,903
It's between me and my mom.

212
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:54,623
When will we go there?

213
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,223
Eventually.

214
00:13:00,943 --> 00:13:03,303
Seo-yoon, you're the best!

215
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,063
My darling.

216
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:06,863
Such a cutie!

217
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,663
Dad, put me down now.

218
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:09,943
I feel dizzy.

219
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,503
No, I won't.

220
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:45,023
Claire's mom. Hi. This way.

221
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:48,983
This way.

222
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:51,303
Here?

223
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:53,463
Of course.

224
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:54,583
Sit down.

225
00:13:59,143 --> 00:14:01,223
You look like a different person today.

226
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:03,743
Congratulations.

227
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,983
Claire's now in Class A.

228
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:10,343
This is the schedule
Class A mothers shared.

229
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:11,463
Take a look.

230
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:14,303
(December Reading List)

231
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,423
(Essay Program)

232
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:20,983
(Language, math, science road map)

233
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,439
(Hockey, figure skating,
jump rope schedule)

234
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,743
Have your children...

235
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:27,743
been doing all this?

236
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:28,903
Of course.

237
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:30,623
Claire's now in Class A.

238
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:32,143
She should too.

239
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:34,103
Of course.

240
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:36,383
Tell me anything,

241
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:38,263
and I'll help you.

242
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,503
She's right. You should get used to it.

243
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:43,103
Yes.

244
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:49,103
- She's here.
- My goodness.

245
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,583
How shameless.

246
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,383
What an eyesore.

247
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:56,863
How can she show up here?

248
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:58,703
How funny. I knew she wasn't ordinary.

249
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:01,103
I can't believe it.

250
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:07,703
Anyway, how did it go with Myeongseong?

251
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:11,223
It all worked out.

252
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,999
Claire will be going to that school.

253
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:15,423
That's great.

254
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:17,583
Then...

255
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,703
what about Tommy?

256
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,863
Tommy is...

257
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:27,463
Oh, no.

258
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,463
Where will Tommy go then?

259
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:31,743
Will she pay them off?

260
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,143
Or threaten them?

261
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,783
That's her specialty...

262
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:37,983
How scary.

263
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,743
Why are you glaring at me like that?

264
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:41,663
I'm only asking out of curiosity.

265
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,903
I can't even ask a question?

266
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:45,943
Why do you ask?

267
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:47,543
Rumors spread fast in this town.

268
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:51,383
We'll soon hear about it.

269
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,383
Today's essay theme is...

270
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:15,703
violent video games should be banned.

271
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:18,303
Write your opinion in
the form of an essay...

272
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:22,183
with an introduction, body, and conclusion.

273
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,303
Now begin.

274
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:59,143
I expected Class A to be so much fun,

275
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,103
but it's boring.

276
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:03,023
Seo-yoon, what about you?

277
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:04,743
I find it boring too.

278
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,943
Do you want to visit our grandmas?

279
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:08,023
Yes.

280
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:09,503
What do you want to eat?

281
00:17:11,703 --> 00:17:13,863
- Mom.
- Hello.

282
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:16,382
Tae-rin.

283
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:18,423
In Class A, you can't play...

284
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,343
in the lounge during the break.

285
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:22,583
- Why not?
- Look at the other kids.

286
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:27,023
You have to prepare for your next class.

287
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:30,943
Grandma said...

288
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:33,823
I should rest during the break.

289
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,343
As much as I can.

290
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,943
At the time, you were in Class B.

291
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:40,543
Now, you're in Class A.

292
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:43,023
Then I want to go back to Class B.

293
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,063
Why would you?

294
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:49,262
Don't you know how hard
it was to get you here?

295
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,783
Why would you go back to Class B?

296
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,023
Tae-rin.

297
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:53,623
Grandma.

298
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:55,543
Aren't you on break?

299
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:56,663
Why didn't you come?

300
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,783
Because...

301
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:00,663
Hello. I'm Claire's mom.

302
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:02,902
Yes, I know.

303
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:05,063
They're now in Class A.

304
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,358
They can't play during break time...

305
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:08,623
like they did in Class B.

306
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,743
If you say so.

307
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:15,623
Go back in.

308
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,463
But...

309
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,823
She reminds me of Tommy's mom.

310
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:25,623
I was thinking the same.

311
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,823
Anyway, Grandma. It
hasn't even been a day yet,

312
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:30,783
but I don't like it.

313
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:32,503
I agree with you.

314
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:34,343
Hurry up and clean Table 10.

315
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:35,343
Yes.

316
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:36,943
Two ox bone soups for Table Six.

317
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:38,023
Yes.

318
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:40,103
Hello. This way.

319
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:41,623
Here you are.

320
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:43,543
Enjoy.

321
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,023
- Hello.
- Thank you.

322
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:46,583
Excuse me. Soju, please.

323
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:48,063
Soju. The same one?

324
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:49,382
- Yes.
- Jae-man.

325
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,719
- Yes.
- They're ready to order.

326
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,303
- Okay.
- Two ox bone soups.

327
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:56,183
Oh, no.

328
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,863
Mom, I'll be right back.

329
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:01,303
Where are you going? We're busy.

330
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,823
Where else would I go?

331
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:04,223
I'm going to cook for Jung-eun.

332
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:06,823
That little...

333
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:10,263
Hey.

334
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:11,983
You're home. I bet you're exhausted.

335
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:16,343
What on earth are you doing?

336
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:18,623
I thought I told you to get lost.

337
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:20,223
Got it.

338
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:22,343
I was only going to make dinner.

339
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:24,279
Keep this up, and I'll
change the lock passcode.

340
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:25,503
I heard you the first time.

341
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,183
All I made was this hot
and spicy kimchi stew...

342
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:30,142
and Seo-yoon's favorite rolled eggs...

343
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:31,382
with dried laver and ham.

344
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:35,263
Wash up already.

345
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:36,663
Seo-yoon, wash your hands.

346
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:39,943
What is it?

347
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:42,902
What?

348
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:49,783
Dad,

349
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:53,943
Mom deleted Grandma's number.

350
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:57,063
She did that?

351
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,863
I hate her.

352
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:01,863
Got it, Seo-yoon.

353
00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:04,343
I'll save her number again.

354
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:05,503
Are we good, then?

355
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:08,783
Can't you bring Jinny over?

356
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:11,902
I miss her.

357
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:15,902
Seo-yoon, why are you crying?

358
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,623
Hold on a second.

359
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:23,103
Let me see.

360
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,103
Here. That's your grandma's number.

361
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:31,142
Seo-yoon,

362
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:33,623
don't hate your mom too much.

363
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:35,623
She has it rough, that's all.

364
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:37,863
Can I call her?

365
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,783
Of course, you can.

366
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:42,463
And I'll talk to your mom...

367
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,463
about this ordeal with your grandma.

368
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:46,783
Thanks.

369
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:48,943
Seo-yoon, where are you?

370
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:50,902
Let's go.

371
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:52,983
Wipe your tears.

372
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:54,063
Okay.

373
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:59,543
(Grandma)

374
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,463
(Princess Seo-yoon)

375
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:18,583
(Princess Seo-yoon)

376
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:24,583
(Missed calls: Princess Seo-yoon)

377
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,103
(Power off)

378
00:21:34,463 --> 00:21:35,863
<i>The phone has been turned off,</i>

379
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:37,503
<i>and you'll be redirected to voicemail.</i>

380
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:39,343
<i>Record your message after the beep.</i>

381
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:43,543
You said you were like the genie...

382
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:46,583
and that you'd come...

383
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:48,142
whenever I called.

384
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:51,783
Why won't you pick up?

385
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:55,623
You're mean, Grandma.

386
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:07,142
Pinkru.

387
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,743
I miss Grandma.

388
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:14,783
Can't you let me see her?

389
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:16,823
Please.

390
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:19,303
It's my wish.

391
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:35,623
(Calls)

392
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:38,303
(Mom)

393
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:15,983
I'm afraid this was in vain.

394
00:23:16,623 --> 00:23:17,943
I have nothing to say.

395
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:20,063
Why haven't you been answering the phone?

396
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:24,823
I told you not to contact me.

397
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:28,503
What are you doing here all alone?

398
00:23:32,063 --> 00:23:33,382
Come with me.

399
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:37,623
Let me say this once again.

400
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:38,983
- I...
- You...

401
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:42,823
are someone I cherish.

402
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:45,943
Yoon Ji-a.

403
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:48,382
That's the person you are.

404
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:54,783
You said you wanted to go to Chapel Hill.

405
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,902
I can't go. You should head back.

406
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:06,063
I'll send you the departure date.

407
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:11,743
And I'll...

408
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:13,983
be waiting.

409
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,423
Goodness, I almost died waiting for you.

410
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:39,343
Where were you and what took you so long?

411
00:24:54,223 --> 00:24:57,143
Why did you turn your phone off?

412
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,183
Life has been too hectic for me.

413
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:03,103
This is me looking back on myself.

414
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,263
How's Seo-yoon?

415
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:09,183
She's doing well, of course.

416
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:10,319
Your daughter and son-in-law...

417
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,279
have been taking her to
the academy and then some.

418
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,383
Seo-yoon's doing well too.

419
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:16,303
I'm glad to hear that.

420
00:25:17,303 --> 00:25:18,183
Are you really going...

421
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:19,559
to let Professor Lee walk off like that?

422
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,343
It's hard to know when he'll be back.

423
00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:22,543
I have my kids.

424
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:23,863
I can't possibly leave them.

425
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:25,303
What about them?

426
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:26,999
They're busy with their own lives,

427
00:25:27,023 --> 00:25:28,079
so why should we constantly...

428
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:29,143
be at their beck and call?

429
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:30,343
Go with him.

430
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:44,263
Mom, I don't want to go in.

431
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:45,743
I don't want to go to class.

432
00:25:46,303 --> 00:25:48,143
What do you mean, you won't go to class?

433
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,543
The kids make fun of me...

434
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:53,103
for getting kicked out of Myeongseong.

435
00:25:53,623 --> 00:25:54,623
Also,

436
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,383
they call you a liar.

437
00:25:58,263 --> 00:25:59,503
Who said that?

438
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:03,023
Jason and Annie.

439
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,983
I don't want to take classes here.

440
00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:09,903
Min-ho.

441
00:26:10,623 --> 00:26:12,263
Just focus on your classes.

442
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:15,623
You're to get a perfect
score on the term test today.

443
00:26:16,463 --> 00:26:17,503
Got it?

444
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:28,463
Seo-yoon, why aren't you going in?

445
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:30,623
Classes aren't fun.

446
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,703
Why do you keep doing this?

447
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:37,503
It only upsets me.

448
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:41,463
Head inside. Go on.

449
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:44,383
Go.

450
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:51,343
Seo-yoon.

451
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,183
I'll get going.

452
00:27:02,903 --> 00:27:04,863
- Claire's mom, over here.
- Hey.

453
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:08,623
- Hello.
- Hello.

454
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:12,063
Would you like some coffee?

455
00:27:12,143 --> 00:27:13,303
No, I'm good.

456
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:16,063
Sorry about this.

457
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:19,823
Hey, Mr. Kim.

458
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,623
Jung-eun, where are you?

459
00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:23,863
<i>Where else? I'm at Seo-yoon's academy.</i>

460
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:24,863
Get to the office.

461
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,023
TR's CEO is asking for you.

462
00:27:27,343 --> 00:27:29,303
TR's CEO showed up?

463
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,023
Don't ask me.

464
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:34,143
<i>Director Yoon told me a second ago.</i>

465
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:35,623
<i>Anyway, just get here.</i>

466
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:37,383
Sir,

467
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:40,303
I quit, remember?

468
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:41,743
<i>I'm no longer...</i>

469
00:27:41,823 --> 00:27:43,623
It hasn't been processed yet!

470
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,463
You're still on this team, so get here.

471
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:49,183
I'm sorry, sir.

472
00:27:49,823 --> 00:27:51,103
<i>Are you kidding me, Jung-eun?</i>

473
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:56,103
Unbelievable.

474
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,103
Claire, what are you doing?

475
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:13,903
You should be writing.

476
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:18,623
Twenty minutes remaining.

477
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,183
Jung-eun, my gosh!

478
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:27,943
I knew you'd come. I'm glad you're here.

479
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:30,743
Why does the CEO of TR want to see me?

480
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:32,263
Exactly.

481
00:28:32,783 --> 00:28:34,823
Why is TR's CEO asking for you?

482
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:36,903
You must've flirted a lot...

483
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:39,103
when you were only
told to set up a meeting.

484
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:40,543
Why you...

485
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,263
Everyone. Come on in.

486
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:48,023
Meet the CEO of TR.

487
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:03,143
It's good to see you in this setting.

488
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:06,023
I'm Oh Hye-won.

489
00:29:07,303 --> 00:29:09,583
- Tae-rin's mom?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

490
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:11,823
I'm Deputy Director Ha Sa-na...

491
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:13,263
of Aaes' Strategic Planning Team.

492
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:17,583
It's not exactly our first encounter.

493
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:19,143
Sorry?

494
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:20,543
Ms. Lee, don't just stand there.

495
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:25,103
Right, I'm Lee Jung-eun.

496
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:28,343
Now, let's all take our seats.

497
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:29,943
Director, I'm sorry but...

498
00:29:30,023 --> 00:29:32,223
Goodness. Ms. Lee, I'm sorry.

499
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,183
I called her here when she's on leave.

500
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:35,663
Mr. Kim, please.

501
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:38,623
That was neglectful on my part.

502
00:29:39,063 --> 00:29:40,463
I put you out...

503
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:42,023
unaware of her situation.

504
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:45,223
- I apologize.
- But...

505
00:29:45,503 --> 00:29:47,583
Actually, I'm in charge of the TR project,

506
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,103
so you can talk to me.

507
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:50,903
I'm not sure about that.

508
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,063
I'd rather work with those
who are sharp and clever.

509
00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:57,023
Is that so?

510
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:58,279
Then we'll put someone else in charge.

511
00:29:58,303 --> 00:29:59,543
Ms. Lee will take over.

512
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:01,943
The company...

513
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:05,183
has high expectations
about the project with TR.

514
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:06,743
Right.

515
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:09,743
The decision didn't come easy for us at TR.

516
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:13,103
However, we put our trust in the ability...

517
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:14,703
of Ms. Lee.

518
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:16,303
(Collaboration Proposal)

519
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:19,719
I'm Senior Manager Lee Jung-eun...

520
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:20,983
from Aaes' Marketing Team.

521
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:23,623
I have a document for the CEO of TR.

522
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:26,823
Pardon?

523
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:28,343
Can you...

524
00:30:28,823 --> 00:30:30,423
please pass it on?

525
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:34,743
Wait.

526
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:36,743
Excuse me.

527
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:44,303
Let's work on this together,

528
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,103
Ms. Lee.

529
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,583
I'm truly sorry,

530
00:30:53,383 --> 00:30:55,623
but I can't work on this project.

531
00:30:57,783 --> 00:31:00,423
I only came here today to tell you this.

532
00:31:01,263 --> 00:31:02,623
Mr. Kim, really?

533
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:04,783
Jung-eun, come on.

534
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:07,023
Ms. Lee!

535
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:08,823
<i>You quit?</i>

536
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,223
But we at TR...

537
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:14,863
made this decision
because of our faith in you.

538
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:17,943
Who will spearhead
this project without you?

539
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:19,183
Even without me,

540
00:31:19,263 --> 00:31:21,463
the project will run smoothly.

541
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:23,583
By the way,

542
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:26,823
has Tae-rin easily adjusted to Class A?

543
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:30,343
Tae-rin quit the academy.

544
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:32,759
Sorry?
What can I do when it's not what she wants?

545
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:35,063
What can I do when it's not what she wants?

546
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:40,143
You let Tae-rin drop out
of Class A at Big Parker?

547
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:42,783
Seo-yoon must enjoy being in Class A.

548
00:31:44,383 --> 00:31:45,943
Yes, of course.

549
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:47,263
It wasn't easy getting in.

550
00:31:48,663 --> 00:31:51,023
Seo-yoon has a test today,

551
00:31:51,103 --> 00:31:52,263
so I'll get going.

552
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:55,743
Are you really going to give this up?

553
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:58,903
Can you honestly say you won't regret it?

554
00:32:04,863 --> 00:32:07,303
I'd rather do right as Seo-yoon's mom now.

555
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:20,783
Mom, you must've missed me a whole lot.

556
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:23,183
This has never happened before.

557
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:24,343
- Tae-rin.
- Yes?

558
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:26,303
Do you want me to take
you to your classes...

559
00:32:26,383 --> 00:32:27,463
like the other moms?

560
00:32:27,543 --> 00:32:28,663
I'm fine.

561
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:29,983
I'm fine as well.

562
00:32:30,063 --> 00:32:32,703
Be the CEO that you are.

563
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:34,543
We're doing fine by ourselves.

564
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:35,943
- Right.
- Right.

565
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:39,559
Even if you get upset with me...

566
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,743
about being the only one...

567
00:32:40,823 --> 00:32:42,279
whose mom didn't drive her to classes,

568
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:43,423
I won't bat an eye.

569
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,143
Sure. I'm good.

570
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:47,423
If I could choose, I'd
choose Grandma any day.

571
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:48,503
Nice.

572
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:50,063
See?

573
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:52,143
Don't think about getting between us...

574
00:32:52,223 --> 00:32:53,903
and do your job.

575
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,263
Got it.

576
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,583
I'll get back to the office, then.

577
00:32:57,663 --> 00:32:59,463
Sure. See you later at home.

578
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:02,943
- Earn a lot!
- Earn a lot!

579
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:07,663
Why don't we go to a dry sauna...

580
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:08,823
and scorch our backs?

581
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,103
We had something cold,

582
00:33:10,183 --> 00:33:11,703
so scorching our backs sounds good.

583
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,143
Eat up, then.

584
00:33:33,823 --> 00:33:34,903
I'm sorry.

585
00:33:35,983 --> 00:33:37,863
I don't think I can go with you.

586
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:41,303
I'm...

587
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,903
going back to the hospital.

588
00:33:44,943 --> 00:33:48,503
I'm the happiest when I work there.

589
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:54,783
I respect...

590
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,743
your decision.

591
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:01,663
When...

592
00:34:02,503 --> 00:34:03,583
will you be back?

593
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:05,983
I'm not sure.

594
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:08,983
I'll know once I get there.

595
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:11,183
I'll wait.

596
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:16,623
I'll wait for you here,

597
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:19,423
so travel safely.

598
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:30,863
I'll do my best to return
as soon as possible.

599
00:35:01,663 --> 00:35:02,783
(Friday, December 27)

600
00:35:03,863 --> 00:35:05,223
(Princess Seo-yoon)

601
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:09,543
<i>Grandma, where are you?</i>

602
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:11,982
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

603
00:35:13,063 --> 00:35:14,383
<i>Please help me.</i>

604
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:19,022
<i>Jinny, where are you?</i>

605
00:35:19,543 --> 00:35:20,743
<i>Come quickly.</i>

606
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:22,783
Big Parker in Daechi-dong, please.

607
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:25,103
<i>Grandma, I miss you.</i>

608
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:34,743
Where's my pencil?

609
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:37,783
Tommy.

610
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,303
You took my pencil again, didn't you?

611
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:42,543
- No.
- As if.

612
00:35:42,903 --> 00:35:46,383
It was here a second
ago, but now it's gone.

613
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:49,943
- Don't!
- Move.

614
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:57,543
You... I'm telling my mom.

615
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,863
Mom!

616
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:17,823
Nicely done.

617
00:36:17,903 --> 00:36:19,103
Mom!

618
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:20,823
Hey, my son.

619
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:22,823
What's wrong?

620
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:27,823
Did something happen?

621
00:36:28,303 --> 00:36:31,943
Tommy stole my pencil again.

622
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:33,863
What?

623
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:36,022
What do you mean, Jason?

624
00:36:36,823 --> 00:36:38,279
How many times must I say you saw wrong?

625
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:39,303
He saw wrong?

626
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:41,063
As if.

627
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:43,423
Jason, you wait here.

628
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:45,223
I'll check in person.

629
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:48,303
Stop right there.

630
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:50,823
Stop!

631
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:55,463
Tommy.

632
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:57,502
Tommy?

633
00:36:58,103 --> 00:36:59,423
Where's your pencil case?

634
00:36:59,502 --> 00:37:00,543
Is it here?

635
00:37:00,623 --> 00:37:01,823
Let me see it.

636
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:05,623
- Is this it?
- That's my pencil case!

637
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:07,903
- Let go.
- Ma'am.

638
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:09,823
Why are you doing this to Min-ho?

639
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:11,583
Claire, let go of my hand.

640
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,022
Why are you acting up today?

641
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:16,982
What is the meaning of this?

642
00:37:18,022 --> 00:37:19,143
Did you push me?

643
00:37:19,223 --> 00:37:20,343
I asked what you were doing!

644
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:21,543
Yell louder, why don't you?

645
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:22,623
Mom.

646
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:23,823
- What is it?
- Stop this.

647
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:25,463
- You little thief.
- Hurry.

648
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:28,063
I take it you must be scared.

649
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:30,383
The mom steals someone else's spot...

650
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:32,263
while the son steals from a classmate.

651
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:35,063
- How is that normal?
- What?

652
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:37,823
Why? Am I wrong?

653
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,183
We can check.

654
00:37:44,183 --> 00:37:46,623
See? Jason was right.

655
00:37:46,703 --> 00:37:47,783
Just in case,

656
00:37:47,863 --> 00:37:49,903
I had his name engraved on it.

657
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,703
Are you still saying Jason saw wrong?

658
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:54,303
Where's your proof?

659
00:37:54,743 --> 00:37:56,583
How can you be sure
Tommy put that in there?

660
00:37:56,903 --> 00:37:58,943
Wasn't this found in Tommy's pencil case?

661
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:00,223
Mom.

662
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:01,903
Something's wrong with Min-ho.

663
00:38:01,982 --> 00:38:03,703
Call Grandma.

664
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:05,303
- Look at this.
- No way.

665
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,383
Why? Yap again, why don't you?

666
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:09,943
Say that my Jason isn't smart enough.

667
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:12,223
This time around, I won't let it slide!

668
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:13,863
Mom, hurry.

669
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:15,982
Call Grandma.

670
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,519
Do you think Big Parker
could have gotten this far...

671
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:19,143
- without Tommy?
- I'll go check on him.

672
00:38:19,183 --> 00:38:21,463
You used to cling onto us like a leech.

673
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:23,063
But what did you just call us?

674
00:38:23,143 --> 00:38:24,143
- A leech?
- Tommy.

675
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,719
- Are you all right?
- I've been so patient with you!

676
00:38:26,743 --> 00:38:27,783
Tommy's mom.

677
00:38:29,022 --> 00:38:30,583
- Tommy, are you okay?
- Min-ho.

678
00:38:31,703 --> 00:38:33,543
- What's wrong, Min-ho?
- Sit down.

679
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:35,943
- Min-ho.
- Oh, no.

680
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,583
Min-ho. Are you all right?

681
00:38:37,903 --> 00:38:39,623
Has this happened to Tommy before?

682
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,423
No, this has never happened before.

683
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:42,982
Mom.

684
00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:45,903
I feel sick.

685
00:38:48,183 --> 00:38:49,423
Min-ho, what's wrong?

686
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:50,783
Min-ho, wake up.

687
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:55,303
<i>Grandma.</i>

688
00:38:57,623 --> 00:38:58,623
Seo-yoon.

689
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:00,359
What's wrong? Did something happen?

690
00:39:00,383 --> 00:39:01,559
- Wake up, Min-ho.
- Please help us,

691
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:02,583
- Grandma.
- Min-ho!

692
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:04,703
- We must take him to the hospital.
- Min-ho is sick.

693
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,743
- Come to the academy now.
- No!

694
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:08,903
Min-ho?

695
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:11,982
My gosh. I'm already on my way.

696
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:14,223
Seo-yoon. Hang in there a bit.

697
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:16,502
Min-ho.

698
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:18,982
Wake up, Min-ho.

699
00:39:19,903 --> 00:39:20,903
My gosh.

700
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:29,703
Grandma has to be here.

701
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:31,502
Grandma should be here.

702
00:39:32,463 --> 00:39:34,543
How could she come here?

703
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:36,823
He went to the hospital.
So he should be okay.

704
00:39:36,903 --> 00:39:37,943
No.

705
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:40,823
Grandma has to help him.

706
00:39:48,943 --> 00:39:49,943
Min-ho.

707
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:51,943
Wake up.

708
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,223
Min-ho.

709
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:56,623
Min-ho. What's wrong?

710
00:39:56,743 --> 00:39:58,783
Min-ho.

711
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:00,943
Yes. You're tired.

712
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:02,743
You're exhausted. It's okay, Min-ho.

713
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:04,623
It's okay, Min-ho.

714
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,303
You're going to be okay, Min-ho.

715
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:08,263
Min-ho. Look at me.

716
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:09,543
Min-ho.

717
00:40:09,982 --> 00:40:11,703
Do you remember how you, Seo-yoon,

718
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:13,502
and Tae-rin went on a trip together?

719
00:40:18,423 --> 00:40:20,903
<i>We played with soap bubbles that day.</i>

720
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:22,663
<i>We rode the swing.</i>

721
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:24,583
<i>We also played rock-paper-scissors.</i>

722
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:27,982
<i>We also fed alpacas, right?</i>

723
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:29,343
Right?

724
00:40:31,143 --> 00:40:33,303
Min-ho. Why don't we try this together?

725
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:34,423
Breathe.

726
00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:37,823
Try it.

727
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:39,543
Excellent. One more time.

728
00:40:40,743 --> 00:40:42,543
Great job.

729
00:40:43,263 --> 00:40:45,343
Excellent job, Min-ho.

730
00:40:47,303 --> 00:40:49,063
Well done, Min-ho.

731
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,463
Stars...

732
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:54,823
Oh, right.

733
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:57,263
Let's go and look at
the stars with Seo-yoon.

734
00:40:57,903 --> 00:41:01,103
I don't want to study at the academy.

735
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:04,502
You got it.

736
00:41:05,623 --> 00:41:08,383
If you don't want to
do it, you don't have to.

737
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:10,982
No more academies.

738
00:41:11,943 --> 00:41:13,823
Get a taxi quickly.
Let's go to the hospital.

739
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:15,423
Okay.

740
00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:17,783
All right. Let's get up now.

741
00:41:25,103 --> 00:41:26,143
There.

742
00:41:26,223 --> 00:41:27,982
Watch your head.

743
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,583
All right.

744
00:41:30,063 --> 00:41:31,183
Thank you.

745
00:42:13,022 --> 00:42:14,383
Jinny!

746
00:42:16,143 --> 00:42:17,183
Seo-yoon!

747
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:27,743
Stop!

748
00:42:39,783 --> 00:42:40,783
Oh, no.

749
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:50,623
Seo-yoon!

750
00:42:52,022 --> 00:42:53,063
Mom!

751
00:42:54,183 --> 00:42:55,943
Mom...

752
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:58,303
Oh, no!

753
00:42:59,463 --> 00:43:00,743
Mom!

754
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:02,423
Seo-yoon.

755
00:43:02,502 --> 00:43:04,343
Seo-yoon!

756
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:08,502
Honey!

757
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:11,343
Jung-eun. My gosh.

758
00:43:11,982 --> 00:43:13,783
Are you all right?

759
00:43:13,863 --> 00:43:15,463
Are you hurt?

760
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:17,022
I heard your mother was there too.

761
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:19,063
Jung-eun.

762
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:20,783
Look at me. Get yourself together.

763
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:23,903
Where's Seo-yoon? Is Seo-yoon okay?

764
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:25,783
She's okay.

765
00:43:26,663 --> 00:43:27,903
But my mother...

766
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:29,982
- What?
- How could this happen?

767
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:31,063
This was so sudden.

768
00:43:31,183 --> 00:43:33,263
- Oh, no. My goodness.
- What do I do?

769
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:35,063
What about my mom?

770
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:36,903
What will I do if something happens to her?

771
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:38,823
Don't think like that.

772
00:43:39,223 --> 00:43:40,783
Jung-eun, she's going to be fine.

773
00:43:40,863 --> 00:43:42,022
Okay? Don't worry.

774
00:44:02,303 --> 00:44:04,143
Mom. You saved Seo-yoon.

775
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:10,863
Seo-yoon is fine.

776
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,863
So you need to wake up too.

777
00:44:26,543 --> 00:44:28,502
Wake up, please.

(I got a new BFF today.)

781
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,183
<i>BFF.</i>

782
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:37,863
<i>I got a new BFF today.</i>

783
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:40,223
<i>Best friend forever.</i>

784
00:45:40,303 --> 00:45:41,303
<i>Jinny.</i>

785
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:44,022
<i>Jinny is my grandmother.</i>

786
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:46,543
<i>She's my first best friend.</i>

787
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:53,303
<i>First place.</i>

788
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:57,183
<i>I won first place in the speech contest.</i>

789
00:45:58,022 --> 00:46:01,143
<i>I gave the trophy to Mom as a present.</i>

790
00:46:02,143 --> 00:46:03,303
<i>Mom was happy...</i>

791
00:46:03,383 --> 00:46:05,183
<i>- because I can move...</i>
- You can keep this.

792
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,303

<i>Shots.</i>

795
00:46:12,623 --> 00:46:15,982
<i>Jinny and I went to the
hospital and got a shot.</i>

796
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:22,343
<i>I must have done very
well on the exam today.</i>

797
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,383
<i>So Jinny,</i>

798
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:27,022
<i>Min-ho's grandpa, and I had a party.</i>

799
00:46:28,223 --> 00:46:30,743
<i>I got a Pinkru doll as
a present, my favorite.</i>

800
00:46:34,783 --> 00:46:36,623
I couldn't do any of these for her.

801
00:46:39,703 --> 00:46:41,383
My mother did everything for her.

802
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:49,543
<i>Grandma won't come back now.</i>

803
00:46:50,743 --> 00:46:52,143
<i>Mom...</i>

804
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:54,863
<i>deleted Grandma's number too.</i>

805
00:46:55,423 --> 00:46:57,359
- Why are you deleting Grandma's number?
<i>- What if...</i>

806
00:46:57,383 --> 00:46:59,223
- Why?
<i>- Jinny doesn't come back?</i>

807
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:02,022
<i>What if she never comes back?</i>

808
00:47:03,183 --> 00:47:04,943
<i>I want to see her.</i>

809
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,623
<i>But I can't remember her number.</i>

810
00:47:08,063 --> 00:47:09,223
<i>I miss Jinny...</i>

811
00:47:10,103 --> 00:47:11,982
<i>so much.</i>

812
00:47:14,103 --> 00:47:15,303
I...

813
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,982
took your best friend away from you.

814
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:31,303
Seo-yoon.

815
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:35,143
Where's Grandma?

816
00:47:35,223 --> 00:47:36,383
Are you all right?

817
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:38,423
I hate you, Mom.

818
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:41,583
I don't like you. Go away, Mom.

819
00:47:50,223 --> 00:47:51,263
Seo-yoon...

820
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:25,583
You should get some rest.

821
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:28,623
I'll watch Seo-yoon.

822
00:48:30,022 --> 00:48:31,022
I'll go...

823
00:48:31,463 --> 00:48:33,783
and get some of my mom's clothes.

824
00:48:44,943 --> 00:48:46,903
My gosh. It's you, Jung-eun.

825
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,423
How have you been?

826
00:48:48,743 --> 00:48:50,982
I heard your mom was
going to move in with you.

827
00:48:51,783 --> 00:48:53,703
You're such a kind daughter.

828
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:56,263
Pardon? What do you mean?

829
00:48:56,343 --> 00:48:57,559
She put the house on the market...

830
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,903
because she was moving in with you.

831
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,022
But still. It'd be a waste to sell it now.

832
00:50:03,743 --> 00:50:04,743
Mom...

833
00:50:08,183 --> 00:50:10,943
Why would you care about our money problems?

834
00:50:13,103 --> 00:50:14,543
Were you going to sell this house...

835
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:17,223
and give me the money?

836
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:22,863
I was mean to you. Why would you care...

837
00:50:24,343 --> 00:50:26,343
if I end up on the street?

838
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:33,783
<i>This is how you always are.</i>

839
00:50:35,223 --> 00:50:36,583
Don't you see my scars?

840
00:50:37,903 --> 00:50:39,863
You can't even see that
your daughter is hurting,

841
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:42,503
so who are you to treat others?

842
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,623
You know,

843
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:47,263
living as your daughter...

844
00:50:49,623 --> 00:50:51,423
has been painfully challenging.

845
00:50:53,903 --> 00:50:54,983
Don't call...

846
00:50:56,063 --> 00:50:57,263
either me or Seo-yoon.

847
00:51:06,783 --> 00:51:08,223
I take everything back.

848
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:11,063
I didn't mean any of it. I was lying.

849
00:51:11,143 --> 00:51:12,423
I was lying to you.

850
00:51:13,423 --> 00:51:15,863
So please wake up.

851
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:20,183
Please...

852
00:51:22,823 --> 00:51:23,823
Mom...

853
00:51:36,703 --> 00:51:38,143
<i>- Jung-eun.</i>
- Yes?

854
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:39,303
<i>Mother...</i>

855
00:51:47,503 --> 00:51:48,543
Mom.

856
00:51:51,183 --> 00:51:52,303
Are you all right?

857
00:51:53,223 --> 00:51:54,383
What about Seo-yoon?

858
00:51:55,183 --> 00:51:56,183
She's okay.

859
00:52:09,743 --> 00:52:11,303
What about my daughter, Jung-eun?

860
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:13,823
She's not okay.

861
00:52:16,063 --> 00:52:17,143
I thought...

862
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:20,863
my heart was going to explode and kill me.

863
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:23,863
I...

864
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:28,183
made things difficult for my daughter again.

865
00:52:29,783 --> 00:52:31,423
Don't say that.

866
00:52:34,143 --> 00:52:35,183
Mom.

867
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:39,703
I'm sorry.

868
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:43,303
Why are you sorry?

869
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:47,143
I put my daughter through a lot.

870
00:52:50,183 --> 00:52:52,583
She loves you so much. But I...

871
00:52:56,263 --> 00:52:58,063
I had no idea you did everything for her.

872
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:03,903
They were all the things
I wanted to do for you.

873
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,623
When you were growing up,

874
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,823
I missed out on doing
so many things for you.

875
00:53:21,143 --> 00:53:23,263
I know it's late, but I'm sorry.

876
00:53:27,943 --> 00:53:30,143
I know I always held you back.

877
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:32,863
If it weren't for me...

878
00:53:33,263 --> 00:53:34,623
I lived for you.

879
00:53:37,943 --> 00:53:39,223
Without you,

880
00:53:42,063 --> 00:53:43,503
I couldn't have lived.

881
00:53:47,343 --> 00:53:48,423
Mom...

882
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:52,623
Could you help me up?

883
00:53:53,223 --> 00:53:55,783
Already? It's too soon.

884
00:53:55,863 --> 00:53:58,183
It's okay. Help me up.

885
00:53:59,183 --> 00:54:00,223
Wait.

886
00:54:00,943 --> 00:54:02,023
Hold on.

887
00:54:10,223 --> 00:54:11,303
Slowly.

888
00:54:34,823 --> 00:54:36,983
When did my daughter grow up...

889
00:54:38,423 --> 00:54:40,303
and become a mother too?

890
00:54:43,143 --> 00:54:44,143
Right.

891
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:48,943
In no time,

892
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,463
I became a mother too.

893
00:55:10,423 --> 00:55:11,543
My daughter.

894
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:17,263
I'm sorry that you had
to grow up on your own.

895
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:25,623
I realized it after raising Seo-yoon.

896
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:33,463
I'm sorry I couldn't understand you
all these years.

897
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,583
But I hope you won't hate me too much.

898
00:55:42,823 --> 00:55:43,903
Jung-eun.

899
00:55:45,103 --> 00:55:46,703
Do you hate Seo-yoon?

900
00:55:47,783 --> 00:55:49,343
Not even for a second.

901
00:55:50,023 --> 00:55:52,663
Same here. Not even for a second.

902
00:55:58,703 --> 00:55:59,903
Mom, thank you...

903
00:56:02,143 --> 00:56:03,263
for raising me.

904
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:08,103
Don't be sick.

905
00:56:08,983 --> 00:56:10,463
I'm not sick.

906
00:56:23,223 --> 00:56:25,183
(Hanguk University Hospital)

907
00:56:40,023 --> 00:56:41,743
If you're here to see me, come in.

908
00:56:55,183 --> 00:56:57,023
Hello, Min-ho.

909
00:56:57,103 --> 00:56:58,623
Hello.

910
00:57:01,063 --> 00:57:03,263
I'm sorry, Ms. Yoon.

911
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:06,743
Look at my nails.

912
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,103
Your nails grew a lot.

913
00:57:10,663 --> 00:57:11,663
Min-ho.

914
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:15,023
Min-ho has been going to therapy.

915
00:57:16,343 --> 00:57:18,183
We came to thank you.

916
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,143
Min-ho and I came together.

917
00:57:20,783 --> 00:57:22,183
Thank you for coming.

918
00:57:22,623 --> 00:57:24,423
What about my dinosaurs?

919
00:57:24,783 --> 00:57:26,423
I ought to paint them on your nails!

920
00:57:26,703 --> 00:57:28,023
I'll do that very soon.

921
00:57:28,623 --> 00:57:30,023
Thanks to you,

922
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:32,623
Min-ho's condition is improving.

923
00:57:34,503 --> 00:57:35,903
Do me a favor.

924
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:37,663
Sure.

925
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:42,503
I promised to take Min-ho to see the stars.

926
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:45,023
You need to take him instead.

927
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:48,463
Min-ho.

928
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:51,783
Won't it be better if you
see the stars with her?

929
00:57:51,863 --> 00:57:53,303
Yes! I'd like that.

930
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:56,303
Keep the promise.

931
00:57:56,983 --> 00:57:58,023
I will.

932
00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:02,143
I will keep my promise too.

933
00:58:07,303 --> 00:58:08,703
Let me hold your hand.

934
00:58:29,463 --> 00:58:30,783
You too, Min-ho?

935
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:43,143
I'm not cold.

936
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:46,343
Yes, you are. You could catch a cold.

937
00:58:48,383 --> 00:58:50,303
What about you, Mom?

938
00:58:50,383 --> 00:58:51,503
You said you hated me.

939
00:58:52,343 --> 00:58:54,063
So you wouldn't mind if I caught a cold...

940
00:58:54,143 --> 00:58:55,903
and started coughing, right?

941
00:58:57,543 --> 00:58:59,063
Put the scarf back on.

942
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,023
You don't hate me anymore.

943
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:02,983
You must love me so much.

944
00:59:04,983 --> 00:59:06,703
I like Grandma more.

945
00:59:07,183 --> 00:59:09,863
Grandma is a great listener...

946
00:59:09,943 --> 00:59:11,623
and does everything I ask.

947
00:59:16,743 --> 00:59:17,783
I'm sorry.

948
00:59:19,303 --> 00:59:22,543
From now on, I'll listen to what you say.

949
00:59:23,543 --> 00:59:26,543
And I'll always ask you first...

950
00:59:26,623 --> 00:59:28,303
what you want to do.

951
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:30,303
I can promise you that.

952
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:37,743
- Really?
- Of course.

953
00:59:40,823 --> 00:59:41,863
Seo-yoon.

954
00:59:42,983 --> 00:59:44,863
What should we do with
Myeongseong Elementary?

955
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,983
Do you want to attend that school?

956
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,183
No.

957
00:59:48,263 --> 00:59:50,103
Can I not go to Myeongseong?

958
00:59:50,623 --> 00:59:51,623
You got it.

959
00:59:51,663 --> 00:59:53,343
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

960
00:59:55,103 --> 00:59:56,863
Then it's settled.

961
00:59:57,463 --> 00:59:58,463
Okay!

962
01:00:01,863 --> 01:00:02,903
Mom.

963
01:00:03,623 --> 01:00:05,223
The truth is...

964
01:00:06,263 --> 01:00:08,343
I never hated you.

965
01:00:10,343 --> 01:00:11,463
I know that.

966
01:00:11,823 --> 01:00:13,263
You thought I wouldn't know that?

967
01:00:15,503 --> 01:00:16,503
Here.

968
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,103
I've been keeping it with me every day,

969
01:00:18,143 --> 01:00:19,703
so I could give it to you.

970
01:00:20,343 --> 01:00:21,423
A letter?

971
01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:24,903
Hong Seo-yoon.

972
01:00:25,943 --> 01:00:27,623
You really love me!

973
01:00:28,623 --> 01:00:30,399
You don't give out pink
hearts to just anyone.

974
01:00:30,423 --> 01:00:31,463
Right?

975
01:00:33,223 --> 01:00:34,383
Thank you.

976
01:00:34,743 --> 01:00:35,823
Me too.

977
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:41,623
It's snowing.

978
01:00:42,303 --> 01:00:43,543
Gosh, it's snow.

979
01:00:46,303 --> 01:00:47,783
It's snow.

980
01:00:58,023 --> 01:01:01,183
(10 months later)

981
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:06,783
I love the scent of Product 081.

982
01:01:07,183 --> 01:01:08,463
The product came out very well.

983
01:01:08,783 --> 01:01:11,583
We'll start accepting pre-orders for
these online.

984
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:13,503
Sounds good.

985
01:01:14,223 --> 01:01:16,303
Thank you so much for your hard work.

986
01:01:16,623 --> 01:01:18,063
I knew it was the right decision...

987
01:01:18,143 --> 01:01:19,783
to trust you and do this project with you.

988
01:01:20,383 --> 01:01:21,423
By the way,

989
01:01:21,503 --> 01:01:23,703
thank you for talking me out of quitting.

990
01:01:24,743 --> 01:01:26,903
I still feel sorry for my daughter that...

991
01:01:27,223 --> 01:01:28,863
I can be her mom only half the time.

992
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:29,943
Oh, dear.

993
01:01:30,183 --> 01:01:32,823
Kids will grow up just fine together.

994
01:01:33,263 --> 01:01:34,823
Our mothers were busy too.

995
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:36,343
But we grew up all on our own.

996
01:01:37,423 --> 01:01:38,463
That's true.

997
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:57,983
(Welcome back, Ms. Yoon Ji-a.)

998
01:02:00,103 --> 01:02:01,623
My goodness, her and her nagging.

999
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,503
Don't worry. I won't be late.

1000
01:02:03,543 --> 01:02:04,663
I'm on my way now.

1001
01:02:04,743 --> 01:02:06,063
<i>Did you really leave?</i>

1002
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:08,063
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

1003
01:02:12,303 --> 01:02:14,503
I'm sorry, Jung-eun.

1004
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:18,143
I completely forgot about
an old promise I made.

1005
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:19,623
<i>"A promise"?</i>

1006
01:02:20,343 --> 01:02:21,703
<i>What do you mean, all of a sudden?</i>

1007
01:02:24,023 --> 01:02:26,503
I'll be slightly late. See you later.

1008
01:02:37,943 --> 01:02:40,783
What if she kicks you
out because you're late?

1009
01:02:41,263 --> 01:02:42,783
Let her kick me out.

1010
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:46,383
I have someone to be with now.

1011
01:02:55,103 --> 01:02:56,223
Is this...

1012
01:02:57,423 --> 01:02:58,503
a good enough answer?

1013
01:02:59,623 --> 01:03:01,343
It is more than enough.

1014
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:17,383
Seo-yoon.

1015
01:03:17,943 --> 01:03:19,423
You can't see the stars yet.

1016
01:03:19,703 --> 01:03:21,623
You must wait until the sun goes down.

1017
01:03:21,703 --> 01:03:24,183
It's okay. I'm good at waiting.

1018
01:03:29,783 --> 01:03:31,823
You must have waited for
me like this every day.

1019
01:03:32,983 --> 01:03:35,183
I only wait for things I like.

1020
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,503
Imagine how happy I'll be
to see them after waiting.

1021
01:03:40,263 --> 01:03:41,343
You're right.

1022
01:03:41,423 --> 01:03:42,823
You're so smart.

1023
01:03:44,543 --> 01:03:45,543
Done.

1024
01:03:48,103 --> 01:03:49,943
- I see stars.
- Stars!

1025
01:03:50,703 --> 01:03:51,823
What do you think?

1026
01:03:51,903 --> 01:03:52,983
Dad's the best, isn't he?

1027
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:54,063
- I'll do it.
- Seo-yoon!

1028
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,223
- You're here.
- Jinny!

1029
01:03:57,783 --> 01:03:58,943
What took you so long?

1030
01:04:00,063 --> 01:04:01,503
Are you scolding me? I just got here.

1031
01:04:02,023 --> 01:04:03,183
What about me?

1032
01:04:03,503 --> 01:04:05,423
My gosh. My beautiful Ji-a.

1033
01:04:05,863 --> 01:04:08,143
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1034
01:04:10,903 --> 01:04:12,063
Jung-eun.

1035
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:15,023
You'll never be alone now.

1036
01:04:16,543 --> 01:04:17,703
Of course not.

1037
01:04:22,343 --> 01:04:23,343
Even so,

1038
01:04:24,183 --> 01:04:26,623
stay by my side for a very long time. Okay?

1039
01:04:27,103 --> 01:04:28,143
Of course.

1040
01:04:28,223 --> 01:04:29,783
I'll be glued to you.

1041
01:04:30,303 --> 01:04:31,383
Be glued.

1042
01:04:32,023 --> 01:04:34,103
Me too. I want to be glued to you too.

1043
01:04:35,223 --> 01:04:36,943
- My gosh.
- You should join us.

1044
01:04:37,703 --> 01:04:39,143
I'm here too.

1045
01:04:43,543 --> 01:04:44,863
What do you want to do, Seo-yoon?

1046
01:04:45,103 --> 01:04:46,663
The stars.

1047
01:04:47,223 --> 01:04:48,919
- The stars aren't out yet.
- Are you that happy?

1048
01:04:48,943 --> 01:04:50,023
Gosh, this is very nice.

1049
01:04:50,103 --> 01:04:51,343
- It's nice, right?
- Yes.

1050
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:52,943
All right.

1051
01:04:53,343 --> 01:04:54,543
Let's take a picture together.

1052
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:56,383
- Another one? Okay.
- Yes.

1053
01:04:56,463 --> 01:04:57,463
Seo-yoon.

1054
01:04:57,903 --> 01:04:59,983
One, two, three.

1055
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:03,543
All right. Let me take one with you too.

1056
01:05:03,623 --> 01:05:05,583
One, two, three.

1057
01:05:05,663 --> 01:05:10,343
(Thank you for watching Mother and Mom.)

1058
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:12,879
(We thank Son Jong-hak and Nam Kee-ae...)

1059
01:05:12,903 --> 01:05:14,463
(for their special appearances.)

1060
01:05:44,463 --> 01:05:47,983
(Mother and Mom)

1061
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:26,623
Our preschool days were the best days.

1062
01:06:27,343 --> 01:06:29,183
My goodness. Time flies, doesn't it?

1063
01:06:29,383 --> 01:06:30,983
Look at us all grown up.

1064
01:06:31,063 --> 01:06:33,103
We're now in elementary school.

1065
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:35,783
I didn't grow that much.

1066
01:06:35,863 --> 01:06:37,783
Did you grow taller again?

1067
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:38,703
- Yes.
- Yes.

1068
01:06:38,783 --> 01:06:40,263
Hi, guys.

1069
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:42,343
- Hi, teacher.
- Hi, teacher.

1070
01:06:42,423 --> 01:06:43,903
How's school going?

1071
01:06:44,263 --> 01:06:47,063
- Gosh, you know how it is.
- Gosh, you know how it is.
