1
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,540
(All places, organizations, characters,
incidents,)

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,660
(and backstories in this drama are
fictitious.)

3
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:37,780
(Child actors were accompanied by family...)

4
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,940
(and were kept safe.)

5
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,550
Is it really yours, Jason?

6
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:44,550
(Episode 7)

7
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,990
Are you absolutely sure?

8
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,550
It's a misunderstanding, ma'am.

9
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,590
Is he even thinking straight?

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,150
It's okay, Jason.

11
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,230
It's okay.

12
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,190
Don't cry, Jason.

13
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,150
But it really is mine.

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,590
I'm not lying.

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,230
Jason.

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,830
Come here, boy.

17
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,430
But...

18
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,510
Ho-gyung.

19
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,430
There must've been a misunderstanding.

20
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,150
Let me talk to him first.

21
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,990
Is that okay with you?

22
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,030
You should meet Tommy--

23
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,310
What about my Tommy?

24
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,350
No, it's okay.

25
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,870
It's not your fault. It's okay.

26
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,590
Jason, say sorry to Tommy.

27
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,910
No.

28
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,790
Listen to Jason first and--

29
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,030
Mind your own business.

30
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,070
Hey.

31
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,950
Go say sorry.

32
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,830
Mom?

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,630
I was about to leave.

34
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,110
One second.

35
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,550
I'm really sorry.

36
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,110
I'll talk to Jason...

37
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,310
and make sure this never happens again.

38
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,310
I'm really sorry.

39
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,110
Hello.

40
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:18,230
Seo-yoon, are you okay now?

41
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,510
- Are you good now? - Yes.

42
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,030
- Grandpa. - Yes?

43
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,310
I want to take a picture with your camera.

44
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,470
One second.

45
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,270
Here. Turn it on.

46
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,070
Press this button.

47
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,110
Okay.

48
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:41,310
Have you seen Min-ho recently?

49
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,990
No, I haven't met him.

50
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,870
You should meet him more often.

51
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,190
Okay.

52
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,590
Let me take a picture of you.

53
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,390
- Okay. - Well...

54
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,110
Sure.

55
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,110
One, two, three.

56
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,230
You're like a photographer.

57
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,710
Let me see.

58
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,270
- It's Grandpa. - Nice.

59
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,910
I promised to look at the stars with Seo-
yoon.

60
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,910
Promise?

61
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,390
Nothing.

62
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,750
Say that again.

63
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,430
With whom? What did you promise?

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,310
Who was there? Grandpa and who?

65
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,550
Tae-rin's grandma and Seo-yoon's grandma.

66
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,710
When?

67
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,150
The day of the draw.

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,750
And?

69
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,270
What did Seo-yoon's grandma say?

70
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,030
Sorry?

71
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,470
She must've talked to Grandpa.

72
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,790
What did they talk about?

73
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,790
Lee Min-ho. Your hand.

74
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,550
Bring your phone.

75
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,590
Even I was angry about Jason.

76
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,430
Tommy must've been upset.

77
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,870
That's what kids are like.

78
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,590
I'm worried...

79
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,430
about how soft-hearted you are.

80
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,030
What are you trying to say?

81
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,230
The woman in Class B.

82
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,790
I heard her kid is moving to Class A.

83
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,470
Says who?

84
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,630
She said it with her own mouth.

85
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,550
Since when was it that easy...

86
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,470
to get into Class A at Big Parker?

87
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,750
Did she say that?

88
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,870
Her kid is moving to Class A?

89
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,110
It's not true. Right?

90
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,829
Did she not hear...

91
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,829
that she must leave if she doesn't get
enough votes?

92
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,870
- Really? - On the day of voting,

93
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,590
I'm going to show her.

94
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,670
Then I'll be against it for sure.

95
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,470
I thought you had become soft-hearted.

96
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,070
Do you know how surprised I was?

97
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,470
I was close.

98
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,670
All done.

99
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,949
Dang it.

100
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,829
What's wrong?

101
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,590
The TR proposal. Have you seen it?

102
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,030
Why would I?

103
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,630
We only need to make the meeting happen.

104
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,790
Right?

105
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,590
Gosh, what an eyesore.

106
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,750
- Is it that bad? - Don't pay attention to it.

107
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,590
If you read it, you won't be able to stand it.

108
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,870
It'll only give you more work.

109
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,350
You think I don't know Ha Sa-na?

110
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,110
I have no expectations of her.

111
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,750
Show me. I'll only read it.

112
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,790
I'm on cloud nine right now.

113
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,630
I should read it when I'm generous. Give it to
me.

114
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,990
Let me see.

115
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,350
Is this supposed to be a proposal?

116
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,910
Even if I find the TR CEO,

117
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,270
I could never show this.

118
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,550
First, send me the file.

119
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,630
Pardon?

120
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,190
Are you going to fix it?

121
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,590
If I feel like it.

122
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,230
- Okay. - Gosh, that woman...

123
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,350
(Madam Shin's Gukbap)

124
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,070
(Grand Award Winner Hong Seo-yoon,)

125
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,750
(Madam Shin's Granddaughter)

126
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,830
Gosh.

127
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,590
We're closed.

128
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,710
Mom.

129
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,830
What are you doing here at this hour?

130
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,790
Well...

131
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,190
Mom. Help me.

132
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,150
There you go again.

133
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,350
I've thought about it over and over,

134
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,750
and you're the only one I have.

135
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,870
What is it this time?

136
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,430
The money we saved to move to Gongnam
Apartment.

137
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,910
I lost it all.

138
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,150
What? How?

139
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,110
We were a little short, so I spent it all...

140
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,830
on...

141
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,670
cryptocurrency.

142
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,230
What? Cryptocurrency?

143
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,990
Gosh. You idiot.

144
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,310
You saw what I went through...

145
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,310
because of your father's money problems.

146
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,270
- I know. - Yet you're doing this to me?

147
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,550
My goodness.

148
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,070
Yes, I deserve it.

149
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,270
I deserve more. I'm crazy.

150
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,109
My goodness.

151
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:13,630
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,630
Can you help me out one last time?

153
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,229
Right now, we're about to lose the store.

154
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,510
We won't be able to move.

155
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,470
We'll have to live on the street.

156
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,910
I don't know.

157
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,349
No.

158
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,229
I did that for Jung-eun and Seo-yoon.

159
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,430
But it went under.

160
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,710
Don't think about hitting the jackpot.

161
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,670
You said it's for Jung-eun and Seo-yoon.

162
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,990
Then what can't you do?

163
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,950
Do what?

164
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,990
- Work here. - Mom!

165
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:44,990
Work here...

166
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:46,590
and save money.

167
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,070
No.

168
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,109
Then live on the street. It's your call.

169
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:52,590
But...

170
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,670
Mom!

171
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,990
But...

172
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,590
Look at Mommy.

173
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,190
So adorable.

174
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,070
Seo-yoon.

175
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,910
You'll be moving to Class A starting
tomorrow.

176
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,830
- Are you happy? - How?

177
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,229
I didn't take the test.

178
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:25,990
I took care of it.

179
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:29,030
Am I moving to Class A now?

180
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,430
Of course.

181
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,950
Mom, are you happy?

182
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,030
I'm very, very happy.

183
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,950
Now you and Tommy are both in Class A.

184
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,710
You worked very hard.

185
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,510
So cute.

186
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,910
- Good morning. - Jinny.

187
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,470
Seo-yoon.

188
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,710
Go pee before going to preschool.

189
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,070
Okay.

190
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,430
Where's Jae-man? Still in bed?

191
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,030
He went out early in the morning.

192
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,950
He's been busy avoiding me lately.

193
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,349
He leaves early in the morning...

194
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,430
and comes home late at night.

195
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,310
Did you fight again?

196
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,870
Oh, I don't know.

197
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,470
Today is an important day.

198
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,710
I don't even want to think about him. It's bad
luck.

199
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,109
Watch your mouth.

200
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,590
Okay.

201
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,270
You know what day it is today.

202
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,430
- There's voting. - Exactly.

203
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,670
Can you bring her psychological test
result...

204
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,510
after her academy?

205
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,190
Okay. Call me when you're done.

206
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,950
You had a tough time...

207
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,270
driving Seo-yoon around, Mom.

208
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,390
So let me give you a hug.

209
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,670
- Come here. - No thanks.

210
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,550
- Come here. - Stay away.

211
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,390
- Thank you. - I don't need it.

212
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,030
What are you doing?

213
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,070
Wait and see...

214
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,750
how this awful proposal changes.

215
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,190
I'll finish it before I leave tonight.

216
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,270
Nice.

217
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,470
It's a special day.

218
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,310
It'll be like an offering.

219
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,910
What? What day is it today?

220
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,109
You don't have to know.

221
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,510
Mr. Kim, Ms. Lee's showing what she's got.

222
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,830
Do you want to watch?

223
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,430
I'm sure she'll take care of it.

224
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,590
Keep it up.

225
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,790
Is everything all right with him?

226
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,030
I'm not sure.

227
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,550
He's returning from Director Yoon's office.

228
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,910
I'm Senior Manager Lee Jung-eun...

229
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,270
from Aaes' Marketing Team.

230
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,310
I have a document for the CEO of TR.

231
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,710
Pardon?

232
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,430
Can you...

233
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,390
please pass it on?

234
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,590
Wait.

235
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,710
Excuse me.

236
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,790
I couldn't meet the CEO.

237
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,470
I'll take responsibility for TR.

238
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,670
Are we good now?

239
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,590
Don't mess with my team.

240
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,630
How are you going to take responsibility?

241
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,470
Whether I have to take a break or quit,

242
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,870
I'll get out of your sight.

243
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,670
Isn't that what you wanted from the
beginning?

244
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,550
I never thought you'd run away.

245
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,550
Say whatever you want.

246
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,030
What?

247
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,990
You.

248
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,990
Have you ever wondered why it was so hard
to reach TR?

249
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,310
Did you think they'd meet you...

250
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,710
if you gave them a lame proposal in Aaes'
name?

251
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,470
Who said it was lame?

252
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,310
You think it's easy to persuade anyone...

253
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,630
in this field?

254
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,830
No desperation. No substance.

255
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,670
A proposal that only looks fancy on the
outside...

256
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,910
only for your performance?

257
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,750
I wouldn't read it either.

258
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,230
Watch your mouth.

259
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,510
Hey!

260
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,270
- Mommy. - Mom.

261
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,110
- Mom. - Mom.

262
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,750
I'm done.

263
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,390
They always come running during the break.

264
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,910
But how come they aren't here today?

265
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,990
I know.

266
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,030
I'll go find them.

267
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,590
No, don't worry.

268
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,590
Leave them. They'll come in due course.

269
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,710
Sit down.

270
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,270
Tae-rin.

271
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,590
Do you want to visit Class A together?

272
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,870
Why?

273
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,190
We'll be moving to Class A starting
tomorrow.

274
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,910
- Why bother? - Because...

275
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,150
I'm curious.

276
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,070
And Min-ho's there too.

277
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,550
Min-ho?

278
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,510
Oh, you want to see him.

279
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,070
Then you should've just told me.

280
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,750
No, that's not it.

281
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,230
No need to say it. Let's go.

282
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,190
Min-ho.

283
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,430
Don't.

284
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,310
It's break time. Come on.

285
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,670
I guess they can't talk in here.

286
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,550
Hey.

287
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,950
Are you allowed in here?

288
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,150
You'll get in trouble.

289
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,910
But it's recess.

290
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,350
Who cares? It's fine.

291
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,470
We're moving to Class A starting tomorrow.

292
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,190
Really? That's great.

293
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,510
Why is it so boring here during break time?

294
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,910
Let's go out and play.

295
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,350
Yes, let's go play with our grandmas.

296
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,230
Can I come with you?

297
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,590
Of course. Come with us.

298
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,390
You're holding hands.

299
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,990
- Hey. - Hey.

300
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,270
Mom?

301
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,350
Lee Min-ho. Where are you going?

302
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,990
Hello.

303
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,790
We're going to meet our grandmas.

304
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,390
Grandmas?

305
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,590
- Return to your seat. - Okay.

306
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,550
Is this your class?

307
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,710
- No. - No.

308
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,750
Return to your class.

309
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,870
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

310
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,390
How is...

311
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,350
Seo-yoon's test result?

312
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,390
Here it is. You should take a look.

313
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,830
This will be Seo-yoon's class from now on.

314
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,150
She has finally reached Class A.

315
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,030
Thanks to you, I got here too.

316
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,910
Tae-rin's supposed to be in Class A too.

317
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,870
She's a winner of the speech contest.

318
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,430
If they're going to move us, they should just
do it.

319
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,990
Why bother with a vote?

320
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,230
They said it was only a formality.

321
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,550
Don't worry about it.

322
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,670
Okay.

323
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,990
What's taking them so long?

324
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,750
I guess you haven't made up your mind yet.

325
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,590
Pardon?

326
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,710
I expected you to vote in favor.

327
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,190
What's that look on your face?

328
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,110
You don't want them, even though you're
friends?

329
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,750
No, that's not it.

330
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,270
If Mom's not greedy,

331
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,310
she can't secure her child's place.

332
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,110
Only four children can be in Class A.

333
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,669
And if Claire and Stella move up...

334
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,790
What...

335
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,990
What are you saying?

336
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,350
I'm saying anyone beneath Tommy...

337
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,390
can be changed.

338
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,230
If you plan to give Sophie's spot to Claire,

339
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,909
it won't matter though.

340
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,950
You know what?

341
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,550
They were waiting in Class A.

342
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,630
They're acting like...

343
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,990
they've already moved to Class A.

344
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,430
What's going on?

345
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,230
I thought it was only a formality.

346
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,870
Now, shall we begin voting?

347
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,950
Yes, let's get it over with.

348
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:14,190
She always gets on my nerves.

349
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,070
We'll count the votes, then.

350
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,550
Two are against it.

351
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,350
It's all right.

352
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,870
Things will get better from here.

353
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,870
It's two to one.

354
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,950
Only one vote remains.

355
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,149
If the vote is tied,

356
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,030
the casting vote...

357
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,590
will be mine as I'm the chairwoman.

358
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,270
- Of course. - One more thing.

359
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,750
Should Claire's mom lose this vote,

360
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,870
Claire won't just lose her spot in Class A...

361
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,909
but will be forced out of Big Parker.

362
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,230
But Tommy's mom...

363
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,790
What are you talking about?

364
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,149
Why? Don't you remember?

365
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,230
That's what you said.

366
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,390
I'll do whatever you ask. Anything.

367
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,550
If she doesn't make it this time,

368
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,030
I'll accept whatever you decide,

369
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:21,310
whether it's demoting her to Class C...

370
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,830
or making her quit entirely. So...

371
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,790
Please give her one more chance. I beg you.

372
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,909
Please.

373
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,230
Tommy's mom, that's...

374
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,790
What is it? Isn't that what you meant?

375
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,070
That's how I understood it...

376
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,830
and why I gave you your last chance.

377
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,669
Then, let's check the remaining vote.

378
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,870
It seems as though Jason's mom...

379
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,270
has issues with me.

380
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,590
Thank you, all.

381
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,030
As decided by the vote,

382
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,030
Claire will no longer study at Big Parker.

383
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,190
Stella's mom, what about you?

384
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,790
Forget it.

385
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,470
We're leaving too.

386
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,149
Of course. Now I know why Sophie's so
smart.

387
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,710
Jung-eun, wait.

388
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,909
- Let go of me. - Hear me out.

389
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,950
Shut it.

390
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,790
So what if I had voted yes?

391
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,790
She still wouldn't have gotten in.

392
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,149
Tommy's mom was against it anyway.

393
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,430
Still, how could you do this to me?

394
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,310
I never thought Claire would get this far.

395
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:34,669
I...

396
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,710
even quit my job to support So-ra.

397
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,310
But still, I only barely made it this far.

398
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,510
Why help me in the first place, then?

399
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,310
How can you be this cruel?

400
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,350
- Jung-eun. - Don't call me like that.

401
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,310
I'm disgusted to hear you say my name.

402
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:56,190
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,430
I'm sorry, Jung-eun,

404
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,030
but...

405
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,070
So-ra comes first.

406
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,149
I'm sure it's no different for you too.

407
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,669
So please... Just this once.

408
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,950
Just this once.

409
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,990
Are you playing me?

410
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,230
How does it feel to wake up from a dream?

411
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,710
What?

412
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,710
Did you think it'd be easy to climb up this
high?

413
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,350
You came to my house and begged...

414
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,710
which is why I gave you another chance.

415
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,590
You were delusional enough...

416
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,790
to dream of something bigger.

417
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,030
It was all in my head?

418
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,470
Why put it to a vote, then?

419
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,750
You should've just kicked me out then and
there.

420
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,110
Do you want to know why?

421
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,870
Now you know.

422
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,590
That's why Seo-yoon can't be in Class A.

423
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:21,430
- How... - Don't tell me...

424
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,430
you want us to be family or something.

425
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,470
I'd rather not be.

426
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,510
Then,

427
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,910
is my mother the reason Seo-yoon...

428
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,070
So I suggest...

429
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,870
you take this up with your mother.

430
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,390
Now, get out.

431
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,790
You, your daughter,

432
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,630
and Ms. Yoon.

433
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,190
Disappear from here.

434
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,910
"Ms. Yoon"?

435
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,030
Ju-hee?

436
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,630
Right?

437
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,750
Song Ju-hee.

438
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,310
Today,

439
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,270
I quit my job at the school.

440
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,750
Is it because of her?

441
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,470
Why are you quitting, not her?

442
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,510
Why, because of someone I don't even
know,

443
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,870
can't I go to the school I want?

444
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,470
Could it be...

445
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,950
Don't tell me it was you.

446
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,670
Song Ju-hee from Eunhae Girls' Middle
School.

447
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,830
That's you, isn't it?

448
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,110
Darn it!

449
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,390
(Mom)

450
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,230
Where are you?

451
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,630
I was just about to call you.

452
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,150
I have something to say,

453
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,190
so I'll see you at home.

454
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,630
No.

455
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,350
I'll come to you.

456
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,230
Seriously...

457
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,910
You got here early.

458
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:16,190
I have the report on Seo-yoon's mental state.

459
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,230
How is she?

460
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,310
It's not good.

461
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,550
Jung-eun,

462
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,670
it'll be best for her to quit the academy.

463
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,910
Why?

464
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,590
I discussed it with Dr. Park,

465
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,150
and Seo-yoon seems to have developed...

466
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,390
an obsession over her grades.

467
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,710
Remove her from all the extra classes for
now...

468
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,310
and let her get treated.

469
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,150
She'll get better with therapy.

470
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,910
Did something happen to you today?

471
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,070
Seo-yoon...

472
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,990
can't attend the academy anymore.

473
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,270
Why not?

474
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,190
Did she...

475
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,550
Did she not make it into Class A?

476
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,030
That's right.

477
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,150
She didn't make it.

478
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,390
It's for the better.

479
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,030
She can take a break...

480
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,190
and focus on getting better.

481
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,710
I'll do my best to help her.

482
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,510
Are you sure dropping out is for her own
sake?

483
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,910
Wh-What on earth are you saying?

484
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,550
How could you be in the dark?

485
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,830
Don't you know who caused this?

486
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,430
Jung-eun, use words I can understand.

487
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,590
Whatever.

488
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,590
Just like you did to me,

489
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,950
do whatever you please however you see fit.

490
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,590
Don't use Seo-yoon as an excuse!

491
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,990
As an excuse?

492
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,350
You...

493
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,590
I don't know why you're on my case,

494
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,270
but Seo-yoon's treatment is my priority.

495
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,550
How can you date at your granddaughter's
academy?

496
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,110
With Tommy's grandfather too!

497
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,110
- I... - Thanks to you, Mom,

498
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,470
we were kicked out...

499
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,230
not only from Class A, but from Big Parker.

500
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,470
Are you happy now?

501
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,550
So date all you want, darn it!

502
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,590
But...

503
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,430
Jung-eun.

504
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,590
Let me talk to Tommy's mom.

505
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,190
Gosh, no. Don't.

506
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,230
I can't believe I had you care for Seo-yoon...

507
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,470
after what you did to me.

508
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,470
I was out of my mind.

509
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,550
Was ruining my future not enough?

510
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,310
You had to ruin my daughter's too?

511
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,550
Lee Jung-eun.

512
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,150
Tommy's mom was that girl.

513
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,070
Song Ju-hee.

514
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,550
You quit your job because of her, and I
couldn't...

515
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,110
go to the foreign language high school!

516
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,350
Have you forgotten that?

517
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,230
How...

518
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,950
And now, you're doing the same to my
daughter.

519
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,830
Well, Ju-hee was ill at the time.

520
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,310
You...

521
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,590
This is how you always are.

522
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,150
Other kids are always your priority.

523
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,230
What about me, though?

524
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,350
What about my Seo-yoon?

525
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,190
Don't you see my scars?

526
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,950
You can't even see that your daughter is
hurting,

527
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,550
so who are you to treat others?

528
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,230
I...

529
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,150
You said...

530
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,590
You said you were all right.

531
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,670
Never have I been okay.

532
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,030
Is it over if I say I'm good?

533
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,910
How is it that you never asked me?

534
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,190
"Are you really okay?"

535
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,910
So that I wasn't a burden.

536
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,470
So that you'd have it easier as a single mom,

537
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,150
I didn't say anything.

538
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,470
Actually, I couldn't.

539
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,590
Not even once.

540
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,590
I'm done keeping it in.

541
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,510
If things are rough, I'll say so.

542
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,190
Jung-eun.

543
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,950
I...

544
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,030
didn't know you were hurting, and I'm sorry.

545
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,510
As if a belated apology would do me any
good.

546
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,110
Even now, you won't ask me if I'm all right.

547
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,390
Today has been the roughest...

548
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,110
and the most painful day.

549
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,670
One where I'm closest to losing my mind.

550
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,150
You know,

551
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,710
living as your daughter...

552
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,910
has been painfully challenging.

553
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,430
Don't call...

554
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,910
either me or Seo-yoon.

555
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,350
Oh, no.

556
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,070
What do I do?

557
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,710
My gosh, what do I do?

558
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,190
Mom's the reason.

559
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,710
It's all her fault.

561
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,390
Ji-a.

562
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,670
- Goodness! - Sorry I'm late.

563
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,030
- Have a good one. - Sure.

566
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,830
Do you have any idea...

567
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,670
how scared I was that day?

568
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,950
Like always, I never said a thing.

569
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,190
(Mom, it rained a lot today.)

570
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,870
Mom,

571
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,190
it rained a lot today.

572
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,230
Although I got a bit wet,

573
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,910
I made it home just fine.

574
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,470
I studied hard while waiting for you too.

575
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,990
Don't worry about me.

576
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,350
I'm tired, so I'll go to bed first.

577
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,390
I love you, Mom. From Jung-eun.

578
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,670
Gosh.

579
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,710
Mom...

580
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,830
What do I do?

581
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,910
What now?

582
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,190
What have I done?

583
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:58,749
Father.

584
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,590
That is where Min-ho studies.

585
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,070
I'm worried others might find out.

586
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,550
I handled it on my end,

587
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,269
- so-- - You handled it?

588
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:12,830
Were you going to continue your
relationship...

589
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,230
with Seo-yoon's grandmother?

590
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,150
I didn't know it required your permission.

591
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:17,710
Don't you think about Min-ho?

592
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,430
You should ask yourselves that.

593
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,550
Father.

594
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,150
I'm his mother.

595
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:24,110
Does he seem fine to you?

596
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,310
Because of the stress--

597
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,910
Academic stress...

598
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:29,950
is what everyone experiences.

599
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,470
You two...

600
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,830
Your only goal is to make him your prized
possession.

601
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:40,830
From here on out,

602
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,870
don't go to Min-ho's academy.

603
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,830
If that's what you want,

604
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,910
I'll do that.

605
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,710
In return,

606
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,789
you're to stay out of my business too.

607
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,269
- Father, please. - Father!

608
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:03,230
I had something to give back.

609
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,030
I can't accept this.

610
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,590
- Ms. Yoon... - I'm sorry.

611
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,510
Please...

612
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,430
Don't contact me.

613
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,190
You scared me.

614
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,830
My goodness.

615
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,710
What are you doing with the lights off, Jung-
eun?

616
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,910
Get out of the house. I don't want to see you.

617
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,510
Jung-eun. Pleasehear me out.

618
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,510
I'll take care of the moneyproblem soon.

619
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,150
I'm going to raise Seo-yoon.

620
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,070
I don't need you or my mom.

621
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,470
So get out.

622
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,150
Dad.

623
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,630
Seo-yoon. You must be scared. Come to
Daddy.

624
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:24,110
Don't call her.

625
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,190
Mom.

626
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:28,630
Don't get in the way of her future. Get out
now.

627
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,310
Dad...

628
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,430
My baby.

629
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,430
It's okay, Seo-yoon.

630
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,150
It will just be the two of us now.

631
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,269
No, Mom.

632
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,310
I don't want that, Mom.

633
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,510
It will be all right.

634
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:01,630
I would have kicked you out too.

635
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:02,550
It's not some chumpchange we're
talkingabout.

636
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,590
Oh, dear.

637
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,630
So 200 millionwon?

638
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,630
Why do I keep messingthings up?

639
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,510
You're not so bad.

640
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,110
Gosh, you know how I am.

641
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,670
Hey.

642
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,390
But of all the juniorsI've trained,you are...

643
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,150
I'm what?

644
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,350
You're the kindest.

645
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,510
Gosh, you might not be the smartest worker.

646
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,190
But your wife and your daughterare...

647
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,470
the center of your world.

648
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,870
That's all wives need from their husbands.

649
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:40,230
That's why I'm putting up...

650
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,870
with your drunk antics at this late hour...

651
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,870
even though you moved to a
differentcompany.

652
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,350
Come here, you.

653
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,430
Gosh, stop it. That's gross. Sit back down.

654
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,510
Drink up.

655
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,310
Don't touch my hand.

656
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,590
- Seo-yoon. - Yes?

657
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,670
You'll go to a differentacademynow.

658
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:04,749
Why?

659
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,470
We'll go to a much better academythan Big
Parker.

660
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,110
So you don't have to worryabout a thing.
Okay?

661
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,430
I'll come and pick you up later tonight.

662
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,150
What about Grandma?

663
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,830
I'll come and pick you up. You don't want
that?

664
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,710
It's not that I don't want you to come.

665
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,110
But it's just that Grandmahas been
pickingme up.

666
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,950
From now on, I'm going to do everythingfor
you.

667
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,670
No. I'm going to call Grandma.

668
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,710
No. You can't call her.

669
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,030
Don't call her.

670
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,269
How do you delete a number on this?

671
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,470
(Grandma)

672
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:44,350
Why are you deleting Grandma's number?

673
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,430
Why?

674
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,710
Hey, Seo-yoon. Your mom is droppingyou off
today.

675
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,510
- Hello. - Hello.

676
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,670
For the time being, Seo-yoon...

677
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,070
will stay at preschoolfor the entireday.

678
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,550
Sure.

679
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,990
I guess she's not goingto the
academyanymore.

680
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,510
Right.

681
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,110
Let's go.

682
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,030
Seo-yoon, shall we go inside?

683
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:19,430
All right. Let's take off your shoes.

684
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,910
Put on your indoor shoes.

685
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,070
(Searchingfor traditions)

686
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,789
Seo-yoon, what's wrong?

687
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,830
I can't remembermy grandmother's number.

688
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:36,950
What was it?

689
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,030
Is it over if I say I'm good?

690
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,670
How is it that you never asked me?

691
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,590
You know,

692
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,190
living as your daughter...

693
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,430
has been painfully challenging.

694
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:15,030
How long do we have to wait for the level
test?

695
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,230
A month?

696
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,910
Is there a way to move it up?

697
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,070
I see. Okay. I understand.

698
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:35,269
Hello.

699
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,190
I have a daughterwho will start
elementaryschool.

700
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,789
When is the earliestdate...

701
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,150
for a leveltest?

702
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:46,230
Oh, right. She used to study at Big Parker.

703
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,190
She won the Grand Award at the
speechcontest.

704
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,190
I see.

705
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,789
Okay.

706
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,830
It sure feels great...

707
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,269
to get rid of those nuisances.

708
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:07,230
This was long overdue.

709
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:12,950
But what's up with you two? Why the long
faces?

710
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:18,870
Tommy's mom. This way.

711
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:19,950
- Hello. - Gosh.

712
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:24,990
You're here.

713
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:27,350
My goodness.What's gotteninto her?

714
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:30,510
I'm reallysorryabout what happenedthat day.

715
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,150
I'm sorry.

716
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,350
Why make a mistaketo apologizefor in the
first place?

717
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,910
- I shouldglue up that mouth of yours. -
What?

718
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,630
I heard you. I understand.

719
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:42,749
Ms. Song.

720
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,390
Everyonemakesmistakesin life.

721
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,749
Right?

722
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,710
- Mistakes? - Yes.

723
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,590
You made the right decision.

724
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,190
Excuseme?

725
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,110
Thanks to that, your daughtercan keep her
spot.

726
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,230
Right.

727
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:03,310
You were her friend but stabbedher in the
back.

728
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,269
- You. - Yes?

729
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,749
Watch your mouth.

730
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:08,390
Oh, right.

731
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,990
Didn't Jason barely pass the test to join
Class A?

732
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,990
Ms. Song. I must have lost my mind that day.

733
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,670
- Please. - Once a traitor,

734
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,190
alwaysa traitor.

735
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,670
- Right? - You little...

736
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,710
Right.

737
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,590
I like ambitiouspeoplelike you.

738
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:28,910
Now that I know what you're capableof,

739
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,590
you will be compensatedwithouta doubt.

740
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,590
Pardon?

741
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,870
There will be a notice about openingsin
Class B soon.

742
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,510
Jason'smom used to handle that.

743
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,310
Startingnow, you'll be handlingit.

744
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,390
You can make a few recommendationstoo.

745
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,749
Right.

746
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:57,269
Claire came to Big Parker with your
recommendation.

747
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,749
- Right. - Now that you've experiencedwhat
it's like,

748
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,870
you won't make the same mistake twice.

749
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:07,310
Be careful whom you bring in this time
around.

750
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,710
How could you recommenda familylike that?

751
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,789
I guess you're a bad judgeof character.

752
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:17,630
Like attracts like?

753
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,390
Excuseme.

754
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,150
I need to get going.

755
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:29,310
Unbelievable.

756
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,590
I must have lost my mind.

757
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,150
I knew it.

758
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:43,430
Your head is clearlymore suitablefor
crackingeggs.

759
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:44,990
Come here. Let me crack one with your
head.

760
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,190
- Grandma. - You!

761
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,310
- Look at you. - Grandma.

762
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,950
Kid, you can try all you want to run away.

763
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,670
- I can easilygrab you. - Grandma.

764
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:52,710
This isn't fair.

765
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,430
You can't use force on me.

766
00:48:54,749 --> 00:48:56,590
If you don't think it's fair, grow up.

767
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,590
If Seo-yoon were here, we could'vetaken
you down.

768
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,590
My gosh. I do miss Seo-yoon and her family.

769
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,269
We're usedto seeingthem every day.

770
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,030
Not seeingthem is makingme feel lonelyfor
sure.

771
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,030
- I'm sure you feel the same way. - Yes.

772
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,310
I'm thrilledthat I don't have to go to the
academy.

773
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:12,430
But it's a pity that I can't see Seo-yoon.

774
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,590
Same here.

775
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,990
Hey, why is the professorcallingme?

776
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,510
I can't get in touchwith Ms. Yoon.

777
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,350
I'm sure you know where I can find her.

778
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,110
I reallydon't know where she is. I swear.

779
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,870
Please help me. Tell me where she is.

780
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,710
She made sure that I wouldn'ttell...

781
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,590
Come on.

782
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,590
So you did meet with her, right?

783
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,470
Where did she say she was going?

784
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:43,710
- Oh, dear. - Ma'am.

785
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,670
You can ma'am me, but I can't tell you even
in death.

786
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:48,910
Then pretendthat you're dead and just tell
him.

787
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,470
Pleasetell me where she is.

788
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,470
Sir, should we all go on a trip togetherlike
before?

789
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,350
Hey, she's not there. Never.

790
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,150
Where was that?

791
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,510
- Could she be at... - Dear me.

792
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,070
I don't know. I give up.

793
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:12,470
That's it.

794
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,110
Thank you, Tae-rin.

795
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:28,750
Seo-yoon.

796
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:30,630
Why are you so quiettoday?

797
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,790
You didn'tsay a word on the way home.

798
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,430
Are you mad at me?

799
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:41,350
Grandma is my BFF.

800
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,190
"BFF"?

801
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:44,790
What's that?

802
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,790
See? You don't even know what it is.

803
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:49,510
I...

804
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,310
My gosh.

805
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,430
Seo-yoon. Wait up. We shouldgo home
together.

806
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,790
Seo-yoon.

807
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,430
- Hello. - Hello.

808
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,470
What are you doinghere?

809
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,310
Then you shouldhave answeredyour phone.

810
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,750
I have nothingto say to you.

811
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,310
- Let's go. - My gosh, hold on.

812
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,510
Here.

813
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:19,510
What's this?

814
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,950
Number seven, please.

815
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,110
Number seven, please.

816
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,550
- Seven! - The last number is...

817
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:38,910
(Myeongseong Elementary School)

818
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,310
- Number 17. - Here.

819
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:46,550
I'm number 17.

820
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,270
I believe this is the ball you saw...

821
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:49,990
on the day of the draw.

822
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,510
Someone wrote this post...

823
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,030
a few days after the draw.

824
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:56,550
But oddlyenough,

825
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,510
it was deletedthe next day.

826
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,310
This is the screenshotI took that day.

827
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,910
("An Exposé of AdmissionsFraudat
Myeongseong")

828
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,270
As you can gather from the post,

829
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,790
the whistleblowermust be someonefrom the
inside.

830
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:16,470
(Background)

831
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,710

833

834
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,150
(It was first discovered...)

835
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:36,030

(Yu So-yeon)

840
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,030
I found her.

841
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,110
(Pale blue dot 1209: Yu So-yeon)

842
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,270
- Hello. - Hello, Seo-yoon.

843
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,190
- Hello. - Go inside.

844
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,990
Seo-yoon.

845
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:06,550
Bye.

846
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:09,990
- Bye. - Bye.

847
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,110
Is this Myeongseong Elementary School?

848
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,510
Is there a teacher named Ms. Yu So-yeon?

849
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,230
We spokeon the phone earlier.

850
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,390
My name is Lee Jung-eun.

851
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,550
Not today.

852
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,430
I have somewhereto be in the afternoon.

853
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,190
What about the report to Director Yoon
today?

854
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,430
Things aren't looking good. You could lose
your job.

855
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,550
Even if I do, there's nothingI can do.

856
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,350
I really have to take the day off.

857
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:12,670
Go home after the report then.

858
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,830
I met with your husband.

859
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,710
I can totallyunderstandhow you feel now.

860
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,150
- But you stillhave to work. - My gosh.

861
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,190
This isn't about that.

862
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:22,790
Well, I'll get going.

863
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,110
Ms. Lee.

864
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,510
Ms. Lee.

865
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:27,430
My goodness.

866
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,230
Should we schedule the level test...

867
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,670
sometime next week for Class B?

868
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:35,790
Why are you scheduling the level test?

869
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,830
BecauseI've always scheduled the level test.

870
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,070
That's my business.

871
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,270
I thought you were taking care of that.

872
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,350
Well, recently, I've been...

873
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,750
Jung-eun.

874
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:56,030
- What's she doing here? - I thought her kid
left.

875
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:57,430
Why are you here?

876
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,830
Do you still have business here?

877
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:03,310
Yes.

878
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,990
You took Seo-yoon's place, and I'm here to
get it back.

879
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:07,870
Get what back?

880
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:09,230
- What's going on? - I don't know.

881
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,670
- What is this? - What's she doing here?

882
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,190
Tell the receptionist to get her out of here.

883
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:14,310
Okay.

884
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,950
You'll want to listen to this.

885
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,510
What scene are you going to cause this
time?

886
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,430
You're the one who caused a scene...

887
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,790
on the day of the draw at Myeongseong
Elementary.

888
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,870
- What? - You rigged the draw.

889
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:27,990
- On the day of the draw? - She rigged what?

890
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:29,550
- She rigged the draw. - My gosh.

891
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,110
What nonsense are you talking about?

892
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,070
Have you lost your mind after getting kicked
out?

893
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,830
- My goodness. - Why does she have that?

894
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:43,910
- Isn't that the ball? - What?

895
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,590
- Is that the ball? - How does she have that?

896
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,070
- Why does she have it? - My gosh.

897
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,150
Goodness.How did that happen?

898
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,470
What's this?

899
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,590
Take a good look at it.

900
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,030
I asked you what it was.

901
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:58,110
It came from a trash can in your house.

902
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,430
You should know what it is.

903
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,230
No.

904
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,070
No.

905
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,790
Do you have proof?

906
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,270
Proof?

907
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,270
Can you prove your accusation?

908
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,230
How dare you accuseme...

909
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,710
of doing something so cheap and
disgraceful?

910
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:27,910
Get out.

911
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,150
Get out of here right now.

912
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,230
You...

913
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,070
Lee Min-ho! Pull yourself together!

914
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,950
Can you make sure he wins first place or
not?

915
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,150
I'm sure he can, ma'am.

916
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,830
It ends here.

917
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,470
You're dismissed.

918
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,750
I only hired you for a high price because...

919
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,430
you were becoming a teacher at
Myeongseong Elementary.

920
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,030
I'm sure you know who she is.

921
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:23,830
What is this?

922
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,990
Did you join hands to threaten me...

923
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,750
because you were both kicked out by me?

924
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,350
How dare you plot against me?

925
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:32,310
You'll deny it to the end?

926
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,470
Then how about this?

927
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,430
- What's this? - You're curious,aren't you?

928
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,590
We'll show you...

929
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,990
the dirty act you committedon the day of the
draw.

930
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,910
Then we can all watch it here.

931
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:05,710
No.

932
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:46,950
(Mother and Mom)

933
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:48,590
Your son can no longer attend our academy.

934
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:49,510
Ma'am.

935
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,430
It's game over for you.

936
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:55,070
What are you doing here all alone?

937
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,590
Come with me.

938
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,150
I'll wait for you.

939
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,190
I missed out on so much of your life...

940
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,990
because I was busy with work.

941
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,510
Now, I'll be there for everything.

942
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,870
Mom. I feel sick.

943
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:09,790
Grandma has to help him.

944
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,030
Jinny!

945
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,590
Stop!
