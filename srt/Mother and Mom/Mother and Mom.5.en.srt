00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,160
(All places, organizations,
characters, incidents,)

2
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,320
(and backstories in this drama are
fictitious.)

3
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,360
(Child actors were accompanied by
family...)

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,519
(and were kept safe.)

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,160
(Congratulations Grand Award)

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,400
What's that?

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
That's huge.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,880
Put that here.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,320
Good. Come here.

10
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,510
- Is it hot? - Here.

11
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,630
Oh, hot.

12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,310
So hot.

13
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,150
There it goes.

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,630
When did you get the rice cake?

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,670
Thank you for your work.

16
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,750
Mom, this isn't a festival.

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,550
Why didn't you put up a banner?

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,950
- I already ordered one. - What?

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,470
I'm going to put it up outside.

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,830
Mom.

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,110
Did you order the biggest one?

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,750
Seo-yoon's favorite color is pink.

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,750
Are you sure it's pink?

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,070
Of course. It's pink.

25
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,350
She got pink for you.

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,790
Congratulations, Seo-yoon.

27
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,030
I'm so proud of you.

28
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:18,470
Grandma, feed me.

29
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,550
Do you want some?

30
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,590
Okay.

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,110
Okay.

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,430
Congratulations.

33
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,710
Gosh.

34
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,750
Jae-man, you've made it in life.

35
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,710
Thanks to Jung-eun,

36
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,830
you got a smart daughter.

37
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,830
Yes, I've made it.

38
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,190
Congratulations.

39
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,990
- Are you happy? - Not just happy.

40
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,550
I could fly.

41
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,910
Everyone's excited thanks to you,
right?

42
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,030
Yes.

43
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,430
Let's pop champagne on a day like
this.

44
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,110
- Gosh. - Be careful.

45
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,270
This is my first time.

46
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:59,350
Thank you.

47
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,389
Do you mean it?

48
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,350
Where did the Lee Jung-eun who
yelled at me...

49
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,550
at the competition hall go?

50
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:05,949
Where did she go?

51
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,350
I don't know who that is.

52
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,390
She placed first thanks to you.

53
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,150
- Thanks. - You're my boss.

54
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,390
You placed first because you were
good, right?

55
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,430
Right?

56
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,750
You were amazing today. You were
the best.

57
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,630
Mom, are you happy that I placed
first?

58
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,070
Of course.

59
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,430
You're so cute.

60
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,910
(Grand Award)

61
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,590
Cool.

62
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,830
You can keep this.

63
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,110
It's my gift for you.

64
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,070
(Grand Award)

65
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,870
- Don't eat too much. - Okay.

66
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:44,030
Seo-yoon.

67
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,269
You're now in Class A.

68
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,910
Yes, now I'm in the same class...

69
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,150
with Tae-rin and Tommy.

70
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,549
Just like how you did in the speech
contest,

71
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,989
you can beat Tommy, right?

72
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,910
What? Beat Tommy?

73
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,470
One second.

74
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,590
Hello?

75
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,830
Really?

76
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,070
Yes, I'm on my way.

77
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,270
You're leaving?

78
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,590
Where are you going?

79
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,190
You're leaving? Where are you
going?

80
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,350
- I have to go. - Seriously?

81
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,429
We're eating without you then.

82
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,070
Sure. Go ahead.

83
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,230
Bye.

84
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,350
I brought the trophy.

85
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,230
Where's Min-ho?

86
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,350
His math tutor is coming soon.

87
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,510
He's getting ready for it.

88
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,910
Let me give this to Min-ho before I
leave.

89
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,110
Father.

90
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,510
He doesn't need it.

91
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,590
You can take it with you.

92
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,990
Are you saying it's useless unless
it's first place?

93
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,190
Yes.

94
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,350
How can you say that when you saw
how hard Min-ho--

95
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,590
Father.

96
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,390
This is a battlefield.

97
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,270
It's better to move on...

98
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,110
from failure as soon as possible.

99
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,790
Did you just say failure?

100
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,950
The boy who always placed first...

101
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,550
placed second for the first time.

102
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,110
If that's not failure, what is?

103
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,710
Min-ho is only seven.

104
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,830
Is that what you think?

105
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,150
You can stop...

106
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,830
giving him rides.

107
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,110
Thank you for your work until now.

108
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,110
Hi, Dad.

109
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,990
How did Min-ho do?

110
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,430
Actually...

111
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,550
What?

112
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,670
Didn't he win the Grand Award?

113
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,670
The contest was hectic today.

114
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,110
Some weirdo suddenly showed up.

115
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,310
- He missed... - Hey.

116
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,310
We need to talk.

117
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,830
Grandpa.

118
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,270
Min-ho.

119
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,430
You were amazing today.

120
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,629
What?

121
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,310
Who placed first?

122
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,470
Not Tommy but Claire?

123
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,749
Did Claire really place first?

124
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,629
How could that happen?

125
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,030
Okay. Bye.

126
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,950
What's going on?

127
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,310
Does that mean Claire's moving to
Class A?

128
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,390
Mom, is Claire in Class A too?

129
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,310
- Yes! - "Yes"?

130
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,110
Jason, that's not going to happen.

131
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,510
But even if that happens,

132
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:08,270
don't think about hanging out with
her, okay?

133
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,150
Why not? I like her.

134
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,110
What do you like about a kid in
Class B?

135
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:17,110
You don't even know her.

136
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,910
She's pretty.

137
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,629
I like her because she's pretty.

138
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:22,110
Oh, my gosh.

139
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,150
Jason.

140
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,070
Don't you hang out with her.

141
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,110
Don't even talk to her.

142
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,350
It's up to me. Tease-ya.

143
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,190
Gosh, that brat...

144
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,470
Jason, put that pencil away.

145
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,110
If you lose it, you'll be in big
trouble.

146
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,189
Put that away.

147
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,629
I'm giving this to Claire later.

148
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,870
Hi.

149
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,750
Ji-suk.

150
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,590
Is there really something in the
market?

151
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,110
That's not all.

152
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,950
This is awesome. Don't be
surprised.

153
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,110
What is it?

154
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,070
Today, Seo-yoon...

155
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,590
placed first in the speech contest.

156
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,350
- First place? - Yes!

157
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,750
Tommy placed second.

158
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,750
And Seo-yoon placed first!

159
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,150
Finally, she's moving...

160
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,830
to Class A at Big Parker.

161
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,150
Seo-yoon is?

162
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,830
Yes! I'm telling you.

163
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,710
I just got a call...

164
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,630
that there's a unit available at
Gongnam Apartment.

165
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,390
So I called you right away.

166
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,990
Hey, do you want to visit...

167
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,190
Divine General one more time?

168
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,190
He was pretty good.

169
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,510
- About my mom's incident too. -
Well...

170
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,350
I'm kind of busy.

171
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,270
Are you? Something wrong?

172
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,510
I thought you were close...

173
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,470
to the realtor.

174
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,590
I was going to ask you to put in a
good word for me.

175
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,510
Sorry, I didn't know you were busy.

176
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,710
I have to go.

177
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,830
I'll see you later.

178
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,230
Okay. Bye.

179
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,710
- I'll call you. - Okay.

180
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,910
Excuse me.

181
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,990
- Oh, hello. - Hi.

182
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,470
Is there just one on the market?

183
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,710
Yes.

184
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,670
It's kind of old,

185
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,430
but it's been maintained well.

186
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,750
Yes, I can tell.

187
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,310
Thank you so much.

188
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,830
It's on the ninth floor.

189
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,710
It's the best floor.

190
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,190
This way.

191
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,950
Every minute counts.

192
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,870
You shouldn't miss it.

193
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,350
I just put it on the market. That
was fast.

194
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,510
Oh, you already know.

195
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,830
Besides, it's 25 pyeong.

196
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,870
I ran here as soon as I got the
call.

197
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,990
Right. It's getting crazy...

198
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,190
near the new school year, right?

199
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,270
I actually have someone else...

200
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,870
coming later.

201
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,950
Where?

202
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,230
Jeil Real Estate.

203
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,270
You said you'd leave it to us only.

204
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,630
I'll take it.

205
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,710
You don't want to look around?

206
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,950
It's neat.

207
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,030
What's there to see?

208
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,110
Also, we only have one girl.

209
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,030
We don't have any dogs or cats.

210
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,750
And we don't plan to have any in
the future either.

211
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,110
That's great.

212
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,630
But...

213
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,350
you know the unit's for sale.

214
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,510
Sorry? You're selling?

215
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,950
I thought it was a lease.

216
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,750
Actually...

217
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,590
my daughter's getting married next
year.

218
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,950
I almost forgot.

219
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,110
So I called right away and put it
up for sale.

220
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,029
Oh, did I forget to call you?

221
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,510
What?

222
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,790
Then how much is the sales price?

223
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,190
Oh, it's the realtor again.

224
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,190
How did they know?

225
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,270
One second.

226
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,350
- What should we do? - Hello?

227
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,230
Yes.

228
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,070
You're here already?

229
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,909
But...

230
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,590
Give me one second. Okay.

231
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,950
I'm sorry.

232
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,430
They were supposed to come later,

233
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,950
but they're already in front of the
building.

234
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,270
I'll take it.

235
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,870
I'll sign the contract.

236
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,830
What? You signed the contract?

237
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,110
Today?

238
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,909
It's in Gangnam. The price won't go
down.

239
00:09:59,029 --> 00:09:59,909
It's a good school district.

240
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,110
It's a shorter commute for us.

241
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,270
Why not go there?

242
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,029
Since when...

243
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,430
were you so decisive?

244
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,750
I thought you agreed to move to
Gongnam.

245
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,390
Yes, I agreed.

246
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,550
But...

247
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,310
I'm saying we need to be realistic.

248
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,870
Gangnam...

249
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,710
It's great, but...

250
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,149
we have to worry about the budget.

251
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,630
Did you think I missed that?

252
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,510
You thought about that already?

253
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,909
First, we're selling this house.

254
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,670
Cash in our pension.

255
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,070
Max out our loans from work.

256
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,630
Except for Seo-yoon's insurance,

257
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,630
cancel pension savings and our
insurance contracts.

258
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,350
Then we only need 300 million won.

259
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,550
To make up for that...

260
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,750
You have a storefront.

261
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,710
We can sell that.

262
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,390
But...

263
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,070
Gosh.

264
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,670
It's under my name,

265
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,350
so why are you considering that?

266
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,110
What?

267
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,350
We were planning to use that for...

268
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,190
Did you mess with it already?

269
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,790
What do you mean?

270
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,830
Listen.

271
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,430
What about our later years?

272
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,909
We bought it...

273
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,190
to provide for us when we get old.

274
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,390
How can you...

275
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,070
Jung-eun.

276
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,470
I want to keep that unit for you.

277
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,110
To me, you are...

278
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,590
my highest priority.

279
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,710
You know that, right?

280
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,070
Thank you, but...

281
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,430
my highest priority is Seo-yoon.

282
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,029
You saw it too.

283
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,350
(Grand Award)

284
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,270
She beat Tommy.

285
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:49,070
She beat Tommy, the number one at
Big Parker.

286
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,510
Seo-yoon's pulling it off.

287
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,790
I'm going to do my best for her.

288
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,990
(DY Coins)

289
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,990
Gosh.

290
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,230
If Jung-eun finds out, I'm dead.

291
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,070
How come this coin never goes up?

292
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,270
Always going down...

293
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:12,790
(Jackpot)

294
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:14,270
A jackpot.

295
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,310
Yes, a jackpot.

296
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,350
Forty million...

297
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,670
Not 40 million.

298
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,750
Twenty million. Yes.

299
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,230
At least five million.

300
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,710
Dang it.

301
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,390
One billion?

302
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,710
One billion.

303
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,230
Twelve.

304
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,830
Twelve.

305
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,830
Twelve.

306
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,470
Twelve. Eight...

307
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,750
Twelve. Eight...

308
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,790
Jackpot,

309
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,390
my foot.

310
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,310
What?

311
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,750
(Jackpot)

312
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,110
"Never change"?

313
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,350
Why won't it change?

314
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,550
Why? Why won't my life change?

315
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,909
Hey. Get lost.

316
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,350
I heard Claire placed first.

317
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,270
Really?

318
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,390
What about Tommy?

319
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,630
He placed second.

320
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,310
Really?

321
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,870
Seo-yoon's mom was so happy
yesterday.

322
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,510
Did you celebrate yesterday?

323
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,550
Yes.

324
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,110
Seo-yoon's grandma threw a party.

325
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,430
It was a big one.

326
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,630
Good job.

327
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,110
We had a party too.

328
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,070
Tae-rin's mom...

329
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,870
What's going on?

330
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,350
They're making such a huge fuss...

331
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,470
over a single award.

332
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,990
Tell me about it.

333
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,710
So cheap and tacky.

334
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,190
They seem to know we're talking
about them.

335
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,550
Yes.

336
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,590
By the way, what is up with that...

337
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,830
old and moldy stench?

338
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,950
Exactly.

339
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,270
Nursing home alert.

340
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,350
Refreshing.

341
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,790
Good.

342
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,950
Try?

343
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,110
It's nice.

344
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,990
Would you shut your mouth...

345
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,110
- and be quiet? - Oh, my gosh.

346
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,590
What did you just say?

347
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,790
What?

348
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,430
You were talking in English until
now.

349
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,830
Why are you suddenly playing dumb?

350
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,630
Did you spend money and time to
learn...

351
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,470
so you can gossip?

352
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,670
Besides, why are you wearing
sunglasses...

353
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,390
inside?

354
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,790
Are you going to a ball?

355
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,190
Did you get double eyelids or
something again?

356
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,190
"Again"?

357
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,030
Don't you know fashion?

358
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,470
It's not because I can't speak
English.

359
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,870
But I don't want to speak in
English. Please...

360
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,990
shut up!

361
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,510
Oh, my gosh.

362
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,710
What are you doing? Have some
manners.

363
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,030
What?

364
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,190
Have some manners?

365
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,950
I see you have a few memorized...

366
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,390
lines up your sleeve,

367
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,790
but what you did just now was...

368
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,470
absolutely rude.

369
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,350
Do you understand what I'm saying?

370
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,270
I knew it.

371
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,590
She only picked up one phrase.

372
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,070
How vulgar.

373
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,830
Why not? Keep talking in English.

374
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,510
That's all you memorized?

375
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,150
Granny here seems totally fazed.

376
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,670
Look at her.

377
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,310
She's sweating like a pig.

378
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,310
That's it.

379
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,230
You have crossed the line.

380
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,670
Enough is enough.

381
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,110
If you don't have the courage to
say that...

382
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,070
to my face in Korean,

383
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,030
then keep your mouth shut.

384
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,630
Everyone here gets it.

385
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,630
What if the children hear you?

386
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,870
What a day.

387
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,830
Let's go.

388
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,270
Wait for me.

389
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,030
When I was watching a movie,

390
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,310
I knew that was it.

391
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,390
I told my daughter to write it
down...

392
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,950
and memorized it.

393
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,550
Were you able to tell?

394
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,230
You were great.

395
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,990
Really? How was my pronunciation?

396
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,470
Good.

397
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,910
My goodness.

398
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,190
How are you so good at English?

399
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,590
I'm not good at all.

400
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,590
Of course, she's good.

401
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,350
No wonder Claire won the Grand
Award.

402
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,070
My goodness. Did you teach her?

403
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,590
Not just English.

404
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,030
She worked as an art therapist...

405
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,390
until recently at a university
hospital.

406
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,870
I see.

407
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,470
(Ji-a)

408
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,590
(Ji-a)

409
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,030
(Ms. Yoon)

410
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,190
Yes.

411
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,070
This is how I should start.

412
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,830
Unfortunately,

413
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,630
as of today...

414
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,310
What if it's only unfortunate for
me?

415
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:46,110
That would be awkward.

416
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,630
Due to...

417
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,590
an unavoidable reason...

418
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,310
(Message from Ji-a)

419
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,949
You're late today.

420
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,310
Aren't you coming?

421
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,750
Due to an unavoidable reason,

422
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,030
I won't be giving Min-ho rides
anymore.

423
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,110
What's wrong?

424
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,590
Who is it from?

425
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,550
Well...

426
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,390
That's...

427
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,990
Are you really going to...

428
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,590
accept them in Class A?

429
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,150
Are you crazy?

430
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,270
Right?

431
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,949
It's a mess in the academy...

432
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,830
after the speech contest.

433
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,350
What are you going to do?

434
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,030
If you just say no,

435
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,350
they won't listen.

436
00:19:02,469 --> 00:19:03,630
Of course not.

437
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,390
That's what I'm saying.

438
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,390
They won't walk out on their own.

439
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,630
We'll have to make them leave on
their own.

440
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,630
That way,

441
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,750
they won't cause any problems.

442
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,949
Right.

443
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,430
But last time I noticed...

444
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,670
she was a handful.

445
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,350
She was showing off big time...

446
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:23,110
for winning a single award.

447
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,310
What an eyesore.

448
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,510
Still, it's the benefit.

449
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,550
Whose side are you on?

450
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,870
They're on the same side,

451
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,830
so she can't stand to hear it.

452
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:40,990
No, Ms. Song. What I mean is...

453
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,350
From now on, you don't have to join
us...

454
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:43,790
at the moms' meeting for Class A.

455
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,469
No.

456
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,510
It was my mistake.

457
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,670
Did you say you worked at the same
company...

458
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,310
as Claire's mom?

459
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,630
Yes.

460
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,590
Are you pretending to be nice...

461
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:58,910
or are you being a fool?

462
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:02,469
You quit your job for your child...

463
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,870
so you could give her rides to the
academy.

464
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,550
And only after winning a prize in a
speech contest,

465
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,310
her child is going up to Class A.

466
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,590
Don't you feel it's unfair?

467
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,030
You need to intervene quickly...

468
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,510
and nip problems in the bud.

469
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,469
I forgot. I brought a cake on my
way.

470
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,750
Shall I go to the kitchen...

471
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,390
and cut some for you?

472
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,070
I can do that.

473
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,590
You can stay here.

474
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,430
All right, then.

475
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,469
What are you doing?

476
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,270
You should go and help her.

477
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,070
Okay.

478
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,870
Excuse me. Can you clean this up?

479
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,750
Okay.

480
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,550
Goodness.

481
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,510
Huh?

482
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:14,910
What's this?

483
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,150
Did she throw this away?

484
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,630
(Top Excellence Award)

485
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,230
She's unbelievable.

486
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,590
(Myeongseong)

487
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,830
Number seven, please.

488
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,790
- Number seven. - Really?

489
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,270
Let me take a look.

490
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,510
I saw it was seven.

491
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,990
Why is this ball here?

492
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,990
(Jung-eun)

493
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,350
Today, Seo-yoon...

494
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,550
placed first...

495
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,150
in the speech contest.

496
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,030
Tommy placed second.

497
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,190
And Seo-yoon placed first!

498
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,469
Finally, she's moving to Class A at
Big Parker.

499
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,990
(Jung-eun)

500
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,070
No.

501
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,910
She said she'll make Seo-yoon...

502
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,910
go to Gongnam Elementary.

503
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,990
Where are you going this early?

504
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,949
Did I wake you up?

505
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,230
You should get some more sleep.

506
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,430
Where are you going?

507
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,590
Well, it's...

508
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,190
I'll go and be a devoted son today.

509
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,150
What did you say?

510
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,469
It's nothing.

511
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,310
Don't worry.

512
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,670
See you.

513
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,070
Honey...

514
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,310
Hey...

515
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,110
(Madam Shin's Gukbap)

516
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,910
(Grand Award Winner Hong Seo-yoon,)

517
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,750
(Madam Shin's Granddaughter)

518
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,430
I heard you have more customers
these days.

519
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,350
Don't get me started.

520
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:14,550
I'm so busy standing here in the
kitchen all day.

521
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,110
You must not even have time to
count all your money.

522
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,830
Shall I go and count it for you?

523
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,709
Counting money is my only joy.

524
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,750
I've counted it already.

525
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,830
Don't forget to boil that meat
thoroughly.

526
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:24,750
Don't worry. I finished it.

527
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,110
Gosh, it's hot!

528
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,790
Look at you.

529
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:29,469
Are you okay?

530
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,270
Come on.

531
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,949
Are you worried about me?

532
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,030
Don't get me wrong.

533
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,830
I called you to help me out here,

534
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:37,230
and you'll be useless if you hurt
your hand.

535
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,750
How sweet.

536
00:24:39,949 --> 00:24:40,990
Goodness.

537
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,190
Mom, you know...

538
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,590
I have no money.

539
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:46,750
What?

540
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,190
I can tell what you are up to.

541
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,830
You really have no money?

542
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,590
No, not for you.

543
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:54,910
Then how about for Seo-yoon?

544
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,670
Why would that child need money
from me?

545
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,230
See? You only know how to make
money.

546
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,709
You have no idea what's going on in
the world.

547
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,310
- What? - Mom.

548
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,350
Do you know how much money you need
to raise a child?

549
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,469
You need money because you're
greedy as a parent.

550
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,590
Don't think about following other
parents...

551
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:10,949
and doing what they do.

552
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,190
Seo-yoon is a genius!

553
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,030
You were called a genius too, when
you were little.

554
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,070
Stop exaggerating.

555
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,230
Seo-yoon entered the speech
contest...

556
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,190
and won the Grand Award.

557
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,990
That's why you hung the banner
here!

558
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:23,590
That's true.

559
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,550
So how much do you need?

560
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,910
I need 300 million won for now.
Then...

561
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,390
- Hey! - You surprised me.

562
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,790
You're out of your mind.

563
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,590
You don't have to leave me...

564
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,950
an inheritance later.

565
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,750
Can't you lend me some money when I
need it?

566
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,710
My goodness, you punk.

567
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,590
It's like you're wishing me...

568
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,710
dead now!

569
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,190
What are you saying?

570
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,710
Stop talking nonsense and get out!

571
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,350
Yes, I will get out.

572
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,550
You can just give me the money.

573
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,230
I can't.

574
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,470
300 million? I can't believe it.

575
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,470
Then you can give it in
installments.

576
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,550
You can give me 10 million won 30
times.

577
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,470
How about that? Isn't it a good
idea?

578
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,710
Let go of my hands.

579
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,430
Close your mouth and work, or
leave!

580
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,790
My gosh.

581
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,270
I'm not going to see you again!

582
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,430
How come I have a son like you?

583
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,670
Goodness gracious.

584
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,070
- Ma'am! - What?

585
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,870
- Old lady. - How dare you!

586
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,150
I'm not your son anymore.

587
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,510
I'm not going to say goodbye.

588
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,550
Look at you.

589
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,110
Hey!

590
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,790
Hello. How are you?

591
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,630
- How are you? - What brings you
here?

592
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,070
I was just passing by.

593
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,310
How is your business?

594
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,510
Great. Thanks to you.

595
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,990
Everything is perfect.

596
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,390
Congratulations.

597
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,430
I have customers.

598
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,910
- Please excuse me. - Sure.

599
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,790
Welcome.

600
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,230
This shop isn't mine anymore.

601
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,230
The bank owns it now.

602
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,630
Gosh, I must have been crazy.

603
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,790
It's all because of the coin!

604
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,270
Gosh, I'm going to lose this too.

605
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,790
If Jung-eun finds out, she'll file
for divorce.

606
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,750
Ms. Lee.

607
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,590
Please take care of this.

608
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,270
By the way,

609
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,550
did you apply for the loan?

610
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,830
Now, I'm a resident of Gongnam-
dong.

611
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,190
I don't need to register my address
falsely.

612
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,630
Oh, my.

613
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,350
Is the marketing plan for our new
product...

614
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,070
proceeding all right?

615
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,390
I'll finish it by next week.

616
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,990
- Min-hee. - Yes.

617
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,390
Did you send the data of customer
reviews?

618
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,230
Yes, I sent it to your email.

619
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,310
Okay.

620
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,790
Ms. Lee, you need to handle the TR
case quickly,

621
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,070
but we take precedence. Don't
forget that.

622
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,510
Of course, I understand.

623
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,870
Why? Do you need to leave?

624
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,310
It's a very important day.

625
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,950
There's a get-together for Class
A...

626
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,310
at Seo-yoon's academy.

627
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,310
Why isn't anyone coming?

628
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,110
Gosh.

629
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,310
Goodness.

630
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,310
Oh, gosh.

631
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,510
Are you here for the get-together
for Class A?

632
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,590
Yes, and who are you?

633
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,550
I'm Seo-yoon's mom...

634
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,910
I mean Claire's mom.

635
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,030
I see.

636
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,550
Nice to meet you.

637
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,310
I'm Tae-rin's mom.

638
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,470
I've heard a lot about you from
Tae-rin.

639
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,430
Same here.

640
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,910
Please sit here.

641
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,870
Excuse me?

642
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,630
This area is for moms in Class A.

643
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,950
I see.

644
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,190
Is there a separate area for each
class?

645
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,270
Yes.

646
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,150
It stings.

647
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,910
Gosh, really.

648
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,750
The static gets worse...

649
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,590
during the winter.

650
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,910
This is new. You can have it.

651
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,670
Thank you.

652
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,190
It's a very good product.

653
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,590
Actually, I'm a marketer at Aaes.

654
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,950
For skincare products, rather than
my company,

655
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,430
TR produces better items.

656
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,590
I heard you're a working mom too.

657
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,790
Right.

658
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,630
To be honest,

659
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,630
I slept only four hours last night.

660
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,790
I feel so tired now.

661
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,510
Goodness. I see.

662
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,630
I also have a lot of work to do
these days.

663
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,470
I'm darn busy...

664
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,070
that I'm not in my right mind.

665
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,470
What are you talking about, Ms.
Song?

666
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,910
She can't just join Class A like
that.

667
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,590
The benefit of winning the speech
contest...

668
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,790
only applies to skipping the level
test for Class A.

669
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,230
You didn't say that before.

670
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,150
Children who fall behind in every
class...

671
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,630
can't stay in Class A.

672
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,830
"Fall behind"?

673
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,430
Who's falling behind? Seo-yoon?

674
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,910
Are you not confident?

675
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,470
That's nonsense.

676
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,030
She didn't win the Grand Award by
luck.

677
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,710
Then,

678
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,630
you can give it a try.

679
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,190
So, what do we need to do?

680
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,630
First of all, get your child
vaccinated for the flu.

681
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,670
(Mission to enter Class A, flu
shot)

682
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,910
With many children in the same
classroom,

683
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,430
they become prone to infections.

684
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,750
That's right.

685
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,150
In addition,

686
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,590
both of you meet many people,

687
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,350
being working moms.

688
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,030
You're right.

689
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,670
To keep our children healthy,

690
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,790
I can do that.

691
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,550
All right, I will.

692
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,910
And what else do I need to do?

693
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,910
Go to a large hospital...

694
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,390
and get her psychologically tested.

695
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,550
(Mission 2 to enter Class A,
psychological test)

696
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,830
If your child can't focus in class,

697
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,390
other students in Class A...

698
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,350
will suffer.

699
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,590
She's right.

700
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,590
Right before entering elementary
school,

701
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,270
children are totally sensitive.

702
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,230
But a psychological test within two
weeks?

703
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,070
Even if I make an appointment now,

704
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,510
I will have to wait at least a
month.

705
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,270
We all did that, Jung-eun.

706
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,030
If you can't do it,

707
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,750
you'd better give up.

708
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,910
All right, I will do it.

709
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,910
Are we done now?

710
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,070
No, not yet.

711
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,110
The most important one remains.

712
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,230
The Lucid children's intelligence
test.

713
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,590
(Mission 3, Lucid children's
intelligence test)

714
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,550
Pardon?

715
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,430
If she's within the top one
percent, we'll accept her.

716
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,270
But Tommy is within the top 0.1
percent!

717
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,390
We can cut her some slack.

718
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,870
She won the Grand Award, after all.

719
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,830
Why? Don't you think she can make
it?

720
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,150
If you don't think she can,

721
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,270
she needs to take the level test.

722
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,510
Not at all.

723
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,390
She will take the Lucid test.

724
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,390
She needs to take the test...

725
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,830
at the gifted academy we designate.

726
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,870
These days, there are so many
gifted academies...

727
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,390
that we can't trust the test
results.

728
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,630
That's what I'm saying.

729
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,150
When children take the test at
those places...

730
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,710
and get a good result,

731
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,790
people believe that their
children...

732
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,630
are actually gifted.

733
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,670
So where's this place?

734
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,470
CM Gifted Academy.

735
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,830
We can trust that institution.

736
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,270
I will make an appointment...

737
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,870
so that she can take the test.

738
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,550
But it should be done within two
weeks.

739
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,710
Doing it within two weeks...

740
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,110
I mean, so soon?

741
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,510
How about you?

742
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,270
I will take this opportunity to get
her tested.

743
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,030
I'm also curious...

744
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,550
about Tae-rin's test result.

745
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,670
I will do it.

746
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,430
But you need to keep your promise
this time.

747
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,670
Of course.

748
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,150
I wish you good luck.

749
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,910
Do you think you can do it?

750
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,510
Sure.

751
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,990
Don't you think Seo-yoon can make
it?

752
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,870
Seo-yoon was in the top 0.8 percent
before.

753
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,910
Wait and see.

754
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,430

755

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,510

759
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,990
The Lucid test for infants.

760
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,630
But now she needs to take the Lucid
test for children.

761
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,510
Do you happen to know...

762
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,230

763
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,790

764
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,630
She said...

765
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,110
she'd make an appointment for you.

766
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,270
My daughter can't take the test...

767
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,870
in two weeks without any
preparation.

768
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,910
Joining Class A depends on the
result.

769
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,270
I think, for practice,

770
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,790
she needs to take the test...

771
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,470
at another gifted academy.

772
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,350
Do we need to do that?

773
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,110
Let's put them on the waiting
list...

774
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,430
at an available academy.

775
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,830
Can I get your number, please?

776
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,990
Okay.

that class?

779
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,310
I will do it.

780
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,950
I will put Seo-yoon in Class A.

781
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:57,230
That's enough.

782
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,430
She's saying she doesn't want to
accept Seo-yoon.

783
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,870
Why are you obsessed with Class A?

784
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,670
Seo-yoon did such a great job.

785
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,670
And you're saying I just have to
give up?

786
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,030
Then are you going to complete all
of these?

787

Children don't feel well for
several days...

788
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,670

of these...

791
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,870
Seo-yoon is only seven years old.

792
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,870
She has a lot of opportunities
ahead.

793
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,910
This isn't her only chance--

794
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,990
No.

795
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,110
There's a timing for an
opportunity.

The teacher said I need a parent to
sign here.

804

How about going...

805
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,990
to a regular high school?

806
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,150

Today,

808
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,630
I quit my job at the school.

809
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,630
Is it because of her?

810
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,750
Why are you quitting, not her?

811
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,069
I will get a new job soon.

812
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,670

first,

813

- and later... - Mom.

If I can't do it now, when can I?

817
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,350
Why, because of someone I don't
even know,

818
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,710
can't I go to the school I want?

819

I didn't tell you,

825
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,910
but I was very upset.

changed.

932
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:18,350
Yes! It's possible.

933
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,230
Okay.

934
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,830
Okay.

935
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:27,790
Where are you?

936
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,310
Where else? The academy.

937
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,549
Seo-yoon has her gifted academy
exam tomorrow.

938
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:34,710
Tomorrow?

939
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,950
You said it's in two weeks!

940
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,430
I think we should do a practice
run,

941
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:39,470
just in case.

942
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:41,350
It's a bit far, so she needs to
head straight there...

943
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,390
after the academy.

944
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,750
I'll send you the location.

945
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,150
And how about the hospital?

946
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,270
I'm going after the academy.

947
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,549
You are? Thanks so much.

948
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:55,030
I'm both loved and hated a dozen
times a day.

949
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,670
Come on.

950
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,549
Love you.

951
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,910
Let's go.

952
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,069
There.

953
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,670
Bye.

954
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,150
Bye, Tae-rin.

955
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,750
- Bye. - It must be a busy day
today.

956
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,630
- Good luck. - Thanks.

957
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:16,830
What?

958
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,190
Look who it is!

959
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,230
Hello.

960
00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:26,990
- Hello. - Hello.

961
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,950
I heard you got fired from your
driving duty,

962
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:30,230
so what brings you here?

963
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,390
I think Tommy's mom already fetched
him.

964
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,310
I happened to be in the area,

965
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,470
and I was just walking past the
building...

966
00:44:39,549 --> 00:44:41,750
- when I saw-- - I see.

967
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,230
You happened to pass by the
building...

968
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,230
just when we were coming out.

969
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:49,950
Goodness.

970
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,750
I have plans,

971
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,549
so we should get going, Tae-rin.

972
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:57,350
Have a good time, you two.

973
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,549
Let's go.

974
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,390
- Bye, sis. - Bye.

975
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,710
- Let's go. - Bye, Tae-rin.

976
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,030
Bye.

977
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,750
We should get going too.

978
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,790
Right.

979
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,190
I am sorry,

980
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,510
but I need to take Seo-yoon
somewhere.

981
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:13,390
Right.

982
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,430
Where are you going? May I tag
along?

983
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,230
Sorry?

984
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,510
I have nothing to do now, you see.

985
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,710
Are you bored?

986
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,790
Yes.

987
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,589
I'm a little bored, honestly.

988
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,630
We're going to the hospital.

989
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:31,950
Hospital?

990
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,710
Are you unwell?

991
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,110
No, not me.

992
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,630
Seo-yoon has a psychological exam
today...

993
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,990
at the hospital I used to work at.

994
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,750
I'll drive you there.

995
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,470
I'm a great driver.

996
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,549
I have...

997
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,950
plenty of time as well.

998
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,870
What plans do you have?

999
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,710
When did we start having secrets?

1000
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,390
I have no plans.

1001
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,589
It was just me knowing the right
time to leave.

1002
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:08,310
Did you forget what I told you last
time, Tae-rin?

1003
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,750
You've got to know when to stay and
when to get out.

1004
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:11,870
Did you already forget?

1005
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,190
But wasn't it too deliberate?

1006
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,630
People should be honest!

1007
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,310
Seo-yoon and Min-ho--

1008
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,589
Girl, did you hear anything I just
said?

1009
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,750
What do you know when you haven't
even lived 10 years?

1010
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,430
Why would you bring up age right
now?

1011
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:29,350
I'm turning 70 soon, you see.

1012
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,549
I'm a solid seven.

1013
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,110
Goodness gracious me.

1014
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,710
Who raised you?

1015
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,310
Who do you think? It was you, of
course.

1016
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,470
Aren't you proud you raised me
well?

1017

(Hanguk University Hospital)

1018
00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:47,990
You're going to draw a house, a
tree, and a person now.

1019
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,870
Let's start with the house. How
does that sound?

1020
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,069
Okay.

1021
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,950
Doctor, I think I drew it wrong.

1022
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:12,310
Can I erase it and try again?

1023
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,910
Just draw however you want.

(Dept. of Pediatrics)

1025
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:45,990
You're here, Dr. Yoon.

1026
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,950
Thank you, Director.

1027
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:51,110
No problem at all.

1028
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,310
There's a big gap in the art
therapy studio...

1029
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,230
with you gone.

1030
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,390
I'm sorry.

1031
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,510
I've heard...

1032
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,390
that Su-chan is doing much better,

1033
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,870
and his mom's been calm.

1034
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,589
That's a relief.

1035
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,350
That brings me to ask you...

1036
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,870
You should come back.

1037
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,790
Your position is still available.

1038
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:12,470
Right.

1039
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:14,430
Well...

1040
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:16,110
Take your time to think about it.

1041
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,270
I'll be waiting.

1042
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,830
What's on your mind? Just do it.

1043
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,069
Do what?

1044
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,230
I overheard earlier.

1045
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:43,589
Right.

1046
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,510
It's something you love, right?

1047
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,270
Why hesitate?

1048
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,069
It's Seo-yoon's exam tomorrow.

1049
00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:54,030
I can't just quit.

1050
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,670
If you don't have time,

1051
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,069
I'll pitch in with the rides.

1052
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,430
I will drive you and Seo-yoon.

1053
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,110
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

1054
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,230
Now that I'm on break, I have a lot
of free time.

1055
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,230
Call me anytime.

1056
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,589
Why are you looking at me like
that?

1057
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,270
You just reminded me of something.

1058
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:19,990
Sorry?

1059
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:22,950
I used to have someone like you...

1060
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,030
who would talk to me like you,
Professor.

1061
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:31,430
I am sorry. I shouldn't have said
it.

1062
00:49:31,549 --> 00:49:32,549
It's okay.

1063
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:36,910
I actually forgot about it,

1064
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,950
but thanks to you, I remembered
something good.

1065
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:45,350
Thank you for that.

1066
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:54,750
I completely forgot about Seo-
yoon's vaccination!

1067
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,670

(Lucid Final)

1069
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,110
- Mom. - You're home.

1070
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:09,670
You're back.

1071
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,430
You're home early.

1072
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,230
- Well done. - Seo-yoon.

1073
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,110
Seo-yoon, you have the exam
tomorrow,

1074
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,190
so let's study a little...

1075
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,590
before dinner, okay?

1076
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,350
What are you doing, making her
study after a flu shot?

1077
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,950
Can't you see she's exhausted?

1078
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:25,190
Let her rest.

1079
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,590
Stop it, Mom.

1080
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:30,870
She's fine, see?

1081
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,030
Just a little bit, all right?

1082
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,470
But I want to watch Pinkru.

1083
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,230
We'll watch it later, okay?

1084
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,750
After the exam is over, we'll watch
it. Okay?

1085
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,670
I feel dizzy though.

1086
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:43,790
You feel dizzy?

1087
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,070
Is it serious, Seo-yoon?

1088
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,510
No, just a little bit.

1089
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:48,910
Goodness.

1090
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,510
See? I told you this would happen
if you pushed her.

1091
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,630
This isn't for me, you know.

1092
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,230
Goodness, no.

1093
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:57,390
Don't say that.

1094
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,230
She can get dizzy, you know.

1095
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,590
Princess, let's go lie down.

1096
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,670
Daddy will make it go away.

1097
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:06,910
- Let's go. - Hey--

1098
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,270
Let's go to your room.

1099
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,230
But she needs to prepare.

1100
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:20,950
Seo-yoon, was it a tiring day?

1101
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,070
It was.

1102
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:23,910
Let's get some sleep then.

1103
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,550
You should rest well...

1104
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,110
so you're ready for your exam
tomorrow.

1105
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,310
Getting good rest is important,

1106
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,030
especially during these growing
years, you know?

1107
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,550
Only then will you be able to stay
focused.

1108
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:33,670
Okay?

1109
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,830
- Okay. - Good night.

1110
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:40,030
Goodness.

1111
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,430
I wish I could just sleep like
this, too.

1112
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,190
Today's vaccination record.

1113
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:49,470
Goodness.

1114
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,310
(Vaccinated)

1115
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,470
Gosh.

1116
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,870
She was such a pretty baby.

1117
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,350
Are you saying she's not pretty
now?

1118
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:09,350
She's just as pretty now, of
course.

1119
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,430
But she's even prettier when she's
not sick. Right?

1120
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:14,230
- Thank you for taking her today. -
Wait.

1121
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,830
Are you saying it's my fault she's
sick?

1122
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,070
Well, isn't it?

1123
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,510
That's not it, you know.

1124
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,350
Anyway, at least one mission is
complete.

1125
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,430
Wait, no!

1126
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:29,070
The psychological exam too. We got
two done.

1127
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,270
Two done.

1128
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:32,750
Well done.

1129
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:36,510
You're here?

1130
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,870
I'll be right down. I'll take the
elevator.

1131
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,950
Yes, Tae-rin's mom.

1132
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,030
Okay.

1133
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,230
"Tae-rin's mom"?

1134
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,230
You really didn't have to come all
the way here.

1135
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:54,110
I could've just sent these to you.

1136
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,430
Come on, you went through a lot to
get these.

1137
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,190
I can't just take them for free.

1138
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,190
And...

1139
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,390
thanks for the hand cream last
time.

1140
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:09,470
Goodness, this is a lot.

1141
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,310
Does she really need to go through
all of these?

1142
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,870
Seo-yoon already started.

1143
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,470
Already?

1144
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:20,990
We're on a tight schedule.

1145
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,750
Goodness, Ms. Lee?

1146
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,430
So, not a business meeting.

1147
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,830
Looks like you have plenty of free
time.

1148
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,710
Not your business. Can you go now?

1149
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,270
What even is all this?

1150
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,430
You've got your hands in a lot of
things.

1151
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,470
By the way, you do realize your
meeting...

1152
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,110
with the TR CEO is coming up,
right?

1153
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,870
Yet here you are, sitting around
with another mom...

1154
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,990
during office hours.

1155
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,470
I told you.

1156
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,550
I'll get the meeting done before
the deadline.

1157
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,830
Sure, sure. Whatever you say,
Senior Manager Lee.

1158
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:59,550
Please make it happen.

1159
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,230
Sorry about that.

1160
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,870
She's quite rude.

1161
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,150
Yeah, I can tell.

1162
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,590
She also looks like she sucks at
her job.

1163
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,190
You're right.

1164
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:29,470

1166
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,830
I heard your exchange program got
approved.

1167
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,390
Did you see the email?

1168
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,470
Yes.

1169
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,390
I'm looking at it now.

1170
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:39,950
Congratulations.

1171
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,790
Thanks.

(Exchange Visitor Short Term

1173
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,830
Goodness, I'm late.

1174
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:56,790
Seo-yoon, hurry.

1175
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,510
We need extra time since it's our
first visit.

1176
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,790
- Should we run? - Let's run!

1177
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:01,950
See you later!

1178
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,270
Bye!

1179
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,110
- Bye! - Bye!

1180
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,550
We should get going too.

1181
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:10,910
What?

1182
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,070
Oh, dear.

1183
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,790
Who are you looking for with that
lovesick face?

1184
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:30,950
Goodness gracious me.

1185
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,430
Watching him is painful.

1186
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,430
Goodness.

1187
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,110
There's a person passing. Wait,
will you?

1188
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,430
Seo-yoon, are you okay?

1189
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,830
Yes.

1190
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,190
Darn it!

1191
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,270
This is so annoying.

1192
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:26,870
Too annoying.

1193
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,350
Get out.

1194
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,710
I'm scared.

1195
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,630
It's okay, sweetie.

1196
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,510
Get out!

1197
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,030
Let's talk.

1198
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:42,790
- Seo-yoon. Don't get out. - Darn
it.

1199
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:44,470
- Lock the door, okay? - Won't you
get out?

1200
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:45,470
Okay.

1201
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,270
Get out of the car!

1202
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,270
I knew it.

1203
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,110
Another woman driver.

1204
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,030
Stay home if you can't drive.

1205
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,830
Are you colorblind?

1206
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:59,950
Didn't you see the green light?

1207
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,030
You have to drive forward when it's
a green light!

1208
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:03,230
Green light!

1209
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,750
There was a pedestrian.

1210
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,430
What was I supposed to do, run her
over?

1211
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,110
This lady just doesn't get it!

1212
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:10,430
I'm in a darn hurry!

1213
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,470
I'll kick you!

1214
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,110
I will just...

1215
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,430
What are you doing?

1216
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,790
What am I doing?

1217
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,470
I will just hit you right in the
neck--

1218
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:19,630
What?

1219
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,750
- Move your car. - Who are you?

1220
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,190
Let go of me.

1221
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,070
- Are you okay? - I am not okay!

1222
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,590
Let go of me!

1223
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,510
Move your car, I said!

1224
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,230
Amazing!

1225
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,350
(We thank Kim Ki-moo for his
special appearance.)

Isn't it a delivery mistake?

1229

Where's the money?

1230
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,790
She has to be in the top one
percent within two weeks!

1231
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:31,070
From now on,

1232
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,230
I will be your designated driver.

1233

It's a Christmas present.

1234
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:36,350
Why are you burning up?

1235

Mommy,

1236
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,190
I am sorry.

1237
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:40,230
What happened?

1238
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,230
What did the doctor say?

1239
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,550
Jung-eun, seriously.

1240
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:45,510
Please give her one more chance. I
beg you.

1241
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,590
Is she out of her mind?
