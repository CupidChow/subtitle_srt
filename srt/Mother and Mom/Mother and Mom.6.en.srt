(and were kept safe.)

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,640
(Episode 6)

12
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,040
What would you have done without me?

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,840
I know.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,610
Thank you.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,330
Why are there cars stopped on the road?

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,930
That's Seo-yoon's car.

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,050
The light changed.

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,850
Then move forward.

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,930
Seriously.

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,290
What are you doing?

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,490
What am I doing?

22
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,090
I will just hit you right in the neck--

23
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,130
What?

24
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,290
Move your car.

25
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,170
Who are you? Let go of me.

26
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:12,770
- Are you okay? - I am not okay!

27
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,610
Let go of me!

28
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,850
Move your car, I said!

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,930
Amazing!

30
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,370
Are you all right?

31
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,730
- You... - Behind you.

32
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,810
- Seriously. - Hey.

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,010
Look here.

34
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,689
Okay.

35
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,570
What are you doing? Are you taking pictures
of me?

36
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:34,730
Why are you taking pictures of me? What
are you doing?

37
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,730
What else? It's for proof of assault.

38
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,450
I didn't lay a hand on them.

39
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,970
You were close.

40
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,490
Go on with what you were doing.

41
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,250
Prosecutor Lee? It's me.

42
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,850
How many years in prison do you get...

43
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,850
for beating people?

44
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,850
But I didn't hit anyone.

45
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,010
I see.

46
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,250
It depends on whether it's assault or special
assault?

47
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,290
Okay.

48
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,290
It's just one bald guy with no tools.

49
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,890
Is that just assault?

50
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,530
What's the maximum time he'd get?

51
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,050
But I didn't hit them.

52
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,090
Gosh, when you reach this age,

53
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,650
my bones just break from touching.

54
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,690
It aches even from the wind.

55
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,650
Okay.

56
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,250
I see.

57
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,170
It takes eight weeks for me to recover...

58
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:16,890
even from a touch.

59
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,810
When did I touch you?

60
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,330
I have to go. Bye.

61
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,770
- I'm off. - Hey.

62
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,210
He's running away as fast as he can.

63
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,490
Nice timing.

64
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,890
Perfect?

65
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,610
Good. That was awesome.

66
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,010
- Tae-rin. - Seo-yoon.

67
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,690
Tae-rin.

68
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,130
Mi-chun.

69
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,050
You know someone in the prosecution?

70
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,130
This?

71
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,410
This number is not in service.

72
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,490
What?

73
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,729
Anyway, are you okay?

74
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,610
Yes, you were amazing.

75
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:02,130
That scared me big time.

76
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,810
You were impressive.

77
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,050
I'm glad we got here on time.

78
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,450
You must've been shocked.

79
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,490
I will take the wheel now.

80
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,770
Come with me.

81
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,610
Go.

82
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,370
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

83
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,690
Tae-rin, let's go.

84
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,370
Hello. How can I help you?

85
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,370
We're here for the Lucid Test.

86
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,010
It's Hong Seo-yoon and Min Tae-rin.

87
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,730
The teacher will be here soon.

88
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,210
- Please wait. - Okay.

89
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,170
I'm your counselor Lee Yong-ho.

90
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,930
- Hello. - Hello.

91
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,890
Who's Tae-rin that made an appointment
today?

92
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,330
That's me.

93
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,730
Nice to meet you.

94
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,690
- Ready to come with me? - Yes.

95
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,090
This way.

96
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,850
Hong Seo-yoon?

97
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,410
- Yes. - Shall we?

98
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,490
Seo-yoon, just relax.

99
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,810
Nothing to be afraid of.

100
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,130
You can do it, right?

101
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,530
I'll see you later.

102
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,730
This way.

103
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,090
Can you match what you see in the picture?

104
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,250
Yes.

105
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,010
Stop.

106
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,890
Good job.

107
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,610
This is amazing.

108
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,410
Stop.

109
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,570
Can you draw what you see?

110
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,250
Yes.

111
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,489
Now, can you draw that again...

112
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,850
from memory?

113
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,250
Sorry?

114
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,929
Okay.

115
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,090
Well done. Bye.

116
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,049
Bye.

117
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,890
- Good job, Tae-rin. - Bye.

118
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,570
Grandma.

119
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,049
Seo-yoon, was it hard?

120
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,410
It was okay.

121
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,890
I had so much fun.

122
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,010
Seo-yoon, didn't you enjoy it?

123
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,970
Are you sure that was a test, Grandma?

124
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,650
Then I want to take it again next time.

125
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,530
Sure. If you want, take it again.

126
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,970
It's all coming from your mom's pocket, not
mine.

127
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,330
Let's go.

128
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,890
She must be very tired.

129
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,370
She must've been nervous...

130
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:12,770
to deal with a new counselor.

131
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,890
You should get some sleep too.

132
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,530
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

133
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,770
How can I sleep when you're driving?

134
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,050
You don't trust my driving skills?

135
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,650
That's not it.

136
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,010
Do you want me to make a U-turn here?

137
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,890
I trust you.

138
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,130
So please keep going straight.

139
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,450
Yes, I'll keep going straight.

140
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,610
Why did you look at my hands?

141
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,210
Something on my hands?

142
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,530
No.

143
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,410
You don't wear a ring?

144
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,290
Do you have any allergies?

145
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,130
No, I don't have any.

146
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,130
It's bothersome when I'm working.

147
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,690
I see.

148
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,650
Excuse me.

149
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,370
Yes, Jung-eun.

150
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,730
How did Seo-yoon's test go?

151
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,890
Do you have the result?

152
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,930
What's the score?

153
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,010
Slow down. Let's talk at home.

154
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,330
Seo-yoon's sleeping.

155
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,770
Did she not do well?

156
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,250
What was her score?

157
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,810
Grandpa, I need to use the restroom.

158
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,970
Jung-eun, I'm driving. I have to go.

159
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,010
What?

160
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,050
Did she not do well on the test?

161
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,730
That's not good.

162
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,010
Thank you for everything today.

163
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,370
Bye.

164
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,810
Can I have my key back?

165
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,410
But my job is not done yet.

166
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,930
Sorry?

167
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,130
I need to drive you home.

168
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,130
I'll wait for you.

169
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,890
It's cold. You should get going.

170
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,090
No, I'll wait.

171
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,610
Then give me just 10 minutes.

172
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,810
See you soon.

173
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,610
Bye, Seo-yoon.

174
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,850
Wait here.

175
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,810
- Hi. - Hi.

176
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,450
Hi, Seo-yoon.

177
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,650
I'm tired, Dad.

178
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,850
I'm going to sleep.

179
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,730
She must be tired.

180
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,730
Let her sleep.

181
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,890
Where's Jung-eun?

182
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,810
She's not home yet.

183
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,770
Yes?

184
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,490
Where are you? Seo-yoon's home.

185
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,010
I'm coming up. I'm in the parking lot.

186
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,329
- Hi. - What's the score?

187
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,730
- Read it. Bye. - Bye.

188
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,209
Wait.

189
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:14,329
You need to tell me before you go.

190
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:15,410
It's all written in there.

191
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,370
Bye.

192
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,329
Don't go. Wait.

193
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,449
(1st Mock Test Result, Top 2 percent)

194
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,730
Two percent?

195
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,810
Are you sure it's her test result?

196
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,850
- What? - Are you sure it didn't get mixed
up?

197
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,050
Doesn't that mean she's a genius?

198
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,890
She got 0.8 percent when she was five.

199
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,570
Did she?

200
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,850
The counselor was a man.

201
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:35,850
I think she was a bit scared.

202
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,730
A man?

203
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,250
The counselor?

204
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,890
The counselor matters for the Lucid Test.

205
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,130
But why...

206
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,890
This isn't good.

207
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,610
We never know who her counselor's going
to be.

208
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,570
We might as well make her take it a few
more times...

209
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,570
until she gets used to it.

210
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:50,490
A few more times?

211
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:53,810
Hey. This isn't a driving test.

212
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,610
I told you.

213
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,449
She must be within the top one percent in
two weeks.

214
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,170
We should make her memorize the
questions at least.

215
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,570
That's insane.

216
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,570
You think that will make her score go up...

217
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,930
when she doesn't even know the answer?

218
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,530
What else can I do?

219
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,010
We don't have time.

220
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,690
Whatever.

221
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,810
I'll make another appointment for tomorrow.

222
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,690
Can you help me out a little more?

223
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,770
Do what you want, but I'm never doing it
again.

224
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,170
No, I can't do it. Seriously--

225
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,810
What do you mean, you can't?

226
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,090
You said you'd help me.

227
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,170
Seriously.

228
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,410
- Bye. - Where are you going?

229
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,209
Did something happen?

230
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,090
Why do you ask?

231
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,530
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

232
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,770
It's frustrating.

233
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,050
Then...

234
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,610
this is the wrong direction.

235
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,610
Pardon?

236
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,730
Where are we going?

237
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:54,329
Seo-yoon.

238
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,530
Did you have a long day?

239
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,530
Should we stop?

240
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,250
What am I doing to a seven-year-old?

241
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,930
(Grand Award)

242
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,650
She's already doing so great.

243
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,329
No. Don't be weak.

244
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,610
Gosh.

245
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,430
Do you like your destination?

246
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,509
Yes, I like it.

247
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,390
I finally feel like I can breathe.

248
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,870
I was really frustrated earlier.

249
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,710
What was so frustrating?

250
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,790
The test today.

251
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,629
It was an IQ test.

252
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:51,950
It wasn't the SAT.

253
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,030
But just because the score was low,

254
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,790
Jung-eun said she should take the test
again.

255
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,670
Do you think that makes sense?

256
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,710
I'm a child psychotherapist.

257
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,190
I never expected my daughter to do that.

258
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,310
It's frustrating.

259
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,629
Then you should tell her.

260
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,110
I would've done that already if she was a
stranger.

261
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,350
No matter how much I tell her...

262
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,629
to stop taking the IQ tests...

263
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:17,110
I regret saying I'd watch her daughter.

264
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,590
Perhaps I should just...

265
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,830
I got too worked up, didn't I?

266
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,629
I'm sorry. I didn't realize what I was doing.

267
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,270
No, I don't mind.

268
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,470
When you're angry,

269
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,430
feel free to vent to me.

270
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,990
And...

271
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,590
here.

272
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,430
It's embarrassing.

273
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,950
I look ugly, don't I?

274
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,150
You were so funny that day.

275
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,510
Were you that scared?

276
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,710
No.

277
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,070
I can't stop talking when I'm with you.

278
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,590
So? Do I look like him?

279
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,870
No, he was way skinnier and scarier than
you.

280
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,150
I can't lose weight immediately.

281
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,150
Hong Seo-yoon. You brat. Stop.

282
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,030
So? Do I look scary now?

283
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,790
What do you think?

284
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,070
Right.

285
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,830
Nothing would scare the little Lee Jung-eun.

286
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,510
Good. Let's pretend I'm scary.

287
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,350
Now, draw the line...

288
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,150
as I show you.

289
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,190
Okay?

290
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,750
Here. This one.

291
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,230
Try to draw this.

292
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,470
I see. Good job.

293
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,190
Next...

294
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,670
try to remember what you just drew...

295
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,870
as much as you can...

296
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,030
and draw it again.

297
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,350
Dad.

298
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,750
What? Is something wrong?

299
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,350
You're...

300
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,310
telling me the answer.

301
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,350
What? Did I?

302
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,430
That's my girl.

303
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,710
You're very honest. Good job.

304
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,710
Plus 10 points.

305
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,470
- Yes! - Yes!

306
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,920
Seo-yoon, are you doing well?

307
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,240
Yes.

308
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,850
I'll go and wash my face. I'm tired.

309
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:40,970
Okay.

310
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,970
How far did you get? Is she any good?

311
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,290
Yes, we tried.

312
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,490
And...

313
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,850
it's not as good as...

314
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,450
- I feel bad for her. - What?

315
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,530
Is this all?

316
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,810
This is crazy.

317
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,010
Go. I better take over.

318
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,690
Go inside.

319
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,290
Put these on.

320
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,890
What are these?

321
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,570
The university admissions system is
changing again.

322
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,890
It changes every year.

323
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,570
How will it change when our children go to
university?

324
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,770
What if they pass out?

325
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,250
They'll give up soon.

326
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,530
Gosh, grannies.

327
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,010
- Grandma. - Grandma.

328
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,330
Yes. You're here.

329
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,970
Are you that tired?

330
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,650
Wait until you reach my age.

331
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,250
Didn't you say you're getting tested again
today?

332
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,850
We'll get going first.

333
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,330
See you tomorrow.

334
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,410
Bye.

335
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,650
Bye, Seo-yoon.

336
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,010
- Bye. - Bye. We're going to hang out for a
bit.

337
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,010
Cool.

338
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,930
What is all this?

339
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,490
Grandpa, can I have that?

340
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,170
Of course. Eat all you want.

341
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,570
- Thank you. - Hop in.

342
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,970
So? Do you like it?

343
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,210
Yes, I like it.

344
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,090
I told you.

345
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,050
I'm in charge of driving you from now on.

346
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,850
Hop in.

349

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,890
Seo-yoon, aren't you tired?

352

I'm okay.

353
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,970
Aren't you tired from taking the test?

354
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,530
What was the hardest?

355
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,410
I don't know. Can I go sleep now?

356
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,010
Sure.

357
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,010
Seo-yoon, next time,

358
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,970
you have to do a little better than this.

359
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,170
Can you do it?

360
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,090
Are you saying I did bad again?

362
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,730
What do you mean, bad?

363
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,730
It's great.

364
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,690
Right? You're the best.

365
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,810
But...

366
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,770
But what?

367
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,130
But you placed first...

371
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,810
It says 1.4, right?

372
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,770
Is this the same?

373
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,090
Does this mean I placed 1.4?

374
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,050
Yes, you placed 1.4.

So, next time, try harder...

376
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,410
and let's place first.

377
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,290
Mom, I'm tired.

378
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,850
Seo-yoon, go to bed.

379
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,530
You're tired. Go.

380
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,330
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

381
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,570
Cut it out, will you?

382
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,130
Okay.

383
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,250
Look at this.

384
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,490
Seo-yoon can do it if she tries.

385
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,410
She scored 1.4 right away.

386
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,610
I made an appointment at one more place--

387
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,010
I'm not doing it.

388
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:10,969
I can't do it anymore.

389
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,690
Don't be like this.

390
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,209
Just until she gets into Class A. Please?

391
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,410
You can sleep here tonight.

392
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,690
Stop it.

393
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,969
- Let's sleep together tonight. - Stop it.

394
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,170
- Let's sleep. - Whatever.

395
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,850
So? Did you find the TR CEO?

396
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,170
This is no time to be idle.

397
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,810
Don't worry.

398
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,370
Why would I worry about you?

399
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:42,530
You're the legendary Lee Jung-eun...

400
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,130
that turned everything into a hit with your
touch.

401
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,250
I'm sure you'll do a good job.

402
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,930
Both the president and the director are...

403
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,209
looking forward to it.

404
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,530
But the greater their expectations,

405
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,690
the more disappointed they will be.

406
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,890
What are you going to do?

407
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,650
If you can't find the CEO before the deadline,

408
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,410
it's all your responsibility, you know?

409
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,890
An incompetent marketer...

410
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,890
who can't even get started.

411
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,330
That will make you a legend in a way too.

412
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,370
Do your best, Jung-eun.

413
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,170
Deputy Director Ha's determined.

414
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,090
She looks like she wants the TR Project to
fail.

415
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,850
She's trying to...

416
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:24,650
put the blame on you.

417
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,969
I'll get it done.

418
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,730
Seo-yoon's test is starting soon.

419
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,050
You'll have to wait for about 20 minutes.

420
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,290
(In session)

421
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:46,010
(The 3rd mock children's intelligence test)

422
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,209
All right.

423
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,890
Can you draw it again, as you remember?

424
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,290
Okay.

425
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,610
Look at these numbers.

426
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,370
Say the numbers you just saw in order.

427
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,770
Okay.

428
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,010
99, 8, and 25.

429
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,010
Now, can you say the numbers in the
opposite order?

430
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,330
25, 8, and 99.

431
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,010
Depending on the child's condition,

432
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,370
the test result can vary.

433
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,770
That's what I'd like to tell you in advance.

434
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,370
Yes, I understand.

435
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,449
Is her result...

436
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,130
not good?

437
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,250
No.

438
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,570
Seo-yoon is...

439
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,330
in the top one percent, which means...

440
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:39,770
she's one of the smartest children.

441
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,250
I'm in the top one percent!

442
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,449
Great. You worked hard.

443
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,810
Congratulations, Seo-yoon.

444
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,570
You worked hard too.

445
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,890
It's a happy day.

446
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,209
How about having a party?

447
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,209
Yes, let's have a party.

448
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,370
Let's do it. Please.

449
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,810
This is wonderful!

450
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,930
Thank you.

451
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,290
Don't be surprised yet. This is just the
beginning.

452
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,930
Seo-yoon, let's get inside.

453
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,290
Go in!

454
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,610
Jinny, you can make a wish with me.

455
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,810
Can I?

456
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,810
- Yes. - Thank you.

457
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,650
You even brought a camera?

458
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,209
Sure.

459
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,969
One needs to make thorough preparations
for everything.

460
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,850
Seo-yoon, what did you wish for?

461
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,010
I wished that I could do well on the actual
test...

462
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,850
as I did today.

463
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,570
Mom will be happy then.

464
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,170
Seo-yoon,

465
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,410
this is for you!

466
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,490
Oh, my!

467
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,530
Goodness.

468
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,330
This is the Pinkru that I wanted to have.

469
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,770
Jinny, thank you!

470
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,250
Seo-yoon, you've worked hard.

471
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,010
Seo-yoon,

472
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,850
there's one more present for you outside.

473
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,410
What do you think this is?

474
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,850
Oh, my!

475
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:55,770
You can see the stars with this, right?

476
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,050
This is how you see the stars using this.

477
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,770
Your eye goes here.

478
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,209
Turn this with your hand...

479
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,410
to adjust the focus.

480
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,090
- I think I can see the stars. - Do you?

481
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:09,530
- Do you see them? - Yes!

482
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,370
Which star are you looking at?

483
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,650
Thank you.

484
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,969
I prepared a present for you too.

485
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,050
This is a Christmas gift for you.

486
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,050
Already?

487
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,330
Soon, as an exchange professor,

488
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,490
I'm going to Chapel Hill.

489
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,330
Do you remember the clock tower...

490
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,090
on campus?

491
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:53,250
Of course.

492
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,170
I miss that place around this time of the
year.

493
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,170
I want to visit it again.

494
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,930
Do you think that place is still the same?

495
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,170
Come with me...

496
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,850
and check it out for yourself.

497
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,490
I have to go there soon.

498
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,250
Are you really going there?

499
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,090
When?

500
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,410
Would you like...

501
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,410
to go with me?

502
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,290
That's...

503
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,250
As a Christmas gift for me,

504
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,410
I want you...

505
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,209
to give me an answer.

506
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,730
I'll be waiting.

507
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,850
Well...

508
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,770
I...

509
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:51,090
Jinny, Mom is almost here.

510
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:52,530
Let's go now.

511
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,730
Yes, we should go.

512
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,570
Seo-yoon, you're the best!

513
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,690
Goodness, Seo-yoon.

514
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,730
I told you you can make it.

515
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,170
My darling.

516
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,970
Such a cutie!

517
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,930
They're so happy.

518
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,890
See?

519
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,890
It's all because of my help.

520
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,530
What? I'm speechless.

521
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,770
Who do you think prepared for the test with
her...

522
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,090
every morning?

523
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,250
"Prepared"?

524
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,890
You played with her.

525
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,650
That's how I educate her as a dad.

526
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,530
I think I have to publish a book.

527
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,850
The title will be, "How to raise a gifted
child."

528
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,970
I did my share too.

529
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,250
"How to be a gifted child's mom."

530
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,730
Dad, put me down now.

531
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,890
- No. - I feel dizzy.

532
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,570
No, I won't.

533
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,850
Oh, my goodness.

534
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,490
Thank you, Ji-a.

535
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,210
We only have the last test left.

536
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,130
I will count on you till the end.

537
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,650
I love you.

538
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,530
(Jung-eun)

539
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,050
(Jung-eun)

540
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,330
(Jung-eun)

541
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:53,970
Where are you?

542
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,730
I'm in front of her preschool.

543
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,610
So far, it's all been practice.

544
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,410
Today, it's the real thing, you know.

545
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,330
If she doesn't get nervous,

546
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,330
she'll be in the top one percent, no matter
what.

547
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,810
Arrive at the academy early.

548
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,130
If the counselor doesn't seem right,

549
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,770
request to change to another one. Do you
get it?

550
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,210
I'll call you when Seo-yoon goes in to take
the test.

551
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,490
Bye.

552
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,610
I'm sorry that I asked you to meet me.

553
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,810
I know you're busy.

554
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,730
You must be worried about Tae-rin.

555
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,210
What's her result?

556
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,490
She's in the top 1.2 percent.

557
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,810
I think she'll do better for today's test.

558
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,930
How about Seo-yoon?

559
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,370
Do you want to see this?

560
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,250
Let me see.

561
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,370
(Lucid Children's Intelligence Test)

562
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,570
Top one percent?

563
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,490
Seo-yoon will be accepted then.

564
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,770
Don't worry.

565
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,170
Tae-rin will do well on the test too.

566
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,850
That's right.

567
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,770
You mentioned...

568
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,810
the TR case earlier. How is it going?

569
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,050
Not good.

570
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,330
But I tend to try until I get things done.

571
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,970
To be honest,

572
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,970
I'm now curious...

573
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,410
who the CEO of TR is.

574
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,850
Why?

575
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,930
It frustrates me.

576
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,210
Frustrates you? What do you mean?

577
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,250
I'm asking because I'm curious.

578
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,730
TR's key marketing strategy...

579
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,010
is charity. That's all good.

580
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,770
But wouldn't it be nice if it could cooperate...

581
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,290
with a large company like Aaes...

582
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,570
and expand its size?

583
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,650
It would be nice,

584
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,810
but do you think it's possible?

585
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,090
Well,

586
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,970
I guess I haven't told you yet.

587
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,250
Once, using the charity marketing strategy,

588
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,290
I hit the highest sales record...

589
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,330
and donated 10 percent of the total profits.

590
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,730
How much were the profits again?

591
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,730
While someone like that exists here,

592
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,490
the CEO doesn't even consider a meeting.

593
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,330
That frustrates me. Do you understand?

594
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,570
You're right. That CEO is unbelievable.

595
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,650
Hello.

596
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,890
How have you been?

597
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,650
The other day, you said you would never
visit me again.

598
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,890
Today, I'm here not as your son Hong Jae-
man.

599
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,290
I'm here for business.

600
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,050
Business? What business do we have in
common?

601
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,810
Mom, do not settle for making small money.

602
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,730
Let's make big money together.

603
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,650
If you're talking about home shopping, you
can leave.

604
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,570
Leave while I'm talking to you nicely.

605
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,530
Come on.

606
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,090
Jackpot Ox Bone Soup in Yeongdeungpo...

607
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,370
also started to sell food on a home shopping
network.

608
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,290
You have no idea,

609
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,250
but you can earn enough money...

610
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,770
to build a building soon. So...

611
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,850
I earn enough money here.

612
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,530
You can go and make big money.

613
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,090
Don't just keep turning me down.

614
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,410
Who is it?

615
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,970
(Hwangseok Sundae Soup owner)

616
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,650
Mom, take a look at this before we talk.

617
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,290
Look at this, and then tell me.

618
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,930
I can't believe this.

619
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,690
How could you use a photo like this?

620
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,010
Leave now!

621
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,450
Come on. You need to look at this in detail...

622
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,690
Gosh.

623
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,010
Leave!

624
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,410
Next time, we'll meet as moms of Class A.

625
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,970
I like the sound of that.

626
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,450
Oh, you know what?

627
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,690
At Big Parker, no working mom...

628
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,090
has been able to get their child into Class A.

629
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,890
We're the first.

630
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:26,970
Is that true?

631
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,530
Actually, Sophie's mom...

632
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,650
was my colleague, but she quit her job...

633
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,090
to focus on her child.

634
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,810
Only after that did Sophie advance to Class
A.

635
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,210
But we...

636
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,250
made it while working.

637
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,450
I guess you're right.

638
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,810
- See you. - Bye.

What is this regarding?

642
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,810
I can't reach Mr. Hong.

643
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,530
I received a certification of mail contents.

644
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,770
Pardon? Certification of contents?

645
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,490
Isn't it a delivery mistake?

646
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,650
No, it isn't.

647
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,650
It was sent to Mr. Hong.

That's it. Go up. All right.

652

Yes. Just keep going up like this.

everything...

Hello, Jung-eun. What's up?

657
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,410
The store received a contents-certified mail.

658
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,490

Wh-What did it receive?

660
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,490
From where?

661
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,730
From a bank.

662
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,890
That's...

663
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,730
I guess I forgot to pay the interest.

664
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,090
The bank guys...

665
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,970
It's only been overdue for a few days...

666
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,610
and they sent a contents-certified mail for
that?

667
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,410
- I'll go and tell those punks... - Interest?

668
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,290

What?

670

I told you to put the store on the market.

Well, it's...

673
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,850
Not the store, but a loan.

674
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,450
Is it an intracorporate loan?

675
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,210
What are you talking about?

00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,130

00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,930
- I want to throw up. - I see.

744
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,890
Oh, my.

745
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,850
My goodness.

746
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,490
I need to take the test.

747
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:56,650
How can you take the test when you're this
sick?

748
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,610
If I fail the test,

749
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,370
Mom will be upset.

750
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,970
Seo-yoon, what are you saying?

751
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,370
It's all right.

752
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,690
I'll explain to Mom.

753
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,810
You can take the test next time.

754
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:14,890
Really?

755
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,170
Of course.

756
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,049
Right now,

757
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,650
the test doesn't matter.

758
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,890
Seo-yoon matters more.

759
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,970
Do you understand what I mean?

760
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,650
Yes.

761
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:40,330
Why isn't she picking up?

762
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,890
(Hwangseok Sundae Soup)

763
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,610
What did you do with that money?

764
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,290
Jung-eun, calm down.

765
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,850
- I can explain. - Hey!

766
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,049
Do you think I can calm down now?

767
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,130
- Tell me now! - Okay.

768
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,410
Jung-eun, don't pinch my ears!

769
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,330
You idiot, seriously!

770
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,410
What?

771
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,410
Seo-yoon is sick?

772
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,569
What's wrong?

773
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,530
My goodness. No wonder.

774
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,930
I thought it was strange...

775
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:12,970
that she wasn't here yet.

776
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,730
Yes, Tae-rin went in to take the test.

777
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,810
The kid matters more.

778
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,170
The test isn't important.

779
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,610
Then shall I go in and explain what
happened?

780
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,810
Then we can't help it.

781
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,730
Don't wait for her, and proceed with the test.

782
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,650
Class A is out of her league indeed.

783
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,450
Don't you know what day today is?

784
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:51,170
It's the real test day for Seo-yoon's Lucid
test.

785
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,049
Do I have to come all the way here because
of you?

786
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,770
I'm sorry.

787
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,210
I'm stressed out today already.

788
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,290
Make sure...

789
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,770
you bring that money.

790
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,730
I can get it all back next week. I mean it.

791
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,290
Are you sure?

792
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,089
Of course.

793
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,530
Everything will be settled next week.

794
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,569
Then,

795
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,049
until next week,

796
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,210
don't even think about coming into the
bedroom.

797
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,730
Jung-eun!

798
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,290
Yes, Mother.

799
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,210
What?

800
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,810
The ER?

801
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,930
(Emergency Center)

802
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,250
Seo-yoon!

803
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,410
Okay.

804
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,410
What happened?

805
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,530
What did the doctor say?

806
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,850
Stress-induced vomiting.

807
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,170
Stress? From what?

808
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,530
The academy. The test.

809
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,810
How can she not be stressed?

810
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,610
I knew she was barely holding it together.

811
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,569
Is she okay now?

812
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,410
She got an injection and fell asleep.

813
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,130
So she missed the test?

814
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:07,930
You...

815
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,290
The kid was burning up...

816
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,130
and throwing up. She was sick.

817
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,170
I should've forced her to take it?

818
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,370
Jung-eun, seriously?

819
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,530
I'm not saying you should've forced her.

820
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:20,690
But you could have at least explained the
situation.

821
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,089
Jung-eun, we're in a hospital.

822
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,530
Can you not? Look at Seo-yoon.

823
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,450
I should call CM Gifted Academy now.

824
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,330
- Don't-- - Mom.

825
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,730
Are you okay, Seo-yoon?

826
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,010
Daddy's here.

827
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,530
I'm sorry.

828
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:37,010
I'm sorry I got sick, Mom.

829
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,970
Don't say that. You don't need to apologize
for that.

830
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,569
It's okay.

831
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,410
Right. Don't say that.

832
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,010
Why would you be sorry?

833
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:52,569
Yes, this is CM Gifted Academy, right?

834
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,569
I'm calling about Hong Seo-yoon's test
today.

835
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,610
She had a medical emergency.

836
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,970
Is there any chance she could take it
tomorrow?

837
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,730
Yes, I know it's over.

838
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,410
Can't she take it tomorrow?

839
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,049
I'm begging you. Please.

840
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,250
I'm begging you.

841
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,730
Yes.

842
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,810
Okay.

843
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,250
Gosh, what do we do?

844
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,170
What do we do?

845
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,250
What do we do?

846
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,410
Mom.

847
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,690
Yes?

848
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,490
I'm sorry.

849
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,730
No, sweetheart.

850
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,890
Don't say that.

851
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,370
Take Seo-yoon home.

852
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,890
Okay.

853
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,650
Goodness.

854
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,690
This is all because of my daughter-in-law.

855
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,530
I sincerely apologize.

856
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,450
Professor, there's no need for you to
apologize.

857
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,569
I should meet her now...

858
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,410
and put her in her place--

859
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,650
No, don't.

860
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,930
I saw everything that happened to Seo-yoon
today.

861
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:10,490
You really expect me to just sit back and do
nothing?

862
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,330
Just let it go.

863
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,690
I can't do that.

864
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,370
For my daughter-in-law's own good too,

865
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,410
I can't ignore this.

866
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,810
Professor, please...

867
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,450
don't confront your daughter-in-law.

868
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,330
I'm asking you.

869
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,890
Hello?

870
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,770
This is Yoon Ji-a.

871
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,610
It's been a while since we've met one-on-
one.

872
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,130
Just get to the point.

873
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,089
I want Seo-yoon moved to Class A.

874
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:31,490
And why would I do that?

875
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,890
Winning the speech contest was
supposed...

876
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:38,049
to guarantee her a spot in Class A.

877
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,530
Seo-yoon and Jung-eun...

878
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,330
worked hard for it.

879
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,530
I gave her a chance, didn't I?

880
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,650
I heard she didn't take the test.

881
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,890
The test didn't even matter in the first place,

882
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,210
and you know it.

883
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,370
Move her up, as you promised.

884
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,240
Are you anxious...

885
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,360
to meet me in person, Ju-hee?

886
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,919
Don't call me that.

887
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,000
(Song Ju-hee)

888
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,000
What do I do now, Ms. Yoon?

889
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,320
If people find out about it,

890
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,520
I will drop out.

891
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,560
Drop out from school?

892
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,320
You're in ninth grade.

893
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:38,800
You can't just quit.

894
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:40,000
It's better than having everyone know.

895
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,000
I should just leave.

896
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,399
Don't worry.

897
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,480
I will take care of it.

898
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,680
But you're leaving school...

899
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,720
because of me.

900
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,840
I stole.

901
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,240
I should be the one leaving.

902
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,080
I'll protect you,

903
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,680
but you have to promise me one thing.

904
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,600
No matter how tough things get,

905
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,439
you can't take things from people...

906
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,640
ever again.

907
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,439
Can you promise me that?

908
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,720
Yes.

909
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,000
Even if I'm gone, you need to continue the
treatment.

910
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,480
I'm no longer Song Ju-hee.

911
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,960
I'm Song Ho-gyung.

912
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,360
I keep the promises I make.

913
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,160
There's nothing for you to be afraid of.

914
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,360
This time,

915
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,040
I'm asking you for a favor.

916
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,680
Jung-eun,

917
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,240
did you have to act like that at the hospital?

918
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,800
Seo-yoon was right there.

919
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,800
My child was sick.

920
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:34,040
Do you think I wasn't upset?

921
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,880
Of course, I was.

922
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,439
But you only ever see half of things.

923
00:47:40,439 --> 00:47:41,680
We had an opportunity, you know.

924
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,720
Do you think opportunities like this come
easily?

925
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,600
Seo-yoon worked so hard for this.

926
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,960
You saw it.

927
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,640
And now it's all going to waste?

928
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,040
You can resent me all you want.

929
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,439
As long as Seo-yoon can get ahead,

930
00:47:57,399 --> 00:47:58,640
I'll do whatever it takes.

931
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,200
Gosh.

932
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,640
That darn Class A.

933
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,160
Stay out of it.

934
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,760
Just get the money.

935
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,919
Don't stand in her way.

936
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,680
Ms. Lee, you're not heading home?

937
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,439
You go ahead.

938
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,640
(Marketing Team 1)

939
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,680
Lee Jung-eun.

940
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,880
Mr. Kim, we should go first.

941
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,160
Come on.

942
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,600
Let's go.

943
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,040
The Grand Award goes...

944
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,600
to Hong Seo-yoon!

945
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,000
- Yes! - Who? Seo-yoon?

946
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,200
The Grand Award?

947
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,320
(Grand Award)

948
00:48:51,439 --> 00:48:52,840
Tommy placed second.

949
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,960
And Seo-yoon placed first!

950
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,720
Finally, she's moving...

951
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,160
to Class A at Big Parker.

952
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,520
Top one percent?

953
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,439
Seo-yoon will be accepted then.

954
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,760
(Smart video doorbell)

955
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,160
(Smart video doorbell)

956
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,640
Have a seat.

957
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,040
What brings you all the way here?

958
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,760
Ms. Song.

959
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,680
Please give Seo-yoon one more chance.

960
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,160
What do you think you're doing?

961
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,080
I'll do whatever you ask. Anything.

962
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,280
If she doesn't make it this time,

963
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,840
I'll accept whatever you decide,

964
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,120
whether it's demoting her to Class C...

965
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,240
or making her quit entirely. So...

966
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,280
Please give her one more chance. I beg you.

967
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,080
Please.

968
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,000
Lift your head.

969
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,480
Lift your head. I will give her a chance.

970
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,640
You will?

971
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,960
I'll put it to a vote with the Class A parents.

972
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Pardon?

973
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,080
What do you mean by that?

974
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,080
I will move her up to Class A.

975
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,600
The vote is just a formality.

976
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,680
Thank you so much.

977
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,400
Thank you, Ms. Song.

978
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,680
I really appreciate it.

979
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,160
Tell your mom...

980
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,920
that I kept my promise.

981
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,080
"Promise"?

982
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,600
Did you meet with Tommy's mom yesterday?

983
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,520
I did. Why?

984
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,040
She suddenly agreed to move Seo-yoon up!

985
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,560
What did you say to her?

986
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,080
And what did she mean about a "promise"?

987
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,120
Right.

988
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,760
I went to Tommy's mom and told her...

989
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,720
it was all my fault that Seo-yoon missed the
test.

990
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,800
That I messed everything up.

991
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,760
I begged her to move Seo-yoon up...

992
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,320
to Class A.

993
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,840
You did?

994
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,480
It was you!

995
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,200
Thank you so much, Mom.

996
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,760
I'm so touched.

997
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,840
Gosh.

998
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,920
A vote?

999
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,560
Yes. Seo-yoon's moving up to Class A.

1000
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,760
I guess people aren't as bad as they seem.

1001
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,040
Tommy's mom acted like she'd never budge,

1002
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,040
but in the end, she's giving us a shot.

1003
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,880
Does that mean Seo-yoon is officially in
Class A?

1004
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,600
Basically.

1005
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,560
Tommy's mom already agreed.

1006
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,920
That's one vote in our favor. Then there's
you.

1007
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,400
So that's two votes.

1008
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,680
Even if Jason's mom and Annie's mom...

1009
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,960
vote against us,

1010
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,280
the tiebreaker is still Tommy's mom.

1011
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,640
Which means Seo-yoon is in.

1012
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,800
You really think...

1013
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,840
the other moms will just let this slide?

1014
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,640
So what if they don't?

1015
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,480
Tommy's mom made the call.

1016
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,920
Once Seo-yoon's in,

1017
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,600
we'll all be in the same class.

1018
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,600
I might as well go ahead and meet them.

1019
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,760
Give me their contact info.

1020
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,120
After what happened with the babysitter
mess,

1021
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,960
you think we're close enough to meet up?

1022
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,320
I never got to apologize properly.

1023
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,800
Forgive me. It's long overdue.

1024
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,800
I sincerely apologize for it.

1025
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,240
What made you apologize now?

1026
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,080
Seo-yoon will join Class A...

1027
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,200
after the vote, you know.

1028
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,160
So I just wanted to get in touch...

1029
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,080
and introduce myself properly before the
vote.

1030
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,160
You know.

1031
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,240
A vote?

1032
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,160
Let's be good friends from now on.

1033
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,320
I've honestly never seen a kid...

1034
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,800
as smart and adorable...

1035
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,280
as Annie. She's like a little doll.

1036
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,960
And of course, with a mom as beautiful,

1037
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,080
how could she not be?

1038
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,360
And I hear she's just...

1039
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,080
the sweetest. Everyone says it.

1040
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,160
Well,

1041
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,520
I suppose she does take after me.

1042
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,600
Of course.

1043
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,600
It's obvious she's totally her mother's
daughter.

1044
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,440
Right, my Annie is...

1045
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,840
Wait.

1046
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,800
So you're telling me Tommy's mom actually
said...

1047
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,400
we will decide it through a vote?

1048
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,640
Yes,

1049
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,760
she said so.

1050
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,960
How on earth did your daughter manage...

1051
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,600
to pull one over...

1052
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,440
on Tommy's mom?

1053
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,400
Seemed like Class A was never going to
happen.

1054
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,520
And now there's going to be another vote?

1055
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,320
That's what they're saying.

1056
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,720
Why would they take a vote?

1057
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,760
Whenever they see us,

1058
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,760
they roll their eyeballs...

1059
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,520
like this, you know.

1060
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,200
There's no way those wenches would agree
to it.

1061
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,080
Alright, everyone. That's it for today.

1062
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,480
We will circle back around and go over...

1063
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,920
the answers next class.

1064
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,960
Good job today, and we will see you
tomorrow.

1065
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,960
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1066
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,520
What?

1067
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,400
That's my pencil.

1068
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,640
Mom!

1069
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,880
My little cutie pie.

1070
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,880
Mom!

1071
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,160
My son! Come here.

1072
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,040
Tommy stole my pencil.

1073
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
What?

1074
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,360
What did you just say, Jason?

1075
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,840
Tommy did what?

1076
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,040
Excuse us.

1077
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,520
What did you say, Jason?

1078
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,600
Tommy's pencil case...

1079
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,160
had one just like mine.

1080
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,960
You must've been mistaken.

1081
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,360
No! It's mine!

1082
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,680
I even bit it,

1083
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,040
and Tommy's has the same mark!

1084
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,400
Is it really yours, Jason?

1085
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,120
Are you absolutely sure?

1086
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,560
Jason's mom.

1087
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,240
How did you educate your kid?

1088
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,760
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1089
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,400
How dare he make up...

1090
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,880
such nonsense about my Tommy?

1091
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,160
It's a misunderstanding, ma'am.

1092
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,720
I let your kid into Class A...

1093
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,800
even though he barely made the cut,

1094
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,440
and this is how you repay me?

1095
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,320
Is he even thinking straight?

1096
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,880
It's okay, Jason.

1097
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,000
It's okay.

1098
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,120
Don't cry, Jason.

1099
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,720
But it really is mine.

1100
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,160
I'm not lying.

1101
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,360
I know, I know. You're not lying.

1102
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,360
But isn't it possible...

1103
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,680
Tommy just has one that looks the same?

1104
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,600
No, it's mine.

1105
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,120
I see.

1106
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,760
But...

1107
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,600
did you ask Tommy about it first?

1108
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,800
No.

1109
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,760
I didn't ask him.

1110
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,480
Let's go ask Tommy first then.

1111
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,960
He might have one that looks the same.

1112
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,840
Or maybe he found it on the floor,

1113
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,360
not knowing that it belonged to you.

1114
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,400
What do you think, Jason?

1115
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,800
Stop.

1116
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,240
Jason.

1117
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,520
Come here, boy.

1118
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,960
(We thank Kim Ki-moo for his special
appearance.)

1119
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,000
(Mother and Mom)

1120
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,920
Are you playing me?

1121
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,880
Go ask your mom.

1122
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,320
How can you date at your granddaughter's
academy?

1123
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,160
With Tommy's grandfather too!

1124
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,960
Thanks to you, Mom, we were kicked out...

1125
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,080
not only from Class A, but from Big Parker.

1126
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,240
Do you plan to keep seeing Seo-yoon's
grandmother?

1127
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,080
You stay out of my business.

1128
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,840
Why are you deleting Grandma's number?

1129
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,960
Why?

1130
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,760
I believe this is the ball you saw...

1131
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,160
on the day of the vote.

1132
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,080
Do you still have business here?

1133
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,040
You took Seo-yoon's place,

1134
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,080
and I'm here to get it back.
