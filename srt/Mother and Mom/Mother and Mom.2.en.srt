00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:37,714
(Child actors were accompanied by family...)

11
00:00:37,794 --> 00:00:38,977
(and were kept safe.)

12
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:41,069
What?

13
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:43,509
I can't stand it anymore...

14
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:46,909
(Episode 2)

15
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:49,429
- Mom! - Are you crazy?

16
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,029
Why did you hit me?

17
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,909
You should be apologizing for what you did.

18
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:53,989
How dare you say so?

19
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:56,709
How do you feel getting hit in the back?

20
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:59,709
You should feel what we felt. That's poetic
justice.

21
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:00,739
Don't you think?

22
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,469
She's right.

23
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,989
How feisty.

24
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:07,909
My goodness.

25
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,269
I was wondering who was making such a
fuss.

26
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,909
She hit me.

27
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,069
Really?

28
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,189
Was it you?

29
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,189
This nanny met all my requirements.

30
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,669
So I made an offer.

31
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:25,875
Take a look at this,

32
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,709
and tell me if there's anything you want to
add.

33
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:29,989
I'll give you extra 500,000 won to your
current salary,

34
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:32,349
and 50 percent more for overtime.

35
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,309
I guess you prefer cash for a holiday gift,
right?

36
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,389
You poached my kid's nanny,

37
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:39,509
- and you call that a job offer? - What?

38
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:41,629
It's not like you made a contract for life.

39
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,589
You should know as a working mom.

40
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,949
People change jobs for better terms.

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,189
I'm sure you've seen that many times.

42
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,989
She can change jobs,

43
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:53,669
but she needs to give me some time.

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:55,949
We're both parents.

45
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,269
How inconsiderate is this?

46
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:58,669
Stop it.

47
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,989
They talk without much thought.

48
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:02,189
It's a waste of time to talk with them.

49
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,949
Like mother, like daughter.

50
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,589
Gosh.

51
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,429
Poor you.

52
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:11,468
Oh, my.

53
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,509
Like mother, like daughter?

54
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:18,669
Kids are in class here.

55
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:20,269
What on earth are you doing here?

56
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:22,188
Who are you now?

57
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:24,429
Mom.

58
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,589
You should stop.

59
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:27,748
What's wrong with you?

60
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:29,069
Move over.

61
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,099
What do you want?

62
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,229
Do you know where you are?

63
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:34,909
How dare you make a noise?

64
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:44,939
Ju-hee?

65
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,269
Ju-hee?

66
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:52,309
Right?

67
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:54,309
Song Ju-hee.

68
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,188
Do you know her?

69
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,349
You got the wrong person.

70
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,549
She says she's not her.

71
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,029
You're right.

72
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,789
I got the wrong person.

73
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,309
- Excuse me. - Yes?

74
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:32,029
If you needed a nanny,

75
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:33,269
you should have told me.

76
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,229
Ms. Song, that's not what happened...

77
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,069
I will recommend you a good nanny,

78
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,949
so let this one go.

79
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,109
Are you sure?

80
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,509
Excuse me. Wait a minute.

81
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:48,029
You should have given her a good
explanation.

82
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:49,389
How could you let this happen?

83
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,749
You don't have to come anymore.

84
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:53,869
What?

85
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,949
Hey, you!

86
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,269
Hey, you?

87
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,869
Didn't you hear her? The kids are in class
now.

88
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,229
You shouldn't raise your voice here!

89
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,349
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

90
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,869
What's wrong with these people?

91
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:07,869
Gosh.

92
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,269
How annoying!

93
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,789
Ms. Song, wait for me.

94
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,509
Who's Ju-hee?

95
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,189
I got the wrong person. Forget it.

96
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,909
Are you sure you got the wrong person?

97
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:38,669
Try to remember.

98
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,189
I got the wrong person, okay?

99
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,549
It's a bummer.

100
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,389
If you were acquainted with her,

101
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,669
you could pull a few strings for Seo-yoon.

102
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:51,629
- What do you mean? - She could have been
saved.

103
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,349
That woman is a lifesaver in Daechi-dong.

104
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,149
Her son, Tommy, is the top student here.

105
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,509
That's why everyone tries so hard...

106
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,269
to find favor in her eyes.

107
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,589
It's an academy where kids study.

108
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,229
Look what you've done.

109
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,349
She can take care of herself when she
grows up.

110
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,109
Dr. Yoon,

111
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,469
turn your head,

112
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,509
and look over there.

113
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:15,549
(English and math)

114
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:16,589
(Information session)

115
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:17,749
Can you see it?

116
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,789
She can take care of herself when she
grows up?

117
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,309
Meanwhile,

118
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,869
those who go to academies in this
neighborhood...

119
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,388
will be far ahead of her.

120
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,189
If we stop here,

121
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,629
she needs to catch up...

122
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,828
a lot more to study.

123
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,749
You're looking for a nanny, right?

124
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:34,778
What?

125
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:37,149
Of course, I am.

126
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,669
I need to look for a nanny.

127
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,429
Aren't you going?

128
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,828
Don't forget your meals.

129
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,029
Hello, this is Seo-yoon's mom.

130
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,349
Yes.

131
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,349
Are you available today?

132
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,949
Okay. I'll pay you for the interview
and transportation.

133
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,989
Please don't approach me. Not here.

134
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:47,429
No, not here.

135
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,669
My goodness. This is driving me crazy.

136
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,509
Somebody help me, please.

137
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,149
Excuse me.

138
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:59,589
This is insane. Why does it have to be me?

139
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,389
May I sit here?

140
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:05,069
Sure.

141
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,189
Are you here to pick up your grandchild?

142
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:14,789
This is my first time.

143
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,389
I'm here to pick up my granddaughter.

144
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,789
She's Seo-yoon in Class B.

145
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:23,229
I heard she's called Claire here.

146
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,269
Yes, I saw you earlier.

147
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,149
Thud.

148
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:29,949
This is how you hit Seo-yoon's nanny.

149
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,389
I see.

150
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,269
That's...

151
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:36,629
I shouldn't have done it.

152
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,909
I can understand.

153
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:40,709
I'm...

154
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,509
Tae-rin's grandma. Our granddaughters are
best friends.

155
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:44,829
It's nice to meet you.

156
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:47,389
You're Tae-rin's grandma.

157
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,909
I came to the right place.

158
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,429
It's amazing you decided...

159
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,709
to come and sit here in front of me.

160
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,189
I know.

161
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:58,509
By the way, how did you end up doing this?

162
00:07:58,539 --> 00:07:59,475
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,829
- Since when did you do it? - Excuse me?

164
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:04,669
Taking care of your grandchild is not easy at
all.

165
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,989
I don't recommend it.

166
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,189
You shouldn't have set your foot in this.

167
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:09,909
What can you do about it now?

168
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,069
This is temporary.

169
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:15,229
That's how everyone starts doing it.

170
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,909
Listen to me carefully now.

171
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,469
Taking your grandchild to and from
academies...

172
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,629
is something you shouldn't have started...

173
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:21,635
in the first place.

174
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,909
But you already started it, so you can't help
it.

175
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,869
You need to make your daughter...

176
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,909
give it up on her own.

177
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,309
- Yes. - In my case,

178
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:31,869
not to take care of my grandchild,

179
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:34,709
I've tried everything I could.

180
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,429
Can you give me an example?

181
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:40,029
As you can see, my dialect is fluent.

182
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,869
So I taught Tae-rin my dialect...

183
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,348
thinking it would astonish her mom.

184
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:48,429
I guess Tae-rin didn't have a talent for a
dialect.

185
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:49,459
You're wrong.

186
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,589
Since I taught her my dialect...

187
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:56,108
My pumpkin.

188
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:59,228
How did the level test go?

189
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,629
Her English speaking...

190
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,669
is so excellent.

191
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:06,989
However, her grammar is just a little...

192
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,429
Grandma, this teacher is a bit like the thing.

193
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:13,589
- In what way? - She's so cute.

194
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:16,829
But what does the word you said mean?

195
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,869
It means you're a bit like the thing.

196
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:20,389
Don't you understand?

197
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:22,629
We would love to have her...

198
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:25,189
Everyone said...

199
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:28,149
that she was so cute.

200
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,589
Who knows?

201
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:32,829
You could teach Seo-yoon a dialect too.

202
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:34,228
Do you know one?

203
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:36,989
I don't know how to speak a dialect.

204
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:40,629
I can teach her English, though.

205
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:43,669
English. I see.

206
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:44,709
Your daughter intentionally made you...

207
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,389
sit your granddaughter.

208
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,189
You should keep doing this.

209
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,228
I guess we'll meet every day.

210
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:53,029
I have a job.

211
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,389
Can you recommend any other solution?

212
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,029
To shock my daughter,

213
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,149
I intentionally taught Tae-rin...

214
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:05,348
how to play flower cards.

215
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:09,669
All right!

216
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,029
What's this?

217
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:15,269
Great!

218
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:18,469
Oh, my. You're sweeping everything.

219
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:19,435
Two.

220
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,709
She wasn't good with numbers,

221
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,469
You're ruined.

222
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,629
but she learned addition and multiplication
so fast.

223
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,949
Three go!

224
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:29,709
She shouted, "Three go."

225
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,149
Her mother didn't understand how I felt...

226
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:34,549
and asked me when I taught her math.

227
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,869
That's how I'm in charge of bringing her...

228
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,228
to and from the academies.

229
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,189
It's insane.

230
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:46,749
But I really have to do this just for a while.

231
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,555
I mean it.

232
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,309
No parents can win their children.

233
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,228
Isn't she your real daughter?

234
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,709
She is my daughter.

235
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:57,269
Still, I'm going to do this only for a while.

236
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,429
That's what everyone thinks at first.

237
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,469
However...

238
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:05,348
Grandma!

239
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:06,909
Jinny!

240
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,629
Jinny? What does that mean?

241
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:12,429
That's my English name.

242
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:14,228
Are you done with your class already?

243
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:16,509
No, it's a break.

244
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,589
Grandma, didn't you bring some rice punch?

245
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:19,749
I'm thirsty.

246
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,389
Do you think I didn't bring it? I have rice
punch.

247
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,309
Grandma, give me apple juice.

248
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:26,789
Apple juice for Seo-yoon.

249
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,989
Let's see what I got.

250
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,309
Eggs.

251
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,789
I have eggs, rice punch,

252
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,949
and apple juice for Seo-yoon.

253
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:39,989
Do you want some tomatoes?

254
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:43,269
Eat some tomatoes too. What's this?

255
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:45,589
Look. What do you want to have?

256
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,749
Your home is far from the academy.

257
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,348
I should have checked it earlier.

258
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:56,675
That's...

259
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,949
It's hard to find a parking spot in Daechi-
dong,

260
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,669
and there's a serious traffic jam at this hour.

261
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:02,595
You need to reserve a public parking lot...

262
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:03,869
near the academy...

263
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,749
if you want me to take this job.

264
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,509
Yes, I'll do that.

265
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,709
If you work for my family,

266
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,389
you can buy cosmetics at the employee
discount rate.

267
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:15,555
You can get a 40 percent discount...

268
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:16,989
for family restaurants and cafes too.

269
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:19,789
- That's nice. - Isn't it? So...

270
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:21,469
So how much do I get paid?

271
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:25,779
That's...

272
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:31,389
I think I can give you 2,500,000 won.

273
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,549
Ma'am, I'm sorry...

274
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:42,109
My child, compared to other kids, is very
gentle.

275
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:43,749
She's not picky with food,

276
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,109
so it's so easy to take care of her...

277
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,309
Still, a kid is a kid.

278
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,509
It takes much more effort than you think...

279
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:51,589
to take care of kids.

280
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,109
Then...

281
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,149
may I ask how much you want?

282
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:03,389
It's because I'm in a pressing situation.

283
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:07,949
I hope we can negotiate your salary a bit.

284
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,589
I'm sorry,

285
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:12,269
but I'll take a rain check on that.

286
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,629
Well...

287
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:19,509
A rain check?

288
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:21,949
When?

289
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:25,109
After Seo-yoon has grown up?

290
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,389
I'm sorry for what happened in the academy
today.

291
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:40,469
I heard about it.

292
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:42,229
Does apologizing solve everything?

293
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:45,389
You must have looked down on Big Parker...

294
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:47,389
to bring someone like her.

295
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,669
I'll take responsibility...

296
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,069
not to let this happen again with Claire's
family.

297
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:54,149
How can you take responsibility?

298
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,309
We can let her leave.

299
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:59,149
We need to strangle an initiative at birth.

300
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,469
Ms. Song, I'm asking you.

301
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:03,789
As you know, Claire waited for several
years...

302
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:06,229
to take the level test and enter Big Parker.

303
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,829
If she gets kicked out now, where can she
go?

304
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:10,789
She can go to somewhere on her level,

305
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:13,349
like any academy in her neighborhood.

306
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:17,749
You also provided the cause for what
happened today.

307
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:19,869
Can you hear yourself?

308
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,229
I'm the victim.

309
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:25,589
I need to get a new nanny too.

310
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,829
Ms. Lee goes to work, so she would hardly
come...

311
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,509
to the academy.

312
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:31,949
She's looking for a new nanny,

313
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:33,029
and her mother will take care of Claire...

314
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,069
in the meantime.

315
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:37,189
What's the name of Claire's grandmother?

316
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:44,589
I don't know,

317
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:47,829
but I heard that she's an art therapist at a
hospital.

318
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:49,869
She also worked at a school before.

319
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:04,869
If it happens again,

320
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,669
it won't be just a warning.

321
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,949
Of course, I understand. Thank you, Ms.
Song.

322
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,669
What? Are you going to let her come to the
academy?

323
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:20,429
Ms. Song!

324
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,309
- Wait for me! - Take care.

325
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:25,349
Ms. Song!

326
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:27,709
Lee Jung-eun, you owe me big time.

327
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:33,259
(Jung-eun)

328
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,509
Hello, Ji-suk.

329
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:41,509
Lee Jung-eun! Are you out of your mind?

330
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:43,709
I'm sorry, Ji-suk.

331
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:46,469
It's totally my fault.

332
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:50,109
Who'd expect Ms. Song to appear at that
moment?

333
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,069
If I did, I would be a lunatic. Don't you think
so?

334
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,909
No, ma'am.

335
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,509
It's scarlet series in 900...

336
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,509
and currant series starting with 68, a red
color.

337
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:03,549
What is she saying?

338
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,229
Ms. Jeong, what are you saying now?

339
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:11,349
I asked you so many times to check it.

340
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:12,909
I can't believe this.

341
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:18,829
I get it. I won't ever go near the academy
again.

342
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:19,909
I promise.

343
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,829
You're a true friend.

344
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,189
Thank you, Ji-suk.

345
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:30,589
I'll never forget what you did for me.

346
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:33,869
I know how hard you work, Ms. Jeong.

347
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,309
But you know we have a tight schedule.

348
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:38,339
What is it?

349
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:39,755
It's nothing.

350
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,509
What is it? Is Mr. Kim there?

351
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,029
You're going through a lot.

352
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:47,069
Don't mention it.

353
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,589
Is he gone yet?

354
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:49,989
I forgot.

355
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,949
Ms. Song asked me about your mom.

356
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,149
What?

357
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:58,869
Ms. Song asked you about my mom?

358
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:00,949
Jung-eun.

359
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:02,829
What?

360
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:04,669
What? Hello?

361
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:09,469
Tell me now.

362
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:11,389
Don't you have any idea?

363
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,229
I said I don't.

364
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,389
I asked my mom, but she said she didn't
know her.

365
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,749
That's strange.

366
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:19,949
Ms. Song isn't someone...

367
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:21,429
who'd tolerate something like that.

368
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:22,469
I guess so.

369
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,029
Come on.

370
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:27,629
There's no chance my mom had met Ms.
Song before.

371
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,029
There's not a possibility.

372
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:37,789
Are you sleepy? Do you feel tired?

373
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:40,509
No, I'm not tired at all.

374
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,349
I'm so happy that I'm with you, Seo-yoon.

375
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:45,668
I'm so excited too.

376
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:48,549
You're excited.

377
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:50,629
I'm in big trouble.

378
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:52,789
Let's listen to the music.

379
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:53,819
Music?

380
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,349
Seo-yoon, how about we play a game?

381
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,949
Okay. What's the game?

382
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:02,429
The one who closes eyes and goes to sleep
first wins.

383
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:03,629
What do you think? It's easy, isn't it?

384
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:06,069
I've played it with Dad before.

385
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:08,709
I don't want to sleep. Let's just say I lost.

386
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:11,229
You've played it already.

387
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:16,189
Then turn on the music you want to listen to.

388
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:17,589
All right.

389
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:21,989
(Soundtrack of "Gem of Stars")

390
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,829

391
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,509
Chi Ring Chi Ring Chi Ri Ring

392
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,509
Gem of stars

393
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:34,269
Chant a spell with a magical song

394
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:36,029
Chi Ring Chi Ring Chi Ri Ring

395
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,189
Ju-hee?

396
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,189
Right?

397
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:51,229
Song Ju-hee.

398
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:06,989

401
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:36,989
Are you awake?

402
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:44,509
Chi Ring Chi Ring Chi Ri Ring

404
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,589
You must have been tired.

405
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:50,515
Do you know how many times...

406
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:51,908
I listened to this song today?

407
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:56,589
My cell phone ringtone is "Gem of Stars"
too.

408
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,829
What is it?

409
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,668
We woke you up. I'm sorry.

410
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:05,148
- I want to go to the bathroom. - Okay.

411
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,668
Please don't leave.

412
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:11,148
Can't we live together?

413
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,029
When we see each other again tomorrow,
it'll bring us another joy, right?

414
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:16,699
My sweetheart.

415
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:18,469
Go now.

416
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:21,469
Just staying with her today...

417
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:23,349
made you forget about your mom?

418
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:24,589
You see?

419
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:25,789
This is who I am.

420
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,509
What kind of nanny...

421
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,709
will Seo-yoon like more than you?

422
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:32,989
So, how about...

423
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:34,749
What?

424
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:35,989
Whatdoyoumean?

425
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:38,148
How about you care for her...

426
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:39,189
Then, what about the hospital?

427
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:41,469
What about the kids in there?

428
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,349
I know. I know what you mean, but...

429
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:44,509
I'm leaving!

430
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:46,749
Darn, please.

431
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:48,109
How can you be like this...

432
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:49,709
when she likes you this much?

433
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,589
Okay! You don't need to do that.

434
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:55,029
I didn't expect it either anyway.

435
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:57,549
You scared me!

436
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,069
Are you already leaving?

437
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:02,349
It'd be great if you stayed here a little longer.

438
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:03,355
Enough.

439
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,069
I mean...

440
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,989
Mother, take care!

441
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:08,829
Thanks a lot!

442
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,429
Honey, baby, Jeong-eun!

443
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:17,709
How could you raise your voice when we
request...

444
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:20,429
Forget it. You take care of this matter.

445
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,829
What do you mean by that?

446
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:24,629
Don't you see it?

447
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,549
My mom refused it, and we couldn't find a
nanny.

448
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:27,749
Then, who's next?

449
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:31,429
What's this? You mean my mom? Are you
serious?

450
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,309
No way!

451
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:35,829
Then, will our Seo-yoon go around alone?

452
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:39,189
You call your mom yourself.

453
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:42,029
Now is the time to talk nice and gentle.

454
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,589
But...

455
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:44,989
Honey. Jeong-eun!

456
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:54,668
Gosh.

457
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,069
What made you come here this early
morning?

458
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:58,389
You followed me even to the market.

459
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,109
I was worried that you would struggle...

460
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:01,589
in this cold weather.

461
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:02,829
Wait a second.

462
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:06,109
The chives look so fresh!

463
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:07,189
Look at this.

464
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,429
It looks...

465
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:11,869
- pretty good. - Yes.

466
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:13,749
I'll take five bundles of chives...

467
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:15,589
- and three napa cabbage. - I got it.

468
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:17,509
- Please put them here. - Yes. No problem.

469
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:18,709
Thank you.

470
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,349
Hey,

471
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:22,269
how Seo-yoon is doing?

472
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,908
It seemed she was shocked.

473
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:26,908
I felt this was the time...

474
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,429
the family should stay...

475
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:30,749
with her.

476
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:33,189
Sure. Family is the best!

477
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:36,789
That being said,

478
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,069
how about you take off work for now...

479
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,469
and take care of her?

480
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,029
What?

481
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,389
That was it! I wondered what made you here.

482
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,189
Stop your nonsense!

483
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:49,589
Just leave if you're going to keep saying
that!

484
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,869
Mom, please.

485
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:53,668
Don't you need radish?

486
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:56,989
Seo-yoon, are you eating it?

487
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:00,429
Mom, you should dry the tray...

488
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:01,829
before putting it in my bag.

489
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,349
You forgot it yesterday.

490
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:05,069
Really? Oh, my.

491
00:23:05,098 --> 00:23:06,098
I'm sorry.

492
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,469
Let's see.

493
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,509
I must've been crazy. I'm sorry.

494
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,309
Today, I did.

495
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:18,709
I checked it just now.

496
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,469
Seo-yoon, by the way,

497
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:24,829
did you memorize the script for the speech
competition?

498
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:26,549
No, not yet.

499
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,269
Aren't you supposed to make the speech
today?

500
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:36,189
"By the people,

501
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:38,229
of the people,

502
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,549
shall not perish from the earth."

503
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,668
How about practicing it with me this
evening?

504
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:47,269
Mom, I'm late!

505
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:49,309
Yes, you are! I got it.

506
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:51,229
We're late.

507
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:52,235
We're late again.

508
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:55,349
Mom, it hurts! Please do it gently.

509
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:57,709
Gosh, your hair is...

510
00:23:58,059 --> 00:23:59,429
Your hair grows so fast.

511
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,389
Seo-yoon,

512
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:05,949
instead of a nanny,

513
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:07,668
it's better...

514
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,549
if your grandma takes care of you, right?

515
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,189
Then,

516
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:13,789
you should directly appeal to your
grandma...

517
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,309
It is, but Grandma also works.

518
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:17,509
Like you.

519
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:19,309
I'm fine, Mom.

520
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,069
But the thing is, I'm not fine.

521
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:25,229
Let's go! We're late!

522
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,269
Get dressed!

523
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:27,858
Let's go!

524
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,269
Hurry up!

525
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,429
We're late!

526
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:39,589
It's a picture of a rainy day.

527
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:41,309
Where are you going with your umbrella?

528
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:46,389
Then,

529
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,349
when you want to tell me later,

530
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,549
please let me know, Su-chan.

531
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,389
Su-chan, come out. Time to go to the
academy.

532
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:00,469
Ma'am,

533
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,469
how about you wait until he finishes his
painting?

534
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:08,429
I take care of my son's business.

535
00:25:09,699 --> 00:25:10,789
Park Su-chan!

536
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:16,589
Hurry up!

537
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,589
What's wrong with you?

538
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:21,909
What are you going to do...

539
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,549
if he's rushed to the emergency room again?

540
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:24,629
What?

541
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,709
Are you a doctor or something?

542
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:28,509
Just helping in the emergency room once...

543
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:30,109
made you a doctor?

544
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:31,549
Park Su-chan!

545
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:37,149
I... I won't go...

546
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:39,269
to the academy.

547
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:42,829
What?

548
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,509
Park Su-chan.

549
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:46,629
What did you say?

550
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,309
Come over here.

551
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:50,109
Please!

552
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:51,469
Let's talk outside.

553
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:53,989
There are many kids here.

554
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:55,389
Come on out.

555
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:07,509
What did you say to my son?

556
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:09,869
What if he gets a lower score in the next
exam?

557
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:11,429
If you keep behaving like this,

558
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:15,429
I'll have to report your case as child abuse.

559
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:18,149
What? "Child abuse?"

560
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:21,429
Are you crazy? Say that again!

561
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,589
Yes.

562
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:24,909
I'm not a doctor or anything.

563
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:27,789
I'm telling you this as a mom.

564
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,309
This is absolutely abuse!

565
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,629
To make you feel satisfied...

566
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,229
Do you even know his condition?

567
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:37,349
You...

568
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:39,509
Do you think I'll just let this slice?

569
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:41,389
I'll post what you said...

570
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:42,829
on all of the hospital bulletinboards.

571
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:43,909
Do it.

572
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:46,469
I'll report it as child abuse.

573
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:49,509
Sure. Give it a try.

574
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:52,069
I won't just sit back and do nothing.

575
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:58,349
Park Su-chan, get up.

576
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,589
Get up.

577
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,109
Move.

578
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:07,389
Hurry up.

579
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:29,389
Why a gloomy face?

580
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:31,589
Ms. Ha requested me to have a list of 10
people...

581
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,829
for TR representatives within today.

582
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:35,189
Ha Sa-na requested that?

583
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:38,989
Almost no one knows about TR
representatives...

584
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:40,269
in our field.

585
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,589
We haven't even seen faces,

586
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,109
so how can we get contacts?

587
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:46,029
She said I must have good contacts with
others...

588
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,069
as I'm a marketer.

589
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,589
She wanted to get the list within today.

590
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:50,869
She must be crazy.

591
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:52,389
Why did she hand over her own work...

592
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:53,749
to another department?

593
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:56,109
This brat...

594
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:57,989
- Please. - You're dead now.

595
00:27:58,019 --> 00:27:59,349
Please, stop.

596
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:00,429
No way.

597
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:03,269
Please, don't step up in this matter, Ms. Lee.

598
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,069
I will...

599
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,509
- That brat... - Please sit down.

600
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,389
I'll handle this matter.

601
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:10,509
If that's the case...

602
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:13,629
You have business cards from the last
conference.

603
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,109
- Toss them to her! - Oh, I see.

604
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,629
She just threw some work.

605
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:18,149
You should also simply toss it, Ms. Han.

606
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,589
- That sounds like a good idea. - That rude
woman...

607
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,669
What is this?

608
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,349
Everything is red.

609
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:30,509
It's the draw lots of Myeongseong
Elementary School.

610
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:33,069
There's a jinx that...

611
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:34,949
if I carry red stuff,

612
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,509
it brings me luck.

613
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,309
But I think they went too far.

614
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:43,029
Are you really going to wear this tacky...

615
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:46,629
What did you say?

616
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:50,469
Ms. Han,

617
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:52,349
being a mom means...

618
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:54,629
never feeling ashamed.

619
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:57,589
It will end before lunchtime, right?

620
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:58,949
(12 entered Myeongseong Elementary
School.)

621
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:00,309
(37 entered Hanseon Foreign Language
High School.)

622
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,389
Oh, my.

623
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,029
So cool!

624
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,389
(56 entered Changseong Science High
School.)

625
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:05,949
(48 entered Hanguk University.)

626
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:07,099
It's amazing!

627
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,269
Ten minutes for a consultation.

628
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:13,989
- Who's first? - Me...

629
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,269
Oh, it's so shiny!

630
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,829
You look younger than the deity of the
baby...

631
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,189
and your skin is brighter...

632
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:22,829
than that of Taoist Fairy.

633
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,389
You're very sharp.

634
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:26,269
Your child's date of birth?

635
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,235
Here.

636
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:31,349
Hong Seo-yoon.

637
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:36,229
Do you think...

638
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,349
she can enter Myeongseong Elementary
School?

639
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:40,829
Let's see.

640
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:44,629
Born on May 20, theYearoftheGoldenDog.

641
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:46,229
(Myeongseong Elementary School)

642
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:47,669
Gosh.

643
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:49,029
Oh, my!

644
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:51,069
You graduated from Myeongseong
Elementary School?

645
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:52,075
Imightnotlookit,

646
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,099
butIwent to school in Daechi-dong.

647
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:54,115
From Myeongseong...

648
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:55,469
to Hanguk University majoring in English.

649
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:57,709
That's why...

650
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,829
I can predict one's future even in the IVY
league.

651
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:01,709
No way American deities can speak Korean,
right?

652
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:02,715
You're funny.

653
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:04,149
Would they use a translator?

654
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,269
A person like me at this level...

655
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:06,869
can only mention the IVY league!

656
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,909
She will enter.

657
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:20,939
"Enter?"

658
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,189
She's going to enter the school!

659
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:25,669
Even if I die here, I've nothing to regret.

660
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:28,709
Why die now? It's just the beginning.

661
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:31,509
You should pull yourself now!

662
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:33,309
A slight mistake can cause a big problem.

663
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,339
Sorry?

664
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:36,949
It's foggy! I can't see it clearly.

665
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:38,989
You should offer a devoutprayer.

666
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,429
A devoutprayer?

667
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,869
You mean performing an exorcism or
something?

668
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:45,309
Should Idanceonthebladeofthestrawcutter...

669
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:46,949
in this harsh weather?

670
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:49,189
You should do a devout prayer as a mom!

671
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:52,429
What should I do?

672
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:53,509
Write it down.

673
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:03,229
The Toad Rock in Mount Buram.

674
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:08,309
Go back and get the biggest piece of taffy.

675
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:10,309
Put it on the rock and pray sincerely.

676
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:12,469
Of course, I should.

677
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:15,269
But there's no use going alone.

678
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:16,949
Go as a two and pray twice as much.

679
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:18,989
Does that mean I should go with my
husband?

680
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:20,309
Why?

681
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:22,029
No. I should go, no matter what.

682
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:24,229
General, please read my daughter's fortune
too.

683
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,229
This is my daughter So-ra's date of birth.

684
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:36,189
It says she enters Myeongseong too.

685
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:37,219
Oh, my!

686
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:39,509
It's so good for you.

687
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:41,749
Thank you so much, General.

688
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:44,989
Done? Next.

689
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:46,709
Wait!

690
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,549
Just one more.

691
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:50,669
What is it?

692
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:53,629
I'm urgently looking for a nanny.

693
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:56,189
Where should we go to find the best one?

694
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:03,269
You don't need to find one.

695
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:04,749
The precious person is reaching out to you.

696
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:06,629
Really?

697
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,709
I'm here!

698
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:16,789
This way!

699
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:18,509
Take a seat.

700
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:20,629
- You came early. - Yes, I did.

701
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:24,029
I thought about it at home,

702
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,029
and I didn't even ask your name.

703
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,789
I'm not talking about Jinny or Jenny or
something.

704
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:30,189
- It's Yoon Ji-a. - Yoon Ji-a?

705
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:32,349
That's such a pretty name!

706
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:44,229
They're acting up again.

707
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:45,395
Sorry?

708
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,309
No, don't worry. Ignore it.

709
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:49,109
I thought you weren't good at reading the
air...

710
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:50,389
as you looked a bit stubborn.

711
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:52,829
Is it right? You don't know what's going on,
right?

712
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:01,469
Am I...

713
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:05,749
being ostracized or something?

714
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:08,509
Oh, you know it. That's it!

715
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:11,549
You, Ms. Yoon Ji-a, fought...

716
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:15,429
severely against Jason's mom,

717
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:17,429
who is always with Tommy's mom.

718
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:20,149
Everyone's wary of Tommy's mom. That's
why.

719
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,029
If they ask you something,

720
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:23,989
they may be marked by Tommy's mom.

721
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,149
Marked by Tommy's mom?

722
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,115
Yes.

723
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:32,069
Even the director of this academy can't
contradict her.

724
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:34,029
It's like a mouse in front of a cat.

725
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,789
I'm just worried about Seo-yoon.

726
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,189
And that government of the people,

727
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:48,069
by the people, for the people,

728
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,629
- shall not perish from the earth. - Stop!

729
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:51,989
Claire, time is up.

730
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,309
Next time, let's be a bit quicker!

731
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:56,909
Try to finish within the time, okay?

732
00:33:56,939 --> 00:33:57,949
Okay.

733
00:33:57,979 --> 00:33:59,269
Still, well done.

734
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:01,709
All right. Go take a seat.

735
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:06,749
Everybody, let's give a round of applause to
Claire!

736
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,589
- Teacher? - Yes?

737
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,189
Why did you say Claire did a good job?

738
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,989
We all saw that she went over the time limit!

739
00:34:19,939 --> 00:34:21,748
Speaking that slowly...

740
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:24,349
- will disqualify her! - That's right!

741
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:28,629
Stop making a mess and take care of your
business.

742
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:32,989
I saw you speak terribly!

743
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:35,109
Who teaches whom now?

744
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:37,949
What? Darn, you are wrong!

745
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:40,149
- Are you sure you're done? - Yes, I'm
finished!

746
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,469
English only, kids!

747
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:47,748
Okay. Now everybody, let's...

748
00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:49,309
Do you think it makes sense...

749
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:50,315
that kids are involved in adults' arguments?

750
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,629
So, at first, I also thought...

751
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,549
about turning over tables...

752
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,509
and leaving with my Tae-rin.

753
00:34:57,218 --> 00:34:58,268
But the thing is,

754
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:00,589
this place is so good at teaching English...

755
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:03,149
to kids.

756
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:05,829
What's the point of improving English only?

757
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:06,949
Their characters are--

758
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,029
Do you commute...

759
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:09,059
from the traditional Cheonghak-
dongVillage?

760
00:35:09,979 --> 00:35:11,069
Sorry?

761
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,349
You look stylish,

762
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:15,829
but what you say is very old-school.

763
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:18,869
Am I?

764
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:23,029
I've never heard of that before.

765
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:25,589
Your age makes you be like that, then.

766
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,949
Let's keep things quiet, okay?

767
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:36,788
Son! Mom's here. Where are you?

768
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:38,829
- Mom. - Yes?

769
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:41,909
I lost the pencil you bought me yesterday.

770
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,189
The red one.

771
00:35:43,218 --> 00:35:46,389
Oh, my gosh! Do you know how much it
was?

772
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:51,189
By the way, Jason. Why did you just come
out?

773
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:54,709
You should be with Tommy!

774
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,989
It's a break time.

775
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:59,909
That's why!

776
00:35:59,939 --> 00:36:02,709
You should be with Tommy and get along
well!

777
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:04,748
Go back to the class!

778
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,469
Back to class! Quick!

779
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:08,509
It's so annoying!

780
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,029
- What? - I hate it!

781
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:15,389
This place is amazing, isn't it?

782
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:18,549
Yes, indeed.

783
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:26,829
Lee Min-ho.

784
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:28,755
It's okay to skip things,

785
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:30,429
but you should eat salmon every day.

786
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:31,989
That's good for your brain development.

787
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:40,669
And regarding the speech practice,

788
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,189
I'll join you and watch.

789
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:49,709
Why aren't you answering?

790
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,509
Lee Min-ho!

791
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:56,629
How many times have I told you not to bite
your nails?

792
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,589
What would others think if they see you?

793
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,549
(Myeongseong Elementary Parent
Representative)

794
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:05,189
Hello, ma'am. How have you been?

795
00:37:05,218 --> 00:37:06,349
We're going to play golf...

796
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:07,389
with the members of Myeongseong mothers.

797
00:37:07,419 --> 00:37:09,549
Can you spare time?

798
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:10,669
Tomorrow?

799
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:12,389
Why? You can't?

800
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:14,549
Of course, I can.

801
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,909
Then, let's meet at the club lounge.

802
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:18,989
I'll see you tomorrow, ma'am.

803
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,669
Mom, then what about the academy?

804
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,429
Can I skip it tomorrow?

805
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:26,709
What are you talking about? Why would you
skip it?

806
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:28,589
That won't happen.

807
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:34,949
Hello.

808
00:37:38,419 --> 00:37:39,669
Hey, Professor Kim.

809
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:42,989
This weekend?

810
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:46,109
What's the point of going alone...

811
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,669
for the couples' meeting?

812
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:51,069
I'm planning to go fishing.

813
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:53,589
Okay. See you.

814
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,349
Father, it's me.

815
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:04,829
Oh, yes.

816
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:08,509
I'd like to ask you a favor.

817
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,788
A favor? What is it?

818
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,349
I have an important appointment tomorrow.

819
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,509
If you can spare time,

820
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:18,469
can you drive Min-ho to his academy?

821
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:20,389
Tomorrow afternoon?

822
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:22,509
Sure.

823
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,909
Luckily, I only have classes in the morning.

824
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:28,189
- Thank you so much.- Don't mention it.

825
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:31,069
I haven't seen him for a while. So, it's a good
chance.

826
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:33,389
Please help pick him up tomorrow.

827
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,268
Okay. Take care.

828
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,909
It is the principle, which promises a state...

829
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:44,589
in the selfish pursuit of power,

830
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:50,149
to disregard its treaties and its solemn
pledges,

831
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:53,909
which sanctions the use of force,

832
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:57,829
or threat of force, against...

833
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:01,149
soverei...

834
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,149
Lee Min-ho.

835
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:05,109
Pull yourself together.

836
00:39:05,738 --> 00:39:08,268
You made a mistake again there. Do it again!

837
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:12,589
Soverei...

838
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:13,709
Lee Min-ho!

839
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,149
How many times has it been?

840
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:17,349
Pull yourself together!

841
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,268
You know the competition will happen soon,
right?

842
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:24,669
Yes, I know.

843
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:27,788
You know, but he can only do this much?

844
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:29,268
I apologize.

845
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:31,109
Forget it.

846
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:33,748
I'll ask you one thing.

847
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:38,869
Can you make sure he wins first place or
not?

848
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:40,989
I'm sure he can, ma'am.

849
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:42,909
You said you were sure.

850
00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:45,748
Yes.

851
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:48,229
Lee Min-ho.

852
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:51,069
I'll check it again tomorrow.

853
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:54,509
So, pull yourself together and focus. You got
it?

854
00:39:56,218 --> 00:39:57,229
Okay.

855
00:40:05,179 --> 00:40:07,389
(Min-ho's schedule)

858
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:55,829
Don't say anything.

That this nation, under God, shall have...

861
00:41:13,899 --> 00:41:15,909
a new birth of freedom,

862
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:19,349
and that government of the people,

863
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:22,229
by the people, for the people...

864
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:28,949
Seo-yoon. You're out of time.

865
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:30,669
You must finishin time.

866
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:31,955
I know that.

867
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:33,869
But I can't seem to finish in time.

868
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:35,309
You told me to enunciatethe words.

869
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,669
Yes, enunciatingthe words is great.

870
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:39,349
But you must also finish in time.

871
00:41:39,379 --> 00:41:41,429
Mom. Can't I do this tomorrow?

872
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,469
No.

873
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:44,149
What do you mean? The competitionis next
week.

874
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:47,748
I don't want to do it because I'm not good at
it.

875
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:50,629
That's why we're practicingtogether.

876
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:51,635
Right?

877
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:52,949
All right. Let's try again.

878
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:55,349
Chin up. Look at me.

879
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,429
I said I didn't want to do it today.

881
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:00,788
I said I didn't want to do it.

882
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,829
But why won't you listen to me?

883
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:04,429

884
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,429
Don't you want to join Class A?

885
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:08,515
Let's try it one last time. I promise.

886
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,149
This will be the last time.

887
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:13,229
- Seo-yoon, give it to me. - What are you
doing?

888
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:15,469
Let's stop for today and go for a walk
instead.

889
00:42:15,698 --> 00:42:17,469
- Bring your jacket. - Okay!

890
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,589
You're not going out this late at night.

891
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:22,389

892

Let's go!

894
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:27,949
What?

895
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,429
Come on!

896
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:32,429
Good grief!

897
00:42:33,499 --> 00:42:35,909

900
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:45,268
Yes.

901
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:48,748
Mom also likes chocolate.

902

What do you like,Seo-yoon?

903
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:55,349

What? That's me.

906
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:01,629
Well,

907
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:05,149
but the Genie is the lamp fairy.

908
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:07,509
You can call me wheneveryou need me.

909
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:09,909
Then I'll pop up like the Genie.

910
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:12,149
Does it mean we can come here...

911
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:13,669
and stargazewheneverI call you?

912
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:15,509
You must like stars then.

913
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:19,469
My gosh. You're just like your mother.

914
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:20,788
Your mother loved...

915
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:22,788
stargazingwhen she was a child too.

916
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:25,389
I'll do everythingMom likes.

917
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:28,909

competitiontoo.

919
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:33,669
It doesn't matter...

920
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:37,189
if you win an award at the competitionor not.

921
00:43:37,419 --> 00:43:39,469
Your mother will love you all the same.

922
00:43:39,738 --> 00:43:41,709
But still. If I win first place,

923
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:43,949
Mom will be happier.

924
00:43:44,698 --> 00:43:46,509
But it's too hard.

925
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,909
And that government

926
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:07,429
of the people, by the people,

927
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:08,989
for the people,

928
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:10,748
shall not perish...

929
00:44:10,779 --> 00:44:13,989
Oh, my. I sound like a man! It's not fun at all,
right?

930
00:44:14,379 --> 00:44:16,429
Right. I hate it.

931
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:18,829
I'll tell you what. Let's win first place.

932
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:21,069
But let's have fun at the same time.

933
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,829
How?

934
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,189
Well, let's abort this boringspeech first.

935
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:28,029
Let's make the script interesting.

936
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,589
Is that allowed?

937
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:32,748
Of course, it is.

938
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:36,069
But under one condition.

939
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:39,229
You can't tell your mom about it.

940
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:41,229
Okay. It's our secret.

941
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:42,379
Great.

942
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:45,389
Starting today, this will be our practice spot.

943
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:47,949
We'll do it at our secret spot. What do you
say?

944
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:49,389
Sounds good.

945
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:53,939
What?

946
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:56,788
My gosh.

947
00:44:57,979 --> 00:44:59,949
This is your favoritering.

948
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:01,149
That's right.

949
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:03,268
Now, we're BFFs.

950
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:04,629
BFFs?

951
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:06,549
Best friends forever!

952
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,309
Yes!

953
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,029
And this is the secret spot of BFFs.

954
00:45:11,419 --> 00:45:13,109
I won't tell anyoneabout it.

955
00:45:13,899 --> 00:45:16,589
Same here. I keep it a secret too.

956
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:31,309
Let's take off your jacket.

957
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:34,189
What did you two do?

958
00:45:34,218 --> 00:45:36,149
What do you think? We practicedtogether.

959
00:45:36,419 --> 00:45:38,429
We decided to practice the speechtogether.

960
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:41,589
Really?

961
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:44,829
You're goingto help her with the
speechcompetition?

962
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:46,669
You don't trust me?

963
00:45:47,419 --> 00:45:50,509
No. I do. But...

964
00:45:50,859 --> 00:45:52,589
So I'll do it.

965
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:54,709
Really?

966
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,389
You can't back out of this later.

967
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:00,349
Your mother is happy, isn't she?

968
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:01,669
- Yes! - Right?

969
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:04,909
Of course.

970
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:06,549
I'll check it right away and call you back.

971
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:08,589
Yes, thank you. Bye.

972
00:46:09,218 --> 00:46:11,469
Who in the world taught you to work like
this?

973
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:14,069
Did you think throwing me a few
businesscards...

974
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:15,829
would make me think you were competent...

975
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:17,229
and let it slide?

976
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:20,029
I'm sorry, Ms. Ha.

977
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:21,629
That's not it.

978
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:23,189
- How dare you talk back to me? - Come on.

979
00:46:23,218 --> 00:46:24,389
What's this about?

980
00:46:25,939 --> 00:46:27,629
It's nothing,sir.

981
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,509
I was talking to Ms. Han from Marketing...

982
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:30,949
regarding the TR project.

983
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:32,268
Ms. Han?

984
00:46:32,698 --> 00:46:34,709
I see. You're the one...

985
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:35,909
who volunteeredto join the project.

986
00:46:36,779 --> 00:46:39,829
You must be busy with your tasks from
Marketing.

987
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:41,189
Right.

988
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:44,389
She's such a motivatedemployee, sir.

989
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:48,669
I see. How's the meeting with the CEO
going?

990
00:46:48,698 --> 00:46:51,268
Actually,we were justtalkingabout that.

991
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:53,029
Ms. Han will find a way to contact the CEO...

992
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,469
beforeshe gets off work.

993
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:58,109
It seems the juniorswant to work with you.

994
00:46:58,459 --> 00:46:59,829
It's great to see that.

995
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:01,069
I'll report to you...

996
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:02,589
the momentthe meetingis scheduled.

997
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,669
Sure. Thanks.

998
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:05,788
Have a good day.

999
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:08,109
Hello.

1000
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:14,949
(Ms. Lee. Try these. I hope you win. Be a
winner.)

1001
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:21,709
Good luck with Myeongseong Elementary
School.

1002
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,949
- See you tomorrow. - Okay.

1003
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:29,509
Ms. Lee. Try these on. I hope you win.

1004
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:30,909
Be a winner.

1005
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:34,869
You're late.

1006
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:36,389
Yes, I'm a bit late.

1007
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,109
Your child isn't even enrolled in our school.

1008
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:40,035
How could you be late--

1009
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:42,829
Forget it. I must have had too high an
opinion of her.

1010
00:48:43,179 --> 00:48:44,589
I'm sorry,ma'am.

1011
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:48,419
Ms. Park.

1012
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:55,829
Hello.

1013
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:57,629

1014
00:48:57,779 --> 00:49:00,029
My gosh. It's Park Jin-yi.

1015
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,268
What's going on, Ho-gyung?

1016
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:05,589
Ms. Park will be joiningyou...

1017
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:07,309
on the fieldtoday.

1018
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:08,909
I had to coordinatethe scheduleat the last
minute,

1019
00:49:08,939 --> 00:49:10,189
so I was late.

1020
00:49:10,218 --> 00:49:11,194
I'm sorry.

1021
00:49:11,218 --> 00:49:12,669
Gosh, don't worryabout that now.

1022
00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:14,989
I look forward to hittingthe course with you.

1023
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:18,469
How thoughtfulyou are.

1024
00:49:18,738 --> 00:49:20,389
Let me formallyintroduce you.

1025
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:22,589
Her son, Min-ho, will soon enroll in our
school.

1026
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:24,189
Her name is Song Ho-gyung.

1027
00:49:41,738 --> 00:49:43,829
- Good shot. - Oh, my.

1028
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,669
- Good shot. - Good shot.

1029
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:03,349
(Full)

1030
00:50:03,379 --> 00:50:04,629
Oh, no.

1031
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:06,749
There's no availableparkingspot here.

1032
00:50:10,979 --> 00:50:13,149
- Are you Tommy's grandpa? - What?

1033
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:15,989
Oh, yes.

1034
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:17,829
I'll show you where to park.

1035
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:18,949
What?

1036
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:24,269
(No Parking)

1037
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:36,749
The top floor is Class A where Tommy
studies.

1038
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:38,589
I see.

1039
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:45,389
- This way. - Thank you.

1040
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:48,589
To disregard...

1041
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,029
its treaties and its solemn pledges,

1042
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:56,029
which sanctions the use of force,

1043
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:58,509
or threat of force,

1044
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:00,509
against the...

1045
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:03,989
soverei...

1046
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:06,869
Soverei...

1047
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:15,989
Lee Min-ho.

1048
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:17,949
Pull yourself together.

1049
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:19,869
You made a mistake again there.

1050
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:22,989
How many times has it been?

1051
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:24,829
Pull yourself together!

1052
00:51:28,979 --> 00:51:30,829
Okay, Tommy. Take a seat.

1053
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:35,749
All right. Class is dismissed. See you
tomorrow.

1054
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:37,989
- Thank you, Sarah. - Thank you, Sarah.

1055
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:02,229
Lee Min-ho.

1056
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:22,269
Min-ho.

1057
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:24,989
Grandpa.

1058
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,469
You forgot your backpack.

1059
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:32,029
You shouldn't bite your nails.

1060
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:34,309
Don't touch me!

1061
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,549
Grandpa, you're mean. I hate you.

1062
00:52:40,939 --> 00:52:42,269
No, Min-ho.

1063
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:46,189
I didn't think you'd--

1064
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:47,789
Who are you?

1065
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:52,069
Did you make Min-ho cry?

1066
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:53,509
Are you a bad guy?

1067
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:55,389
No, I was...

1068
00:52:55,419 --> 00:52:56,949
Excuse me.

1069
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,789
Now we're the same height.

1070
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:02,389
We're the same, right?

1071
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:03,909
Yes.

1072
00:53:03,939 --> 00:53:06,109
Let's get up. It's time to go home.

1073
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:12,669
Sorry.

1074
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:14,949
I forgot to introduce myself.

1075
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:17,029
Nice to meet you.

1076
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:19,109
My name is Yoon Ji-a.

1077
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:21,869
Hello. My name is Lee Min-ho.

1078
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:23,509
Hi, Min-ho.

1079
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,349
She's my grandma. Isn't she pretty?

1080
00:53:25,699 --> 00:53:26,749
Yes.

1081
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:29,389
Oh, how nice.

1082
00:53:34,259 --> 00:53:36,869
What is that supposed to mean?

1083
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:40,189
Nothing, you're pretty.

1084
00:53:40,779 --> 00:53:42,469
You're beautiful.

1085
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:43,989
I know.

1086
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:46,355
Here.

1087
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:48,629
You shake hands when you meet someone
new.

1088
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:56,189
Nice to meet you.

1089
00:53:58,619 --> 00:53:59,669
Min-ho.

1090
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:04,149
I'm a really good painter.

1091
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:08,989
So I want to give you my painting as a gift.

1092
00:54:09,939 --> 00:54:11,109
Will you accept it?

1093
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,789
A gift?

1094
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:16,109
Yes, she means it. Say you'll accept it.

1095
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:17,309
Let's get up.

1096
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:19,789
Good boy.

1097
00:54:22,899 --> 00:54:25,509
Do you need help getting up, sir?

1098
00:54:26,419 --> 00:54:29,309
No, I can get up on my own.

1099
00:54:31,419 --> 00:54:32,749
Good job.

1100
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:34,789
Let's go.

1101
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:38,669
It sounds like a compliment.

1102
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:42,709
Maybe not.

1103
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:52,109
How can you draw with that?

1104
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:54,949
Like this. What do you think? Pretty, right?

1105
00:54:56,939 --> 00:54:58,309
On nails?

1106
00:54:59,259 --> 00:55:02,189
Maybe I'll do that later.

1107
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:05,749
Then...

1108
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:09,069
do you want to draw on your grandpa's nails
first?

1109
00:55:09,979 --> 00:55:11,269
Give me your hand.

1110
00:55:12,019 --> 00:55:13,909
- What? - Your hand.

1111
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:18,909
But...

1112
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:22,909
Seo-yoon, brown.

1113
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:26,789
Thank you.

1114
00:55:56,299 --> 00:55:59,349
I want to try it too.

1115
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:01,149
Really?

1116
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:03,189
Then I'll start on you first.

1117
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:05,709
Give me your hand.

1118
00:56:08,459 --> 00:56:11,989
Can you draw a dinosaur too?

1119
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:13,429
Of course.

1120
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:16,109
I'm good at drawing dinosaurs.

1121
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,309
Check this out.

1122
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,749
Seo-yoon, green.

1123
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:28,629
Here.

1124
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:30,829
Let's draw a dinosaur.

1125
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:58,629
Min-ho.

1126
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:03,709
Your nail is too short to draw everything.

1127
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,389
If you come back with longer nails next
week,

1128
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:08,829
I can draw the whole dinosaur.

1129
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:16,269
Grow your nails,

1130
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:18,109
so we can draw a cool dinosaur.

1131
00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:20,509
What do you say?

1132
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:24,669
Can you do it?

1133
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:27,749
Yes, I can do it.

1134
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:36,429
It's my favorite, but I'll give it to you.

1135
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:39,869
You're so lucky.

1136
00:57:42,299 --> 00:57:43,349
Nice.

1137
00:57:44,939 --> 00:57:45,949
I like it.

1138
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:47,869
Do you like it that much?

1139
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,509
No, I meant--

1140
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:54,069
You seem to like it so much.

1141
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:10,659
Min-hee.

1142
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:12,429
Is Ms. Han out for work?

1143
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:14,429
No, Deputy Director Ha wanted to see her.

1144
00:58:14,459 --> 00:58:15,669
So she went to the rooftop terrace.

1145
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:22,949
I told you to find it before today.

1146
00:58:23,419 --> 00:58:24,789
Did you not take me seriously?

1147
00:58:25,179 --> 00:58:26,189
Not at all.

1148
00:58:26,219 --> 00:58:29,189
I called everyone today.

1149
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:32,149
You called them? But you couldn't find it?

1150
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,229
Is that it?

1151
00:58:33,699 --> 00:58:35,709
Is that how the marketing team does their
job?

1152
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:38,789
Who taught you to work like that?

1153
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:40,389
Who else?

1154
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:43,669
It was me. What are you going to do about
that?

1155
00:58:43,699 --> 00:58:44,869
Ms. Lee.

1156
00:58:44,899 --> 00:58:47,109
- Let me go. - Don't be a jerk.

1157
00:58:47,139 --> 00:58:49,629
File the work officially with respect.

1158
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:50,989
Then I'll get it done for you.

1159
00:58:51,019 --> 00:58:52,949
So stop harassing Ms. Han, got it?

1160
00:58:52,979 --> 00:58:54,509
Have you lost your mind?

1161
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:56,229
Let me go!

1162
00:58:58,459 --> 00:58:59,709
(We'd like to thank Son Jong-hak, Kim Tae-
hun,)

1163
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:00,949
(Miram, and Park Jin-yi for their special
appearance.)

1164
00:59:31,899 --> 00:59:35,469
(Mother and Mom)

1165
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:37,109
Why would Director Yoon want to see me?

1166
00:59:37,379 --> 00:59:39,189
Who would accept someone who got fired...

1167
00:59:39,219 --> 00:59:40,749
- after assaulting her superior?- Gosh.

1168
00:59:41,259 --> 00:59:42,909
How dare an art therapist...

1169
00:59:42,939 --> 00:59:44,629
act up?

1170
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:47,189
Seo-yoon, you can trust Mommy.

1171
00:59:47,779 --> 00:59:49,629
Hey. That's bad luck!

1172
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:52,989
Jung-eun, have some taffy.

1173
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:54,989
Are you crazy?

1174
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:56,309
Do you still call yourself a dad?

1175
00:59:57,619 --> 00:59:58,949
If Seo-yoon can get into Myeongseong
Elementary,

1176
00:59:58,979 --> 01:00:00,349
I'd do anything.

1177
01:00:00,899 --> 01:00:02,229
- Seven.- Really?
