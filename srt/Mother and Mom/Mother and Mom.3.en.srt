Min-hee.

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,949
Is Ms. Han out for work?

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,830
No, Deputy Director Ha wanted to see her.

14
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,030
So she went to the rooftop terrace.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,670
Is that how the marketing team does their
job?

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,470
Who taught you to work like that?

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,190
Who else?

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,110
It was me. What are you going to do about
that?

19
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,190
Ms. Lee.

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,350
File the work officially with respect.

21
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,590
Then I'll get it done for you.

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,470
So stop harassing Ms. Han, got it?

23
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,110
Have you lost your mind?

24
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,350
What are they doing?

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,430
My goodness.

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,990
- Calm down. - Get out of my way.

27
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,430
It's okay. Let her go, Ms. Han.

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,749
Let's see what she does.

29
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,510
Lee Jung-eun.

30
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,950
You just made a big mistake.

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,510
Mistake my foot.

32
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,830
Who's the one who made a mistake?

33
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,310
We'll see about that.

34
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,710
Is she okay?

35
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,390
What was that about?

36
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,350
What just happened?

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,630
Fighting at work?

38
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,310
- That's ridiculous. - Unbelievable.

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,750
Are you okay, Ms. Lee?

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,430
Me?

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,910
What have I done?

42
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,750
Gosh.

43
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,070
So annoying.

44
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,710
Lee Jung-eun.

45
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,950
So that's how you want to play?

46
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,670
I won't forgive you.

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,789
(Episode 3)

48
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,069
Be careful.

49
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,870
Can we go for ice cream with Min-ho?

50
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,789
Ice cream? Shall we?

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,430
Min-ho, do you want to come?

52
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,870
- Oh, my mom is... - Hey.

53
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,990
I will give your mom a call.

54
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,950
Let's get ice cream with them.

55
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,190
Really? Are you sure, Grandpa?

56
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,310
Let's go. I want to go with you.

57
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:37,110
May we join you?

58
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,150
Sure.

59
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,190
Let's go.

60
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,910
Why are you laughing?

61
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,110
Do I have something on my face?

62
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,710
I'm Elsa, and Jinny is Anna.

63
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,390
Are you Kristoff?

64
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,070
Who's that?

65
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,550
Anna's boyfriend.

66
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,910
Boyfriend?

67
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,310
No. Never.

68
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,270
I'm not her boyfriend.

69
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,030
You don't have to deny it that much.

70
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,910
I mean,

71
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,310
not yet.

72
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,670
Not yet?

73
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,750
We're just friends.

74
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,430
Like how you two are friends.

75
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,790
I see. Like me and him?

76
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,670
Grandpa, your hand.

77
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,870
What?

78
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,630
Today is your first day.

79
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,870
Try to be friends.

80
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,110
Grandpa.

81
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,630
Yes?

82
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,270
Since when did the word friends...

83
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,590
feel so sad?

84
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,590
Why is that sad?

85
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,750
Min-ho.

86
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,270
Everything starts as a friend.

87
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,750
What?

88
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,870
Grandpa.

89
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,310
Yes?

90
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:28,590
Can you come pick me up tomorrow again?

91
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,310
Tomorrow again?

92
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,750
Yes.

93
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,230
I love it when you come to pick me up.

94
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,670
Did you have fun today?

95
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,230
So much.

96
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,790
So come pick me up again tomorrow.

97
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,230
Sure. I will.

98
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,350
Your hand.

99
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,870
But...

100
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,670
Boyfriend?

101
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,070
Not yet.

102
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,190
Am I losing my mind?

103
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,590
- What? - What? What was that?

104
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,510
You just said something.

105
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,310
No. I didn't say anything.

106
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,390
Seo-yoon, remember that song?

107
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,310
"The Star of Jewel?"

108
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:33,950
Yes, "The Star of Jewel."

109
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,030
Do you want to listen to that?

110
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,030
- Yes. Sounds good. - Okay.

113

How dare an art therapist...

114
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,830
act up?

115

(Hanguk University Hospital Pediatric)

116
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,790
I'm posting this...

117
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,230
on the hospital bulletin board.

118
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,230
We're home.

119
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,150
Father.

120
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,470
Thank you for everything today.

121
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,950
You're welcome.

122
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,470
I had a good time.

123
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,670
Oh, right.

124
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,030
I was thinking about...

125
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,870
giving Min-ho a ride tomorrow too.

126
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,710
Tomorrow?

127
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,230
No.

128
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,830
He has to get ready for his English speech.

129
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,110
I'll give him a ride.

130
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,390
Drive safe. Goodnight.

131
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,230
Oh, is that so?

132
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,950
Lee Min-ho, say goodbye to Grandpa.

133
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,910
Goodbye.

134
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,350
Okay, Min-ho.

135
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,510
Goodnight.

136
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,670
I'll see you later.

137
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,550
- Bye. - Bye.

138
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,590
Bye.

139
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,350
Lee Min-ho.

140
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,110
What are you hiding?

141
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,030
Show me.

142
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,310
Who did this to you?

143
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,230
What is all this?

144
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,990
Who did this?

145
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,390
Mom.

146
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,950
Lee Min-ho, get changed...

147
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,070
and review what you learned today.

148
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,550
Hurry.

149
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,750
Min-ho.

150
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,350
Min-ho, I was...

151
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,550
Liar.

152
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,630
I can't draw a dinosaur anymore.

Pinkru.

156
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,830
Oh, that was fast.

157
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:36,590
"What do I do when I'm happy?"

158
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,670
Well...

159
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,709
Three, two...

160
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:41,990
Looking at your pictures.

161
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,990
- Really? - Of course.

162
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,310
"What's my favorite?"

163
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,870
Just one?

164
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,270
Three,

165
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,230
- two... - Mom.

166
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,310
What? What about Dad?

167
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,910
You said I could pick only one.

168
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,670
Let's say I lost.

169
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,390
It's still a game.

170
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:06,070
I won.

171
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,910
Yes, I'll grant your wish.

172
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,030
Well, my wish is...

173
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,590
for you to join the speech contest...

174
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:15,070
with your favorite story.

175
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,230
Can you make a different wish?

176
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,350
What?

177
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,390
You agreed to change the script...

178
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,590
to something interesting.

179
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,230
BFF's pinky swear, have you forgotten?

180
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,949
Sorry.

181
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,030
But to place first,

182
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,190
I need to choose something hard.

183
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,670
I bet not.

184
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,709
- Really? - Yes.

185
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,230
Even if you give a speech on something you
really want,

186
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,829
you can still win first place.

187
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,310
Then I'll do that.

188
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,670
But we must win first place.

189
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,670
Seo-yoon.

190
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,630
Why do you want to place first that badly?

191
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,110
If I place first, Mom will be really happy.

192
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,750
She wouldn't worry about me either.

193
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,190
I even wrote a letter to give to Mom

194
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,350
if I won first place.

195
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:07,910
A letter?

196
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,790
I'll show you since we're BFF.

197
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,270
Can I really read it?

198
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,030
Thank you.

199
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,310
You take after your mom.

200
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,390
Ms. Park, what brings you to call me at this
hour?

201
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,230
No.

202
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,949
What about the bulletin board?

203
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,110
Pediatric department.

204
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,070
You can't make it today?

205
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,709
Another cancellation?

206
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,550
They're going overboard over a single post.

207
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,270
(Hanguk University Hospital)

208
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,910
It seems there was a misunderstanding...

209
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,510
between you and Ms. Yoon.

210
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,950
I will apologize on behalf of the hospital.

211
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,590
A misunderstanding?

212
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,390
It seems like Ms. Yoon made a mistake.

213
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,790
We ask for your generous understanding.

214
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,790
Whether I understand or not depends on
how she behaves.

215
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,710
My apologies, ma'am.

216
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,950
What?

217
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,710
Is that it?

218
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,470
You were making a scene...

219
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,270
about how I was abusing my son.

220
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,990
"My apologies?"

221
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,710
I thought you were going to...

222
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,110
go on your knees or something.

223
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,350
Is that...

224
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,190
what you want?

225
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,870
Ma'am, please calm down...

226
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,990
Calm down?

227
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,830
Yes, I will calm down.

228
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,510
And I will delete the post.

229
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,830
But...

230
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,910
fire her in return.

231
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,350
For your information, my husband is a
journalist.

232
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,470
Social affairs journalist.

233
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,630
It'd help you make your decision, right?

234
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,190
Know your place.

235
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,550
Wearing a gown doesn't make you a doctor.

236
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,990
Ma'am.

237
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,390
She's been working here for over 20 years...

238
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,550
and has never caused trouble before.

239
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,590
Wait.

240
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,830
What are you saying?

241
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,750
Are you saying she's someone...

242
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,470
who never caused trouble before,

243
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,550
and I'm the weird one?

244
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,070
No, that's not what I meant.

245
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,430
What the heck?

246
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,470
Are you stepping forward to defend her?

247
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,510
And you make me the bad person?

248
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,070
I don't want to hear it anymore.

249
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,030
Please wait, ma'am.

250
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,110
If I quit,

251
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,230
will that do?

252
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,910
Ms. Yoon.

253
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,190
That's what you want, isn't it?

254
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,750
Yes.

255
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,990
Sure, I will do that.

256
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,910
Ms. Yoon, wait.

257
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,990
But...

258
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,990
under one condition.

259
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,350
A condition?

260
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,670
You think you're in a situation to suggest
that?

261
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,510
She's still not reading the room yet.

262
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,550
I only ask for one thing.

263
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,830
In return for my resignation,

264
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,830
I want Su-chan to continue his therapy.

265
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,790
It's the therapy he must not miss,

266
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,230
not the academy.

267
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,110
If you give up on his therapy like now,

268
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,030
then...

269
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,110
I am going to report you for child abuse.

270
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,750
And the media where your husband works
at...

271
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,310
will be the first place I report it to.

272
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,790
What?

273
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,790
You still don't...

274
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,270
Thank you for everything.

275
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,790
Ms. Yoon.

276
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,750
Ms. Yoon.

277
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,750
(Pediatric Department, Yun Jeong-jin)

278
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,030
If you quit like this, what about my child?

279
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,470
Don't worry too much.

280
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,070
Ms. Park loves children.

281
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,350
Still...

282
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,990
If anything happens to your son, give me a
call.

283
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,430
I'm willing to help you at any time.

284
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,550
Thank you.

285
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,590
Su-chan, let's go. We're late.

286
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,670
Where's Ms. Lee?

287
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,310
- Ms. Lee? - Yes.

288
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,990
Ms. Lee.

289
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,110
What's the matter?

290
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,390
What?

291
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,269
Did Director Yoon want to see you?

292
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,430
I was on my way.

293
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,509
Follow me.

294
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,670
Why would Director Yoon want to see me?

295
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,990
You told me to do it.

296
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,550
I only did what you said.

297
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,550
- You think I'd do it? - So what if you say no?

298
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,230
Do you want me to tell him what you did to
me?

299
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,830
Do you think he'd let you get away with it?

300
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,150
Jung-eun, you're not me.

301
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,110
You have no ties or connections in this
company.

302
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,430
You'll look funny though.

303
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,830
Who would accept someone who got fired...

304
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,470
after assaulting her superior?

305
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,509
I told you. You made a mistake.

306
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,030
For your information, I got a doctor's note
yesterday.

307
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,790
Do you understand it now?

308
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,790
Only I'd let it slide.

309
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,310
So you shouldn't have acted up.

310
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,269
Why bother pretending to look after a
junior...

311
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,870
when you can't even take care of yourself?

312
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:49,230
You were using your child as an excuse...

313
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,110
to be a chair warmer.

314
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,110
I never used my child as an excuse to put
my work off.

315
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,470
And I never made anyone else...

316
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,350
take over my work like someone.

317
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,030
Is that so? But who cares?

318
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,910
So keep your mouth closed and do as I say.

319
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,310
What did you just say?

320
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,950
It's dirty and crappy, isn't it?

321
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,630
But what can you do? You need this job.

322
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,950
You need this to raise your child, don't you?

323
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,110
Your husband isn't doing well after he
transferred.

324
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,509
Do your best.

325
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,670
What are you doing? Director Yoon is
waiting.

326
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,749
Gosh.

327
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,110
Shoot.

328
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,390
- Bye.
- Bye.

329
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,070
Come in.

330
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,870
It's nice to see you together.

331
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,590
I heard you agreed to work on the TR
together.

332
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,870
Ms. Lee, I have high expectations.

333
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,630
Well...

334
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,790
Director Yoon, actually...

335
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,950
Oh, Director Yoon.

336
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,470
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can join...

337
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,910
Hanguk University alumni golf round
tomorrow.

338
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,590
Why not?

339
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,269
It's been a few days since my neck...

340
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:15,190
What about your neck? A neck pain?

341
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,509
I sprained it a bit.

342
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,390
And the doctor told me to rest.

343
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,910
Sorry, Ms. Lee.

344
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,390
I'll let you continue.

345
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,630
Yes. Right.

346
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,470
It's nothing.

347
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,310
The president is...

348
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,830
paying attention to this TR project.

349
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,190
So do your best.

350
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,350
Once this goes well,

351
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,110
you'll hear good news at the end of the year.

352
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,550
Yes.

353
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,390
Ms. Lee, you have many connections.

354
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,310
Use all your connections...

355
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,830
to find the CEO of TR.

356
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,870
I beg your pardon?

357
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,710
Director Yoon, that's a great idea.

358
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,790
Then I'll focus on the cooperation
presentation.

359
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,070
Look at you.

360
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,190
Your teamwork is perfect already.

361
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,190
This is a good chance for your career.

362
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,590
You must seize this chance.

363
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,150
You're right, Director Yoon.

364
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:14,950
I'm sure Ms. Lee will pull it off.

365
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,350
Right?

366
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,470
I look forward to working with you,

367
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:32,670
the legendary Senior Manager Lee.

368
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,430
But you don't have much time.

369
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,110
This is crazy.

Which sanctions the use of force,

372
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,509
or threat of force...

373
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,870
against the...

374
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,990
sover... - Stop.

376
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:28,150
What are you reading again?

377
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,070
It's a speech.

378
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,990
How can it be a speech if you stutter?

379
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,830
We need to talk.

380
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,830
It's me.

381
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,950
Find Min-ho a new speech tutor.

382
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,910
It doesn't matter how much it costs.

383
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,790
But...

384
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,830
make sure she's good this time.

385
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,910
Bye.

386
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,670
Ma'am.

387
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,910
Can you give me one more chance?

388
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,790
I'm in a tough situation to quit now...

389
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,550
One more chance?

390
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,749
Are you trying to ruin my son?

391
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,550
Find someone for your level.

392
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:21,910
It ends here.

393
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,990
You're dismissed.

394
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,950
I only hired you for a high price because...

395
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,790
you were becoming Myeongseong
Elementary teacher.

396
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,190
It was a waste of time.

397
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,470
Hello, Father.

398
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:06,030
I saw that you had a guest?

399
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,590
She was Min-ho's English speech tutor.

400
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,310
Don't mind her.

401
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,870
She's not coming here anymore.

402
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,350
Anyway, what brings you here?

403
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,590
Speaking of which,

404
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,350
by English speech,

405
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:23,670
you mean George VI's speech?

406
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,190
Yes, Father.

407
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,150
How did you know?

408
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:28,390
When I visited Min-ho's academy,

409
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,350
I saw him practicing.

410
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,509
I see.

411
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,630
You know...

412
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,070
English speech isn't just about memorizing.

413
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,749
But you also need to know the history,
situation,

414
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:43,509
and the speaker's habit...

415
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,910
and nature too.

416
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:48,430
No wonder you became...

417
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,710
the English literature professor.

418
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,590
And it's posh English.

419
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,470
Anyway,

420
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,710
you chose a very difficult text.

421
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,030
It won't be easy.

422
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,110
Right.

423
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,870
Someone like you...

424
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,470
should teach him.

425
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,550
Right.

426
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,270
Then...

427
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,830
do you want me to help him?

428
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,470
While driving him to the academy?

429
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,070
Really?

430
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,350
Of course.

431
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,910
He's my grandson after all.

432
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,110
That's the least I can do for him.

433
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,910
Yes, please.

434
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,310
I'd appreciate it.

435
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,790
Sure.

436
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,870
When is the contest again?

437
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,950
Well, there isn't much time left.

438
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,630
The contest is next week.

439
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,350
Do you have the time for it?

440
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,270
Of course.

441
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,950
I'll make the time for it.

442
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,510
I appreciate it.

443
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,550
I'll bring you some tea.

444
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,910
Grandpa.

445
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,350
Yes.

446
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,070
Then are we going...

447
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,910
to practice English together?

448
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,990
No.

449
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,910
You're doing great.

450
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,150
You don't need my help.

451
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,710
Really?

452
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,070
Really.

453
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,950
But...

454
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,190
if you relax a little bit,

455
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,310
you'll do even better.

456
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,190
Yes.

457
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,590
Grandpa, by the way.

458
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,710
Yes?

459
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,790
Are you going anywhere today?

460
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,470
Why do you ask?

461
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,950
Do I look better than usual?

462
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,710
Well...

463
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,670
Not so bad.

464
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,670
Who are you meeting?

465
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,950
No, I'm not meeting anyone.

466
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,190
Well, I'm just...

467
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,910
I think I know who it is.

468
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,830
You look great, Grandpa.

469
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,950
- Hello. - Hello.

470
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,350
Let's go.

471
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,390
Have a good day.

472
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,190
- Bye. - See you tomorrow.

473
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,550
Jinny.

474
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,590
Are you ill?

475
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,590
No.

476
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,790
I'm not ill at all.

477
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,630
Why?

478
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,670
That's not true.

479
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,550
You look strange today.

480
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,830
Normally,

481
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,870
you're like this,

482
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,230
but today,

483
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,390
you're doing this.

484
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,150
No, that's not it.

485
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,750
I was just thinking about something.

486
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,230
Well...

487
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,630
Not this either?

488
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,990
Oh, my dear Jinny.

489
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,870
You'll be okay.

490
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,230
Seo-yoon, what was that?

491
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,550
Who taught you?

492
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,630
Mom.

493
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,830
She said you did that to her.

494
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,870
She's right.

495
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,470
I used to do that.

496
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,470
- Seo-yoon. - Yes?

497
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,390
When Mom...

498
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,310
pats you like this,

499
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,230
does it make you feel better?

500
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,350
Of course.

501
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,910
Every time Mom pats me like this,

502
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,590
I can't ask for more.

503
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,590
Do you like that too? Yes?

504
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,790
Yes.

505
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,430
It cheers me up.

506
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,350
Thank you.

507
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,630
Really?

508
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,790
Then do you want to see what's next?

509
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,510
After patting, it's tapping.

510
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,070
Right?

511
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,470
Yes.

512
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,430
Patting...

513
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,710
and tapping.

514
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,510
Seo-yoon.

515
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,990
- Tae-rin. - Hello.

516
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,390
Hey, you're early.

517
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,790
So? Did you decide to keep attending?

518
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,390
I just might.

519
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,350
- I'm glad you decided so. - You're welcome.

520
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,390
Let's play with this.

521
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,190
Play quietly.

522
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,430
- Okay. - Okay.

523
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,030
Tae-rin was born abroad.

524
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,950
Her move to Korea last year was quite
sudden too.

525
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,190
- This is interesting. - She couldn'tspeak
Korean.

526
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,110
- She didn't have any friends either. - This
one.

527
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,910
It had been so tough on her.

528
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,670
She cried her eyes out all day.

529
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,350
That's why all of her nanniesquit.

530
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,710
- My gosh, poor thing. - Let's check this
color.

531
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,310
Her mom came to me with the crying child in
her arms.

532
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,070
She begged me to look after her in her tears.

533
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,830
I couldn't bear to watch my daughtersuffer.

534
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,110
So I ended up drivingher around...

535
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,110
which I never thoughtI would in my lifetime.

536
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,830
- That must've been a tough time. - Right.

537
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,710
With my help,

538
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,030
Tae-rin became a cheerful girl as you can
see.

539
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,590
And even her mother seemed happy.

540
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,230
That's my reward.

541
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,790
You see,

542
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,910
you love her to pieces.

543
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,150
But you'll keep questioning...

544
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,710
if you shouldkeep doing this or not...

545
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,470
a dozen times every day.

546
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,230
Taking care of a child is no easy task.

547
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,150
You'd better brace yourself.

548
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,350
You must know since you raised your
daughter.

549
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,030
Luckily,my daughterhad been independent...

550
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,590
ever since she was young.

551
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,230
Thanks to that, it wasn't much difficultfor
me.

552
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,190
No children can grow up on their own.

553
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,630
She probablydidn'tsay anythingto you.

554
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,590
I bet she couldn'tsay anything...

555
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,790
because she could see her
motherworkinghard.

556
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,190
So she just stayed quiet. Oh, no.

557
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,630
She must've looked afterherself.

558
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,990
My goodness,poor thing.

559
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,990
For parents,

560
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,950
the saddest thing is when your child grows
up too fast.

561
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,470
Mr. Kim.

562
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,670
Must I do this just to keep my job here?

563
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,590
What did Director Yoon say?

564
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,270
My goodness.I can't believehim.

565
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,630
He's only listeningto that sly snake, Ha Sa-
na.

566
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,990
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee. It's all my fault.

567
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,910
This is embarrassing.

568
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,670
Don't say I'm your role model.

569
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,270
Don't say that, Ms. Lee.

570
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,190
What's up with the mood? You know better.

571
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,230
Go and wrap up.

572
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,630
- What? - Let's grab a drink.

573
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,070
Yes. Let's go and grab a drink. Please?

574
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,630
"Please?"

575
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,710
I said we were grabbinga drink, so we will.

576
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,870
She has no say in this.

577
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,790
All right. Today, we're havinga team
bondingworkshop.

578
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,990
This is part of the work. You must attendit.

579
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,310
Where's our youngest?

580
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,430
The youngest?Gosh, her name is Kang Min-
hee.

581
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,310
- Hey. Let's go. - Let's go, Ms. Lee.

582
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,990
- Ms. Lee, let's go. - My gosh.

583
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,990
Girls, let's go inside.The class will
beginsoon.

584
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,110
- Okay. - Okay.

585
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,830
Jinny,you must wait here.

586
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,270
Of course. Go insidenow.

587
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,870
Go on.

588
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,110
- Bye. - Yes, we'll get going.

589
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,710
What?

590
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,110
I've never seen him before.

591
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,950
- Hello. - Hello.

592
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,030
I'm here to give Min-ho a ride again.

593
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,910
We've got another poor soul joiningus.

594
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,030
Pardon?

595
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,670
Nothing.I was mumblingto myself.

596
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,750
By the way, this chair isn't here to be
admired.

597
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,550
- I guess you can't see the chair. - Okay.

598
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,470
Excuseme then.

599
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,190
Where are you from? Who are you?

600
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,870
He's the grandfatherof Min-ho from Class A.

601
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,510
Min-ho? Who's Min-ho?

602
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,510
- Tommy. - Tommy?

603
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,350
Tommy from Class A?

604
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,430
Gosh, it would'vebeen a lot better...

605
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,710
if you told me sooner you were Tommy's
grandfather.

606
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,910
Am I not allowedto sit at this table?

607
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,870
No. It's not that.

608
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,510
You see, I'm the grandmotherof Tae-rin from
Class B.

609
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,190
My name is Jang Mi-chun.

610
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,869
- This is... - Mi-chun, we've met.

611
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,950
Did I make a mistake,perhaps?

612
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,030
No.

613
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,270
How old are you?

614
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,030
Pardon?

615
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,349
I turned 60 just this year.

616
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,470
Hold on a second.

617
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,630
I'm 65 years old. And he's 60.

618
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,710
You are...

619
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,630
Yes. I'm 59 years old.

620
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,030
My gosh. Perfect.

621
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,150
- You're single,right? - How did you know?

622
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,710
Are you in good health?

623
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,470
Yes, I am. I always exercise.

624
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,349
So I managed to stay away from the
hospital.

625
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,590
You too, right? Aren't you single?

626
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,270
Yes.

627
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,710
I'm single. Yes.

628
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,990
Yes. I'm singletoo.

629
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,670
By the way, how come you didn'tbring
anything?

630
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,110
And you only broughtone bag?

631
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,389
It appearsto me that you have
underestimated...

632
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,670
the world of drivingour grandchildren
around.

633
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:20,150
It's not like I can write out everythingfrom A
to Z.

634
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,430
Are we supposedto preparethings for them?

635
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,950
Do you think your ancestorsraiseyour
children?

636
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,070
Never mind. You know what? Forget it.

637
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,910
Insteadof talkingabout this...

638
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,510
All right. Take a look.

639
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,670
You must carry tissues, the most basicitem.

640
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,310
Wet wipes and dry tissue.

641
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,910
And if you can, when you wipe their mouths,

642
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,670
use a handkerchiefinstead of a tissue.

643
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,470
That will be better on their skin, right?

644
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,150
When they come here after kindergarten,

645
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,110
those little munchkinsmust spend a long
time here.

646
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,190
This isn't everything.

647
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,389
We must drive them home after class.

648
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,310
But the trafficis awful as you know.

649
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,310
So those little ones will get hungry,will they
not?

650
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,630
They're in a growthphasetoo.

651
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:04,190
- You're right. - Hold on a second.

652
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,830
Goingover just the basics...

653
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,470
will keep us up all night.

654
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,150
You know what?

655
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,910
Since we have to drive around our
grandchildren,

656
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,750
we shouldpick a day and have a workshop.

657
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,869
Well, I'm down for anything.

658
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,430
In that case, it will be this Sundayat 9 a.m.

659
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,750
We'll meet at the parking lot of the park...

660
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:24,869
across from the academy.Okay?

661
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,550
Okay.

662
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,510
Sure. I guess I'll look forwardto learningfrom
you.

663
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,310
Great!

664
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,389
Hang in there.

665
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,510
No matter how awfulit is, you must hang in
there.

666
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,470
That's work.

667
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,430
Don't even say you'll quit. For whose
benefit?

668
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,830
He's right.

669
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,910
You must keep working to show her...

670
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,110
she can't take you down.

671
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,389
I'll keep it short.

672
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,389
Hang in there for the sake of your daughter.

673
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,190
You said you wanted her to attend
Myeongseong.

674
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,950
Do you know how expensivethe tuitionis
these days?

675
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,869
What about her academy fees?

676
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,190
Do you think your husbandcan pay for all
that?

677
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,389
But...

678
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,950
But what?

679
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:09,869
Darn it.

680
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,430
How am I going to find this CEO?

681
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,349
I'll find the CEO.

682
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,510
I like the spirit,Youngest.

683
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,630
I'll helpyou too.

684
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,790
You mean it, right? No backsies.

685
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,990
You can count on me.

686
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,990
I also get pissedoff when someonecomes
after my team.

687
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,030
Mr. Kim.

688
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,670
We'll comb through every inch of this
industry.

689
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,869
Then we'll find the CEO.

690
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:36,470
On that note,

691
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,590
how about a drink?

692
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,510
No.

693
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,110
You can't toleratealcohol.

694
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,710
I can drink on a day like today.

695
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,950
- No. - I'll just clinkmy class with you.

696
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,990
- That's it, okay? - Yes.

697
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,150
- Cheers. - Cheers.

698
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,310
- Cheers. - Cheers.

699
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,230
Seo-yoon, you can trust Mommy.

700
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,110
And this...

701
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,790
The Toad Rock in Mount Buram.

702
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,270
Go back and get the biggest piece of taffy.

703
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:23,310
Put it on the rock and pray sincerely.

704
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,310
(Divine General)

705
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,070
Are you coming?

706
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,990
Why are you takingso long?

707
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,230
Come out already.

708
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,430
Jung-eun.

709
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,869
Ta-da!

710
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:42,710
(Luck)

711
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,230
Have you gone mad?

712
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:45,670
You'll wear that to the mountain?

713
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,190
Yes. What do you think?

714
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,869
Hey. Going there an the utter sense of
devotion...

715
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,030
might not even be enough.

716
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,990
- You drive me crazy. - My gosh.

717
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:53,990
What?

718
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,510
You said red increased the chance of her
gettingin.

719
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,510
Hey, what do you think? Check out my
bottom.

720
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,869
- There's one on my bottomtoo. - Get

721
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,270
What? Are you gettingexcited

722
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:03,550
to check out my bottom after a while?

723
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,470
- What do you think? - Have you gone mad?

724
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,950
- Check this out, Jung-eun. - You'll bring bad
luck.

725
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,670
Big fortune. Small fortune.

726
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,030
Big fortune.What do you think?

727
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,110
Hey. That's bad luck!

728
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,030
Are you all right?

729
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,710
Blood? Oh, no.

730
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,070
What?

731
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,630
No. Don't wipe it.

732
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,750
Jung-eun. Blood is red too. This is good.

733
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:29,070
Stop goingoverboard.

734
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,710
Jung-eun. Just trust me and followmy lead.

735
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,389
If I can send our daughterto Myeongseong
Elementary,

736
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,230
I can hike the mountainwith you on my back.

737
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,470
My gosh.

738
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,270
- Okay? I'm a strong man! - Goodness.

739
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,630
Seriously.

740
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,190
You are drivingme crazy indeed.

741
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,790
Jung-eun!

742
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,670
What? You can carry me on your back?

743
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,950
Call 911. Could you call an ambulancefor
me?

744
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,750
You've got to help me out. I reallymight die
here.

745
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:03,990
Please.

746
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,910
Should I kill you on this mountain...

747
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,349
and offer you as a sacrifice?

748
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,030
Jung-eun. Abandon me.

749
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,869
Go aheadwithoutme. It's okay.

750
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,550
I'll reallykill you.

751
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,790
Come on.

752
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,190
If I could, I would already have done that.

753
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,990
The generaltold me to bring you to the rock.

754
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,910
Come on, hurry up.

755
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,750
All right.

756
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,830
Come on.

757
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,389
My gosh.

758
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,590
Oh, my.

759
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:18,070
J-Jung-eun.

760
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,630
- My gosh. Seriously.- I'm dyinghere.

761
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,430
I can't do this. No.

762
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,630
- The ToadRock. - Oh, my.

763
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,590
- Goodness. - Oh, dear.

764
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,630
No, I shouldn'twaste time like this.

765
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,030
Honey, give me the bag.

766
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,790
There's taffy to help our daughterget in...

767
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,230
My gosh. Oh, my.

768
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,150
Hey.

769
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,310
Gosh, my blood sugar was crashing. I feel
alivenow.

770
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,030
- Jung-eun. Have some taffy. - You...

771
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,310
- You... - It's sweet.

772
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,950
Did you just eat that?

773
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,470
Have you gone mad?

774
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,869
You reallymust have lost your mind.

775
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,550
Why would you eat that?

776
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,310
That taffy was supposed to help her get in!

777
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,590
I was going to put it on the rock!

778
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,230
That's why I broughtit!

779
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:30,190
How will you fix this?

780
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,990
It's your fault if she doesn't get in!

781
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,430
Hey, if that was your plan,

782
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,790
you shouldhave told me about it.

783
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,470
Hold on a second.This is taffy, after all.

784
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,910
- No... - I can put some salivaon it and do
this.

785
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,070
No, my taffy!

786
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,710
You!

787
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,990
You...

788
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,990
You go back down.

789
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,270
Go back down and buy me a new one.

790
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:56,389
Hey! How do you expect me to go down and
come back?

791
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,150
I know that you're throwinga fit right now.

792
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,869
But be reasonableat least!

793
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,869
Then why did you eat this?

794
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,710
Why did you eat this taffy?

795
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,150
Are you crazy? You dummy.

796
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,550
Do you still call yourself a dad?

797
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,750
You... Unbelievable.

798
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,670
Come on!

799
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:13,830
Hey.

800
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,310
Don't follow me.

801
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,349
Hey, Jung-eun!

802
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,510
If I ever do anythingwith you again,

803
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,670
it means I've givenup on myself.

804
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,070
You idiot!

805
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,590
- Come on. - Jung-eun.

806
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,190
Unbelievable.Darn it.

807
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,270
Jung-eun.

808
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:28,070
Don't leave me alone here.

809
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,270
Hey, my legs are numb.

810
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:34,030
J-Jung-eun!

811
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,310
Wet wipes.

812
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,389
A handkerchief. Vitamins...

813
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,270
You're home early.

814
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,110
We're home.

815
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,070
Mom. Do you know what that fool did?

816
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,110
Don't call your husbandthat.

817
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,990
Mother.

818
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,310
- You know, Jung-eun... - Be quiet.

819
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,389
I'm goingto divorcehim. Don't stop me.

820
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,270
Get up and help me go over this.

821
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,670
I don't know what it is. But later.

822
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,470
I'm aboutto pass out now.

823
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,590
I tried to pack as much as I could.

824
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:14,150
But it's been so long. I can't seem to
remembera lot.

825
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,510
What's all this?

826
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,550
Are you goingon a picnic?

827
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,790
It's not for a picnic.

828
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,590
I'm packing things I'd need when I drive Seo-
yoon...

829
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:26,950
betweenkindergartenand her academy.

830
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,110
What did you just say?

831
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:38,910
You asked me to look after her...

832
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,150
until she started elementaryschool.

833
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,910
What? Do you not want me to?

834
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,190
- Nonsense.- Nonsense.

835
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,030
I know we're a family,

836
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,389
but you stillhave to pay me. You know that,
right?

837
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,110
Of course. We know that.

838
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,670
This is amazing. He was spot on.

839
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,830
The Divine General said...

840
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,110
someonehelpfulwould come our way.

841
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,630
I see.

842
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,710
This is so fascinating.

843
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:05,910
What General?

844
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:07,470
No one.

845
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,990
But...

846
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,310
what about the hospital?

847
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,349
You know,

848
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,910
both Seo-yoon and you need some help.

849
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,830
So I'll take a break for the time being.

850
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,830
Why?

851
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,230
Why are you askingme that?

852
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,389
I want to take a break too. Okay?

853
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:27,389
Are you...

854
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,230
- sick? - What?

855
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,070
W-What's wrong?

856
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,430
I'm not sick.

857
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,550
If I'm sick, I'll go to the hospital.

858
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:35,830
Why would I look afterSeo-yoon?

859
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,830
Well, when I told you I wanted to quit my
job...

860
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,310
to look after Seo-yoon,

861
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,510
you weren't so thrilled.

862
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,990
You suddenlywant to take a break?

863
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,910
So what?

864
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:48,710
You don't want me to do this?

865
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,510
Did somethinghappen?

866
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,630
Nothinghappened.

867
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,670
Nothing.

868
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,630
I'm takingSeo-yoon out for
somethingtomorrow.

869
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,349
Tomorrow?It's Sunday.

870
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,750
With whom? Where are you going?

871
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,389
I want to get some fresh air with Seo-yoon.

872
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,830
Must I report to you about everything even
at my age?

873
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:14,150
No. You don't have to do that.

874
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,190
Once you start drivingaround Seo-yoon,

875
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,750
you might be tired. So...

876
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:20,110
Fine.

877
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,230
- Do you need anything?- No.

878
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:23,790
Leave them here. I'm leavingnow.

879
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,150
- Why don't you sleep over? - You're
leaving?

880
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,750
Get home safely, Mother.

881
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,630
Bye. Call me.

882
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,310
This is amazing. No way.

883
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,070
How did this happen?

884
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,670
My gosh. We got a breather thanks to
Mother.

885
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:44,950
(Kanuda)

886
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,510
- You're aboutto fall asleep. - My gosh.

887
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,670
This is so comfortable.I almostfell asleep.

888
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,790
Is that so?

889
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,750
Seo-yoon. Isn't this nice?

890
00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:01,349
Yes. It's super nice.

891
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,550
My gosh.

892
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:06,830
By the way, what's this?

893
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:07,869
It looks interesting.

894
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,030
Right.

895
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,430
Ji-suk boughtthis for Sophie.

896
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,950
She said it was amazing.

897
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,550
So I decided to splurgeand buy it too.

898
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:16,590
Excuseme.

899
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,990
She's goingto buy this.

900
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,470
Three adult pillows...

901
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:21,710
and one kids' pillow. We'll take this one.

902
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,710
- Yes, ma'am. - Thank you.

903
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,670
Why are we buyingthree adult pillows?

904
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,630
Am I gettingtwo?

905
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,270
No. One of them is for my mom.

906
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,750
Right. She's workingso hard to help us.

907
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:33,470
She oughtto get a good night'ssleep.

908
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,470
You're the best daughter.

909
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:37,830
She's the best, isn'tshe?

910
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:39,869
Mi-chun.

911
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,190
- Hey. - Hello, Tae-rin.

912
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,270
Hello.

913
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:45,470
- Tae-rin. Hello. - Seo-yoon.

914
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:47,389
Hey. Let me go and buy snacks...

915
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:48,630
before they arrive.

916
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,630
- Okay. Sure thing. - Let's go.

917
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,869
My goodness.Seriously.

918
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:57,590
Where are you? Did you even leave?

919
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,270
Over there.

920
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,670
We're over here.

921
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,550
Here.

922
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,830
My goodness.This is just crazy.

923
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,070
What am I seeingright now?

924
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,030
