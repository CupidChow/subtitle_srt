Bob, can you try sitting up straight?

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,530
Face me, please.

17
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,140
Okay.

18
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,250
Keep your mouth closed.

19
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,450
Try a little smile.

20
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,780
Smile, just a bit.

21
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,620
Over there.

22
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,860
Yeah, that's right.

23
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,100
Just hold it with one hand.

24
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,780
I can't stand it.

Everyone who's been scammed

27
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,780
by Putai,

28
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,690
(Turn Over & Be the Boss)
our day is almost here.

29
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,690
As long as you show up,

30
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,690
sign this joint petition,

31
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,940
and give us your real info,

32
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,810
soon we'll be able to

33
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,730
apply for compensation payment.

34
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,450
Is this for real?

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,250
Yeah, totally.

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,090
For real.

37
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,570
Come on, relax.

38
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,410
Everyone, line up, please.

39
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,810
Let's go one by one.

40
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,810
Mr. Lu.

41
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,850
Camera.

42
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,340
Mr. Lu, you know cameras, right?

43
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,010
I know a bit.

44
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,900
Then you must know ACDK.

45
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,530
Before Putai Group tricked us

46
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,900
and took all our assets,

47
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,180
we were the biggest
film equipment rental company

48
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,460
in Gaya.

49
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,660
You know, when making movies,

50
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,500
they don't actually

51
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
just use one lens.

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,290
They use a complete set of lenses.

53
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,300
Hello.

54
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,750
There are a lot of people waiting.

55
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,220
How about we sign this first?

56
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,340
- Hold on.
- Why so slow?

57
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,160
Let me finish explaining.

58
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,530
- Sorry.
- Do you know

59
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,010
how massive our assets were back then?

60
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,290
It was truly impressive.

61
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,140
Let's sign first, then talk more.

62
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,810
After all I've said,

63
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,780
you know I'm someone

64
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,810
who knows this field well.

65
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,180
Maybe you could lend me a bit?

66
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,200
I...

67
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,170
I'm thinking about things

68
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,570
like Eye of Twilight, Nightborne,

69
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,130
Queen of Humanities.

70
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,970
After flipping it once,

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,530
any of these

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,010
can make

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,660
a huge profit.

74
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,180
If we can flip them,

75
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,460
we'll definitely make a fortune.

76
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,620
Is this for real?

77
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,780
Thank you.

78
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,620
The next one.

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,530
The pen.

80
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,370
Thanks.

81
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,400
Your information, please.

82
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,850
Please hand me your info, thanks.

83
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,730
Thank you.

84
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,570
Next one!

85
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,460
Mr. Lu,

86
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,970
I'm a reporter from Gaya Daily.

87
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,890
I think I can help you.

88
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,020
Thank you so much, you really can.

89
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,900
Thank you, really.

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,820
- What should I do later?
- Just watch me.

91
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,220
- Watch you, right? Okay.
- Yeah.

92
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,340
Well, I'm Lu Tianchi.

93
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,820
I was originally a lawyer.

94
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,930
Frankly, I only knew

95
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,260
about the mole people as a group before,

96
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,970
but I didn't understand deeply

97
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,530
what happened to them

98
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,490
to end up in such a situation.

99
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,970
Although the Putai Group

100
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,610
is a very famous,

101
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,260
even called a flagship corporation,

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,610
a key part

103
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,530
of how they got rich

104
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,020
is through fraud.

105
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,460
They used the long con method,

106
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,610
essentially tricking

107
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,660
all these people over.

108
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,140
In the end, they gave them loans

109
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,020
and set them on

110
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,260
a path of gambling.

111
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,290
I think this problem

112
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,970
is something we need to step in and fix.

113
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,060
=Episode 18=

114
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,700
Running late, right?

115
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,780
Go wash up and eat.

116
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,970
I'm not eating.

117
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,610
It's salted fish
and minced pork mushroom congee.

118
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,700
I don't like it.

119
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,460
Do I care if you...?

120
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,300
Sis.

121
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,330
Where did you go?

122
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,680
You left so early this morning.

123
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,820
I had something to do outside.

124
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,490
Come on, wash your hands and eat.

125
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,100
What are you making?

126
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,370
Fennel stuffing buns.

127
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,100
Look, I've asked around.

128
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,220
Although you lost that report
in the hospital,

129
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,580
you can go back to check again.

130
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,780
Which hospital did you go to?

131
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,200
I don't want to look into it anymore.

132
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,620
Please don't.

133
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,700
I asked around a lot.

134
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Finally, someone agreed
to help check for you.

135
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,610
Let's get this done today, okay?

136
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,490
No, I bet you never even checked.

137
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,660
I did go check.

138
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,530
The treatment fee is over 10,000 yuan.

139
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,140
Where am I supposed to get that money?

140
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,660
I'm not leaving. What's the point?

141
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,140
Wait for you to pay for me?

142
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,730
I'm not paying you.

143
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,770
Pay up.

144
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,730
I'll figure something out.

145
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,610
- No way.
- Maybe yes.

146
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,530
Well,

147
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,410
this morning,

148
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,260
I talked to

149
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,460
the doctor.

150
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,930
He said brain tumors

151
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,410
can be benign too.

152
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,820
You just need to do a craniotomy,

153
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,050
take the tumor out, and examine it.

154
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,610
Salty, I'm tired of this.

155
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,050
I'm scared...

156
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,340
What are you scared of?

157
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,460
Isn't it about gambling money?

158
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,610
What kind of hospital charges

159
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,650
over 10,000 for a check-up?

160
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,780
Caught you red-handed, huh?

161
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,820
Hold on.

162
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,220
Don't be scared right now.

163
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,100
The doctor said

164
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,350
he needs to see the examination report

165
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,850
to know what's going on.

166
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,900
Besides, the medical tech
keeps evolving.

167
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,890
Even with a brain tumor,

168
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,820
- it's not always...
- Sis,

169
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,220
check what's in her bag!

170
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,730
Is this something a brain tumor patient

171
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,930
should be focused on?

172
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,630
Only someone as gullible as you
would believe her.

173
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,780
Check the date.

174
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,610
I did, it's last year. So what?

175
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,970
Yeah, last year.

176
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,220
Back then, I still

177
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,410
owed a mountain of debt.

178
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,930
I thought

179
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,370
there was no way I'd make it.

180
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,140
I had a bit of cash left,

181
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,730
so I spent it all on lottery tickets.

182
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,220
I even wrote a will.

183
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,930
I had it all planned out.

184
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,490
Even if I didn't make it,

185
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,970
those lottery tickets

186
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,220
could at least leave you something.

187
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,930
You'd definitely be luckier
than me, right?

188
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,580
Stop making this up!

189
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,730
Just look at these tickets,

190
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,750
do they have our names on them?

191
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,730
Why do you say they're for us?

192
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
We finally found you.

193
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,970
I won't let you die.

194
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,460
To be honest,

195
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,420
my illness,

196
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,300
treated or not, is the same.

197
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,130
For my fellow patients,

198
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,540
most people with this disease

199
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,460
get it psychologically.

200
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,540
For so many years, I couldn't see you.

201
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,490
I really couldn't.

202
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,730
Frankly, this illness

203
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,940
is from missing you.

204
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,780
Jiang Fang,

205
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,180
you don't even blush when you lie?

206
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,010
Are you tricking my sis
because she's kind?

207
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,060
She's too naive.

208
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,130
Sis, don't fall for her tricks!

209
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,250
We just got out of poverty,
and she showed up.

210
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,490
This gambler comes back.

211
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,890
What's her real intention?

212
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,100
I've already said it.

213
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,370
I'm done with gambling!

214
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,610
Is this another ploy?

215
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,190
I've heard this a thousand times.

216
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,130
You said you'd quit gambling.

217
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,700
When the casino wanted to hurt you,

218
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,130
I heard it till my ears calloused.

219
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,370
That time is different from now!

220
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,220
How is it different?

221
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,100
Back then, she wasn't here!

222
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,060
Now she's here!

223
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,900
Enough!

224
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,340
If you're sick, get treated.

225
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,850
Stop arguing.

226
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,770
Fine, I'll get treated.

227
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,610
I'll reach out to that doctor

228
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,700
from before.

229
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,580
Can you even

230
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,540
tell me which hospital?

231
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,010
Or the doctor's name, do you know?

232
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,850
Li Zan!

233
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,940
Now I'm the villain, is that it?

234
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,010
You have money.

235
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,540
Go fill in this mess for her!

236
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,420
Jiang Fang,

237
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,820
tell me the truth.

238
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,100
Are you in debt again?

239
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,610
I'm not.

240
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,890
Don't listen to him.

241
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,970
He's stirring things up!

242
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,540
- You don't get it?
- I'm done.

243
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,940
You two talk it out, alright?

244
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,810
Li Zan!

245
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,690
What is it?

246
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,820
Eat before you leave.

247
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,730
I don't want to eat.

248
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,570
Come back!

249
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,060
Sit down.

250
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,940
Is it good?

251
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,090
Not really.

252
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,020
Hold on.

253
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,020
Vinegar.

254
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,300
The vinegar dish.

255
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,010
Add a little vinegar.

256
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,770
You're eating so messily.

257
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,370
Why aren't you eating, Sis?

258
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,650
Yeah, dig in. It'll get cold.

259
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,650
I got fired today.

260
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,250
When you hit rock bottom, eat first.

261
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,700
Is He Guangyuan a psycho?

262
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,890
It was just one phone call.

263
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,920
Is it necessary to fire someone

264
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,720
over such a small thing?

265
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,370
He's the type

266
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,970
to overthink everything.

267
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,820
If I can be distracted
for three minutes,

268
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,420
it could turn into three hours.

269
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
In his world,

270
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,220
three hours are enough to ruin

271
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,340
every great dish.

272
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,420
He's aiming for Three Diamonds.

273
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,020
I'm not worthy.

274
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,970
Going for Three Diamonds?

275
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,820
Salty, you really
shouldn't blame yourself.

276
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,970
That restaurant of theirs

277
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,370
wants Three Diamonds?

278
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,100
What a joke.

279
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,220
Their dishes prioritize form
over substance.

280
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,180
Basically,

281
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,180
there's no soul in them.

282
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:43,850
Is that right?

283
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,770
No heart in their food.

284
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,610
Wait,

285
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,850
do you even have money
to eat at Highland?

286
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,540
You ungrateful brat.

287
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,650
Six years ago, I took you and your dad

288
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,250
to Highland. Did you forget?

289
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,090
Li Zan,

290
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,300
shouldn't you be heading to school?

291
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,220
You're already late.

292
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,420
Now that she's here,
you're kicking me out, right?

293
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,850
That's not what I meant.

294
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,820
Don't start, okay?

295
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,140
I'm leaving.

296
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,100
Silly girl,

297
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,770
you won't get paid now.

298
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,010
Without money, how can I see a doctor?

299
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,420
Treating my illness

300
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,850
really costs a lot.

301
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,180
Plus, Highland pays well.

302
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,770
You can't lose that job.

303
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,060
What can I do now?

304
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,010
They've already fired me.

305
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,460
Honestly, I don't blame them at all.

306
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,850
It's been the same

307
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,490
for years.

308
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,570
Anyway,

309
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,460
with this level,
wanting to earn diamonds

310
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,970
is impossible.

311
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,750
It's not that I look down
on Western cuisine.

312
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,890
It's just that Western cuisine excels

313
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,130
at highlighting natural flavors.

314
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,090
But when it comes
to complex flavor profiles,

315
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,100
it really can't compare
to Chinese cuisine.

316
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,140
Salty,

317
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,180
come here.

318
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,260
Give me some money.

319
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,690
Jiang Fang,

320
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,780
what's up?

321
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,100
Buying some ingredients.

322
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,220
You'll need them later.

323
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,650
Let me go with you.

324
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,970
No need, I can go myself.

325
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,100
I'll be back soon.

326
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,610
Here, try this at home.

327
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,060
It's just a suggestion.

328
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,180
You can expand on it

329
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,460
and broaden your thinking.

330
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,250
Give me the money, I'll be back soon.

331
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,930
Did you get the video I sent you?

332
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,450
I've been with her all day.

333
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,850
This road leads to the casino.

334
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,170
Told you, Jiang Fang's return
isn't easy.

335
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,050
Here, she went up.

336
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,450
Does this look like a casino?

337
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,650
She's not here to gamble.

338
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,610
Back door.

339
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,820
A place like this

340
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,740
must have a back door.

341
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,580
You know that, right?

342
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,410
Fine, if she's not gambling,

343
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,580
can you please

344
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,890
stop arguing with her every day at home?

345
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,500
What if her tumor ruptures?

346
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,300
Sis, you can only say this to me.

347
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,740
It's embarrassing to tell others.

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,200
Enough, stop talking. Let's go.

349
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,850
What if

350
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,130
there's really a casino upstairs?

351
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,370
And she's really gambling?

352
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,530
If you want to stay, stay here.

353
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,690
What if it turns out to be true?

354
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,900
Nonsense!

355
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,370
I can't believe this.

356
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,020
Doctors these days

357
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,580
have no ethics left.

358
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,130
It's all about the money.

359
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,740
You get what I mean?

360
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,740
Excuse me, is Headache Clinic this way?

361
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,180
Yeah, inside.

362
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,100
The last doctor

363
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,340
asked for a lot of money.

364
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,130
Doctor, I have something...

365
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,940
Okay.

366
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,260
If you have no money,

367
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,130
you can't even see a doctor.

368
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,410
You got that?

369
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,890
Exactly.

370
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,820
How can you get treated with no money?

371
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,500
Yeah, I know, I really do.

372
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,610
And you are?

373
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,420
It hurts.

374
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,650
Yeah.

375
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm the same way.

376
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,210
In my head,

377
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,650
there's something growing.

378
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,820
I have no idea what to do.

379
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,020
Honestly, I'm really scared.

380
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,500
I don't want to bother my kids.

381
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,060
I try to put it off each day,

382
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,850
and somehow get through it.

383
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,740
About your headache,

384
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,610
when does it feel the worst?

385
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,820
Right now,

386
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,850
it hurts every time I lie down.

387
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,930
Lying down makes it worse.

388
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,020
When I feel sick and anxious, I panic.

389
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,100
I want to know,

390
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,300
for example,

391
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,930
after finding out about this thing

392
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,890
in my head,

393
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,210
what symptoms do you experience?

394
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,580
(Lam Kee Herbal Tea, Grocery)

395
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,420
Mr. Lu,

396
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,170
I recently interviewed

397
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,540
some relatives of gamblers.

398
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,740
These are some materials

399
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,610
I've compiled.

400
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,890
Hope this can help you out.

401
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,500
Thanks so much for your support.

402
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,320
Honestly, I think this...

403
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,650
Because I think

404
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,690
my individual strength

405
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,530
is insignificant.

406
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,540
But with your help,

407
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,170
your support really means a lot.

408
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,260
This might be the first case of Gaya

409
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,820
speaking up for the mole people

410
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,610
and protecting their lawful rights.

411
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,850
Your actions

412
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,100
truly move us deeply.

413
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,940
Thank you.

414
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,850
You really made a difference for them.

415
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,370
I'll first release some content

416
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,850
based on

417
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,910
what we discussed today.

418
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,780
Alright, sounds good.

419
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,020
Thank you so much.

420
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,860
No need.

421
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,730
Thanks.

422
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,580
Thank you, really.

423
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,490
Appreciate the effort.

424
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,100
No problem.

425
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,300
Let's treat this as a little study.

426
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,850
Let's go through each dish.

427
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,370
We start with the appetizer.

428
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,020
It's all about tempting the appetite.

429
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,800
It needs to spark some craving.

430
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,820
The current bread offering

431
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,170
is a natural yeast, multi-seed bread.

432
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,300
If you pair it
with sesame-peanut sauce...

433
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,370
Sesame-peanut sauce?

434
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,860
Fantastic.

435
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,290
Wait.

436
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,660
Jiang Fang,

437
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:04,970
thank you.

438
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,050
Liu Yan,

439
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,930
Mr. He asked me to give this to you.

440
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,820
He said you can call this number.

441
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,780
It's for Dr. Chen.

442
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,210
He speaks Chinese, English,
and Cantonese.

443
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,100
Any of those works for him.

444
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,260
That's great, thanks.

445
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,740
I'll thank Mr. He properly later.

446
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,540
He's pretty busy today.

447
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,930
Maybe you should head out first.

448
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,760
I won't take up much of his time.

449
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,610
I don't mind waiting.

450
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,850
If you need anything, tell me.

451
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,740
When Mr. He is busy,

452
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,880
I'm in charge of the kitchen.

453
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,820
Here's a new dish I made.

454
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,340
And the revisions to

455
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,360
some original menu items.

456
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,980
I want to show this to Mr. He.

457
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,300
Thanks, Kanta.

458
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,340
Just do your best.

459
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,540
There'll be lots of new ideas this time.

460
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,380
Sorry.

461
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,540
Mr. He said he's too busy.

462
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,180
No time to eat, but thanks.

463
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,530
Take it back then.

464
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,860
Thank you.

465
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,020
You're fired?

466
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,260
It has nothing to do with you.

467
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,340
Why did he fire you?

468
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,170
What? Pity me?

469
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,100
There's no need.

470
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,300
If it was because

471
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,740
I was rude at the police station,

472
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,980
I'll apologize to him then.

473
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,370
You're not that special.

474
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,410
There's a banquet at Highland.

475
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,760
Halfway through cooking,
I went out to take a doctor's call.

476
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,780
Just for that?

477
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,500
I actually understand him.

478
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,890
That's not the work ethic

479
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,020
expected for a diamond-rated place.

480
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,740
Why understand him? Is he crazy?

481
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,130
He's actually quite nice.

482
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,450
He even helped Jiang Fang find a doctor.

483
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,130
I found a doctor too.

484
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,410
But Mr. He found

485
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,300
the best neurologist in all of Gaya.

486
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,260
Still mad at me?

487
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,020
I can't be bothered with you.

488
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,820
And no time to be angry now.

489
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,020
Wait, what's this?

490
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,650
It's a new dish I made.

491
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,260
But He Guangyuan won't see me.

492
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,860
What's with him?

493
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
Stop following me.

494
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,980
Don't wait outside our house anymore.

495
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,500
Sorry, really sorry.

496
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,170
Mr. He, I couldn't stop him.

497
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,530
Sorry to barge in like this.

498
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,450
Mr. He,

499
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,820
I'm here about Liu Yan's dismissal.

500
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,690
You must taste

501
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,780
Liu Yan's cooking.

502
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,420
Once you taste it,
you'll change your mind.

503
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,690
Mr. Lu,

504
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,060
aren't you overstepping a bit?

505
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,260
No, I'm just nosy.

506
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,780
Honestly, I know little about food.

507
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,930
But I can read people well.

508
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,370
You must have a sharp palate.

509
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,890
That's why you can appreciate

510
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,260
the quality of this.

511
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,170
Why not give it a try?

512
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,060
I respect Liu Yan deeply.

513
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,060
And I value her hard work too.

514
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,200
But I have my own principles
in how I do things.

515
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,210
Hope you can understand.

516
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,380
Yeah, of course.

517
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,210
Principles do matter.

518
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,980
Right, I always stick to mine too.

519
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,820
But...

520
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,690
our principles shouldn't be

521
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,450
rigidly fixed on inflexible things.

522
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,020
Otherwise, what's the point?

523
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,850
If we're talking

524
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,300
about food,

525
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,260
we're surely not discussing principles.

526
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,020
It's about taste,

527
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,860
right?

528
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,340
I think what Liu Yan makes

529
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,850
has that down-to-earth flavor.

530
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,260
You feel the vitality

531
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,540
and so much possibility.

532
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,820
You see what I mean?

533
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,100
No offense.

534
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,060
I feel why

535
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,450
Highland's accolades have stalled here

536
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,980
is because perhaps it's not evolving.

537
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,820
Maybe if you were willing

538
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,740
to try more possibilities,

539
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,850
it would be better.

540
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,500
Just give it a shot.

541
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,980
You can smell the aroma.

542
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,820
Right?

543
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,340
Alright.

544
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:51,770
Please have a seat.

545
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,260
If you'd like, please enjoy it slowly.

546
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,980
No, Mr. He, this...

547
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,260
Please enjoy.

548
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,900
Mr. He!

549
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,170
That's a wrap for today's shoot.

550
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,210
This is

551
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,370
tonight's livestream rundown.

552
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,550
Also, the director team asked me

553
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,740
to talk with you

554
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,060
about this session's theme.

555
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,100
They need some new dishes

556
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,410
that we haven't shown before.

557
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,260
If we only use
Highland's old, tested menu,

558
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,130
they're worried

559
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,650
that the audience might get bored.

560
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,210
I'm not changing the menu.

561
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,310
Go talk to them again.

562
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,740
Actually, I already spoke with them,

563
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,100
including the livestream process.

564
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
Everything was confirmed.

565
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,300
But they changed things last minute.

566
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,540
They said it was based

567
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,980
on audience data analysis.

568
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,260
Then tell them

569
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,370
that I can't accept sudden changes.

570
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,580
But

571
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,800
the other restaurant competing with us

572
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,850
also got notified today.

573
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,690
There are two restaurants.

574
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,610
One's willing, one's not.

575
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,640
If this gets out,

576
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,060
it might not look good for Highland.

577
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,260
Just because they're willing

578
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,820
to cooperate means we have to?

579
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,980
But if we back out,

580
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,500
the opposing restaurant will love it.

581
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,850
Whatever.

582
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,890
But it's Ching To.

583
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,660
Ching To?

584
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,770
Yeah.

585
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,020
Wait, hang on a second.

586
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,540
Here's Liu Yan's new menu.

587
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,100
I've already looked it over.

588
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,170
You take a look too.

589
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,690
Who saw the dish left on my desk?

590
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,050
Kanta,

591
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,100
prepare the ingredients
based on this dish.

592
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,300
Tonight, Liu Yan and I will livestream.

593
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,100
We'll make this one.

594
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,130
Mr. He, she's already fired.

595
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,130
I've worked with Mrs. He for years,

596
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,100
so why let a young girl

597
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,040
suddenly boss me around?

598
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,500
For ten years, Highland's sauce

599
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,740
was made by me,

600
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,740
spoon by spoon.

601
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,780
Is there something about me

602
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,040
that you're not happy with?

603
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,740
Her dishes haven't been tested.

604
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,570
There's no depth to them.

605
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,260
She cooks just as recklessly.

606
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,300
Let me go with you

607
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,340
to the TV station and film.

608
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,140
That would be the safest bet.

609
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,340
But safety won't win us diamonds.

610
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,420
Get the ingredients ready.

611
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,620
And bring Liu Yan back.

612
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,600
Okay.

613
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,460
This is the Highland chef.

614
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,590
Please be quick, okay?

615
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,540
Mr. He,

616
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,340
thanks for referring the doctor to me.

617
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,140
And also,

618
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,700
thanks for letting me come back.

619
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,420
Thank you.

620
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,140
No need to thank me.

621
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,010
If you want to thank someone,
thank Mr. Lu.

622
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,420
Congratulations.

623
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,040
Our place is a bit basic.

624
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,600
- Please don't mind it.
- Here are the records

625
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,180
you asked for. Not sure if they'll help.

626
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,100
Thank you so much.

627
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,740
And these are my documents.

628
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,420
Hello, and welcome to the 5th

629
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,540
Annual Gaya
Culinary Competition.

630
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,660
Today, we have a treat for you.

631
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,980
We brought chefs from across the world

632
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,500
to take part in the unique challenges.

633
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,260
Our first chef today is

634
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,820
Fabio!

635
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,020
Fabio's restaurant is a diamond

636
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,220
certified
from the Black Pearl Restaurant Guide.

637
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,240
But he's not the only one

638
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,500
with diamond certified.

639
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,820
Welcome our next chef,

640
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,980
He Guangyuan!

641
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,420
Chef He Guangyuan.

642
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,900
His restaurant is top of the class.

643
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,020
These two

644
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,940
have both worked together countless times,

645
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,070
producing amazing dishes.

646
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,640
But our challenge for them today

647
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,980
is one thing.

648
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,700
They're allowed one assistant.

649
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,550
So Fabio, he has chosen

650
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,750
Philip from New York City!

651
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,880
As a pair, our dynamic jewel set to
cook up a storm in the kitchen.

652
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,900
But as a match,

653
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,650
for Liu Yan from Beijing, China!

654
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,140
Now Liu Yan is partially unknown,

655
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,220
but could she be a secret weapon

656
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,300
for our theme tonight?

657
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,760
Breakthrough!

658
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,700
It should be starting soon.

659
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,650
Can you grab that for me?

660
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,700
Sorry, there's no TV here.

661
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,620
All set.

662
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,270
Well, you're about to

663
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,500
see they have never been
made before

664
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,740
except these days.

665
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,460
First of all, Fabio
is going to be making a

666
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,140
foie gras beef Wellington.

667
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,300
Something like he's been perfecting

668
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,760
for five years

669
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,620
with his travels

670
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,460
across the country.

671
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,970
Our next dish

672
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,420
from He Guangyuan.

673
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,740
He's going to be making
a beef short ribs with foie gras.

674
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,620
Take a look at this dish.

675
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,580
This was my daughter's idea.

676
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,190
- Really?
- Yeah.

677
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,260
That's impressive.

678
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
Her ideas are amazing.

679
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,420
She's really creative, so impressive.

680
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,620
Of course, she got it from me.

681
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,980
I just gave her

682
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,300
a little guidance.

683
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,220
I think the winner will be Wellington.

684
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,420
Mr. He,

685
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,060
someone messed with the foie gras.

686
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,060
The top layer got burnt.

687
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,020
If we scrape off the top,

688
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,540
dice and pan-fry it, is that okay?

689
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,380
Coat it with flour, then fry it.

690
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,700
Alright.

691
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,820
He Guangyuan, please.

692
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,220
I met Fabio

693
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,300
when I was 14.

694
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,420
I watched He Guangyuan

695
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,940
grow up.

696
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,620
Back then at Highland,

697
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,220
my mom was the head chef.

698
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,100
He was the sous chef.

699
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,500
His mom was really strict with him,

700
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,420
and every time she scolded him...

701
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,260
Liu Yan,

702
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,140
are you the one who made

703
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,660
the dessert that wasn't too sweet?

704
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,860
You really stood out to me.

705
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,540
You remind me

706
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,300
of He when he first joined the kitchen.

707
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,180
Chef Philip, please.

708
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,980
All the chefs at Highland

709
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,140
thought I was pretty strict,

710
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,140
but I was just following

711
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,200
the traditions of Highland.

712
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,700
But Highland has abandoned
those traditions.

713
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,260
In the past, every staff member

714
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,220
in Highland's kitchen

715
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,660
was handpicked.

716
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,300
But this Chef Liu Yan

717
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,260
was just a dishwasher last month.

718
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,590
Now, all of a sudden,

719
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,780
she's become a chef at Highland.

720
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,580
That promotion was really fast.

721
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,420
Honestly,

722
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,980
I don't think
it's just her cooking skills

723
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,260
that got her here.

724
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,740
Chef Liu Yan at Highland

725
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,820
has contributed many new dishes,

726
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,780
in just one month.

727
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,900
The reports on salted pudding

728
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,940
have proven her ability.

729
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,460
And Mr. Philip's

730
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,860
leaving Highland

731
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,620
actually further confirms

732
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,860
Highland Restaurant's

733
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,580
consistent principle of strict demands

734
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,460
on chefs.

735
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,780
There's one more thing I want to share.

736
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,460
Mr. Philip

737
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,180
left Highland Restaurant

738
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,930
not just because of his cooking skills.

739
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,660
Thank you.

740
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,260
Chef Liu Yan,

741
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,220
come on stage please?

742
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,350
Chef Fabio holds the record

743
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,860
for the most diamonds won worldwide.

744
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,900
To all of us,

745
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,580
he's a legendary figure.

746
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,300
That he likes my salted pudding

747
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,980
is beyond my wildest dreams.

748
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,900
Philip...

749
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,420
Philip is such a jerk.

750
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,840
He's not just a jerk...

751
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,910
He's not just a jerk.

752
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,610
He's a traitor too. A total traitor.

753
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,100
I asked if you wanted

754
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,260
to become indispensable.

755
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Of course, I do.

756
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,300
You're too easily distracted.

757
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,620
You'll never become

758
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,180
an excellent chef.

759
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Philip used to be

760
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,340
a colleague of mine.

761
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,220
I started out as a chef midway.

762
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,110
So I don't really want

763
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,180
to judge other chefs.

764
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,380
Thanks.

765
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,580
He's just trying to provoke you.

766
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,740
You did really well this time.

767
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,820
Ching To's foie gras beef Wellington

768
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,860
combines the traditional flavors
of Wellington

769
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,780
with the unexpected taste sensation

770
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,580
from adding foie gras

771
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,420
as filling.

772
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,780
As for Highland's
braised beef ribs with foie gras,

773
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,060
the lobster sauce tastes creative.

774
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,500
That fermented flavor

775
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,020
gives it a local twist.

776
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,900
It's time for us
to take a quick break.

777
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,180
When we come back,
we're going to hear from our judges.

778
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,140
Wait, we need a break now?

779
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,900
Yan,

780
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,620
you did well just now.

781
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,100
Okay.

782
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,060
Ten.

783
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,660
Nine.

784
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,940
Eight.

785
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,980
Liar!

786
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,980
Liar!

787
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,060
Sis, did you see the news?

788
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,300
Uncle Lu's in trouble.

789
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,700
Lu Tianchi!

790
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,530
Liar!

791
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,380
Two.

792
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,800
And one.

793
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,430
I'm sorry, Mr. He.

794
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,900
I really am sorry.

795
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,940
Early this morning,

796
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,180
Gaya revealed a collective scam

797
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,060
by gamblers.

798
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,500
Lu Tianchi,

799
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,980
posing as a professional lawyer,

800
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,060
defrauded a large group of people

801
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,140
who were bankrupted by gambling

802
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,380
to profit from them.

803
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,700
The case is now

804
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,060
under further investigation.

805
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,940
Lu Tianchi, liar!

806
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,940
Lu Tianchi, liar!

807
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,660
Lu Tianchi, liar!

808
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,780
Who did you offend?

809
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,420
