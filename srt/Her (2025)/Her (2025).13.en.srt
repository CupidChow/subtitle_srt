16
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,650
You know what, Salty.

17
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,290
Don't worry.

18
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,760
I'll take another walk around later.

19
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,660
A few of my coworkers

20
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,680
are helping me look too.

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,250
We went in such a big circle.

22
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,680
Why did we forget about this place?

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
Where?

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,220
Our yard, here.

25
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,280
Our yard? Here?

26
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,110
Feels like home field advantage.

27
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,850
Ms. Du will think

28
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,420
we're joking with her. We can't do that.

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,800
Come on. Listen, I have an idea.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,980
We have a trellis here.

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,360
If we hang some loofahs

32
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,640
and set a table underneath...

33
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,170
It'll feel amazing.

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,790
Absolutely not. I'm telling you.

35
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,330
She frequents fancy restaurants.

36
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,580
It'll be her first time here.

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,660
Of course, she can't eat

38
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,660
right here.

39
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,330
- It'll work.
- No, it won't.

40
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,620
- It'll work.
- No, it won't.

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,420
No way. Definitely not.

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,990
Actually, this might work.

43
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,300
Wang Yang, be careful.

44
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,620
That's too long.

45
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,110
I'll cut it short.

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,540
Make it shorter.

47
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,480
Cut it. It's too long.

48
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,020
Here. Is this okay?

49
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,940
Yeah.

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,050
Why is this wire so loose?

51
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,920
Honey.

52
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,980
Honey.

53
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,330
You want to use that money?

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,740
It counts

55
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,970
as our investment.

56
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,460
No, it's not for investing.

57
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,480
That's Mrs. Wang's money
for your wedding.

58
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,760
Come on.

59
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,000
Making money is also

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,180
for building a better future.

61
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,040
Do you not want to marry me?

62
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm just helping her out.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,080
She's my childhood friend.

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,220
Don't overthink it, okay?

65
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,930
Is it because she's back

66
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,220
that I have to leave?

67
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,590
I've told you many times.

68
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,760
She's just a childhood friend.

69
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,300
Why do you keep thinking like that?

70
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,540
It's not that I'm overthinking.

71
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,750
But the moment she came back,

72
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,750
you changed.

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,900
Can we not fight here?

74
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,970
Why not?

75
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,940
This is your place;
why can't we talk here?

76
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,990
I need to clean up this trash.

77
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,620
You don't have anything
to say to me, huh?

78
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,210
Fine, let's break up.

79
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,020
We're not even officially together...

80
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,690
What do you mean?

81
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,290
- Why interfere with my money?
- What?

82
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,620
- What do you mean?
- Wang Yang.

83
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,380
Don't front the money.

84
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,610
Once Ms. Du gets here

85
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,460
and tastes the food,

86
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,620
I'm confident she'll invest.

87
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,590
Did you hear that?

88
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,640
You're showing off again.

89
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,090
You can be my manager.

90
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,080
My management partner.

91
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,140
If she doesn't come,

92
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,640
then forget it.

93
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,050
It'll mean opening a restaurant now

94
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,930
isn't the right time.

95
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,800
It'll mean opening a restaurant

96
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,100
is just an unrealistic dream.

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,900
Salty, I'm telling you.

98
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,740
Don't worry about the money.

99
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,460
Just focus on your kitchen.

100
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,320
That's enough.

101
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,800
Let's talk outside, okay?

102
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,860
Okay? Come on.

103
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,940
No.

104
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,750
- Wang Yang.
- Why do we have to talk here?

105
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,280
In all my life, I've never had a chance

106
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,020
to treat friends
to a good meal and drinks.

107
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,910
Can't you just let me

108
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,260
try once on my own?

109
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,450
You heard her.

110
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,340
She wants to try for herself.

111
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,500
I'm going out for a bit.

112
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,760
- Wang Yang!
- Wang Yang!

113
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,570
Wang Yang!

114
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,260
Can you have a little faith
in my cooking?

115
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,370
Have some faith in her,

116
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,210
alright?

117
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,350
Salty, I really support you.

118
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,130
Wang Yang.

119
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,130
Hello?

120
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,300
Shuangshuang, what are you doing?

121
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,090
Surfing.

122
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,730
Surfing?

123
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,380
Aren't you at home?

124
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,220
I recently met someone

125
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,350
in the surfing business.

126
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,020
Trying to find common interests.

127
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,220
How's Li Zan doing?

128
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,180
That brat hasn't replied to me.

129
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,050
Li Zan's doing well.

130
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,540
He goes to school on time every day.

131
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,020
He's a top student.

132
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,620
His grades are amazing.

133
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,620
What are you doing now?

134
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,530
Buying groceries.

135
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,860
I'm cooking for the investor.

136
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,900
Liu Yan, don't forget

137
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,220
that if you open that restaurant,

138
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,670
I get a share as a technical partner.

139
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,410
Shuangshuang,

140
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,470
what do you think would be

141
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,700
a good name for the restaurant?

142
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,490
Let me think.

143
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,260
Why not ask

144
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,890
Lu Tianchi?

145
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,940
He's good with ideas.

146
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,030
Forget it.

147
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,590
No need to bother him.

148
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,740
I...

149
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,060
I'll think it over myself.

150
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,960
Stop.

151
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,030
I just cleaned. Don't step there.

152
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,340
Don't you have anything else to do?

153
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,040
Aren't you bored?

154
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,770
I've lived on my own before.

155
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,080
I can take care of myself.

156
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,850
Stop hanging around here every day.

157
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,620
I'm taking care of you.

158
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,820
You think you're my brother-in-law?

159
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,660
Do you think

160
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,140
that if you watch me every day here,

161
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,800
my sis will come back
and be with you?

162
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,820
That's not gonna happen.

163
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,140
She's opening a restaurant in Beijing.

164
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,350
She'll pick me up in a few days.

165
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,000
She's not coming back.

166
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,520
She said so herself.

167
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,340
(Salty Resto)

168
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,110
The table seems a bit off-level.

169
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,140
Straighten it out.

170
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,420
Spoon on the left,
chopsticks on the right.

171
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,460
Three, two, one.

172
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,180
Salty, I'm here.

173
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,030
Smells amazing.

174
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,960
What is this?

175
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,580
What's wrong?

176
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,970
It deflated.

177
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,070
- Deflated?
- Cover it up.

178
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,450
You told me not to make a mess.

179
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,330
Look at yourself.

180
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,670
It's too late to redo it.

181
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,630
Then maybe

182
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,830
we just don't serve this dish?

183
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,520
It'll be one dish missing.

184
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,090
No way.

185
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,220
It's okay. I'll fix it up.

186
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,510
It's fine, it's fine.

187
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,600
- Sorry.
- Come out.

188
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,650
It's alright. Let me think.

189
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,970
- Can you fix it?
- Yeah.

190
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,660
Chef, can you come here?

191
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,520
Liu, hurry up.

192
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,180
Ms. Du.

193
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,930
It doesn't look right.

194
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,000
Say something.

195
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,810
Ms. Du, I'm sorry.

196
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,260
The original menu had them steamed.

197
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,020
But I couldn't help

198
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,760
but take a peek, and they deflated.

199
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,680
So, to avoid

200
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,400
delaying the dish,

201
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,980
Liu Yan switched to pan-frying instead.

202
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,600
We truly apologize, Ms. Du.

203
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,340
That means you weren't prepared.

204
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,890
There was no backup plan.

205
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,700
That's a major management flaw.

206
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,540
Yes, that's a big flaw.

207
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,020
Sorry about that.

208
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,530
Ms. Du,

209
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
the kitchen shouldn't waste ingredients.

210
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,520
I want to make full use of everything.

211
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,540
Not wasting food is my backup plan.

212
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,200
No matter how the dish turns out,

213
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,920
Liu Yan can always make it work.

214
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,960
It's her gift.

215
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,760
Today's meal

216
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,460
looks like Chinese cuisine,

217
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,740
but from the sauces

218
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,340
in two of the dishes,

219
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,820
I taste hints of Highland's texture.

220
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,720
How did you manage that?

221
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,330
The fusion I understand

222
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,070
isn't about mixing Chinese
and Western cuisines.

223
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,820
It's about blending memories.

224
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,850
Today's dishes

225
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,980
have combined my memories of Jaya

226
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,470
and Beijing.

227
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,320
Amazing.

228
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,790
Don't feed me.

229
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,690
Ms. Du,

230
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,460
this is especially for you.

231
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,120
Ms. Du,

232
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,700
I'm still just a junior cook.

233
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,510
A lot of what I do starts

234
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,890
as a copycat.

235
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,040
Since that day,
I've been working on the recipe.

236
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,060
I added a few ideas of my own.

237
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,370
Please consider this

238
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,180
a little gesture from all of us

239
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,470
to thank you both for coming today.

240
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

241
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,900
Enjoy your meal.

242
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,180
She really turned my idea

243
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,250
into a Beijing sweet dough.

244
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,620
It's very funny.

245
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,820
Not a bad idea, I think.

246
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,340
Your bag.

247
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,340
We won't walk you out, then.

248
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,600
Take care.

249
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,380
OK.

250
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,130
Did she find it tasty

251
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,370
or not?

252
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,020
Of course, it was good.

253
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,320
She kept saying it was good.

254
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,280
She kept saying okay.

255
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,300
How much did they say just now?

256
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,900
(Salty Resto)
Did I hear that right?

257
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,980
I'm telling you.

258
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,830
It is

259
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,500
this number.

260
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,740
How much is it?

261
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,530
There are many zeros after it.

262
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,470
Yes!

263
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,700
Okay, okay.

264
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,980
We don't need to invest, honey.

265
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,960
We don't need to invest.

266
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,170
It'll work.

267
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,370
I'll bring Li Zan here

268
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:55,930
this month.

269
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,780
No problem.

270
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,420
Feels just like the night

271
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,940
before I won a championship as a kid.

272
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,180
I have a feeling

273
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,980
I'm going to win.

274
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,150
I'm going to win.

275
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,260
We're going to win!

276
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,890
- It's good!
- Good!

277
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,830
- It's good!
- Good!

278
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,980
Good!

(Lam Kee Herbal Tea, Grocery)

280
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,260
What are you doing?

281
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,000
You broke your rule.

282
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,780
Is it because you're heartbroken?

283
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,400
What are you doing here?

284
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,720
I'm having dinner nearby

285
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,180
with Pierre.

286
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,280
Just passing by to see
if you're still alive.

287
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,260
Don't beat around the bush.

288
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm still thinking

289
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,610
about whether I should tell you.

290
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,500
Liu Yan...

291
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,230
She's opening a restaurant in Beijing.

292
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,170
I was just

293
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,370
casually encouraging her.

294
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,010
I didn't think it would happen.

295
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,210
But some boss

296
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,120
ate her food,

297
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,740
thought it was amazing,

298
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,100
and decided

299
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,140
to invest.

300
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,540
Isn't that great?

301
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,140
I know you're upset.

302
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,380
Why are you so bad
at expressing yourself?

303
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,460
You're such a closed book.

304
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,460
Are you here to comfort me?

305
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,500
Yes.

306
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,780
I didn't even need

307
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,980
to tell you this.

308
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,410
It's out of long-standing concern

309
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,750
for you.

310
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,270
Stop pretending

311
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,530
that you don't mind.

312
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,820
Think of something.

313
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,440
I just...

314
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,560
I just don't want
to drag her down anymore.

315
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,650
Drag her down?

316
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,800
Did you pick up that word from Liu Yan?

317
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,820
If you don't drag her down,

318
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,750
you're going to lose her for good.

319
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,920
Can I lose you first?

320
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,340
You can't ditch me that easily.

321
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,130
When are you ever going

322
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,340
to stand up to her like this?

323
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,260
Think of something.

324
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,500
Off to my candlelight dinner. Bye.

325
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,620
Don't drink too much.

326
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,290
Which outfit should I wear
for the signing tomorrow?

327
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,580
How about this one?

328
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,540
Red rose.
It'll attract attention, right?

329
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,980
Pretty nice, right?

330
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,160
I don't know about that stuff.

331
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,730
But that ABC secretary

332
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,700
probably likes it.

333
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,280
That's not ABC.

334
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,660

Little yellow flowers.

339
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,330
Take a look.

341

Look at you.

342
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,890
Either yellow flowers or red ones.

343
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,990
You're such a flower head.

344
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,570
Just pick one. Which one?

They're both fine.

346
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,780
Red or yellow?

347
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,700
Just wear it.

348
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,720
I'll wear it to show you.

What are you doing?

Moving your muscles a bit.

358
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,180
Otherwise, your thighs

359
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,140
will seriously weaken.

Why are you drinking again?

361
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,600
Stop drinking.

362
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,220
Then stop fighting.

363
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,680

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,180
About 17 or 18 years old.

380
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,740
Tall and skinny.

381
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,790
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

382
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,400
Li Zan!

383
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,400
Li Zan!

384
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,080
Li Zan!

385
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,030
Li Zan!

386
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,100
Li Zan!

387
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,390
Miss Liu,

388
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,550
you've changed my dessert

389
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,180
in a very creative way.

390
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,450
Thank you for liking it.

391
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,120
Jenny has a great eye for talent.

392
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,140
Your sincerity will surely make it work.

393
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,260
Congratulations
on having your own restaurant.

394
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,460
The Salty Resto will surely

395
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,980
showcase your cooking skills.

396
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,680
The contract contains

397
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,620
the full business plan.

398
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,780
Once the contract is signed,

399
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,140
the preparation for the restaurant
will officially begin.

400
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,860
If there are no issues,

401
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,100
please sign here.

402
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,000
(Cooperation Agreement; Lu Tianchi)

403
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,350
Sign it. What are you waiting for?

404
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,380
(Lu Tianchi)
Come to Jaya. Li Zan is in trouble.

405
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,720
- What happened?
- Sorry, I need to take this.

406
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,470
She has an urgent matter.

407
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,520
It's just a phone call.

408
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,960
One call, and she'll be back.

409
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,130
Liu Yan, hurry up.

410
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,850
Come here.

411
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,310
What's wrong? What's wrong?

412
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,820
Okay, you can sign now.

413
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,790
I have to go back.

414
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,310
Where?

415
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,360
- He's unconscious.
- Who?

416
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,930
He may need an amputation.

417
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,340
Who?

418
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,280
My brother.

419
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,060
That serious?

420
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,680
Just sign the contract first.

421
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,770
I'll go with you.

422
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,260
Don't mess around.

423
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,880
Let's handle this first.

424
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,830
I'll go with you.

425
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,760
What are you doing?

426
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,060
Sorry, Ms. Du.

427
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,070
I have to go back.

428
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,240
I don't know if I can get back in time.

429
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,520
Sorry.

430
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,140
Come on.

431
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,580
It's not good every time you go there.

432
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,650
You haven't found your mother,

433
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,940
and now you have a brother there.

434
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,340
Finish that and come back soon.

435
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,540
I can still talk

436
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,940
to Ms. Du about the restaurant.

437
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,900
I'll go in then.

438
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,810
No, no, no.

439
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,290
Wait. What's the rush?

440
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,540
Why go in?

441
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,190
You can't go to the VIP lounge anyway.

442
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,140
That won't work.

443
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,520
Are you avoiding me?

444
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,020
There are two hours left.

445
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,660
I'm not avoiding you.

446
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,680
- I just want to get back.
- You are avoiding me.

447
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,400
Don't be so anxious.

448
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,520
You can't have the plane fly anyway.

449
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,870
I'm used to it.

450
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,080
Used to what?

451
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,740
You come and go

452
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,850
as you please.

453
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,930
You know what?

454
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,920
Ever since Jiang Fang

455
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,980
left you,

456
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,310
I feel like I'm the one

457
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,930
who should be by your side the most.

458
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,630
Whatever troubles

459
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,860
and hardships you have,

460
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,260
I should be there with you.

461
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,300
I once heard a saying

462
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,780
that made sense to me.

463
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,910
What is it?

464
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,020
Don't hold unrealistic expectations

465
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,580
for anyone.

466
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,170
For you,

467
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,840
I'm the one you need to be careful with.

468
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,700
Still, sorry.

469
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,700
Sorry.

470
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,210
Why are you apologizing?

471
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,530
The one who apologizes is the boss.

472
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,150
The one being apologized to feels upset.

473
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,000
Do you know that?

474
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,140
The critical period has passed.

475
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,580
The doctor is changing the dressings.

476
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,020
(Doctor's Office)

477
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,660
What exactly happened?

478
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,340
He went to collect a debt with someone.

479
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,420
That guy is a deadbeat.

480
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,070
He couldn't pay,
so he threatened them with death.

481
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,540
It shouldn't have been a big deal.

482
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,890
But somehow a fight broke out.

483
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,010
In the chaos,

484
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,540
they both fell off the dock.

485
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,820
Now the deadbeat's brother

486
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
has come.

487
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,240
He said

488
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,060
Li Zan was too aggressive
in debt collection,

489
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,600
so his brother jumped into the sea.

490
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,900
He is seriously injured and unconscious.

491
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,010
He wants compensation.

492
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,940
If he doesn't get it,

493
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,510
he'll cause more trouble.

494
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,660
Li Zan was clearly trying to help him.

495
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,720
He wouldn't force someone

496
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,650
to jump into the sea.

497
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,300
I used all my connections,

498
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
but...

499
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,450
Tell me how much

500
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,700
this deadbeat wants now.

501
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,480
One million.

502
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,760
What the hell?

503
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,140
(Li Zan.)

504
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,840
(I'm back.)

505
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,120
(Forgive me.)

506
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,360
(I shouldn't have left.)

507
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,170
(I promise you)

508
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,780
(I won't leave you again.)

509
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,210
(Lu Tianchi gave me this little turtle
when I was injured)

510
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,300
(and unconscious last time.)

511
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,110
(I know it looks)

512
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,330
(a bit strange,)

513
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,220
(but it's really powerful.)

514
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,330
(I recovered with my arms)

515
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,660
(and legs working.)

516
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,510
(I hope you're as strong)

517
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,040
(as this little turtle.)

518
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,940
(Get better soon,)

519
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,490
(or I won't forgive you.)

520
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,780
Li Zan, Li Zan.

521
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,190
What are you saying?

522
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,370
Li Zan, I'm here.

523
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,480
I'm here.

524
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,030
I said

525
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,130
don't leave me here

526
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,540
alone anymore.

527
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,490
I promise you. I won't leave.

528
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,100
I won't leave.

529
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,720
Stop whistling.

530
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,130
You're making me unable to pee.

531
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,460
Can you have Lu take care of me
for two days?

532
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,020
No.

533
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,670
Slow down. It's hot.

534
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,680
Is it good?

535
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,330
Let's go home, okay?

536
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,090
Okay, finish your egg.

537
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,380
Slow down, no one's rushing you.

538
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,060
Zan.

539
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,020
Shuangshuang.

540
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,020
My goodness, your face...

541
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,690
Does it hurt?

542
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,100
It's nothing, just a small injury.

543
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,060
I'm a tough guy.

544
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,400
After a dozen days,

545
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,510
I'll be a healthy man again.

546
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,800
In a moment, I'll count to three.

547
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,940
You need to try a little too.

548
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,130
Come on, come on.

549
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,040
One, two, three.

550
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,460
I missed you.

551
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,160
Thanks for your concern.

552
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,960
You're both busy. Please go back.

553
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,500
Also, this is the rent

554
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,280
you gave me before you left.

555
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,510
I failed to look after our brother.

556
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,660
I'm sorry.

557
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,520
It's my fault. I insisted on going back.

558
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,430
It's my fault.

559
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,650
You volunteered

560
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,630
to help take care of him.

561
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,960
This has nothing to do with you.

562
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,000
It's my fault.

563
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,580
Lu also told me

564
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,980
about the issue
with those debt collectors.

565
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,230
Let's figure it out together.

566
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,740
Besides, I've recently met

567
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,750
a super reliable person.

568
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,060
He has the whole...

569
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,830
He has the whole surfing industry

570
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,940
in Southeast Asia.

571
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,290
He has cash flow.

572
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,700
We could borrow some money from him.

573
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,730
Enough.

574
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,270
I'll handle my brother's issue myself.

575
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,150
I don't want to be led

576
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,220
by the nose like before.

577
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,500
Thanks for your effort. Go home.

578
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm going in to take care of Li Zan.

579
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,070
Not seeing you off.

580
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,960
Come on.

581
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,900
I thought only you couldn't come in.

582
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,180
Take your trash away.

583
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,900
Don't make promises you can't keep.

584
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,370
What promise?

585
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,580
What did you promise?

586
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,240
Try it.

587
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,090
Okay.

588
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,300
Eat more.

589
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,820
So good.

590
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,060
I missed your cooking so much.

591
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,700
You must've been craving it for ages.

592
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,700
Sis,

593
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,730
should I go to Tsinghua
or Peking University?

594
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,440
You talk like they're fighting

595
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,430
over you.

596
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,880
Anyway, I'm going to Beijing.

597
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,520
I'll take care of you when you're old.

598
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,670
I heard that the food at the cafeteria

599
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,240
of Peking University is tasty and cheap.

600
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,420
This.

601
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,010
This is for you.

602
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,630
You found the necklace?

603
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,470
No.

604
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,230
This inside

605
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,990
is all

606
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,580
of my assets.

607
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,570
That flash drive has

608
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,850
an NFT in it.

609
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,580
It might increase in value one day.

610
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,530
I'll open a restaurant
for you in the future.

611
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,110
But I don't have money now.

612
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,860
Even Yang

613
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
mortgaged his house

614
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,040
to support you.

615
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,210
As your brother,

616
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,250
I'll support you
even if I have to sell everything.

617
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,790
What did Wang Yang do?

618
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,660
You don't know?

619
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,890
They say Yang

620
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,310
took a large sum of money

621
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,280
as collateral.

622
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,200
That's why Ms. Du

623
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,290
agreed to sign the contract.

624
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,370
Who told you that?

625
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,100
Shuangshuang.

626
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,220
She's such a gossip.

627
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,370
She heard you were opening a restaurant

628
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,410
and asked everything about it

629
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,190
across the sea.

630
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,620
It's all my fault.

631
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,420
I messed it up.

632
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:34,980
I'm sorry.

633
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,040
Wang Yang is such a hothead.

634
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,900
I'm speechless.

635
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,620
You don't need to apologize for this.

636
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,260
It's good that I failed.

637
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,950
Otherwise, he'd lose everything.

638
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,100
Now's not the time to open a restaurant.

639
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,120
I'm not ready at all.

640
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
You...

641
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,230
How long do you plan to stay

642
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,530
in Jaya this time?

643
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,450
You've never believed

644
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,860
I'd take you back to Beijing, right?

645
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,620
I believe it now.

646
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,780
It was right not to believe it before.

647
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,840
Expectations bring disappointment.

648
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,980
So, you're disappointed in Lu

649
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,500
and Shuangshuang?

650
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,570
Actually, this whole thing

651
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,770
isn't their fault.

652
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,050
Lu's been here every day,

653
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,200
cleaning the house, doing laundry,

654
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,640
and even learning to cook like you.

655
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,820
What? He can cook?

656
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,420
I'm not trying

657
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,510
to plead on Lu's behalf.

658
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,590
- But...
- Just eat.

659
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,270
Don't butt into grown-up business.

660
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,980
I'll take a bigger piece.

661
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,800
Mr. Luo.

662
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,690
You're here.

663
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,660
Thanks for meeting with me.

664
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,560
Let's go.

665
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,190
I remember you once mentioned

666
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,980
this lamb offal soup
and fried dough sticks.

667
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,860
Garlic sauce.

668
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,700
Fermented tofu.

669
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,540
Sesame paste.

670
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,020
Can you handle chili?

671
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,100
Yes, I can.

672
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,110
- Add the cilantro yourself.
- Sure.

673
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,100
So good.

674
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,670
I noticed before

675
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,990
you often held your stomach.

676
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,640
Is your stomach weak?

677
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,530
If you have a cold stomach,

678
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,060
don't drink celery juice
on an empty stomach in the morning.

679
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,300
It's too cold.

680
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,620
Since you like fresh juice,

681
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,610
I added some apple

682
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,780
and ginger.

683
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,100
Ginger warms the stomach.

684
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,840
Also, I noticed when you walk,

685
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,760
something's wrong.

686
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,500
Maybe rheumatism?

687
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,290
For people with rheumatism,

688
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,540
lamb offal is actually good.

689
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,610
It also warms the stomach

690
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,740
and drives out cold.

691
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,100
How thoughtful.

692
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,340
You must want something from me.

693
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,420
Yes.

694
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,860
I'd like to ask for your help.

695
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,460
Why should I help you?

696
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,800
Back when I was injured,

697
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,020
your manager said that you said

698
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,520
I could come to you for help.

699
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,500
So, I came to see

700
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,580
if you mean what you say.

701
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,490
Girl,

702
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,620
you're quite direct.

703
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,820
Has anyone told you

704
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,840
you're not like a typical girl?

705
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,580
Hardly anyone treats me like a girl.

706
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,460
My brother's in trouble.

707
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,940
The boy who tricked you
into coming here?

708
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,990
That's him. He's my family.

709
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,690
Family?

710
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,660
That's a bunch of people carrying debts.

711
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,180
Then we mustn't ignore it.

712
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,840
If we can't repay it in this life,

713
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,100
it'll carry over to the next.

714
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,020
So,

715
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,700
can you help me find someone?

716
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,660
This lamb soup is so delicious.

717
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,460
I'll make it again if you like it.

718
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:46,810
Miss Liu,

719
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,420
are you sure you want to do it this way?

720
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,540
Mr. Luo instructed us

721
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,980
to fully cooperate.

722
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,580
I appreciate Mr. Luo's thought.

723
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,300
Let's do it the way I say.

724
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,260
Can I not go?

725
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,590
No.

726
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,120
Sorry.

727
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,260
May you recover soon.

728
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
It's fine. It's okay.

729
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,660
I hope you recover soon too.

730
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,900
Get well soon.

731
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,550
I'll definitely repay the money.

732
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,990
- I'll pay back.
- Go back.

733
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,130
Why should I apologize?

734
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,660
It's clearly your fault.

735
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,040
This isn't right.

736
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,050
Come back.

737
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,070
That's enough, okay?

738
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,080
Why should I apologize?

739
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,130
I was trying to save him.

740
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,860
You've been undisciplined
and disorganized

741
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,720
for too long.

742
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,430
- No.
- Once I left, you caused trouble.

743
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,540
I did great

744
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,860
in many things.

745
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,500
For example, my recent grades are good.

746
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,020
Getting into a Beijing school is easy.

747
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,260
You're still going to take me

748
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,300
to Beijing, right?

749
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,490
Of course.

750
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,540
I'll go back and find a job.

751
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,180
You focus on studying.

752
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,720
When I can't work,
you'll take care of me.

753
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,940
Uncle Lu,

754
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,900
