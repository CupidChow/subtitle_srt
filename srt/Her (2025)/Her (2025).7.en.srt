No need. Take it away. Thanks.

18
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,580
Dear, I'm back.

19
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,600
Honey.

20
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,820
You're back.

21
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,450
I thought you didn't like the sun

22
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,070
or yoga.

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,000
No, I love sunshine.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,630
I like whatever you like.

25
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,370
I've been waiting
for you here all morning.

26
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,050
I nearly passed out in the heat.

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,680
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,030
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,680
Do you plan to come back

30
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,560
to Italy with me?

31
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,240
Let me take you to Tuscany

32
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,490
to meet my parents.

33
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,330
I think Jaya's pretty nice.

34
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,110
And don't you think

35
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,310
it feels really good

36
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,580
being here together?

37
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,400
You're not planning
to live at my place?

38
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,570
Then I'll ask my secretary

39
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,680
to extend the rent
for three more months.

40
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,350
If you like it here,

41
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,340
then we'll stay here.

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,270
There's a great show tonight.

43
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,280
Would you like to come with me?

44
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,140
Of course.

45
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,570
- Long time no see.
- Yes.

46
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,740
- How are you?
- How are you?

47
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm fine.

48
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,500
She's my girlfriend, Shuangshuang.

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,340
Mike.

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,730
We came for the match.

51
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,730
Let's see how it turns out.

52
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,330
Antonio,

53
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

54
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,370
Wait for me.

55
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,440
Sure, no problem.

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,320
Sorry.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,300
I'll wait here for you.

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,490
Why are you here?

59
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,760
Look at this ring. Is it big?

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,660
Stop messing around.

61
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,820
You know this isn't

62
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,020
a legitimate fight, right?

63
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,960
I know.

64
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,380
I heard some things on the way here.

65
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,240
Then why did you come?

66
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,340
Well, Antonio said

67
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,350
he had a surprise for me.

68
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,630
I didn't know it was this place

69
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,720
until I got out of the car.

70
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,430
I really don't think

71
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,870
you should be watching these fights.

72
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,760
Make up an excuse.

73
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,640
Tell him you're not feeling well
or whatever.

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,480
You're good at that.

75
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
- Right?
- No.

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,060
Antonio is

77
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,160
a lifetime VIP member here.

78
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,010
I can't be

79
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,100
"not feeling well" forever.

80
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,910
Have you thought

81
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,110
about being honest with him?

82
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,380
Like telling him about your past.

83
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,080
I don't need you
to teach me how to date.

84
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,100
I'm not your client.

85
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,370
Why do you care so much about me?

86
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,620
Fine, I'm leaving.

87
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,840
I'd suggest you not watch the fight.

88
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,180
It really matches your eyes.

89
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,350
Thank you.

90
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,170
Wait just a moment.

91
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

92
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,730
Come here.

93
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,620
Me too.

94
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,180
Let me introduce you.

95
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,930
This is Mr. He from Highland.

96
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,820
This is Shuangshuang, my girlfriend.

97
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,940
I've heard so much about you.

98
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,820
Pleasure to meet you.

99
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,760
This is Mike.

100
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,110
The show is about to begin.

101
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,280
Everyone, inside, please.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,880
Hi.

103
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,380
And now,

104
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,410
the fight you've all been waiting for.

105
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,690
Coming to the stage...

106
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,190
- Big Beast.
- It's about to start.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,560
Go, Big Beast!

108
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,300
Come on, Big Beast!

109
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,400
Fighting

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,580
against Beijing, China, Liu Yan.

111
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,500
Who?

112
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,740
(Liu Yan)

113
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,100
Big Beast, go!

114
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,380
Isn't she from Xiya?

115
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,380
You knew her before?

116
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,180
She visited my mother's grave.

117
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,780
Something must have happened.

118
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,460
Otherwise, she wouldn't have come here.

119
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,260
(Production: Roses)
Scene 1, shot 1, take 1. Action!

120
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,780
Ladies and gentlemen,

121
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,740
get ready to watch another

122
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,940
two warriors facing off in the ring.

123
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,540
There ain't no scoring.

124
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,280
No time limit.

125
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,540
No holds barred match.

126
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,290
Get ready for combat!

127
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,520
Ready? Beat!

128
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,580
Get up.

129
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,640
Where's the referee?

130
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,500
It has to stop. Can't you see?

131
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,060
Go back to your seat.

132
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,450
So, you've made up your mind?

133
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,800
I have.

134
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,340
You're going to die,

135
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,180
right?

136
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,290
Maybe.

137
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,880
Maybe it's better
to rip the bandage off.

138
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,690
I've been running for too long.

139
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
I ran from debt collectors
with my mom as a kid.

140
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,960
Now I'm running with Li Zan.

141
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,620
I'm tired.

142
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,980
The best thing Jiang Fang ever did

143
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,180
was send me to sports school.

144
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,960
That's where I learned

145
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,270
how to face my fears.

146
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,130
I used to hope

147
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,660
that by the time she came back for me,

148
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,260
I'd have already won

149
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,440
enough matches,

150
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,830
so she'd never have to run again.

151
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,420
I wanted to tell her in person.

152
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,460
Jiang Fang,

153
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,660
I can protect you now.

154
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,380
Don't hide anymore.

155
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,680
Can you be brave for me just once?

156
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,090
Come and find me.

157
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,940
Even if I die,

158
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,770
I want you to remember
you had a Salty

159
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,500
you could always be proud of.

160
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,730
If something happens that day,

161
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,100
this photo can be...

162
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,940
Be what?

163
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,820
A memorial photo.

164
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,150
Louder, louder.

165
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,170
I can't hear you.

166
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,030
Liu Yan.

167
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,700
Liu Yan?

168
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,140
Liu Yan.

169
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,980
Liu Yan.

170
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,060
Stop! Stop!

171
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,560
Why did you hit him?

172
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,620
Stop!

173
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,020
Where are you going?

174
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,060
That was fun.

175
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,980
(Mom.)

176
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,420
(I won.)

177
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,500
(Did you see it?)

178
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,960
Liu Yan!

179
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,420
Don't sleep.

180
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,170
Doctor!

181
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,930
I just had a dream.

182
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,440
I dreamed I went to Jaya Island.

183
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,740
I was drowning in debt

184
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,540
and almost got beaten to death.

185
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,180
You won't die.

186
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,190
Kids with no parents

187
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,060
always survive.

188
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,720
What if I fall in love with someone?

189
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,060
Wouldn't that become my weakness?

190
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,100
Who?

191
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,060
Who's the poor guy you fell for?

192
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,750
56, 57, 58.

193
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,760
59, 60, 61, 62.

194
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,980
Wow.

195
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,080
Wow!

196
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,380
That's a lot.

197
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,420
We're rich, Liu Yan.

198
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,320
We're rich.

199
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,620
We're rich!

200
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,860
I can clear Jiang Fang's debts!

201
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,220
I'm rich!

202
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,620
Are you Jiang Fang?

203
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,460
Thank you for looking after Liu Yan.

204
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,050
I know

205
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,210
I shouldn't be here.

206
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,020
No.

207
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,310
You should've shown up long ago.

208
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,380
She's been looking for you.

209
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,000
You're the one person

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,100
who should've been here.

211
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,500
I don't have the face to see her.

212
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,620
She...

213
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,100
As you know,

214
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,370
she was beaten this badly

215
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,660
because of the debt you owe.

216
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,500
But you...

217
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,620
Could you please

218
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,270
face all this bravely?

219
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,770
I don't know

220
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,870
if she'll forgive you.

221
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,340
But she really misses you.

222
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,540
Please stay.

223
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,740
Wait here with me until she wakes up.

224
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,580
Okay?

225
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,050
You're right.

226
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,300
I shouldn't run anymore.

227
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,760
I'll stay. I'll take care of her.

228
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,740
Please, have a seat.

229
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,820
I haven't asked your name yet.

230
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,300
My surname is Lu.

231
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,220
I'm her legal advisor.

232
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,390
Mr. Lu, thank you.

233
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,740
No problem at all.

234
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,860
You should go get some rest.

235
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,020
I've got things covered here.

236
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,330
I...

237
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,220
I'll stay and wait with you.

238
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,590
As for the hospital staff,

239
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,480
I can manage it.

240
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,500
No need.

241
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,540
I'll call a doctor if I need to.

242
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,880
Besides,

243
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,780
she's a girl.

244
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,220
When she needs to wash,

245
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,770
it's not very convenient

246
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,300
with you here.

247
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,900
Then I'll wait at the door.

248
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,130
Really, there's no need.

249
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,580
Go home and get some sleep.

250
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,460
Come back tomorrow morning for her.

251
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,980
Also...

252
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,740
I haven't seen her in over a decade.

253
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,520
I'd like to spend a little time
alone with her.

254
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,540
Well...

255
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,900
Then I'll leave.

256
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,710
Okay, okay.

257
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,980
If the A/C gets too cold tonight,

258
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,190
you can ask her for a blanket.

259
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,820
Got it. Take care.

260
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,660
Alright.

261
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,820
Thank you, Mr. Lu. Thanks.

262
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,740
You shouldn't have come.

263
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,890
Hello.

264
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,520
Jiang Fang.

265
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,050
Wait.

266
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,530
Are you leaving now?

267
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,320
What do you think?

268
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,900
What did you just say to me?

269
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,570
You said you two

270
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,490
haven't spent much time together
in a while.

271
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,170
You said you...

272
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,510
At least wait until she wakes up

273
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,400
before you go.

274
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,860
If I do, I won't be able to leave.

275
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,840
Your debts

276
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,090
have been cleared now.

277
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,220
You two can finally

278
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,280
start a new life together.

279
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,150
Why are you leaving?

280
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,340
Mr. Lu,

281
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,020
don't you get it?

282
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,540
Liu Yan has grown up.

283
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,340
She has her own life now,

284
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,020
and I have mine.

285
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,260
We're not on the same path.

286
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,260
If we force it,

287
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,900
she'll only end up worse off than now.

288
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,800
Why are you acting

289
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,360
like a completely different person now?

290
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,770
You weren't like this in the room.

291
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,620
Even if you're leaving,

292
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,980
at least wait for her to wake up.

293
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,180
Say these things to her face.

294
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,300
Can you?

295
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,860
You're right.

296
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,620
What should I even say to her?

297
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,380
Should I tell her

298
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,260
I made a lot of money

299
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,020
because I bet on her to win?

300
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,020
Should I stay now?

301
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,980
Liu Yan is my daughter.

302
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,580
It's true that I love her.

303
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,900
It's also true that I love money.

304
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,340
Actually,

305
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,110
if I ever really show up

306
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,240
in her life again,

307
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,100
that's when you should be worried.

308
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,460
Just now,

309
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,250
I got you a little turtle.

310
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,280
I hope you can

311
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,260
be strong like it.

312
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,930
Be strong...

313
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,750
Be strong...

314
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,790
Be strong like it.

315
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,420
That's enough.

316
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,090
Hurry and wake up.

317
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,220
Nurse,

318
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,060
can you call the doctor for me?

319
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,950
The patient is awake.

320
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,480
How are you feeling now?

321
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,230
Thirsty.

322
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,170
Here.

323
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,420
Slow down, slow down.

324
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,340
Don't drink too fast.

325
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,050
My hands

326
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,030
and feet...

327
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,520
They're all here.

328
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,060
You have three broken ribs

329
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,880
and a mild concussion.

330
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,620
Listen. You're lucky.

331
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,270
The doctor said if it were someone else,

332
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,470
their spine would've snapped.

333
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,420
They'd be paralyzed.

334
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,400
With your injuries now,

335
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,810
you're not going

336
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,280
back in the ring, right?

337
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,900
Be grateful, will you?

338
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,560
In the ambulance,

339
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,940
your heart stopped for ten seconds.

340
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,180
When I signed the consent form,

341
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,080
my hand was shaking.

342
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,180
Fine, you can't box anymore,

343
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,770
but you can hit me if you want.

344
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,060
Sorry, sorry.

345
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,380
I shouldn't have said that.

346
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,260
You must be hungry.

347
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,240
Once the doctor finishes,

348
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,300
I'll get you some congee.

349
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,480
Who did you bet on to win?

350
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,390
What?

351
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,990
Who did you bet on to win?

352
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,620
Well, to raise the odds,

353
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,220
I bet on you to lose, obviously.

354
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,580
What?

355
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,580
Is that a smile or a grimace?

356
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,580
What's wrong with you?

357
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,170
What's wrong, my friend?

358
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,220
I bet on myself to win.

359
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,490
You bet on yourself to win?

360
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,400
In that case,

361
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,860
you must've made a lot of money.

362
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,700
How about this?

363
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,050
Help me cover

364
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,380
the money I fronted.

365
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,260
Including the emergency fees, surgery,

366
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,300
and the hospital stay.

367
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,400
Not a small bill.

368
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,760
I want to be discharged.

369
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,120
I want to be discharged.

370
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,200
You talk like you can

371
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,420
walk out of here yourself.

372
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,740
Are you kidding me?

373
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,580
Mr. Luo covered all the costs.

374
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,800
The room is booked for a week.

375
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,090
You've got four more days left.

376
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,360
Rest a little longer.

377
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,690
Mr. Luo?

378
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,740
His people told me

379
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,700
to pass you a message.

380
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,270
If you ever need anything,

381
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,720
you can go to him.

382
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,810
Also,

383
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,700
Jiang Fang's debt is cleared.

384
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,550
If you're happy, just be happy,

385
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,810
but don't smile like that again.

386
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,090
Or it'll hurt again.

387
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,940
Alright.

388
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,860
Have another sip of water.

389
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,180
Come on.

390
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,620
Good for you.

391
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,130
What's this turtle doing here?

392
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,900
I was worried you wouldn't wake up,

393
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,900
so I hung a turtle for good luck.

394
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,240
I hope you'll be like it.

395
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,540
Come here.

396
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,620
Come here.

397
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,540
Are you going to kiss me?

398
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,420
Come here.

399
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,420
Idiot.

400
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,580
Slower.

401
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,120
Ow, ow.

402
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,820
Come on.

403
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,520
It's only 40.

404
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,440
If I go any slower, why not crawl back?

405
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,380
Fine, fine.

406
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,860
I'll drive slower.

407
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,620
Why not wait until you've recovered?

408
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,020
Why insist on being discharged now?

409
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,840
It's expensive.

410
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,930
You're not short on money.

411
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,860
I can cover it for you.

412
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,700
No.

413
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,300
(Big Beast)

414
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,000
What's with this light sign?

415
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,060
Light sign?

416
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,960
What did you do?

417
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,500
The guy on the motorcycle

418
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,300
is my good buddy.

419
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,360
His name's Huang Zongxian.

420
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,370
You can ask him to do it.

421
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,530
Just tell him I told you so.

422
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,770
He'll listen and cooperate.

423
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,710
Just get it done.

424
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,930
(Sexy Girl vs. Big Beast)
Don't worry.

425
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,220
(Yan, Big Beast)

426
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,220
I'm driving. Come on.

427
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,500
What are you doing? Be serious.

428
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,260
Look.

429
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
You need

430
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,340
to get your bangs trimmed.

431
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,060
You can't hit me, so now you bite me?

432
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,080
Are you a dog?

433
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,740
Don't tell anyone.

434
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,420
Fine, I won't.

435
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,140
So embarrassing.

436
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,810
Now you're shy?

437
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,180
Pinky swear.

438
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,500
Pinky swear what?

439
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,020
Don't tell.

440
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,660
I won't.

441
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,820
Still laughing?

442
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,960
Am I not allowed to laugh?

443
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,860
This wheelchair probably can't go in.

444
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,900
What are you doing?

445
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,660
Come on.

446
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,390
No, no, don't.

447
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,480
I don't need it. I'm fine.

448
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,120
It's okay.

449
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,670
Stop acting tough. You can't walk.

450
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,140
Sorry.

451
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,440
There's no electricity.

452
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,780
Are we going in or not?

453
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,820
Let's go.

454
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,720
How many eggs?

455
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Three.

456
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,820
How many?

457
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,920
Three.

458
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,770
And scallions.

459
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,180
Take them all out first.

460
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,670
There's seaweed
on the top of the fridge.

461
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,620
Grab that as well.

462
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,380
The pot is under the board.

463
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,600
The steamer rack is hanging

464
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,380
to the upper left of the stove.

465
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,640
This goes inside, right?

466
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,840
- Is this the steamer rack?
- What?

467
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,860
I can't see it.

468
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,100
Yeah, yeah.

469
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,800
Remove the roots?

470
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,650
Yeah, remove them.

471
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,790
Cut them into slices.

472
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,580
Just a few slices will do.

473
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,500
Crack the three eggs into a bowl.

474
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,770
Then look at the bowl.

475
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,860
See how much egg

476
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,700
is in there.

477
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,900
Add 2.5 times the amount of water.

478
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,450
Has it been whisked evenly?

479
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,760
Still whisking.

480
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,290
Like this?

481
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,300
Is that enough?

482
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,210
Keep whisking. Make it smoother.

483
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,820
And then pop

484
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,260
all the bubbles.

485
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,720
Once the salt is in,

486
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,370
- put...
- Speak slower.

487
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,420
I just found the salt.

488
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,100
Put it into the pot.

489
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,400
Just put it in?

490
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,100
Put it in, and then slice the scallions.

491
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,210
Are you slicing the white part?

492
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,810
The white part is the end, right?

493
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,690
No.

494
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,740
Don't slice the white part.

495
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,540
Use the green tops.

496
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,820
It doesn't sound right.

497
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,570
Seems like it's done.

498
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,290
Drizzle in a bit of sesame oil.

499
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,760
Add a small spoonful of soy sauce.

500
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,820
Don't feed me.

501
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,720
It tastes better when I eat it myself.

502
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,570
This works way better

503
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,490
than painkillers.

504
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,860
Try it.

505
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,280
Not bad.

506
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:46,990
Do you know why

507
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,060
you had to pop the bubbles?

508
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,980
Give me another bite.

509
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,500
Did you know?

510
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,170
When I was in the hospital,

511
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,100
I kept dreaming
that Jiang Fang came to see me.

512
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,020
It didn't feel like a dream.

513
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,880
Do you have any news about Jiang Fang?

514
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,140
No.

515
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,460
Not even bad news?

516
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,580
No.

517
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,620
Did she teach you this too?

518
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,740
Jiang Fang used to be the head chef

519
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,440
at a famous state-run restaurant.

520
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,540
She taught me all the fancy dishes.

521
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,580
I made up

522
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,740
these scrap tricks myself

523
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,040
during all those years in Beijing

524
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,180
when I had nothing but time.

525
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:44,770
Not bad, huh?

526
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,440
What are you working on now?

527
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,540
Did you see my messages?

528
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,400
I sent so many.

529
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,240
Answer me. Hurry up.

530
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,480
Hello, Ke? It's me.

531
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,100
Well.

532
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,500
Didn't you tell me before

533
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,060
you had a friend in Jaya?

534
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,490
Can you give me their contact info?

535
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,850
Yeah, it's urgent.

536
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,940
They're not there now?

537
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,520
If you don't answer soon,

538
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,460
I'm calling the police.

539
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,110
She's sleeping, okay?

540
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,160
Chill out a bit, will you?

541
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,210
Stop shouting.

542
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,140
Why are you crying?

543
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,740
She's not dead.

544
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,500
She's sleeping soundly in there.

545
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,520
She's fine.

546
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,500
Didn't you tell me
it was a minor injury?

547
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,960
When my dad died,

548
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,200
he didn't even end up like this.

549
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,680
If I'd told you the truth,

550
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,920
would you have gone to school?

551
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,910
If you skip school,

552
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,400
your sis will be even more worried.

553
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,510
She's a girl.

554
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,780
With her injuries,

555
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,830
she'll probably need plastic surgery.

556
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,450
Oh, my god.

557
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,730
She'll be fine
once the swelling goes down.

558
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,490
Your sis was born beautiful.

559
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,370
Don't you know that?

560
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,440
You're a boy.

561
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,370
You should learn a bit from her

562
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,730
and be tougher.

563
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,270
It's fine. I'm watching over her.

564
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,110
She'll be okay.

565
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,580
Then I'm going to school.

566
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,620
Go on, go on.

567
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,980
Don't tell her I came back.

568
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,190
I'm still mad.

569
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,540
Still seasick too.

570
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,460
Take good care of her.

571
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,960
Only you would like someone

572
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,870
brave but reckless
and brainless like her.

573
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,860
Are you okay?

574
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,990
When Big Beast lifted me

575
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,540
and slammed me the second time,

576
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,900
do you know what

577
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,770
my last thought was?

578
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,660
What?

579
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,780
Regret.

580
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,070
I hadn't gotten to enjoy anything yet,

581
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,020
and I was going to die.

582
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,900
So why don't you take me out?

583
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,580
Now?

584
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,760
Where are you getting the energy?

585
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,060
How are you going out like this?

586
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,420
With so many broken bones,

587
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,670
you need to rest.

588
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,490
I've been in Jaya so long,

589
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,860
and I haven't done anything fun.

590
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,390
I only focused on clearing debts.

591
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,840
Over and over.

592
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,700
You'd scare people

593
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,540
if you went out like this.

594
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,180
I want to ride the Ferris wheel.

595
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,660
What's so great about that?

596
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,160
It just sways slowly in circles.

597
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,820
Even little kids get bored of that.

598
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,220
I know it's boring.

599
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,620
Shijingshan's Ferris wheel

600
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,580
takes 28 minutes per round.

601
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,120
Yuyuantan's takes 20 minutes.

602
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,140
Longtan Lake's takes 22.

603
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,750
Happy Valley's is more worthwhile.

604
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,980
It takes 35.

605
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,540
I've been on all of them in Beijing

606
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,580
with Jiang Fang

607
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,680
and all her boyfriends.

608
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:15,780
But every time,

609
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,790
they'd still be on the Ferris wheel

610
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,760
by the time I'd finished

611
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,210
riding every other ride

612
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,280
in the park.

613
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,230
When they finally got off,

614
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,300
I had to take pictures for them.

615
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,080
How boring can a Ferris wheel be?

616
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,420
Will it be more boring than me?

617
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,860
Once you're better,

618
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,220
I'll go with you next time,

619
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,060
okay?

620
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,860
I've heard "next time" too many times.

621
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,250
It's always next time.

622
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,960
I'm always asked to wait.

623
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,560
But it's the middle of the night.

624
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,500
The amusement park is closed.

625
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,820
Next time then.

626
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,340
Where are we going?

627
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,500

634
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,340
Surprise.

635
