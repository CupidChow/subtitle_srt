16
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,020
Why are you here?

17
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,450
If you get off work too late,

18
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,530
I'll come and pick you up.

19
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,300
(Staff Only)

20
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,140
It's too late. I can walk home myself.

21
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,580
It's fine. For the next few days,

22
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,700
I'll pick you up after work.

23
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,730
No need.

24
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,410
I've been surrounded by onions all day.

25
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,100
I'll stink up your car.

26
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,940
It's fine. I love onions.

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,900
It rained today.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,500
Your leg injury must've flared up.

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,340
It hurts a little.

30
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,100
See? All the more reason to pick you up.

31
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,670
You haven't had dinner?

32
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,180
I did.

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,320
It's leftovers from a customer.

34
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,530
Don't eat leftovers.

35
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,060
I want to study it.

36
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,620
Come on.

37
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,530
This was made by He Guangyuan.

38
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,500
I want to see why it's so pricey.

39
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,970
Who made this?

40
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,220
He Guangyuan.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,740
Well.

42
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,500
It looks pretty average.

43
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,660
Give it back.

44
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,290
Don't eat the leftovers.

45
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,230
I want to analyze it.

46
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,730
I have to taste good food to make one.

47
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,760
- Stop it.
- Lu Tianchi.

48
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,130
I'll treat you to something better.

49
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,970
Lu Tianchi.

50
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,620
What's that sound?

51
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,780
A ghost?

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,970
The customer from earlier.

53
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,780
Sir.

54
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,780
Sir.

55
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,130
Let's get up, okay?

56
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,730
Here, let me help you.

57
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,130
Slow down. It's slippery.

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,250
Your coat.

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,940
No, no need.

60
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,220
No need. No need.

61
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,340
Alright, no need. Thank you.

62
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,340
It's good to help people,

63
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,970
but if you see someone drunk at night,

64
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,970
especially a man,

65
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,570
just be cautious.

66
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,970
He's a customer.

67
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,830
A customer?

68
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,230
What kind of customer acts like this
at a fancy restaurant?

69
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,800
What are you doing?

70
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,790
Don't throw it away.

71
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,650
I want to taste...

72
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,620
What's wrong?

73
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,320
I think I pulled something

74
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,480
when I helped him up.

75
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,900
What are you doing?

76
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,970
My coworkers might see.

77
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,060
Put me down.

78
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,900
There's no one here.

79
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,460
Lu Tianchi.

80
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,130
No.

81
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,730
Stop struggling, stop it.

82
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,950
If you keep struggling, I'll...

83
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,240
Listen, the parking lot is far.

84
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,250
Okay? Just don't walk.

85
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,260
I can walk.

86
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,110
You can't.

87
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,370
What are you doing?

88
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,460
I'm looking for cream.

89
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,140
Are you Korean?

90
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:22,850
I am.

91
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,470
Then why did you say
we share a hometown?

92
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,660
Liar.

93
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,750
My mom's from Jilin.

94
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,220
My Northeast China accent is so good,

95
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,780
so I tell everyone I'm from Jilin.

96
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,410
Right, Matsuo?

97
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,050
Didn't I tell you that too?

98
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,890
Yes.

99
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,930
See? I'm not lying.

100
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,220
I just borrowed a little money from you.

101
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,260
I don't want your money anymore.

102
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,780
We can forget about being friends.

103
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,850
That's not what I meant.

104
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,410
Forget it. We're done, okay?

105
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,250
Fine, fine.

106
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,490
No, no. Don't.

107
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,060
Curly.

108
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,530
Is this fish soup?

109
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,370
Yeah.

110
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,050
Can I use some?

111
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,010
Go ahead.

112
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,660
You're being fancy

113
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,780
about making a staff meal.

114
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,370
- Thanks.
- Here.

115
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,210
Thanks. Thanks.

116
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,100
This is my first time

117
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,130
being asked to do this at Highland,

118
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,660
so I didn't want to let everyone down.

119
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,930
Alright, everyone.

120
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,370
Let's eat.

121
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,340
Hurry.

122
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,930
I already smelled how good it was

123
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,300
when Matsuo started cooking.

124
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,530
What do we eat today?

125
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,170
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

126
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
This is my signature dish.

127
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,690
Let's eat.

128
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,330
Dig in.

129
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,140
I've made this many times,

130
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,050
and everyone says it's good.

131
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,370
It's good.

132
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,210
Really?

133
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,300
Is it good?

134
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,050
Thanks.

135
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,220
It's good.

136
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,280
It's really good.

137
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,140
Thanks.

138
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,290
Chef, come and eat.

139
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,020
I made this.

140
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,460
Did you add fish soup?

141
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,210
Yes.

142
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,760
If you like drinking tap water so much,

143
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,730
drink all you want.

144
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,580
Mr. Signature Dish,

145
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,530
just started being a chef?

146
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,170
You have to add fish soup
in small amounts

147
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,850
many times to bring out the flavor.

148
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,290
If you just dump in tap water
to be lazy,

149
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,850
you won't fool Philip.

150
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,700
It's okay.

151
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,580
Sorry to trouble everyone.

152
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,050
Haven't you ever had fish before?

153
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,820
Anyone would cook it better.

154
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,260
Chef, if you insult us

155
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,140
without explaining why,

156
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,660
it'll leave us with trauma.

157
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,910
Explanation?

158
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,290
Can't you figure it out yourself?

159
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,730
The skin is golden and crispy.

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,050
The innermost layer of meat

161
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,970
is a little raw.

162
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,590
That's the perfect doneness

163
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,430
for pan-seared fish.

164
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,130
Matsuo, use this for staff meals.

165
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,010
If you serve garbage again,

166
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,180
get out.

167
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,100
Matsuo, it's okay.

168
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,970
Philip's just picking on you.

169
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,850
Don't use that.

170
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,300
No, I have to listen
to the chef in the kitchen.

171
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,300
I'll help you. Don't worry.

172
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,490
Thanks.

173
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,770
Don't worry, Matsuo.

174
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,940
What we're going to make

175
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,130
will totally blow them away.

176
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,180
Heat the pan, and then add oil.

177
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,060
Put the fish in.

178
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,310
Once it starts to change color,

179
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,150
add the egg white.

180
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,010
- All of it?
- Yeah.

181
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,850
OK.

182
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,660
Wait till the fish turns
completely white,

183
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,460
and then add more.

184
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
Is this okay?

185
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,460
Yes, go ahead.

186
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,300
OK.

187
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,300
Add four spoonfuls of this.

188
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,380
Four spoonfuls, got it.

189
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,180
Alright, time to eat.

190
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,820
Amazing.

191
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,490
It's so good.

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,580
- So good.
- Matsuo, you're amazing.

193
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,540
Thank you, Yan.

194
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,650
It's not enough for me.

195
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,850
Take a little less.

196
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,060
Give me a little.

197
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,490
I can easily finish it.

198
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,890
Childish.

199
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,340
Chef, if you're not eating, I will...

200
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,850
Are you sure you can eat so much?

201
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,940
Mr. He, this was made for you.

202
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,220
Cooking the yolk and white separately...

203
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,770
How did you come up with that?

204
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,770
You should ask Matsuo.

205
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,220
In the kitchen,

206
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,250
I know better than anyone

207
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,480
who has brains and who has skills.

208
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,870
Yolk and egg white

209
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,820
have different textures,

210
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,700
so the taste

211
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,870
will also be quite different.

212
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,700
If you control the heat well,

213
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,940
the yolk will taste like crab roe,

214
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,770
and the white like crab meat.

215
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,820
Who taught you that?

216
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,580
My mom used to be

217
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,930
head chef at a Chinese restaurant.

218
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,340
She had both skill and smarts.

219
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,180
Maybe I inherited

220
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,060
just a little bit.

221
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,850
Skill-wise, you're still lacking.

222
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,520
Brains are useless without skill.

223
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,100
The heat was decent,

224
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,490
but your seasoning was off.

225
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,790
Soy sauce and vinegar differ
in the north and south.

226
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,420
This should use Zhejiang Red Vinegar,

227
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,730
but we only had sushi vinegar here.

228
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,570
Liu Yan,

229
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,250
gourmet food is about results.

230
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,730
Lack of skill is a fatal flaw.

231
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,770
If you make excuses,

232
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,010
it means you don't have brains either.

233
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,820
But I like your creativity.

234
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,300
I hope you don't get eliminated
by the end of the month.

235
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,590
I definitely won't be eliminated.

236
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,850
Liu Yan, come here.

237
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,490
Coming, coming.

238
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,420
Mr. He, I'll get back to work now.

239
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,490
Coming.

240
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,770
Why didn't you take out the trash?

241
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,250
Do you want to be fired?

242
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,940
I'll do it right now.

243
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,980
(Lam Kee Herbal Tea, Grocery)

244
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,350
(Lu Tianchi)
Ms. Liu,

245
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,880
are you free tomorrow night

246
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,510
to have dinner with me?

247
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,100
(Liu Yan)
I'll see if I can swap shifts.

248
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,890
I'll let you know if I can.

249
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,300
Hello?

250
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,180
Hi.

251
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,420
Okay, please wait a moment.

252
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,610
I'll be right out.

253
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,210
Okay.

254
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,820
Hello, Miss Liu.

255
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,580
Mr. Lu sent me to pick you up.

256
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,700
Where are we going?

257
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,300
He's being all mysterious.

258
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,020
(Highland Restaurant)

259
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,730
One non-alcoholic drink, please.

260
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,380
Senior,

261
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,300
I brought you

262
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,540
a business opportunity.

263
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,370
What serious case
could you possibly have?

264
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,540
I'm busy.

265
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,010
Come on, just three minutes.

266
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,770
This is a really simple case.

267
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,130
A housewife rode

268
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,550
a scooter every day

269
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,770
to drop her kid off at school.

270
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,180
Her neighbor lived on the way,

271
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,120
so she also gave

272
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,220
the neighbor's kid a lift.

273
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,890
A few days ago, at an intersection,

274
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,010
she swerved

275
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,180
to avoid a truck,

276
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,700
and the neighbor's kid fell off.

277
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,460
The kid was sent to the hospital.

278
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,580
It was just a minor injury.

279
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,060
But the neighbor still

280
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,340
sued them.

281
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,300
Another one of these cases.

282
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,940
Was the first trial over?

283
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,480
Yes. 50,000 yuan in compensation.

284
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,170
She's just a wage earner.
What can she do?

285
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,100
It's like biting the hand
that feeds you, right?

286
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,940
The verdict is out.

287
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,420
Why still fuss over it?

288
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,820
Did you think about that job

289
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,010
I mentioned last time?

290
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
I'll consider it.

291
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,370
Anyway, I think we need

292
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,460
to take this case.

293
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,970
I'll think

294
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,100
of a counterclaim strategy

295
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,580
and let you know.

296
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,490
I've got something to do.

297
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,370
I'll call you later.

298
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,700
Thanks, much appreciated.

299
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,580
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

300
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,700
Mr. Lu,

301
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,650
try this wine.

302
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,580
I can't finish it. You drink.

303
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,700
It's free.

304
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,340
This place is expensive.

305
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,060
Did you bring enough money?

306
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,450
Thanks.

307
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,690
Try it.

308
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,540
Mr. Lu, don't go.

309
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,740
Mr. Lu.

310
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,610
Why are you leaving?

311
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,930
Let's drink.

312
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,500
What a coincidence, Mr. Lu.

313
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,020
You're eating here too?

314
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,690
This place is expensive.

315
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,100
Can you afford it?

316
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,020
You're so mean.

317
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,100
Are these shoes nice, Mr. Lu?

318
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,840
You can have them if you like them.

319
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,670
(5 years ago)

320
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,590
Thanks for tonight.

321
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,550
Thank you, Director.

322
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,390
Okay.

323
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,740
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

324
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,580
Bye-bye.

325
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,930
What's the matter, Lu?

326
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,980
Listen. Just 100,000.

327
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,780
You've got a kid too.

328
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,730
If your daughter

329
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,780
were beaten up like this,

330
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,020
how would you feel?

331
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,100
One million compensation.
We won't budge.

332
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,940
Lu,

333
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,780
I could've left you with nothing

334
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,210
but your underwear.

335
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,130
100,000 is plenty.

336
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,340
If you don't want it,
then you get nothing.

337
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,690
Tang Shuangshuang is my first client.

338
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,710
I won't let her get bullied like this.

339
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,980
We're sticking to one million

340
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,450
and a public apology from the media.

341
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,500
This case has no value.

342
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,300
Don't waste your time.

343
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,740
She got beaten so badly.

344
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,690
Let it be a lesson to her.

345
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,650
She's not going to win the lawsuit.

346
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,370
Isn't the law supposed

347
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,500
to protect the weak?

348
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,690
Of course.

349
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,170
As expected of a top student.

350
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,500
Mr. Lu, you've worked hard.

351
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,850
See you tomorrow.

352
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,580
Ignore him.

353
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,020
What does this mean?

354
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,340
Mr. Lu.

355
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
What do you mean?

356
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,300
You came out of jail.

357
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,740
Let's treat you to a drink.

358
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,130
Just enjoy it.

359
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,340
Take it away.

360
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,210
Why give it back to us?

361
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,610
It was here to begin with.

362
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,170
We're going to the U.S.

363
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,750
If we don't drink it, it'll be a waste.

364
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,130
Lu, Mr. Lu.

365
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,740
Why are you so mad?

366
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,920
We owe it all to you

367
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,020
that we can go to the U.S.

368
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,300
Remember Carlos?

369
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,410
He said he missed Tang Shuangshuang.

370
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,300
Tell that jerk for me.

371
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,020
I hope his stocks crash hard

372
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,740
and stay green forever.

373
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,500
Lu, your mouth is so foul.

374
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,740
Didn't they sew your lips shut

375
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,690
in there?

376
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,170
Here's a piece of advice.

377
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,880
Knowing the rules of the game
matters the most.

378
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,170
Let's just say

379
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,600
we've become friends after a fight.

380
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,410
If you ever need help,

381
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,850
come find me in the U.S.

382
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,890
I can even open

383
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,130
a tailor shop there for you.

384
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,770
Loser.

385
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,550
No matter what you say, he won't get it.

386
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,500
Why are we back?

387
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,890
You don't need to walk me there.

388
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,980
I know the way.

389
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,610
You don't need to.

390
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,130
What's going on today?

391
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,450
What happened to you?

392
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
A friend invited me out,

393
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,810
but I didn't expect them
to book this place.

394
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,780
Yan, you look so pretty today.

395
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,860
Stop it.

396
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,140
Thanks.

397
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,780
Why did you ask me to come here?

398
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,210
If I'd known it was here,

399
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,560
I wouldn't have dressed like this.

400
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,530
So awkward.

401
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,370
I wanted to surprise you.

402
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,930
Why is there still a bottle of wine?

403
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,020
Didn't you quit drinking?

404
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,170
It's not mine. Someone gave it to me.

405
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,340
Gave it to you? Who?

406
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,340
I just ran

407
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,610
into two old peers here.

408
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,530
Who?

409
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,690
They left.

410
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,410
They said the wine

411
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,340
was a gift,

412
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,930
but really just wanted to humiliate me.

413
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,060
Humiliate you?

414
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,850
Just two jerks.

415
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,300
They made a lot of dirty money.

416
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,540
They're just awful.

417
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,420
Wait.

418
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,660
Go back.

419
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,820
What are you doing? Slacking off?

420
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,650
Hurry. Go back.

421
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,330
It's fine. Forget about them.

422
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,500
Let's enjoy our meal.

423
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,340
Let me introduce today's...

424
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,500
It's fine. Anything edible is fine.

425
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,780
Your restaurant

426
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,130
looks nice,

427
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,820
but don't you

428
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,610
screen customers?

429
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,590
What do you mean?

430
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,740
It's such a great restaurant.

431
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,540
Not just anyone should be allowed in.

432
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,580
Trash like that

433
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,060
shouldn't be eating here.

434
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,890
So annoying.

435
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,100
Do you know that many people

436
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,650
in the world go hungry every day?

437
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,540
People like that

438
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,300
don't even deserve the right to eat.

439
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,930
What restaurant screens its diners?

440
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,820
Well, some jerks

441
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,260
are truly awful.

442
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,540
You didn't see them...

443
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,820
It was just too...

444
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,980
No matter how bad your mood is today,

445
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,920
once you eat this food,

446
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,360
you'll feel better.

447
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,210
Let me introduce it.

448
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,930
This tuna

449
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,370
is sliced exactly

450
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,020
0.5 centimeters thick.

451
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,300
Is every piece that small?

452
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,340
It's an appetizer.

453
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,100
So, all the dishes are this small?

454
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,900
No.

455
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,130
I think you once told me

456
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,500
that some dishes are for hungry people.

457
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,450
Some are

458
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,780
for those who aren't hungry.

459
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,370
But there's a third kind.

460
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,820
Some dishes are for the awful people.

461
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,300
You know what to serve them?

462
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,410
You dump a whole bunch

463
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,410
of laxatives in the food.
They deserve it.

464
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,260
Lu Tianchi, I think you're pretty awful.

465
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,370
Why did you ask me to come here today?

466
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,260
You know this is where I work.

467
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,370
Are you trying to humiliate my job?

468
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,790
If you're in a bad mood,

469
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,740
let's not eat.

470
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,890
I've got a lot to do.

471
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,490
Liu Yan.

472
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,370
This is something my coworkers and I

473
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,640
prepared with great care.

474
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,650
Maybe you just can't tell

475
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,740
when someone puts in effort.

476
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,430
Who allowed you to change shifts
without permission?

477
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,750
You didn't even check with me.

478
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,020
Chef, I'm sorry.

479
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,160
It was my mistake.
It won't happen again.

480
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,980
Lu Tianchi,

481
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,640
are you renovating the place upstairs?

482
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,020
Sorry about that.

483
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,660
(Lu Tianchi)
See you at the firm.

484
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,690
I'll apologize to you.

485
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,930

490
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,210
Chef.

491
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,130
Come.

492
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,540
This is my good friend.

493
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,060
- Hey.
- Carl.

494
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,930
A famous food critic.

495
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,050
Hello.

496
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,930
Okay, take this away.

497
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,500
Are you going to try?

498
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,410
Hey, there.

499
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,340
What's your name?

500
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,500
My name is Liu Yan.

501
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,740
It's a pretty name.

502
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,580
Liu Yan,

503
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,300
we've worked together for so long

504
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,410
but haven't had the chance

505
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,610
to get to know each other.

506
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,060
Come on, have a drink.

507
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,690
I don't drink, Chef.

508
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,740
Another class for you.

509
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,780
In the whole kitchen,

510
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,780
everyone must follow

511
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,020
the head chef's orders strictly.

512
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,380
Have a drink.

513
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,980
I really don't drink.

514
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:56,730
Oh Carl.

515
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,780
She's disrespecting you.

516
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,670
No.

517
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,820
Liu Yan, a single bad review from Carl

518
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,210
could wipe Highland

519
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,500
off the map in Jaya.

520
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,510
Are you drinking or not?

521
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,490
Just one.

522
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,290
Just drink it.

523
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,690
Okay, fine.

524
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,980
That's a good girl.

525
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,210
Cheers.

526
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,890
Welcome to Highland.

527
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,340
Thank you.

528
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,780
Surprise.

529
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,930
I did a little decorating.

530
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:16,770
Well.

531
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,850
This is takeout from your place.

532
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,650
I know you like Highland's food,

533
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,160
so I ordered it specially.

534
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,930
Don't be mad.

535
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,100
It's my fault.

536
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,450
I know I was wrong.

537
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,540
Don't be angry.

538
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,690
What are you looking for?

539
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,360
What do you want? I'll get it for you.

540
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,730
What's wrong?

541
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,210
Just now, in Highland's kitchen,

542
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,690
Chef Philip and his friend...

543
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,410
Those two scumbags tried to rape me.

544
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:13,970
How is it?

545
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,130
Chef, you're drunk.

546
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,770
What are you doing?

547
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,100
Chill.

548
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,780
You should listen to Chef.

549
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,580
Understand?

550
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,300
You have a good smell.

551
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,290
Miss Liu,

552
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,740
as long as you obey me today,

553
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,850
not only can I help you
stay at Highland,

554
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,610
but I can help you

555
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,650
get Jaya residency.

556
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,500
Nice necklace.

557
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,740
I think we should keep it

558
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,650
as a souvenir.

559
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,650
What do you say, Carl?

560
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,890
That's what just happened.

561
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,210
I really regret not killing them.

562
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,170
Thank god you didn't.

563
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,260
I know you're extremely,

564
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,740
extremely angry right now.

565
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,210
I'm angry too.

566
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,500
But killing them

567
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,740
and ruining your own life
is meaningless.

568
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,370
Let's go to the hospital first

569
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,410
and get checked. Alright?

570
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,250
No need.

571
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,610
No, listen to me.

572
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,980
Anger solves nothing.

573
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,300
What matters is

574
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,170
what we do next.

575
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,610
I swear I'll use every means I have

576
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,930
to get you justice.

577
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,530
Mr. Lu,

578
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,780
I appreciate the thought,

579
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,610
but I don't want your way.

580
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,620
That jerk.

581
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,170
This wasn't some sudden impulse.

582
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,380
It was planned.

583
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,980
And based on what I know of him,

584
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,330
he'll completely deny it.

585
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,130
Even if we report it

586
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,100
to Mr. He now,

587
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,900
there's nothing he can do.

588
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,500
At most, he'll fire him.

589
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,690
Today, it'll be the last time

590
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,100
Philip ever stands again

591
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,060
in the next three...

592
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,420
no, six months.

593
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,740
Also,

594
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,650
let's speak Mandarin, okay?

595
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,010
Liu Yan.

596
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,690
I'm also a woman.

597
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,730
You have to believe

598
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,730
I personally want
to help you get justice

599
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,290
more than anyone else at Highland.

600
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,460
But I'm also the manager.

601
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,650
So, I have to ask you

602
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,770
in a way you probably can't accept.

603
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,610
Can we put this aside

604
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,130
for now?

605
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,130
Highland has always had

606
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,250
a secret

607
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,770
that other chefs don't know.

608
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,090
Before Mr. He's mother passed away,

609
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,030
to protect Highland's reputation,

610
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,900
she added a clause

611
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,380
to her will.

612
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,020
After her death,
if Highland lost its qualification

613
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,900
to earn diamonds.

614
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,730
And failed to regain it
for three consecutive years,

615
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,250
the group would be forced

616
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,460
to shut down the restaurant

617
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,420
in the third year.

618
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,540
This year happens to be the third.

619
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,980
Mr. He knows this is the last chance.

620
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,650
I can feel he's on the verge
of breaking down.

621
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,900
If Highland disappears from Jaya now

622
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,540
because of Philip,

623
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,580
I truly don't know

624
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,810
what will happen to Mr. He.

625
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,570
I know

626
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,380
you haven't been at Highland for long.

627
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,420
You don't feel as deeply about it
as I do.

628
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,170
But I'm begging you.

629
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,500
Can you please

630
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,690
suppress your anger for now?

631
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,060
I swear.

632
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,500
As soon as the inspection

633
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,770
this month is over,

634
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,500
I'll report everything

635
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,900
to Mr. He and the group immediately

636
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
and let Philip get what he deserves.

637
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,740
Okay?

638
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,060
Why suddenly go back to Beijing?

639
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,910
Without Jiang Fang,

640
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,470
you don't have a reason to stay, right?

641
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,690
What about your job?

642
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,460
Is it because of Lu Tianchi?

643
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,060
He must've done something to you.

644
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,170
I'll go settle it with him.

645
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,460
It's not because of him.

646
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,810
Li Zan, come back to Beijing with me.

647
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,770
You won't starve there.

648
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,380
Sis, if you don't want to work,

649
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,860
I can make money.

650
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,380
You don't need to work, alright?

651
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,010
What?

652
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,460
You want to trick another relative
into coming?

653
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,590
You said I should go with you

654
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,690
because I wouldn't starve,

655
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,420
but why?

656
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,130
It's not like I'm going on vacation.

657
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,380
Am I going to study

658
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,900
or work there?

659
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,000
Have you thought about it?

660
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,540
I'm really just useless.

661
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,940
Sis, you've just been tired lately.

662
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,900
Get some rest, and you'll feel better.

663
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,130
Maybe it's anxiety.

664
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,330
- You...
- I'm not sick.

665
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,780
I just...

666
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,900
I just don't want to stay anymore.

667
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,940
I don't fit in here.

668
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,650
Shuangshuang.

669
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,770
Here's your skincare stuff.

670
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,620
And your clothes.

671
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,810
I'm giving them all back.

672
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,120
Just keep them at your place for now.

673
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,480
It's fine.

674
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,690
Here's one month's rent.

675
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,730
Working at Highland

676
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,940
has indeed changed your life.

677
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,900
Can you help me look after Li Zan?

678
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,980
I'm going back to Beijing.

679
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,780
So sudden.

680
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,020
Did Highland send you
to open a branch in Beijing?

681
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,900
What about Lu Tianchi?

682
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,420
Oh, you had a fight.

683
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,660
Why does my return to Beijing

684
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,420
have to be related

685
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,460
to a fight with Lu Tianchi?

686
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,020
I didn't come to Jaya because of him.

687
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,940
And I'm not leaving because of him.

688
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,460
He's not that important.

689
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,690
Sounds like a fight to me.

690
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,210
I just don't want you to leave.

691
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,650
I'm sorry.

692
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,020
I shouldn't have lost my temper at you.

693
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,460
It's okay. I think you can talk to me

694
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,890
about anything that's bothering you.

695
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,130
I just feel like everything's pointless.

696
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,710
Really pointless. I don't want to stay.

697
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,210
Have you really made up your mind

698
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,810
about going back to Beijing?

699
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,900
If you suddenly leave,

700
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,300
will it be easy to find a new job?

701
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,490
But I think your cooking's amazing.

702
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,910
You could even open your own place.

703
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,750
Me?

704
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,900
Do you really think so?

705
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,610
Of course.

706
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,210
It was my idea.

707
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,290
Count me in as a partner.

708
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,730
A technical partner.

709
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,130
I'll give you ideas,

710
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,730
and you give me a commission.

711
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,100
It'll work out.

712
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,900
Give you what?

713
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,260
Money.

714
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,980
Thanks for the advice.

715
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,900
I'll go pack.

716
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,580
Let me know

717
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,810
when you're leaving.

718
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,780
(Shredded pork with Zhacai pickles;
Steam or boil; Shelf life: 10 days)

719
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,820
Li Zan.

720
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,770
Where were you?

721
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,690
Ms. He called me today.

722
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,570
Have one.

723
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,020
Is it good?

724
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,100
So good.

725
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,500
I made all your favorites.

726
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,690
Everything's packed.

727
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,900
Each note

728
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,500
clearly explains

729
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,340
how to reheat it.

730
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,540
What did the teacher say?

731
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,460
Was she praising me?

732
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,100
Did she say I don't need to go to school

733
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,650
to rank top three in the grade?

734
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,530
Li Zan,

735
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,230
it doesn't mean I'll leave you hanging.

736
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,620
Sis, I bought so much food today.

737
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,700
It's too much.

738
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,900
Way too much to finish.

739
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,580
But you're right.

740
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,810
You're in school right now.

741
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,130
You can't just leave.

742
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:16,980
Right?

743
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,130
I've got everything arranged.

744
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
I paid a year's rent on this place.

745
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,970
I'll find someone to look after you.

746
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,290
Sis, I found a bunch of these.

747
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,650
These are ads

748
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,610
about lawyers.

749
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,730
If Lu Tianchi's no good,

750
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,900
we'll just dump him.

751
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,610
There are plenty of lawyers, right?

752
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,980
These are rental listings.

753
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,130
I'm sick of this place anyway.

754
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,860
It's damp and has no sunlight.

755
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,770
If you want to move

756
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,860
to avoid someone,

757
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,810
we'll move quickly.

758
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,420
Okay?

759
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,130
Li Zan.

760
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,330
Today,

761
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,980
I talked to your teacher.

762
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,770
She said with your grades,

763
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,370
getting into a Chinese school from Jaya

764
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,770
is totally possible.

765
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,060
- And I...
- Sis.

766
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,330
Do you think I'm a burden?

767
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,580
Then why do you have
to go back to Beijing?

768
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,500
I can earn money.

769
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,690
I won't hold you back.

770
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,860
That's not what I mean.

771
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,730
Where's the necklace I gave you?

772
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:34,610
I didn't...

773
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,900
I didn't take it off.

774
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,770
I just forgot

775
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,420
where I put it.

776
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:46,290
So, you really have to go?

777
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,020
Even if you do,

778
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,100
you won't give me a real reason?

779
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,100
The reason is just what you think.

780
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,770
I fought with Lu Tianchi.

781
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,060
I don't want to stay in Jaya anymore.

782
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,130
What are you doing?

783
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,060
My classmate asked me out.

784
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,980
I'm going out.

785
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,220
Li Zan.

786
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,690
I'm an adult.

787
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,580
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

788
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,940
It's too late. Don't go.

789
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,980
I'm fine, I'm fine.

790
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,940
I'm heading out.

791
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,450
- Li Zan.
- See you later.

792
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,780
(Jiang Fang,)

793
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,690
(I'm going to leave Jaya for a while,)

794
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,860
(or maybe)

795
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,130
(leave for good.)

796
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,780
Li Zan,

797
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,210
the password is your birthday.

798
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,160
I put the money and the card

799
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,680
behind my memorial photo.

800
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,460
I'll call you every day.

801
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,500
You have to pick up.

802
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,900
Sorry, traffic was bad.

803
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,170
You're really leaving?

804
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,380
Lu probably can't face you right now.

805
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,860
I called him several times,
but he didn't answer.

806
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,060
That's just how he is.

807
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,580
Right now, his mind's probably a mess.

808
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,770
How about leaving another day?

809
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,980
Let's go, or I'll be late.
