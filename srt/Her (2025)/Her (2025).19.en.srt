how the gamblers' families feel.

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,380
Gamblers lie to them every day,

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,090
so their emotions can't stay stable.

27
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,820
Exactly.

28

right?

32
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,460

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,300

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,660

40
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,480
You know what.

41
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,150
Someone tampered

42
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,060
with our ingredients.

43
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,100
We didn't know who,

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,100
but Mr. He

45
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,370
and I

46
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,380
adjusted the plan on site,

47
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,220
which actually

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,060
surprised the judges.

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,380
Sorry.

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,220
This

51
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,450
kind of ruined

your highlight moment.

53
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,620
Was I too late for your moment?

54
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,680
That was a grand occasion.

55
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,990
I think

56
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,060
I can't be so selfish.

57
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,340
Come on.

58
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,550
I'll give you another highlight moment.

59
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
What do you mean?

60
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,420
Slow down. Turn left.

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,740
Be careful.

62
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,850
- Well.
- Take it slow.

63
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,780
Where are we going?

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,220
Somewhere interesting.

65
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,080
Careful, okay, stop.

66
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
There's a step.

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,020
Come on, let's go down.

68
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,140

Close your eyes.

70
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,350
Close your eyes; don't open them.

71
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,340
Don't open them.

72
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,860
I won't.

73
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,660
Are you ready?

74
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,900
Soon.

75
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,800
Okay, open your eyes.

76
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,810
What? You have a new car?

77
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,100
Switched to a pink one?

78
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,660
Hello, Ms. Liu.

79
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,020
My name is Lu Tianchi.

80
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,360
I was born

81
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,380
in Shanghai in 1987.

82
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,340
I've been at Gaya

83
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,950
for 13 years now.

84
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,310
I have a real and reliable

85
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,340

After spending

87
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,690
a long time with you,

88
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,540
I believe

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,220
I can provide you

90
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,800
with a cohabitation certificate.

91
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,540
To show my sincerity,

92
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,180
this car is for you.

93
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,980
Here is the car contract.

94
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,860
Here are my documents.

95
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,820
Please take a look.

96
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,500
This is for me?

97
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,850
You sold your car

98
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,780
and bought one for me?

99
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,460
If you want to get

100
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,950
the cohabitation certificate in Gaya,

101
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,790
you need fixed assets

102
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,540
under your name.

103
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,290
I can't afford a house,

104
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,980
but a used car is fine.

105
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,900
Come on.

106
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,740
Get in and feel it.

107
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,150

108
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,380
Just get in.

109
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,460

112
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,180
Right.

113
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,940
Come here.

114
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,020
What are you doing?

115
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,420
Gathering evidence
for cohabitation registration.

116
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,380
When did I ever say

117
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,860
I'd live with you?

118
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,940
It's just too hard
to find someone else again.

119
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,780
Seriously.

120
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,460
The ones you found for me

121
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,540
were all unreliable?

122
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,790
Just forget about it.

123
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,770
Let's settle this.

124
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,310
I'll register with you, okay?

125
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,620
Lu Tianchi,

126
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,770
you have one more chance

127
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,060
to say that again nicely.

128
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,780
After thorough consideration,

129
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,000
I believe I'm the most suitable person

130
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,360
to apply for
cohabitation certificate with you.

131
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,340
So,

132
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,990
is it because you're kind

133
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,030
and you think I'm pitiful

134
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,030
that you want to help me

135
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,900
get the certificate?

136
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,740
Is that it?

137
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,580
Well.

138
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,740
Not exactly.

139
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,740
I'll give you one more chance

140
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,940

(Casino)

203
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,820
Hi, Abdu.

204
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,860
Abdu.

205
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
I know you're unhappy.

206
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,220
I know you're mad.

207
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,510
I owed you a lot of money before.

208
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,620
We're such good friends, right?

209
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,500
Listen to me.

210
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,020
I've found a new way recently.

211
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,620
Of course.

212
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,260
It was my fault before.

213
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,420
So, to show my sincerity,

214
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,570
you can ask for any interest you want.

215
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,180
Trust me one last time,

216
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,020
okay?

217
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,670
What are you doing?

218
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,860
This place is nice.

219
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,220
Free food and drinks.

220
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,140
Great place for VIP.

221
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,490
- Nice.
- How did you sneak in?

222
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,660
I just walked in.

223
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,860
Why would I sneak in?

224
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,980
Put your phone away.

225
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,050
Sit down.

226
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,700
- Chatting with foreigners?
- No filming.

227
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,050
That's rude.

228
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,540
When did you learn a foreign language?

229
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,180
Good for you.

230
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,420
Zan, you skipped school again.

231
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,220
I don't care whether you go

232
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,860
to school or not,

233
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,780
but Salty cares.

234
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,820
Do you want her to punish you?

235
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,700
Don't change the subject.

236
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,020
Aren't you sick?

237
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,620
Aren't you on medicine?

238
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,970
Where's your medicine? Show me.

239
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,820
Okay.

240
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,780
This is her medicine.

241
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,000
I had it tested.

242
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,140
Vitamins.

243
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,280
You can't take vitamins like that.

244
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,450
- Spit it out.
- You said it.

245
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,170
- You said it was vitamins.
- Spit it out.

246
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
You said it was vitamins, right?

247
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,260
Gotcha.

248
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,820
Liu Yan, look.

249
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,700
This is the evidence.

250
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,100
I'm telling you.

251
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,040
You need to take Jiang Fang

252
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,980
to get checked now.

253
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,970
The truth will be clear

254
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,280
once the CT results come out.

255
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,840
Jiang Fang, listen.

256
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,810
You're so superstitious.

257
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,060
You can't take off that charm.

258
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,360
If you do, it won't work anymore.

259
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,340
Think carefully

260
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,270
about the consequences.

261
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,740
Well...

262
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,060
I raised you.

263
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,740
You want to start a war with me

264
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,300
with your little tricks?

265
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,030
I owed money to Mr. Luo.

266
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,060
Do you think

267
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,100
I don't know

268
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,620
you put a tracker on me?

269
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,780
So what if you know?

270
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,900
I have evidence now.

271
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,100
If you don't cooperate,

272
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,200
I'll send it to my sister.

273
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,470
Anyway, I came today

274
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,500
to expose you.

275
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,100
I used your ID

276
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,260
to make an appointment.

277
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,280
You just

278
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,520
have to come with me

279
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,740
to get tested.

280
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,820
Okay?

281
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,940
When the results are out,

282
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,020
the truth will come out.

283
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,220
Do you dare?

284
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,020
Don't talk nonsense.

285
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,620
Cancel the appointment now.

286
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,700
Let's go now.

287
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,750
- Let's go.
- Wait.

288
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,180
Go on.

289
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,780
I didn't want to tell you this.

290
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,940
Do you remember the bag

291
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,040
with your dad's memorial photo?

292
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,420
There is

293
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,900
an insurance contract inside.

294
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,020
Go and take a look.

295
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,180
If you still want to take me

296
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,280
to the hospital afterward,

297
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,260
I'll go with you.

298
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,780
What do you mean?

299
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,600
What do I mean?

300
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,550
Didn't you see

301
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,800
when the contract takes effect?

302
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,460
Do you think I can go to the hospital?

303
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,500
I have a brain tumor.

304
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,220
If they know about this,

305
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
will they still pay out?

306
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,870
You're committing insurance fraud.

307
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,730
As long as I don't go to the hospital

308
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,060
for a formal checkup,

309
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,630
there won't be any record of me.

310
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,300
Without my record,

311
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,460
I can say

312
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,090
I didn't know I had this illness.

313
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,640
Why keep asking?

314
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,700
Now, you know

315
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,260
why I can't go to the hospital, right?

316
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,660
- You know why I had
- Please say

317
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,920
- to use my connections, right?
- the service keywords.

318
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,770
Human service.

319
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,060
You can say

320
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,160
"buy insurance".

321
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,500
I need a human service

322
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,160
- to check the insurance No.
- Please say

323
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,540
- Human service.
- the service keywords.

324
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,580
Enough already.

325
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,910
- Why argue with a robot?
- You can say...

326
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,800
You can check the contract No.

327
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,020
on the official website.

328
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,140
Go over there.

329
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,940
Still, we need to know

330
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,660
what the illness actually is, right?

331
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,820
If there's no illness, don't fake it.

332
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,780
If there is,

333
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,860
then we treat it.

334
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,530
I'll call my sis.

335
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,860
Enough already.

336
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,720
She finally

337
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,730
found a job.

338
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,570
Don't disturb her work.

339
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,540
Let's talk when she's back.

340
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,460
Potatoes are here.

341
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,920
Hey, what is this?

342
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,530
How can you decide on your own

343
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,960
to accept a batch of these potatoes?

344
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,220
Didn't you tell me to accept them?

345
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,780
Who said that? I didn't.

346
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,930
No, Jing just said...

347
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,880
Chef,

348
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,310
we've always used potatoes

349
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,340
grown in sand.

350
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,940
They have a higher starch content.

351
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,670
When boiled, they're yellowish.

352
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,940
The batch she accepted

353
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,700
is white potatoes grown in soil.

354
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,070
Their starch content is lower,

355
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,040
and the texture is crisp.

356
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,790
They are unsuitable

357
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,830
for making mashed potatoes.

358
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,630
How can someone
who represents Highland on TV

359
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,140
have such poor judgment?

360
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,590
No, it was Jing who told me

361
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,220
to sign for it with your absence.

362
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,060
Jing.

363
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,220
You win.

364
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
However you wash them,

365
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,580
you still can't change the variety.

366
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,820
Done, Chef.

367
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,980
It's delicious.

368
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,460
Better than before.

369
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,140
Delicious.

370
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,620
Kanta, tell the manager

371
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,000
the mashed potatoes are sold out.

372
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,380
Mr. He,

373
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,590
didn't you say it tastes better

374
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,640
than before?

375
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,460
As a single dish, the mashed potatoes

376
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,620
are indeed very good.

377
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,270
Mashed potatoes are usually paired

378
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,190
with beef.

379
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,660
Beef has

380
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,300
plenty of fat already.

381
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,020
If you pair it
with these mashed potatoes,

382
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,980
they will overpower

383
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,260
the original flavor of the beef.

384
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,540
Chef,

385
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,900
what about that pile of potatoes?

386
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,360
Highland doesn't allow

387
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,400
such mistakes.

388
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
Whoever accepted it

389
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,700
shall compensate at the internal price.

390
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,700
For 100 jin?

391
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,300
Any objections?

392
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,420
No, Mr. He.

393
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,020
A chef's worst mistake

394
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,860
is to take their eyes

395
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,200
off their ingredients.

396
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,620
I will pay attention.

397
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,110
This mistake won't happen again.

398
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,500
I hope whoever tampered

399
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,280
with the food on the day

400
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,900
of the TV show

401
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,380
can come forward

402
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,580
before I find out.

403
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,180
Wasn't it Philip?

404
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,700
(It's not her birthday.)

405
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,420
(Nor mine.)

406
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,420
(Then whose is it?)

407
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,560
(It must be her father's.)

408
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,570
(Could it be)

409
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,100
(that day?)

410
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,500
(Li Zan)

411
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,700
We can develop the dish in the kitchen

412
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,100
based on this idea.

413
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,100
Really?

414
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,500
Great.

415
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,820
Thank you for approving the plan.

416
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,980
It's not really approval.

417
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,160
I just think it has some...

418
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,050
Understood.

419
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,900
Imperfections.

420
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,860
Now, it's garbage

421
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,260
with future potential for perfection.

422
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,900
Mr. He,

423
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,260
I have a request.

424
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,500
Go ahead.

425
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,380
If my performance is acceptable,

426
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,380
I want to apply to be a sous chef.

427
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,430
You disappeared again

428
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,860
at a critical moment a few days ago.

429
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,690
Don't you want to explain it?

430
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,320
I've seen that report.

431
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,660
It was fabricated

432
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,740
by someone else, Mr. He.

433
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,540
Lu Tianchi wouldn't do that.

434
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,390
You're very bad

435
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,340
at managing

436
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,290
your personal life

437
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,360
and your emotions.

438
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,780
A sous chef

439
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,700
is not just someone who cooks well.

440
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,540
Every chef who wants a diamond rating

441
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,000
has no private life.

442
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,380
(Li Zan)
Sis, Jiang Fang ran away.

443
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,700
What happened?

444
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,940
I called you.

445
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,020
Why didn't you pick up?

446
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,720
What were you busy with?

447
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,300
What use is it for you to come back now?

448
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,980
Jiang Fang ran away long ago.

449
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,500
Stop looking around.

450
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,900
Anything in this house
that could be sold

451
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,500
has been sold.

452
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,320
The house is bare.

453
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,060
Come on, tell me how you were fooled.

454
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,300
She told me

455
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,120
she gave up treatment.

456
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,380
She said the insurance company

457
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,540
won't pay.

458
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,400
And she told me not to tell you.

459
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,580
She told me you're busy.

460
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,020
Then she gave me a glass of water.

461
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,340
I've been sleeping ever since.

462
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,660
What are you doing?

463
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,220
Why did you tear it up?

464
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,180
She stole my bank card

465
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,730
and transferred all my money out.

466
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,060
Do you think these few pieces of paper

467
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,060
can be real?

468
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,390
It's all my fault.

469
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,300
How could I believe her?

470
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,660
Jiang Fang is a big jinx.

471
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,380
Whoever touches her gets unlucky.

472
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,140
Look, she even left me a pair of shoes.

473
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,670
Just one of them was left.

474
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,580
And both

475
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,420
are the left ones.

476
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,720
Where are you going, sis?

477
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,260
I brought her back.

478
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,880
None of your business.

479
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,420
Going to find her now

480
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,340
is pointless.

481
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,020
She must've spent all the money.

482
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,460
Come on.

483
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,700
At least get me some clothes.

484
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,830
I think you look good

485
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,680
like this.

486
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,660
Come on.

487
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,060
Liu Yan,

488
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,220
my friend saw Jiang Fang

489
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,060
near the cross-sea bridge.

490
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,860
Jiang Fang

491
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,420
has made her choice.

492
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,540
You...

493
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,340
Stay clear-headed.

494
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,620
Got it.

495
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,260
♪Pear blossoms fall♪

496
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,780
♪Into the mud in spring♪

497
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:41,830
♪They came just for one in this life♪

498
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,640
Salty.

499
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,460
Listen, I feel great today.

500
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,000
I just feel that today

501
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,380
I'll definitely see you.

502
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,220
And you appeared, right?

503
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,640
See? I feel so good now.

504
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,100
Do you still have money?

505
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,620
If you do, give me some.

506
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,060
If I go in, I can win back

507
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,660
- all I lost today.
- You lost it all.

508
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,610
I kept winning before, you know?

509
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,260
I won a lot of money.

510
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,660
All the money

511
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,770
I won...

512
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,420
Just come here.

513
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,900
- You keep losing.
- You...

514
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,820
You keep losing, Jiang Fang.

515
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,980
But

516
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,340
I won't lose forever, right?

517
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,180
I can always win.

518
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,960
I'm telling you.

519
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,140
I'm crazy.

520
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,820
I won so much money

521
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,140
but suddenly ran to the restroom.

522
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,990
Jiang Fang.

523
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,340
After I went to the bathroom...

524
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,420
Jiang Fang, look.

525
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,620
I haven't shown you this before, right?

526
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,670
I broke every bone

527
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,230
in my body

528
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,100
to clear your debts.

529
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,860
What game are you playing,

530
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,700
Jiang Fang?

531
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,400
I've worked so hard.

532
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,550
I put all in. Are you in or out?

533
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Too afraid to look, huh?

534
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,980
You know this.

535
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,550
You just don't dare to admit

536
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,220
that you know everything.

537
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,860
Why?

538
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,140
Why can't you just let me

539
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,820
have a little peace?

540
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,460
Don't give me that.

541
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,430
Just leave me alone, okay?

542
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,010
Leave me alone.

543
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,240
I know I'm no good.

544
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,100
I'm not even human.

545
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,260
Just leave me alone.

546
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,800
I'll handle it myself.

547
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,740
I handle everything myself.

548
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,580
Jiang Fang,

549
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
do you know?
In these ten years in Beijing,

550
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,530
every night I can't help

551
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,640
but ask myself one question.

552
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,420
If you knew

553
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,860
you only had two days left,

554
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,010
would you come to Beijing to get me?

555
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,050
I'm asking you right now.

556
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,370
If you knew

557
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,300
you only had two days left,

558
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,730
would you still treat me like this?

559
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,900
I...

560
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,700
I don't get it.

561
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,150
What are you saying?

562
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,260
Two days to live?

563
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,780
I can live for a long time,

564
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,660
and so can you.

565
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,270
We'll both live long

566
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,420
and get rich.

567
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,460
You're not sick, are you?

568
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,140
You're not sick, are you?

569
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,220
Salty is angry.

570
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,500
Salty is furious.

571
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,420
Salty, don't be mad.

572
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,540
I know, I know.

573
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,700
I know I've failed you.

574
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,620
I lost

575
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,900
all your money gambling.

576
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,990
But you know,

577
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,020
I could have won today.

578
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,420
I'm telling you.

579
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,610
The biggest win of my life

580
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,810
was at this place.

581
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,830
Not long ago,

582
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,480
they told me there would be a new table.

583
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,980
They always throw the game
with a new table.

584
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,380
I had a big chance to win,

585
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,670
so I went to see you.

586
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,020
- I wanted to win.
- Jiang Fang!

587
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,980
I'm not

588
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,740
that 12-year-old girl anymore.

589
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,690
Now, I'm a chef at Highland Restaurant.

590
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,420
I will become a sous chef.

591
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,420
Then I can support you.

592
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,760
I can pay for Li Zan's college.

593
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,990
I can do all that.

594
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,880
Jiang Fang,

595
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,500
stop fooling me

596
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,620
with your tricks, okay?

597
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,700
Salty,

598
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,140
I was wrong.

599
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,470
Please don't be like this.

600
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,020
You hurt my heart, Salty.

601
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,180
Salty, I'm telling you.

602
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,560
Leave me alone.

603
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,610
I'm an adult.

604
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,040
I have the responsibility, ability,

605
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,470
and obligation to take care of myself

606
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,220
- Don't give me that.
- and solve my issues.

607
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,120
Don't give me that.

608
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,060
Let's go.

609
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,890
- Where?
- To quit gambling.

610
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,320
- I don't want to.
- You can quit.

611
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,580
I can help you.

612
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,680
If I do, I'll never win it back.

613
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,860
Only if you quit can you win.

614
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,740
Don't you know that?

615
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,140
No, I can't quit.

616
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,980
Don't drag me.

617
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,580
I can't quit. I don't want to quit.

618
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,760
- You have to go.
- No.

619
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,460
I can't quit, Salty.

620
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,740
I really can't quit.

621
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,100
Salty,

622
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,100
are you going to send me

623
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,310
to a gambling addiction center?

624
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,850
I won't go. Listen, that place

625
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,710
is worse than prison.

626
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,180
- Really.
- I won't send you there.

627
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,040
I can help you.

628
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,400
Let's go home and quit, okay?

629
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,130
- Let's go.
- No.

630
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,970
There's no need to quit at home.

631
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,170
Choose between our home

632
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,420
and a gambling addiction center.

633
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,870
Then home it is.

634
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,260
Let's go home.

635
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,110
Wait a minute.

636
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,340
Promise me you won't send me

637
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,700
to a gambling addiction center.

638
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,620
You also have to promise me

639
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,270
you won't lie to me again.

640
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,820
I know you expected it

641
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,660
to be like this.

642
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,890
So, if you come preaching,

643
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,040
I don't want to hear it now.

644
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,730
No, I'm here to keep you company.

645
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,650
- Take this credit card.
- No.

646
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,260
- No need.
- You'll have to pay it back.

647
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,200
Jiang Fang must've spent

648
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,060
all your money.

649
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,220
Li Zan still needs to eat.

650
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,260
Thanks.

651
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,100
You're welcome.

652
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,380
You have to do me a favor.

653
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,060
Say it.

654
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,540
Li Zan can't live at home anymore.

655
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,640
Jiang Fang's situation

656
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,760
is affecting his studies.

657
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,320
You have to do me another favor.

658
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,460
Say it.

659
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,060
Come and live at my place.

660
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,500
Don't get me wrong.

661
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,800
I just thought of a way

662
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,840
to deal with Jiang Fang.

663
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,860
Right, I can also collect some evidence

664
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,410
for cohabitation.

665
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,740
Ms. He.

666
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,980
Thank you, Ms. He.

667
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,140
Please take care of Li Zan

668
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,070
for a while.

669
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,620
He has to stay a little longer.

670
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,620
Okay, don't worry.

671
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,310
Why did you kick me out?

672
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,640
Shouldn't she be the one to leave?

673
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,080
Enough, just stop it.

674
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,500
Jiang Fang can't quit.

675
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,730
Are you stupid?

676
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,140
You're the stupid one.

677
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,340
Since Jiang Fang came back,

678
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,350
you've skipped 47 classes

679
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,610
and missed 3 important exams.

680
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,540
Are you still going
to Peking University?

681
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,260
It's okay.

682
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,360
With Li Zan's grades,

683
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,050
Peking University is still very likely.

684
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,470
Listen.

685
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,420
Listen to what Ms. He

686
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,260
is saying.

687
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,110
Besides,

688
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,800
can you really keep Jiang Fang in check?

689
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,880
She should be sent
to a gambling addiction center.

690
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,000
If you mention that again,
I'll punch you.

691
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,100
She should be locked up there

692
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,100
forever.

693
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,500
She doesn't see you as her daughter,

694
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,460
nor as a person.

695
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,300
I...

696
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,100
Sis, you just punched me.

697
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,340
Sorry.

698
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,500
Ms. He, please take care

699
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,500
of my brother.

700
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,370
Li Zan, be good.

701
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,660
Listen to Ms. He.

702
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,820
Alright, let's go.

703
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,660
Bye.

704
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,380
You punched him so hard.

705
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,540
That brat didn't even dodge.

706
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,530
He's too fragile.

707
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,740
You still shouldn't punch him.

708
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,060
If he doesn't behave himself,

709
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,040
I won't have the energy
to deal with Jiang Fang.

710
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,070
If you want to try,

711
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,580
just try one.

712
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,980
Well...

713
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,300
Let's see if this works.

714
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,060
Harder.

715
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,580
I think this is too rough.

716
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,930
- Is it okay?
- It's sturdy.

717
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,380
Come and look here.

718
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,300
What?

719
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,340
Come here.

720
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,660
Alright.

721
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,940
Password.

722
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,820
Password.

723
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,540
Your birthday.

724
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,380
Mahjong.

725
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,260
Poker.

726
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,320
From now on,

727
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,900
we don't leave the table for 24 hours.

728
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,140
I quit.

729
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,540
Quit?

730
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,620
Don't. I'll play with you.

731
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,020
Salty, stop messing around.

732
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,700
What about your work
if you play with me?

733
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,620
When she's working,
I'll play with you, okay?

734
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,700
Uncle Lu,

735
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,820
did your law firm

736
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,620
go bankrupt?

737
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,260
You can't feed yourself, huh?

738
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,790
So you came here to freeload?

739
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,920
Listen, I'm a professional at lying.

740
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,060
Don't try to fool me.

741
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,900
- Okay?
- Stop it.

742
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,480
Verbal attacks won't work.

743
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,340
You have to win us over

744
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,380
with your gambling skills.

745
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,180
What is this?

746
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,500
We're playing games.

747
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,500
Salty,

748
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,580
didn't you promise to help me
quit gambling?

749
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,600
Why suddenly start playing games?

750
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,340
I figured it out.

751
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,860
You love gambling, right?

752
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,020
Let's gamble for fun.

753
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,100
You want to test me?

754
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,620
Salty, you don't understand me.

755
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,790
The thing

756
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,210
I can't stand the most is a test.

757
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,540
What game? How to play?

758
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,380
What are the rules?

759
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,900
No sleep

760
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,100
for six days.

761
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,590
If you win,

762
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,380
all the money on the card will be yours.

763
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,420
You can use it to win.

764
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,540
If you lose,

765
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,740
you follow my arrangements.

766
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,660
You have no money left.

767
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,660
Uncle Lu, thanks.

768
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,860
Wait a minute.

769
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,190
How do we calculate wins and losses

770
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,520
over these six days?

771
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,650
The same as usual.

772
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,180
We can keep score.

773
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,780
On the sixth day,

774
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,980
if you win,

775
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,920
the money on the card will be yours.

776
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,100
We'll also give you

777
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,440
all the money you win.

778
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,200
If you lose, I just need...

779
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,180
Follow my arrangements.

780
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,940
Come on, hurry up.

781
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,300
Uncle Lu, come on.

782
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,280
Hurry, shuffle the cards.

783
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,600
Uncle Lu, can you please help me

784
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,020
fill the kettle with hot water?

785
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,420
You have a lot of requests.

786
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,540
Do you want to play?

787
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,460
Just do it.

788
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,640
Do you know how to play Zha Jin Hua?

789
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,510
No.

790
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,950
- Blackjack?
- No.

791
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,340
Mini Pai Gow at least?

792
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,100
- No.
- How do you play then?

793
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,240
You can teach me.

794
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,390
You're learning now?

795
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,610
Make it simple

796
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,820
with our new menu this time.

797
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,010
Stop making it complicated.

798
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,420
Daxiang, come here.

799
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,600
How are you two doing at home?

800
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,140
(Liu Yan)

801
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,890
(Lu Tianchi)
Don't worry. We're still playing.

802
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,980
Uncle Lu,

803
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,700
did you offend someone

804
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
because of that last thing?

805
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,420
Two aces and an eight.

806
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,880
If you ask me, don't be so stubborn.

807
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,420
Go to Putai Group

808
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,340
and get back that 500,000 dollars.

809
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,440
Everyone will be happy.

810
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,060
Are you in? If not, I'll pay it.

811
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,180
Wait a minute.

812
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,900
Twenty.

813
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,860
Forty.

814
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,740
No more playing.

815
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,990
Let's change the place.

816
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,960
This place is unlucky.

817
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,380
You're cheating.

818
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,420
Shuffle.

819
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,100
If you ask me, Uncle Lu,

820
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,200
don't be too greedy.

821
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,140
500,000 dollars is not a small amount.

822
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,300
Look at yourself.

823
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,620
You've got nothing left.

824
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,700
You can only play cards

825
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,780
with me every day here.

826
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,980
How ridiculous.

827
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,020
I'm coming.

828
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,060
You're back.

829
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,500
Did you bring any goodies?

830
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,340
My turn.

831
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,160
Did you bring any goodies?

832
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,120
No.

833
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,420
He's crazy.

834
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,020
Come on, I'll play with you.

835
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,140
Salty,

836
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,940
tell me the truth.

837
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,520
What's going on between you

838
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,860
and Lu Tianchi?

839
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,740
Do you play?

840
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,940
Are you holding hands?

841
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,260
Oh, no.

842
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,020
Did you hug?

843
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,360
Did you kiss?

844
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,620
Look at me.

845
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,340
Did you do that?

846
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,100
What are you saying? No.

847
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,820
Listen, I'm here today

848
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,030
to spend three minutes

849
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,100
explaining

850
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,300
something necessary,

851
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,990
and then you can decide

852
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,940
whether to have me represent

853
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,060
the scammed victims here

854
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,170
to file a class action

855
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,540
against Putai Group.

856
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,560
Listen, Salty.

857
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,210
Now, you have three Seven Characters.

858
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,580
These three Seven Characters

859
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,100
can also act as a pair.

860
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,300
- I'm back.
- Remember that?

861
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,700
Then it's just one pair.

862
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,960
Come on, grab your tile.

863
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,140
I can't reach it.

864
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,540
Don't go. Listen to me.

865
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,620
- Hurry up and go.
- No.

866
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,120
- Listen.
- So sleepy.

867
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,520
She's very smart.

868
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,420
She's never learned

869
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,540
to play mahjong for these years.

870
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,920
After so many years,

871
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,700
you're one

872
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,540
of the few good players I've met.

873
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,660
However,

874
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,850
let me be blunt.

875
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,170
You can't marry my daughter.

876
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,770
What are you doing?

877
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,800
Collecting some evidence.

878
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,180
Help me brush my teeth.

879
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,600
Do you have to prove

880
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,980
our intimate relationship this way?

881
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,070
What are you saying?

882
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,120
Be clearer.

883
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,620
I can't hear what you're saying.

884
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,460
I...

885
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,010
I think this is more natural.

886
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,540
We don't have to hug or cuddle.

887
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,940
What are you doing?

888
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,780
But now...

889
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,860
The cards are dealt.

890
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,620
- Coming.
- Hurry.

891
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,620
(Jiang Fang,)

892
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,380
(have you heard about defeating magic)

893
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,220
(with magic?)

894
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,420
(You taught me how to cook before.)

895
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,540
(Now, I teach you how to quit gambling.)

896
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,580
(I'm not afraid to wait.)

897
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,550
(In my life,)

898
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,440
(the thing I fear least is waiting.)

899
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,580
(Come on.)

900
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,580
(Don't sleep.
Let's have one more round.)

901
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,640
You'll lose if you sleep.

902
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,740
I was looking at the cards.

903
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,200
- You just slept for one sec.
- No.

904
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,280
Even one sec means losing.

905
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,800
No, I'm keeping my eyes open.

906
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,190
I'm keeping my eyes open.

907
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,020
Bid. Three of diamonds.

908
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,060
I have three of diamonds.

909
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,460
You're losing.

910
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,060
Who bid? Who's the landlord?

911
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,060
I'm the landlord.

912
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,980
Play.

913
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,020
Landlord.

914
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,420
Three of diamonds.

915
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,460
Play your card.

916
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,980
Right.

917
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,900
Still want to gamble?

918
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,940
I'm going to sleep. No more playing.

919
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,100
No more playing.

920
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,020
Still want to gamble?

921
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,860
Don't gamble

922
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,820
