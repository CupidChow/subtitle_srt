15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,540
(Five years ago)

16
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,780
Looking good.

17
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,620
Come on. Okay.

18
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,020
Try this angle.

19
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,810
Three, two, one.

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,220
Let's take another shot.

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,100
Three, two, one.

22
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,220
Nice!

23
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,450
One more, just one more.

24
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,360
Ready.

25
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,330
Look at here.

26
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,940
Alright, all set.

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,860
Eyes on the camera.

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,930
Ready.

29
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,530
Three, two, one.

30
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,220
Beautiful.

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,460
Let's do one last photo.

32
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,410
Three, two, one!

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,300
Mrs. He.

34
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,100
Hello, welcome.

35
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,940
It's a great honor.

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,800
Please, have a seat.

37
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,010
Thanks. Appreciate it.

38
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,660
This place has real style.

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,480
It's absolutely stunning.

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,460
Thank you.

41
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,340
Mrs. He, about this year's
diamonds earning selection,

42
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,990
the results are about to be announced.

43
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,210
If Highland

44
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,580
gets Two Diamonds again this year,

45
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,760
that'll make it four years in a row.

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,780
Do you feel

47
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,740
it's already in the bag?

48
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,020
Actually, feeling confident

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,260
is more about mindset.

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,140
Believing brings success.

51
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,580
But for us, it's more than that.

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,940
Highland will definitely win again.

53
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,860
That's so bold.

54
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,340
Classic Mrs. He's style.

55
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,020
But I heard

56
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,460
you made a bold statement,

57
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,300
swore an oath,

58
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,860
saying that if Highland

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,860
can't earn diamonds,

60
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,020
it'll shut down for good.

61
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
Is that actually true?

62
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,740
You know,

63
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,660
a lot of food is made

64
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,740
for people who are hungry.

65
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,300
And some for those who aren't.

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,180
But at Highland,

67
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,420
we serve those who appreciate

68
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,380
truly perfect cuisine.

69
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,620
Our dishes

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,100
are only for those who get it.

71
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,100
So only a Highland with diamonds

72
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,620
deserves to stay open.

73
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,510
I really have no other choice.

74
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,140
It shows perfection

75
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,820
is your lifelong pursuit.

76
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,420
Now, from what I know,

77
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,060
you brought your son over from China

78
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,500
a few months ago.

79
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,500
I heard he's always been

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,060
talented in cooking.

81
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,380
Have you ever thought about

82
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,300
letting him

83
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,020
become Highland's head chef?

84
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,380
First, thank you for your kind words.

85
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,420
As his mother,

86
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,380
I know him best.

87
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,940
When Guangyuan was little,

88
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,020
he had a real knack

89
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,620
for making all kinds of food.

90
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,700
But running a restaurant

91
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,620
takes more than just that.

92
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,700
He still needs a lot

93
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,180
of other skills, too.

94
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,180
So I won't let him
be Highland's head chef.

95
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,740
We've communicated

96
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,340
this privately,

97
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,820
and he agreed that.

98
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,860
Now, to answer your question,

99
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,620
why did I bring him over here?

100
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,500
Since I joined Highland,

101
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,020
it's been almost seven years

102
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,860
since we last lived together.

103
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,300
I really missed him a lot.

104
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,500
I wanted us to be together

105
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,060
and share daily life every day.

106
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,060
That's why I brought him here.

107
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,300
Seven years is honestly

108
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,660
not a short amount of time.

109
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,060
I understand you completely.

110
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,660
Like you said earlier,

111
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,860
managing such a big restaurant

112
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,820
requires someone

113
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,820
with your boldness.

114
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,180
So I've also heard many legends

115
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,340
about you in the industry.

116
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,860
I have another question

117
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,020
I'd like to ask boldly.

118
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,100
Because I heard that a year ago,

119
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,420
you lost your sense of taste,

120
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,800
and now it's gotten worse,

121
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,220
requiring part of your tongue
to be removed

122
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,380
to save your life.

123
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
Is that true?

124
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,240
Lin.

125
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,420
Okay.

126
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,780
Don't worry about it.

127
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,660
It's okay.

128
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,340
At this moment, I particularly welcome

129
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,140
those who spread rumors

130
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,540
to come to Highland Restaurant

131
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,860
and appreciate our cuisine.

132
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,980
Instead of spreading rumors,

133
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,300
why not just trust

134
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,980
your own taste buds for once?

135
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,100
Alright, thank you.

136
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,100
That's it for today's interview.

137
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,990
Okay.

138
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,180
=Episode 14=

139
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Hello, Fabio.

140
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,140
Long time no see.

141
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,020
- Have you been in Italy?
- Yeah.

142
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,660
I've spent the last five years there.

143
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,580
I worked as a farmer for five years.

144
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,860
I lived in Positano the whole time.

145
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,780
Are you really not going
to cook anymore?

146
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,140
I'm still thinking about it.

147
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,140
Highland always welcomes you back.

148
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,660
Attention!

149
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,660
Today's diner, Fabio,

150
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
is the chef with the most diamonds
in the world.

151
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,580
He worked at 20 Black Pearl Restaurants.

152
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,620
He used to be
Highland Restaurant's head chef.

153
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,860
Today, he retired five years ago

154
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,120
and has returned to the culinary world.

155
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,820
Do your best. Don't let me down!

156
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,860
Yes, Chef.

157
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,620
So you're planning

158
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,740
to use this current menu

159
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,460
for this year's selection?

160
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,540
Yes.

161
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,220
You know what I mean, right?

162
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,300
The dishes are thoughtful

163
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,340
and warm.

164
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,060
But, He,

165
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,420
don't you think

166
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,900
it gets a bit boring?

167
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,780
We update the menu

168
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,140
every season.

169
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,860
You keep changing menus,

170
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,460
but it's always your mom's vision.

171
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,300
I've worked with her for so long.

172
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,820
Her Highland Restaurant was flawless.

173
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,700
But that was her idea of perfect,

174
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,220
not yours.

175
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,100
Is this trash or what?

176
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,420
Look at all this chocolate.

177
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,460
What even is this?

178
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,460
Fabio's waiting for this dessert.

179
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,460
So clueless!

180
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,540
Why are you still here?

181
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,020
No one's told you to leave yet?

182
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,900
I'd like to see someone try.

183
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,380
Total maniac.

184
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,060
Such a weirdo.

185
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,780
You took my stuff and wear it daily.

186
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,500
If I'm not wrong,

187
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,020
the next dish will be

188
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,740
Armandi chocolate mousse, right?

189
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,140
Fabio.

190
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,340
Fine by me.

191
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,900
At least I can taste a memory.

192
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,700
I'm visiting Mrs. He
at the cemetery tomorrow.

193
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,020
Do you want to come along?

194
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,860
Sorry, Fabio.

195
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,500
I've been so busy lately.

196
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,420
Mr. He, there's trouble in the kitchen.

197
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,780
You'd better check it out now.

198
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,640
Fabio,

199
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,900
I'll go check your dessert.

200
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,750
Wait a moment.

201
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,600
Alright.

202
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,820
Mr. He is here.

203
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,140
What happened to you?

204
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,460
Chef, what's going on?

205
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,580
I'm here to take back what's mine.

206
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,900
What about the dessert?

207
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,860
I'll give you ten minutes.

208
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,020
Within ten minutes,

209
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,860
Fabio's dessert must be served.

210
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,700
Fabio?

211
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,940
Is Fabio
the Highland's former head chef?

212
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,540
You have nine minutes left.

213
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,900
I'm almost done.

214
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,340
Ten minutes. That means starting over.

215
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,980
Curly,

216
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,540
lend me your apron.

217
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,380
Apron?

218
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,260
I need flour and sugar.

219
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,130
The ingredients are in the storage room.

220
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,180
The key is...

221
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,860
Not my problem.

222
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,100
Sis, I can help out.

223
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,180
I'll come with you.

224
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,300
Curly.

225
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,780
- Go get the crusher.
- Got it.

226
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,180
Matsuo, I need some rice.

227
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,660
Do you still have
that vanilla for desserts?

228
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,260
- Any salted lemon left?
- It's inside.

229
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,460
It's really late now.

230
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,860
Maybe I should head out first.

231
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Thanks for having me tonight.

232
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,540
Where's Armandi?

233
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,500
No idea.

234
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,980
- Fabio.
- No...

235
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,420
Let me try, let me taste it.

236
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,700
Fabio.

237
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,100
Sorry, this must be a mix-up.

238
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,580
Really, I apologize.

239
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,580
It's actually a funny coincidence.

240
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Tonight,

241
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,020
every single dish

242
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,660
is a copy of Mrs. He's recipes.

243
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,540
But this one stands out.

244
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,500
It feels so full of life,

245
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,180
simple, yet a bit rough.

246
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,620
There's a real passion for cooking.

247
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,580
It reminds me of the first time

248
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,700
I tasted your cheese mousse.

249
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,980
The technique was rough,

250
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,140
but it was special.

251
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,260
I really loved it.

252
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,900
That salty flavor

253
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,380
is totally unexpected.

254
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,500
You should try it yourself.

255
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,580
I'm telling you,

256
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,580
this is the cuisine you should do.

257
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,740
Only by doing this

258
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,900
can you achieve your own perfection

259
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,140
at Highland.

260
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,500
Why is that?

261
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,100
Philip took my things.

262
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,500
I came to take it back.

263
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,180
You could've asked me

264
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,260
for it.

265
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,580
You hit someone.

266
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,180
That can't be forgiven.

267
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,820
And what about what he did?

268
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,940
What did he do

269
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,260
that made you act out?

270
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,220
Last time, when Philip got hurt,

271
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,820
was she involved too?

272
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,060
So you planned it last time as well?

273
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,860
Planned what, exactly?

274
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,260
See for yourself.

275
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,420
Liu Yan, what's so funny?

276
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,620
Philip didn't pursue it last time.

277
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
But this time, he'll call the police.

278
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,140
Go ahead, call them now!

279
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,220
Philip and his friend

280
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,060
almost...

281
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,860
No surveillance, no evidence.

282
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,180
So no one cares,

283
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,300
Mr. He?

284
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,780
Manager, what did you tell me before?

285
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,060
Everyone, listen up.

286
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,340
Starting today,

287
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Philip is no longer

288
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,350
the head chef of Highland Restaurant.

289
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,580
- Mr. He...
- You're fired.

290
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,940
Mr. He,

291
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,400
is there some mistake here?

292
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,780
There's no mistake at all.

293
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,220
Leave. Right now.

294
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,380
Don't mess up my restaurant.

295
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,940
Don't dirty the food.

296
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,740
Your restaurant?

297
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,620
Isn't this Mrs. He's place?

298
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,180
It's been three years.

299
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Without me,

300
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,860
Highland would've shut down.

301
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,300
Get out.

302
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,380
You think people don't know?

303
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,500
You don't dare change the menu

304
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,420
because you can't create.

305
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,540
You don't dare let me change the menu

306
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,380
because you're afraid that at Highland,

307
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,540
I'll push you aside.

308
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,300
Everyone will see you're a loser.

309
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,180
Highland will never get a diamond.

310
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,580
Highland can't earn diamonds

311
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,500
because of chefs like Philip.

312
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,260
Fine.

313
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,340
Let's see what that unlucky guy

314
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
can do to help you.

315
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,380
Everyone, keep working.

316
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,700
Lin, come in with me.

317
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,580
About Philip,

318
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,020
did you always know the truth?

319
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,340
There was just no real proof.

320
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,460
Philip

321
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
has passwords
to all surveillance systems.

322
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,100
That night, he turned off all cameras.

323
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,960
I didn't dare speak up

324
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,900
because last month,

325
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,780
Highland was under inspection.

326
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,660
If this

327
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,900
got out,

328
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,700
it'd be too much for Highland.

329
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,340
I don't want trouble for Highland.

330
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,460
I'm deeply dissatisfied

331
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,580
with your work.

332
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,380
Please resign.

333
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,740
Mr. He,

334
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,620
I understand.

335
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,420
Maybe I didn't handle it well.

336
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,680
I'll make sure to do better next time.

337
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,500
Please improve elsewhere.

338
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,460
I can't just walk away from Highland.

339
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,780
Highland means everything to me.

340
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,020
Everything I do is for Highland.

341
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,940
I did all this

342
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,100
to protect Highland.

343
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,860
This isn't your first time

344
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,140
covering for Philip, right?

345
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,900
Remember that chef from Indonesia?

346
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,460
She was incredibly talented.

347
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,020
But she also left out of nowhere.

348
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,310
Was that Philip's doing too?

349
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,930
I believe I rationally

350
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,780
handled this for the greater good.

351
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,540
What greater good do you see?

352
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,380
The greater good is,

353
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,300
after Mrs. He passed away,

354
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,780
Highland was entirely held up

355
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,740
by me and Philip.

356
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,260
You're an idealist.

357
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,820
All you think about is earning diamonds.

358
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,300
Restaurants need income

359
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,620
to survive.

360
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,420
I'm the manager at Highland.

361
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,380
I have to see the bigger picture.

362
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,020
I can't just follow the moods.

363
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,340
You are no longer

364
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,100
the manager of Highland.

365
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,620
Please leave now.

366
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,650
Take care of yourself, Mr. He.

367
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,100
Du,

368
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,540
from today, you're the manager.

369
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,380
Me?

370
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Mr. He, I really can't...

371
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,460
I'm not asking.

372
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,820
What kind of place is this?

373
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,500
It's so flashy. Aren't you dizzy?

374
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,740
Finally, you're here.

375
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,780
You didn't reply to my messages.

376
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,500
You ignored my calls. Are you mad?

377
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,940
No.

378
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,540
I don't get upset that easily.

379
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,380
I just

380
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,180
had some stuff to take care of.

381
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,380
- So, all done?
- All done.

382
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,660
I'm back working at Highland now.

383
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm a junior chef there now.

384
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,460
Congratulations, Liu Yan.

385
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,860
You got promoted right away at Jaya.

386
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,660
That's something to celebrate.

387
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,620
Let's celebrate tonight with Lu.

388
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,380
Better not.

389
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,580
Highland told you

390
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,460
about Lu Tianchi

391
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,340
hitting Philip, right?

392
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,980
I saw the surveillance too.

393
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,660
That punch was so weak.

394
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,740
He clearly didn't engage core strength

395
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,460
when punching.

396
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,900
That punch was limp.

397
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,140
If he'd used proper force,

398
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,860
would it have lasted that long?

399
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,780
He would've ended it instantly.

400
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,740
Liu Yan,

401
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,100
Lu Tianchi almost

402
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,620
went back to jail over this.

403
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,940
It's just a fight, what's the big deal?

404
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,900
It's different for him.

405
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,260
He has a record in Jaya.

406
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,260
It's all stuff from the past.

407
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,860
I wasn't planning to tell you.

408
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,060
But since you're back,

409
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,500
you've been ignoring Lu Tianchi.

410
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,020
I figured I should let you know.

411
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,600
Your business with him is yours.

412
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,620
You don't have to tell me.

413
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,460
Don't.

414
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,340
Maybe I should say it.

415
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,340
Alright, go ahead.

416
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,300
So he spent two years in prison for you.

417
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,180
This time,

418
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,540
he really took a big risk

419
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,940
to hit Philip.

420
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,420
Luckily, Philip

421
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,380
didn't press charges.

422
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,980
Otherwise, if Lu Tianchi went in again,

423
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,340
he might not get out for years.

424
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,220
No wonder you two are so close.

425
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,820
That's a bond for life.

426
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,060
Are you not following

427
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,100
what I'm saying?

428
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,540
As for Lu Tianchi,

429
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
he's not really my type.

430
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
But to me,

431
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,620
he really is special.

432
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,860
You get what I mean, right?

433
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,540
So when he got out

434
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,580
of prison back then,

435
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,940
I thought being with him

436
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,500
would happen naturally.

437
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,380
Plus,

438
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,300
you know me,

439
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,820
I never miss my mark.

440
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,420
But

441
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,140
he's just impossible to crack.

442
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
He turned me down again and again.

443
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,980
To him, I'm just another client.

444
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,220
You two never dated?

445
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,540
Fine, I admit it.

446
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,300
I did make it seem like

447
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,540
there was some chemistry

448
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,380
between me

449
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,860
and Lu Tianchi.

450
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,980
You were a client I introduced to him.

451
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,700
I didn't get my commission.

452
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,220
Then you two hit it off.

453
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,460
Honestly, I was pretty shocked.

454
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,660
Did he tell you we liked each other?

455
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,020
Isn't it obvious?

456
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,140
Uncle Lin and I both noticed.

457
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,130
After Lu Tianchi met you,

458
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,060
he's changed a lot.

459
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,460
Let me tell you,

460
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,900
the lights are so dim now,

461
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,220
but your face is really red.

462
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,220
No, it's...

463
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,460
It's just the lights.

464
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,140
- See for yourself.
- It's the lights.

465
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,100
See for yourself!

466
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,020
Come in.

467
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,460
What did Jason say?

468
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,380
He wants all kitchen staff

469
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,500
replaced with his people.

470
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,740
That's not possible.

471
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,300
Mr. He,

472
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,860
there's something I need to say.

473
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,500
These are my daily work notes

474
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,660
for my past nine years

475
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,060
at Highland.

476
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,380
I don't know

477
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,670
if you recall that one time,

478
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,980
when Mrs. He got upset over beef

479
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,820
and locked you in the cold room.

480
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,500
Since that day,

481
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,260
Highland has never had

482
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,100
another sous chef.

483
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,540
Back then, I didn't accept it.

484
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,020
Because in the six years

485
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,500
before you quit cooking,

486
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,020
every dish you made

487
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,740
proved you knew exactly

488
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,500
the kind of cuisine you wanted.

489
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,260
The only thing unclear was

490
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,140
that Mrs. He's perfect

491
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,700
wasn't your perfect.

492
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,700
I just want you to know,

493
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
you're fully qualified

494
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,260
to be Highland's head chef.

495
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,540
Try it yourself.

496
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Why?

497
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,060
Let me tell you,

498
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,100
you don't understand me!
How did you fry this?

499
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,020
You cooked it with no flavor at all.

500
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,350
Lost your sense of smell? Take it!

501
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,500
Remember what I just said.

502
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,820
Remember it, okay?

503
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,380
Perfect. Everything must be perfect.

504
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,300
No!

505
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,660
There's too much soup!

506
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,460
Make it again!

507
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,340
What a waste.

508
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,180
You really don't understand

509
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,460
what I am saying.

510
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,740
Do you even know

511
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,220
what I want?

512
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
Honestly, you simply

513
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,700
don't know how to cook.

514
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,460
Not even a little.

515
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,820
Okay, okay.

516
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,780
Even if you are stupid...

517
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,940
Okay.

518
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,620
I'll show you right here.

519
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,060
Just copy what I do.

520
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,580
Just a little bit will do.

521
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,100
You'd nail it easily.

522
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,380
But you just can't.

523
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,100
You still don't get it!

524
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,940
Honestly, I really regret it.

525
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,900
I regret it so much.

526
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,460
Bringing you to Jaya was a mistake.

527
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,540
Actually, you should have

528
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,860
stayed with your dad,

529
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,140
hiding on that mountain.

530
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,580
Just cook for folks who have no taste

531
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,940
and no real standards at all.

532
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,100
Just make food for them.

533
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
You'd be a diamond there.

534
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,260
I'm telling you,

535
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,820
if I weren't at Highland,

536
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,100
you would be

537
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,020
nothing at all here.

538
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,540
I know you hate hearing this,

539
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,140
but I have to be honest with you.

540
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
That's just who you are.

541
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,020
Don't think just because I had you,

542
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,180
you were born to be a chef.

543
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,380
You have no idea

544
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,500
what perfection really means.

545
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Or else you wouldn't have made

546
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,900
something that tastes this bad.

547
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
You don't have it in you.

548
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,460
You'll never

549
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,860
become a real head chef.

550
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,140
If I'm ever gone,

551
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,140
I'd rather shut Highland down

552
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,700
than watch you ruin it.

553
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,500
Guess what,

554
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,700
I...

555
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,660
I put on

556
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,140
my junior chef's outfit today.

557
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,380
I'm not a kitchen helper anymore.

558
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,900
See, I told you.

559
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,900
I knew one day

560
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,020
you would be discovered

561
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,500
by someone with vision.

562
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,580
Sorry for standing you up.

563
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,740
Why are you saying this?

564
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,380
It made me stammer.

565
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,900
I appreciate the sentiment.

566
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,980
But in the future,

567
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,580
don't ever do things

568
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,100
like pawning stuff.

569
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,270
Alright.

570
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,080
I have to show the house.

571
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,300
So I'll talk to you later.

572
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,140
Take care.

573
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,060
I'm hanging up.

574
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,260
Highland has no head chef this time.

575
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,020
Earning diamonds is tough again.

576
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,060
What I fear is Mr. He going crazy

577
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,780
and then making us
work overtime every day.

578
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,460
I can't keep up with that pace.

579
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,740
The fastest solution is

580
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,700
to poach someone
from a rival restaurant.

581
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,580
You think rival restaurants

582
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,490
have the talent we need?

583
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,080
Honestly, Kanta should be the head chef.

584
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,100
I'm totally on board with that.

585
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,540
Kanta's got years of experience.

586
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,350
Back when he joined here,

587
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,460
no one even knew who Philip was

588
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,300
or where he was.

589
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,780
Kanta, if you become head chef,

590
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,260
please let me be your assistant.

591
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,100
Is that okay?

592
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,540
Come on, hurry up.

593
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,180
Announcement.

594
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,420
Today is the 982nd day Highland

595
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,700
has lost the diamond rating.

596
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,740
Starting today,

597
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,460
I'll be the head chef

598
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,700
and work together with all of you

599
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,220
to bring Highland back to its prime.

600
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,180
That's awesome!

601
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,100
Morning, Mr. He.

602
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,820
Mr. He,

603
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,980
can I bother you for a second?

604
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,080
Pastry Chef said

605
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,220
that the salted pudding on the menu

606
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,900
has your signature seasoning.

607
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,620
I tried it myself.

608
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,980
The flavor's really unique.

609
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,220
I tried several times at home

610
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,660
to recreate that flavor,

611
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,620
but I couldn't do it.

612
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,820
Besides the original

613
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,100
lemon aroma,

614
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,140
I also noticed

615
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,540
another kind of fruit aroma.

616
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,540
So I tried persimmon, peach,

617
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,380
and apricot.

618
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,220
I think it's probably

619
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,420
processed apricot.

620
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,700
Here's how I handled it.

621
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,820
First, I candied it.

622
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,750
Then I used two kinds of dry spices

623
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,620
to marinate the fruit.

624
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,580
No need to candy them.

625
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,380
Jaya's local apricots

626
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,260
already have rich flavors.

627
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,580
You should learn to pick methods

628
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,260
based on local ingredients.

629
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,940
No need to candy them.

630
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,820
Liu Yan, you certainly

631
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,060
have talent in cooking.

632
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,700
And you use flavor memory well.

633
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,420
But you still can't

634
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,500
become a top chef.

635
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,140
Is there something I'm missing?

636
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,340
I can work harder.

637
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,340
There are two kinds of food.

638
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,060
One is for people who are hungry,

639
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,460
the other is for those who aren't.

640
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,060
Highland makes the second kind.

641
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,860
You want to stay at Highland, right?

642
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,820
First, try to understand Highland.

643
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,340
If you want to understand Highland,

644
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,460
start by thinking about what I said.

645
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,780
Thank you, Mr. He.

646
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,060
(Peach; Asian Pear; Colored Pepper. V;
Crabapple; Beetroot Vinegar)

647
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,020
Miss Liu.

648
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,620
Sorry to bother you.

649
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,660
I'd like to ask you for a favor,

650
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,620
just a personal request.

651
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,620
Go ahead.

652
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,220
Mr. Luo hasn't been well lately.

653
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,020
He can't eat or sleep well.

654
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,940
He keeps telling me

655
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,300
about his past in Beijing.

656
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,460
No wonder.

657
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,740
He hasn't been back in years.

658
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,340
After you cooked for Mr. Luo last time,

659
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,700
he kept talking about it for days.

660
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,460
I want to ask you a favor.

661
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,100
Could you make it for him again?

662
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,460
No problem.

663
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,340
Alright.

664
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,500
Let's put this aside for now.

665
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,540
It smells amazing.

666
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,780
Come on, try it.

667
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,340
I'm...

668
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,180
I'm just a sucker

669
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,460
for noodles.

670
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,180
Luckily, I proofed some dough

671
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,080
in the fridge last night.

672
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,580
Dough proofed overnight

673
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,780
has the best texture.

674
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,820
Noodles without garlic

675
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,820
lose half the joy.

676
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,380
There's garlic too.

677
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,380
The noodles are chewy and tasty.

678
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,460
Of course they are.

679
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,460
How is it in the kitchen

680
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,460
of that luxury hotel?

681
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
Honestly, the pressure is intense.

682
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,300
But working together with everyone

683
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,700
and striving to earn diamonds

684
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,100
feels pretty rewarding too.

685
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,980
As long as you're happy.

686
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
There's dessert too.

687
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,980
Let me get you some almond tofu.

688
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,780
And here's the sauce.

689
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,740
You could tweak the ratio of white wine.

690
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,860
I want to update the old recipe.

691
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,100
But Mrs. He decided on this recipe.

692
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,460
Is it okay to change it, Chef?

693
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,300
Besides...

694
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,220
I want to try a different wine.

695
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,020
How about testing with Huangjiu?

696
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,860
When I was a kid,
my mom made snapper for me.

697
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,900
She used Huangjiu.

698
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,780
Curly, bring me a bottle of Huangjiu.

699
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,820
Adding Huangjiu?

700
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,890
You really think outside the box.

701
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,900
Can I have a taste?

702
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,860
I think adding a bit
to the original sauce

703
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,700
will do.

704
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,620
Curly.

705
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,300
Here you go.

706
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,150
Tastes amazing.

707
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,180
Liu Yan, you're incredible.

708
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,020
So good.

709
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:46,940
It smells great.

710
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,860
The aroma hits you right away.

711
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
You're so good.

712
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,330
A real genius.

713
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,780
(I thought a top chef)

714
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,060
(just needs to make tasty food.)

715
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,020
(Mr. Luo has eaten)

716
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,020
(all kinds of delicious food.)

717
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,580
(Yet a simple bowl
of noodles with savory sauce)

718
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,660
(made him fall asleep.)

719
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
(But I think I just
figured something out.)

720
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,940
(The food made by a top chef)

721
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,140
(should have the power to heal.)

722
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,900
Miss,

723
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,060
the person you are looking for
hasn't returned yet.

724
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,940
I promise I'll send you a message

725
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,060
when she comes back.

726
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,260
It's okay.

727
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,100
Is room 403

728
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,340
occupied now?

729
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,470
Thank you.

730
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,240
Don't come out until I call you.

731
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,540
Hurry up!

732
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,940
Be quick, move!

733
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,070
Once I find a job,

734
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,550
I promise I'll pay you all back.

735
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,020
I'm not someone who dodges debt.

736
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,700
You... Go back!

737
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,460
