We're taking a photo.

18
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,780
Can you tone it down a bit?

19
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,980
Just be a little more reserved.

20
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,630
Don't be so tacky. Come on.

21

There are glasses over there.
Put them on.

No, don't pose like that.

Come on, front face, hurry up.

This one's good. Check it out.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,750
You look like an office lady.

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,700
It's different from the past.

00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,080
What is this mess?

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,770
You want great service,

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,590
but you want to pay less.

32
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,630
I'm the most reliable here.

33
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,480
What more do you want?

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,690
You didn't capture

35
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,370
my executive woman boss's aura.

36
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,100
I've checked it all for you.

37
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,400
That little rich kid from Singapore,

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,510
at most,

39
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,160
is just a worker in a family business.

40
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,490
You're probably just after

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,820
a temporary meal ticket.

42
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,480
It seems even an expert hunter

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,790
can have off days.

44
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,760
Do you still need these photos?

45
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,060
Alright, alright.

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,590
We've got half an hour left.

47
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,080
Looks like these photos aren't needed.

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,390
- Let me buy you a drink, okay?
- Sure.

49
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,530
I'm a reasonable person.

50
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,460
Half an hour's enough
to look over

51
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,430
the prenup, right?

52
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,340
I'm not the type to quit

53
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,480
before lining up my next job.

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,630
Don't pack up your camera.

55
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,790
I'm going to change my clothes.

Why are you thinking about

57
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,190
marriage all of a sudden?

58
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,760
Go change in the bathroom.

59
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,080
Do you want to come in?

60
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,960
Like hell I will.

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,840
Come on.

62
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,780
What are you shy of?

63
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,170
Change later, really.

64
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,160
If you want to look, just say it.

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,100
Just zip it, will you?

66
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,480

69

Miss Tang, what do you want

70
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,620
from the inheritance?

71
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,470
What else could it be?

72
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,880
I wish I could care about

73
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,760
true love instead.

74
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,790
But you've always been like this.

75
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,010
Do you feel at ease with this?

76
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,250
Then I'll stay with you.

77
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,710
Being with you feels so right.

78
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,420
Let's head back.

79
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,300
Step back.

80
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,550
Lu Tianchi, I really don't care

81
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,040
if others say I'm a gold digger.

82
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,830
I just want what I deserve.

83
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,460
Having money really can

84
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,380
give me security.

85
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,330
The more money you have,

86
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,950
the more secure

87
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,830
you feel.

88
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,060
No need to

89
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,900
try persuading me.

90
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,790
Keep taking the photos.

91
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,060
That's enough, come see for yourself.

92
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,960
So many shots.

93
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,180
Let me take a look.

94
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,720
Lu Tianchi, do you really not consider

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,030
becoming a professional

96
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,340
flat photographer?

97
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,920
Or only when you shoot me

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,780
do you get inspired?

99
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,140
This looks amazing.

100
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,410
Me?

101
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,090
I can help you

102
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,130
by doing some research.

103
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,100
But when it comes to their character,

104
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,380
you have to find out on your own.

105
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,780
This one's not bad either.

106
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,740
How to star it?

107
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,010
Hurry up and pick. Once you're done,

108
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,860
just leave.

109
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,550

114

in the dead of night.

Every other day,

169
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,980
he brings in some odd people,

and not have to see him anymore.

192
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,580
It's not that easy.

193
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,960
These past few months,

194
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,060
we've only had some online sales.

195
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,670
The shop's barely getting any business.

196
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,620
Let me do a livestream for you sometime.

197
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,250
The sales will

198
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,580
easily go up.

199
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,190
What are those two talking about?

200
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,720
So long.

201
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,150
You eat instant noodles every day

202
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,010
and drink so much.

203
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,920
That's really not healthy.

204
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,780
Don't act close,
it's none of your business.

205
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,880
I just want to meet Mr. Luo

206
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,050
to discuss repaying.

207
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,260
He probably wants money, right?

208
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,020
The money isn't little,

209
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,010
but it's not enough to see you.

210
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,900
But the problem is

211
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,100
he's got my passport.

212
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,080
If I don't see him,
I can't get back to Beijing.

213
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,560
What kind of stupid rules are these?

214
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,800
Sending people every day
to collect debts,

215
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,010
but not meeting.

216
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,650
I'm warning you.

217
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,420
Don't go labeling Mr. Luo

218
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,400
as some kind of gangster.

219
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,230
Jaya's nothing like China,
it's wild here.

220
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,130
I checked online last night.

221
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,180
What's written online is terrifying.

222
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,260
What's so scary?

223
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,670
They wrote that...

224
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,900
What that?

225
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,420
I told you to keep it down.

226
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,250
Even if you catch a cold,

227
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,640
just search online, you'll freak out.

228
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,500
You just want money, right?

229
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,080
I'll pay you.

230
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,670
Isn't money all you care about?

231
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,620
First, pay my rent,

232
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,820
then leave quickly, okay?

233
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,780
You shouldn't stay here long.

234
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,540
Then help me find a place

235
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
where I can stay long.

236
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,010
Sure, go find Miss Tang Shuangshuang.

237
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,250
She's really good at

238
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,620
taking care of my female customers.

239
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,450
Alright then.

240
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,660
Mr. Lu,

241
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,290
what about Mr. Luo?

242
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,220
Maybe you could return my savings.

243
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,890
Mr. Lu,

244
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,430
I'll wait for your update, then.

245
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,710
I'm heading out.

246
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,520
Waiting for your message.

247
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,690
Finished talking so fast?

248
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,780
Miss Tang,

249
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,280
well,

250
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,140
Mr. Lu said

251
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,450
he highly recommends you.

252
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,710
He said you take good care

253
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,630
of all his female customers.

254
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,550
I'd like to ask you to help me

255
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,060
find a place to stay. Is that okay?

256
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,450
Lu said that?

257
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,740
If he said it,

258
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,980
I'll consider it.

259
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,070
But no matter what happens,

260
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,450
you can't stay here.

261
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,820
Except for Lu,

262
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,780
I really don't know anyone

263
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,140
who likes to take in refugees.

264
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,020
Let me ask,
didn't you stay alone yesterday?

265
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,640
Yes, my... brother was here.

266
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,060
You have a brother?

267
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,560
And the rent

268
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,480
might have to be owed first.

269
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,940
We don't seem

270
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,720
that familiar.

271
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,880
Oh my god.

272
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,420
Go move stuff.

273
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,060
And this rent is too high.

274
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,680
Did you get scammed?

275
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,700
Only people with options

276
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,920
or money worry about being scammed.

277
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,430
What can she scam me out of?

278
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,200
Even if the rent is a bit high,

279
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,150
I haven't paid yet.

280
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,760
Can you not pay?

281
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,610
How about this?

282
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,180
I won't take advantage of you.

283
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,320
Rent split half and half.

284
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,390
A dung beetle is clinging
to a railroad track

285
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,550
pretending to be a big rivet.

286
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,240
I won't split with a minor.

287
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,120
What are you looking for?

288
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,260
Missing a dining table.

289
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,180
This dump,

290
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,770
is it only missing a dining table?

291
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,070
For living places,

292
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,820
the dining table is most important.

293
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,660
Don't you understand?

294
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,300
There's an ironing board inside.

295
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,130
Take that out

296
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,150
and use it as the dining table.

297
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,510
I don't need a desk, okay?

298
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,540
No way.

299
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,110
People who make do with eating

300
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,310
won't stand up in life.

301
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,020
You really learned a lot of nonsense

302
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,580
from Jiang Fang.

303
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,720
I'll pay the rent.

304
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,990
If I say we need something, we need it.

305
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,020
Then,

306
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,140
you handle the rent,

307
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,210
and I'll sort out

308
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,900
the dining table.

309
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,150
Deal.

310
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,870
Put it here.

311
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,100
Put this in the inner room.

312
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,120
Jiang Fang's mahjong table

313
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,140
is finally doing something useful.

314
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,820
Looks good.

315
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,490
This will be our dining table.

316
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,910
I'm hungry now.

317
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,940
Let's make something to eat.

318
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,940
But there's no food here.

319
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,900
I'll make you this instead.

320
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,340
What is it?

321
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,450
Ever tried honeycomb candy?

322
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,100
Yes, I have.

323
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,180
Jiang Fang made it.

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,930
It's almost done, right?

325
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,590
Almost. Didn't you already try it?

326
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,790
You are truly Jiang Fang's daughter.

327
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,190
You know everything she knows.

328
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,100
Try it later,

329
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,120
see if it tastes the same.

330
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,660
Take a look.

331
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,140
It's really pretty.

332
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,640
Go ahead, eat it.

333
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,470
Break off a piece.

334
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,020
Give it a try.

335
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,100
Is it the same

336
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,940
as Jiang Fang's?

337
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,580
I mean,

338
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,290
if it's the same, are you sad?

339
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,190
Or

340
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,200
if it's different, are you sad?

341
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,050
Is it because my life

342
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,230
has been too tough lately?

343
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,090
I haven't had anything good to eat.

344
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,180
Why do I feel this thing you made

345
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,420
tastes better than Jiang Fang's?

346
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,250
Pretty good, right?

347
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,210
You recognize this?

348
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,910
This is...

349
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,630
what your mom left behind.

350
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,280
She said it was a token for you.

351
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,420
I ate the candy.

352
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,990
She got mad at me then.

353
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,940
She left in a hurry.

354
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,440
I didn't get to give it to her.

355
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,560
I've kept it all this time.

356
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,980
I couldn't return it to her.

357
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,890
So I'll give it back to you.

358
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,080
That I'll eat more.

359
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,860
Wait,

360
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,340
you're not eating anymore?

361
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,460
If you don't eat,

362
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,730
I'll finish it all.

363
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,000
(Jiang Fang,)

364
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,650
(at least you have a conscience.)

365
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,690
(You didn't throw this ring away.)

366
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,840
(You once said this was)

367
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,360
(our token for next meeting.)

368
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,430
(Now the ring holder is still here.)

369
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,960
(Where are you?)

370
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,540
(Let me tell you,)

371
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,430
(even if I have to search all of Jaya,)

372
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,440
(I'll find you.)

373
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,900
- God!
- Why didn't you reply?

374
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,570
What's wrong with you?

375
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,430
I've sent it so many times.

376
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,660
Honestly, you're the first person

377
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,890
who makes me not even want the money.

378
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,390
I have no money, no passport,

379
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,240
and no job either.

380
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,800
I really have to see Mr. Luo now.

381
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,320
I can't pay off this debt anytime soon,

382
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,290
so I need to talk to him.

383
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,270
I'll work out a solution

384
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,110
to this problem.

385
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,840
Otherwise, I can't stay in Jaya.

386
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,680
How am I supposed

387
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,300
to find my mom then?

388
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,700
Look,

389
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,060
even when I got someone's mom

390
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,140
out of that place,

391
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,030
you managed to help me out.

392
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,000
So let's go find Mr. Luo.

393
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,940
Uncle Li!

394
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,800
I think you can do it.

395
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,190
You got this.

396
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,710
Uncle Li, can you open the door?

397
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,050
Dr. Chen, long time no see.

398
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,820
Emily!

399
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,200
Mr. Lu,

400
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,900
try this latte.

401
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,750
How is it?

402
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,940
I just learned to make it.

403
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,970
It's really good.

404
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,330
So good, really nice.

405
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,490
Who's this?

406
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,180
No idea.

407
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,040
Please sign in.

408
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,830
Why is this wire still here?

409
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,370
- Where's Uncle Kun?
- No clue.

410
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,060
Let me handle it.

411
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,990
Thanks.

412
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,700
Uncle Cheng, playing chess again?

413
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,850
Is your knee any better?

414
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,520
A bit better.

415
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,920
Walk less and keep it aligned.

416
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,860
Apply some strength.

417
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,900
Alright, be careful.

418
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,310
See you later.

419
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,220
Okay.

420
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,580
Aunt Zhang,

421
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,860
slow down. I'll go with you.

422
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,220
I'm learning from you.

423
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,010
You're impressive.

424
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,560
Here, this is for you.

425
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,970
You should've

426
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,870
emailed me first.

427
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,740
This is

428
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,620
my will.

429
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,600
That's a big deal.

430
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,820
A big deal.

431
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,660
I know.

432
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,870
That's why I brought it to you.

433
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,470
Here's your travel allowance.

434
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,560
Thank you.

435
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,070
- You're welcome.
- Thanks a lot.

436
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,720
Sir, did you read it clearly?

437
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,390
It's only two pages. That's odd.

438
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,230
Don't get scammed.

439
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,430
Sir, he's messing with you.

440
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,570
You really shouldn't sign this.

441
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,220
Take me back to my room.

442
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,060
Let's go.

443
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,220
No, he's confused now.

444
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,550
You're even scamming his money?

445
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,400
Wait for me.

446
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,360
I'll get the wheelchair.

447
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,200
Alright.

448
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,180
The elderly, weak, sick, and disabled
all need seats

449
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,210
given to them on the bus.

450
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,240
You just keep targeting everyone.

451
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,760
He's the only one left in his family.

452
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,110
You won't even spare someone alone?

453
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,060
Signing the will is meant

454
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,480
to make him feel like
he still has family.

455
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,700
Truly confused.

456
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,340
You unscrupulous lawyer.

457
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,720
Here you are. Come to get money.

458
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,930
Let me tell you.

459
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,360
You show up on the 20th every month.

460
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,270
Every month.

461
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,820
Holidays, Chinese New Year, birthdays...

462
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,980
Endlessly making wills.

463
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,390
All that for a little travel allowance.

464
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,180
Aren't you feeling guilty?

465
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,070
You're eyeing Grandpa Deng's apartment,

466
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,340
aren't you?

467
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,290
Last week's complaint
was your doing, wasn't it?

468
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,940
If you're so capable, earn more money.

469
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,060
Pay up and get your dad a new room.

470
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,470
I'm telling you,

471
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,620
in the nursing home contract,

472
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,520
it's written clearly

473
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,580
that healthy seniors

474
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,260
can't stay with those
with mental illness.

475
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,720
Don't point randomly.

476
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,650
I could sue you for slander.

477
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,130
I've told you so many times, right?

478
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,180
He's currently in a period

479
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,510
of restricted civil capacity.

480
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,260
But his mind is clear,
and he's independent.

481
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,840
How could he be considered mentally ill?

482
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,660
He totally fits the criteria
to stay here.

483
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,480
Right, Emily?

484
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,390
Yes, that's true.

485
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,340
Now Grandpa Deng

486
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,740
only trusts Mr. Lu.

487
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:53,930
And Mr. Lu

488
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,660
has never taken a cent.

489
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,010
As long as Mr. Lu visits every month,

490
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,290
Grandpa Deng is

491
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,260
very happy here, right?

492
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,360
He's not even his son,

493
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,230
nor his guardian.

494
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,620
Why do you care who I am?

495
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,500
Young man, no need to lose your cool.

496
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,920
Your hair's already turning white.

497
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,140
What are you talking about?

498
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,560
You help people so much.

499
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,230
Why not lend me a hand, too?

500
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,030
I even saved your life.

501
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,160
Anyway,

502
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,040
don't go find Mr. Luo.

503
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,500
Fine, if you won't help,

504
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,450
I'll try my luck myself.

505
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,380
Do you know the hometown club?

506
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,790
Among the guys asking for money before,

507
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,100
someone was wearing their T-shirt.

508
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,570
That's Mr. Luo's turf, right?

509
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,540
Say something.

510
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,930
Are you two-faced or what?

511
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,140
I saw you

512
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,430
chatting happily with that nurse.

513
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,080
And Emily...

514
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
Are you losing your mind?

515
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,150
Let me tell you,

516
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,000
it was your mom who offended Mr. Luo.

517
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,970
It has nothing to do with you.

518
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,650
Be smart and run away.

519
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,580
Okay?

520
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,180
Alright, I'm leaving.

521
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,260
You're the one losing your mind!

522
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,960
Who are you looking for?

523
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,780
Who exactly?

524
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,860
Who are you here for?

525
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,080
Two nines.

526
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,140
Alright.

527
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,090
Okay.

528
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,840
Is this the hometown club?

529
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,060
I'm looking for Mr. Luo.

530
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,320
You said you're here for Mr. Luo?

531
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,410
2341!

532
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,640
Why did you show up?

533
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,460
Missed you.

534
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,820
It's been a while,

535
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,910
4543.

536
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,990
Before I die,

537
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,190
I should see you at least once.

538
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,500
This looks good.

539
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,510
Your hair is even better.

540
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,410
Great hairstyle.

541
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,360
Are you Mr. Luo?

542
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm...

543
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,970
Aren't you leaving?

544
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,370
Who's she?

545
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,700
What does she need from Mr. Luo?

546
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,860
It's nothing, actually, she...

547
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,910
I... I owe money.

548
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,700
Is she your friend?

549
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,600
I'm...

550
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,170
I'm an important client of Mr. Lu.

551
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,820
I have to see Mr. Luo today.

552
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,380
I have something very important

553
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,340
to tell him.

554
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,860
Lots of people owe him money.

555
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,540
If I take everyone to see him,

556
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,440
what would be left for me?

557
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,980
If you can't explain yourself,

558
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,920
just pay the money back.

559
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,050
- Yes, I want to pay.
- Stop talking!

560
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,730
But I really can't pay right now.

561
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,530
If you want to pay,

562
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,680
how could you not be able to do so?

563
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,060
Men do the heavy work,

564
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,460
and women...

565
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,940
join other gigs.

566
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,120
What's "join other gigs"?

567
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,920
Since you're 4543's friend,

568
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,060
you should just leave now.

569
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
But I really want

570
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,730
to see Mr. Luo.

571
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,760
I'm sorry.

572
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,660
I really do...

573
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,570
Alright, that's enough.

574
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,500
Next!

575
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,430
Come on, let's go.

576
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,270
What's up with you?

577
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
You're already here.

578
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,550
If you won't help, don't make it worse.

579
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,380
How am I making it worse?

580
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,660
I just saved you.

581
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,860
Let's get moving.

582
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,170
What does 4543 mean?

583
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,540
It doesn't mean much.

584
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,940
It's my student number.

585
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,780
That guy's my senior.

586
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,700
Lu Tianchi,

587
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,530
what do you actually do?

588
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,070
Why so serious all of a sudden?

589
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,440
Not going to say, huh?

590
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,570
Registered athletes can be looked up.

591
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,140
Registered lawyers definitely can too.

592
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,030
Come on, is it really necessary?

593
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,080
Did my business card say I'm a lawyer?

594
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,130
What do you mean, aren't you a lawyer?

595
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,950
You've been lying to me?

596
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,580
What did I lie about?

597
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,580
Those guests called me "lawyer".

598
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,350
That means they respect my job.

599
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,580
If you don't want to pay,

600
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,560
find another reason, will you?

601
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,020
You're really something.

602
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,690
No, what are you actually up to?

603
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,090
Have you been in jail?

604
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,800
You were all buddy-buddy

605
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,180
with that guy in the white suit.

606
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,320
He doesn't look like a good person.

607
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,300
I committed murder,

608
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,570
arson, fraud, and so on.

609
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,020
Is that what you want?

610
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,430
If you don't want to live,

611
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,450
I won't stop you.

612
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,740
I'll tell you how to see Mr. Luo.

613
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:03,900
Mangelai Restaurant.

614
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,480
That's Mr. Luo's favorite spot
for breakfast.

615
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,410
Who is it?

616
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,980
No idea.

617
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,540
I'll go check.

618
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,210
Who are you?

619
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,130
You must be Miss Tang, the shady agent.

620
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,330
And you're Li,
who tricks her into grave digging.

621
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,270
Miss Tang?

622
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,430
What kind of talk is that?

623
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,900
You've fixed this place up
really nicely.

624
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,500
Smells great.

625
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,560
Miss Tang, have you eaten?

626
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,610
Have some with us.

627
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,290
I stopped eating dinner when I was 16.

628
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,570
Your cooking is good,
but you can't show off

629
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,290
your skills in such a small kitchen.

630
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,610
Once you move to your new place,

631
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,500
I'll make an exception.

632
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,430
What new place?

633
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,320
Miss Liu, I know you helped me
at the airport.

634
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,260
Thank you.

635
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,100
But you can't

636
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,250
stay here anymore.

637
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,220
Didn't we just move in?

638
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,860
Liu Yan said she'd pay when she could.

639
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,600
Liu Yan, chip in something at least.

640
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,240
It's not about the money.

641
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,880
The landlord just won't allow it.

642
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,510
Doesn't the landlord know

643
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,350
who's living here?

644
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,690
You said before

645
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,180
that you rented this place for us,

646
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,260
and we pay the rent to you.

647
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,100
Did I say that?

648
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,430
Well,

649
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,310
the landlord's not targeting you.

650
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,180
Maybe he wants

651
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,020
to sell this place.

652
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,960
Miss Tang, did you get

653
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,800
some kind of call?

654
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,470
You've been getting a lot, right?

655
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,220
(Pay Off Debts)

656
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,630
If I had known

657
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,880
you owed Mr. Luo so much money,

658
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,430
I wouldn't have helped you
rent this place.

659
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,810
You guys chat, I'm out of here.

660
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,220
You're not eating the noodles?
It's ready.

661
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,600
Save it for the shady agent.

662
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,020
I don't eat dinner.

663
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,620
It'll get soggy soon.

664
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,220
There are new flyers on the door daily.

665
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,100
I thought Lu Tianchi told you.

666
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,940
Aren't you two...?

667
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,060
Lu and I really share everything.

668
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,380
But you're his client.

669
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,820
When it comes to client privacy,

670
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,210
he won't say a word.

671
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,380
Two weeks should be enough, okay?

672
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,460
Guess it's just my bad luck.

673
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,190
Rent and commission are charged daily.

674
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,660
Pay me after you move out if you need.

675
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,210
If I can deal with the debt collectors

676
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,460
and pay you rent and commission,

677
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,850
we get to stay, right?

678
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,260
Mr. Luo agreed to see me.

679
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,340
Who?

680
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,740
Mr. Luo.

681
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,410
He's willing to see you?

682
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,670
Yes, he said yes.

683
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,700
About the place,

684
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,950
maybe just think it over again.

685
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,140
You don't have to.

686
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,060
Seriously, I won't eat.

687
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,620
Then I'll eat it.

688
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,890
Oh my god.

689
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,630
It's really delicious.

690
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,660
Noodles without garlic

691
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,520
miss half the joy.

692
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,720
That's the taste of Beijing.

693
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,540
Oh my god, mamma mia.

694
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,400
I still can't believe it.

695
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,100
Did you actually get Mr. Luo to meet?

696
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,100
I got a spot

697
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,490
at a restaurant he often goes to.

698
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,770
And you're having a meal together?

699
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,210
Lu really has some connections.

700
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,900
What are you wearing?

701
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,600
Can I just wear what I usually do?

702
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,530
I still can't believe

703
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,580
Mr. Luo is meeting you.

704
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,710
Let me lend you an outfit.

705
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,460
And let's get some garlic.

706
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,180
Help,

707
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,020
it's too good.

708
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,220
Mr. Luo,

709
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,820
I'm Jiang Fang's daughter.

710
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,380
Mr. Luo,

711
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,020
I'm Jiang Fang...

712
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,180
Jiang Fang's daughter.

713
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,580
You look sharp today.

714
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,820
Like you're here for business.

715
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,920
It's too tight.

716
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,280
Been staying here for three days?

717
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,290
Three days without eating.

718
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,580
Why are you here?

719
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,620
I... I came to...

720
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,470
Actually,

721
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,100
I'm here to persuade you

722
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,260
to talk properly with Mr. Luo.

723
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,140
When you're talking,

724
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,570
try to keep your temper in check, okay?

725
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,200
Alright.

726
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,580
Mr. Luo!

727
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,200
Mr. Luo.

728
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,040
Miss!

729
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,400
I need to speak with Mr. Luo.

730
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,320
Mr. Luo!

731
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,810
Can I have a word with you?

732
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,730
I mean no harm.

733
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,890
I'm not here to fight, really.

734
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,720
Mr. Luo, I have something urgent.

735
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,700
I...

736
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,070
Don't cause trouble!

737
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,470
Mr. Luo, I want to talk to you.

738
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,350
Don't stir things up.

739
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,620
I have something important

740
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,550
to discuss with Mr. Luo.

741
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,970
I said I'm not here to fight.

742
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,180
Mr. Luo,

743
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,140
I'm not here to make trouble.

744
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,500
I just want a quick word.

745
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,700
Mr. Luo!

746
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,620
Thank you.

747
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,260
Mr. Luo, I'm Jiang Fang's...

748
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,310
I'm Jiang Fang's daughter.

749
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,780
Alright.

750
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,260
Just say what you need.

751
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,590
Aren't you from Beijing?

752
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,980
Yes, I am.

753
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,240
You're from Beijing too?

754
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,740
Come on, have a seat.

755
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,410
Let me introduce myself first.

756
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,740
My name is Liu Yan.

757
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,970
I'm Jiang Fang's daughter.

758
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,540
Jiang Fang.

759
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,020
Don't know her.

760
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,730
She owes you a lot of money.

761
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,180
She owes me a lot?

762
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,220
Then she has to pay me back.

763
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,290
Not a single cent short.

764
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,360
Right, I get it.

765
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,320
That's what I wanted to discuss.

766
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,870
Hello.

767
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,250
Okay, enjoy your meal.

768
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,820
Drinking celery juice
on an empty stomach this early?

769
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,750
How cold is it?

770
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,140
I've gotten used to it by now.

771
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,900
Do they have fried dough sticks

772
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,100
or lamb offal?

773
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,980
About Jiang Fang owing you money,

774
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,060
I'd like to discuss how to handle it

775
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,900
with you...

776
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,820
Miss Liu,

777
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,300
you shouldn't disturb Mr. Luo

778
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,430
during breakfast.

779
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,700
You can come to me instead.

780
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,070
Alright.

781
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,540
Sorry about that.

782
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,180
(One day later)

783
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,900
(Laws Pictures)

784
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,880
Hello,

785
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,750
do you remember me?

786
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,740
I do.

787
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,880
Have a seat.

788
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,500
Mr. Luo has agreed

789
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,060
to let you

790
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,440
repay the debt by working

791
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,280
at the company.

792
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,060
That's great news.

793
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,380
What kind of work?

794
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,530
Have you done boxing before?

795
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,370
Yes, I've trained.

796
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,170
I spent 12 years in a professional team.

797
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,340
I can be a stunt double,

798
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,510
action coordinator,

799
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,130
or sparring partner.

800
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,180
My only hope is

801
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,550
that before filming starts,
I can rehearse with the co-star.

802
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,140
I know it's all staged,

803
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,350
but I'm afraid of hurting them.

804
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,100
No need, we're not faking it.

805
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,580
Aren't movie fights usually staged?

806
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,400
To the public, we're making a movie.

807
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,480
But your part requires real fighting.

808
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,540
How do we fight?

809
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,700
Here, fill this out.

810
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,300
It's a boxing match entry form.

811
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,570
So I'm joining as a boxer

812
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,610
in a competition?

813
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,150
I'm good at that.

814
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,640
But I'm a professional.

815
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,680
Fighting against amateurs,

816
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,500
even if I win, doesn't count as skill.

817
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,180
Let me see.

818
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,580
(Midsummer Boxing Match Entry Form)

819
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,540
(Gambling)

820
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,380
Is this underground boxing?

821
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,530
Midsummer Boxing Match.

822
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,740
You want me

823
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,220
to fight in underground boxing
for gambling.

824
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,860
From what you said,

825
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,490
you're not very willing.

826
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,970
Then you figure it out yourself.

827
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,450
And pay off your debt.

828
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,510
This isn't a decent job.

829
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,680
Wait, you want me to sign this?

830
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,170
Are you out of your mind?

831
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,940
When I speak Mandarin,

832
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,780
I sound a bit gentler.

833
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,740
But I'm not asking your opinion.

834
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,740
First, I'm not asking you to gamble.

835
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,000
Second,

836
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,260
just follow our plan,

837
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,420
and your debt will be paid off soon.

838
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,620
It's not hard.

839
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,580
Sign this.

(Midsummer Boxing Match Entry Form)

841
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,540
I'll pay the money back.

842
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,600
How will you pay it back?

843
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,210
If I recall correctly,

844
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,140
you only have two weeks left

845
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,030
for your next payment.

846
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,470
That's my problem.
