15
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,300
(Six months ago)

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,300
The last time I stayed overnight
in the hospital

17
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,660
was four years ago.

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,970
I stayed with my dad.

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,660
He was

20
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,580
a very cautious man,

21
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,660
always getting annual check-ups.

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,200
One year, they found something wrong

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,970
with his stomach.

24
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,500
He went

25
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,250
for a biopsy,

26
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,580
but during the procedure,

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,970
there was a medical accident.

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,810
They accidentally cut a blood vessel.

29
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,180
He was admitted to the ICU that night.

30
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,010
I had to rush

31
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,660
back to Shanghai from Gaya.

32
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,410
I hadn't been back in over ten years.

33
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,410
When I went back, I was shocked.

34
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,220
I barely recognized the city,

35
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,010
and I didn't even recognize my dad.

36
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,620
He was so thin

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,690
that his face was sunken

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,380
and covered in stubble.

39
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,300
Then,

40
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,850
I stayed with him

41
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,850
like this

42
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,700
and talked to him every day,

43
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,100
babbling on and on.

44
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,530
The doctor told me

45
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,380
to stop

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,540
because he couldn't hear me.

47
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,220
But it only made me want to talk more.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,460
So, I told him

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,010
all my complaints

50
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,510
from the last thirty years.

51
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,410
All of them.

52
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,250
I told him.

53
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,810
After over ten days,

54
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,620
he suddenly

55
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,900
woke up.

56
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,980
He told me

57
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,620
that while he was in a coma,

58
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,010
he heard

59
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,100
every word

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,690
I said.

61
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,180
When I was talking

62
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,100
to him,

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,290
he was actually sitting

64
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,180
on the sofa in the ward.

65
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,340
He was right there with me.

66
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,570
He even went

67
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,780
to his law office

68
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,060
and checked on his plants.

69
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,850
He said a lot.

70
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,180
In the end, he said

71
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,360
that only before dying

72
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,060
did he truly know his son.

73
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,130
Although...

74
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,130
Although it was late,

75
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,850
he was happy.

76
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,460
After telling me that,

77
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,460
he passed away

78
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,260
that night.

79
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,900
Ms. Liu,

80
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,250
no matter

81
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,260
what you're going through now,

82
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,490
no matter what you saw

83
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,220
in your coma,

84
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,820
I can only tell you.

85
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,580
Don't

86
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,780
be afraid.

87
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,580
Because I will

88
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,820
stay with you.

89
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,530
I will always stay with you.

90
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,370
But you have to remember.

91
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,530
You must come back.

92
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,940
=Episode 23=

93
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,770
Good morning.

94
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,620
You made this?

95
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,780
- How many eggs?
- Three.

96
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,220
- How much water?
- 2.5 times.

97
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,200
What did you put inside?

98
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,880
Seaweed flakes, shiitakes.

99
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,900
I added soy sauce and sesame oil

100
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,420
just before serving.

101
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,420
Let me try.

102
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,570
It's hot.

103
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,540
So good.

104
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,460
Not bad, Lu Tianchi.

105
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,660
It's better than what I make.

106
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,140
Did you sleep okay?

107
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,490
A bit cramped.

108
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,060
My fault.

109
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,570
- What's wrong?
- Well.

110
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,930
Let me introduce myself

111
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,410
a little.

112
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,370
I'm not trying to tease you

113
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,900
all the time on purpose.

114
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,730
You drive me crazy sometimes.

115
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,770
Sorry.

116
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,450
You seem

117
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,730
to say one thing but mean another.

118
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,850
It is

119
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,930
because I'm uncertain

120
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,930
about everything.

121
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,340
I've always wanted

122
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,460
to help others,

123
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,260
but this world

124
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,660
doesn't work

125
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,970
the way I want it to.

126
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,290
So,

127
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,530
I get

128
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,580
angry

129
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,980
at the world.

130
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,900
So, it makes you insecure, too,

131
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,740
right?

132
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,930
I can't accept

133
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,170
everything that's happened in my life.

134
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,260
I feel like all of it

135
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,580
will fade away

136
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,580
soon.

137
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,660
That day you were boxing...

138
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,170
That day really

139
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,220
stuck with me.

140
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,100
You asked me what I was thinking

141
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,170
when Big Beast lifted you,

142
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,010
right?

143
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,100
So, what were you thinking?

144
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,900
Honestly, I was thinking

145
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,970
that if

146
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,780
you died,

147
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,820
then my life

148
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,700
would be over again.

149
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,900
Despite

150
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,530
all my uncertainties,

151
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,460
one thing I'm sure about is

152
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,370
that I love you, Liu Yan.

153
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,180
I really love you.

154
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,490
I'm really grateful

155
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,010
you appeared in my life at that time.

156
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,250
So, please don't be mad

157
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,180
at me anymore,

158
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,020
okay?

159
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,730
And please stop punching me, okay?

160
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,940
It really hurts.

161
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,820
It hurts so much.

162
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,220
It really hurts.

163
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,450
Lu Tianchi.

164
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,180
What's wrong?

165
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,970
Jiang Fang

166
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,970
has abandoned me

167
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,300
so many times.

168
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,850
Honestly, I've never believed

169
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,010
anyone could love me

170
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,940
for long.

171
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,260
So,

172
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,940
if one day,

173
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,900
you stop loving me,

174
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,340
or I stop loving you,

175
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,780
or we part ways

176
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,580
for any

177
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,890
uncertain reason,

178
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,420
promise me one thing.

179
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,010
Just eat well,

180
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,370
and live well.

181
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,060
That'll be enough.

182
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,850
This is the best food I've ever had.

183
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,010
I wondered what smelled

184
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,180
so good in the morning.

185
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,300
Turns out it's the taste of true love.

186
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,610
Lu Tianchi,

187
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,180
you don't know my soy sauce bottle

188
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,770
is actually filled with vinegar?

189
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,770
Why vinegar in the soy sauce bottle?

190
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,730
I don't know
what kind of crazy luck he had

191
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,490
to find such a great girlfriend

192
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,820
like Miss Liu.

193
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,130
Such a great girlfriend.

194
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,940
You know what that means?

195
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,700
A chef's dishes

196
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,340
are a reflection of the chef.

197
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,010
Philip, I'm telling you.

198
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,730
You don't belong here.

199
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,490
Are you going to fire me?

200
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,390
Yes.

201
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,610
If I leave now,

202
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,970
Ching To loses.

203
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,300
With you here,

204
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,770
any award we get

205
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,770
is a failure.

206
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
For dessert,
this is the mille-feuille pastry

207
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,420
with an Italian espresso for you.

208
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,460
Enjoy.

209
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,210
Mr. He,

210
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,370
Table 5 has a guest

211
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,730
from Monaco.

212
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,810
I checked.

213
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,250
It should be a Two-Diamond judge.

214
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,550
There's another guest.

215
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,130
What's going on?

216
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,970
It's Philip.

217
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,580
Shouldn't he be working

218
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,610
in Ching To's kitchen?

219
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,770
What's he doing here?

220
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,490
I'll go deal with him.

221
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,460
Chef, besides punching,

222
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,420
we have other ways

223
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,340
to handle him.

224
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,820
Keep going, everyone.

225
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,180
Yes, Chef!

226
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,580
Please enjoy.

227
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,420
Thank you.

228
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,340
Good evening, Philip.

229
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,100
Let me introduce you to the food.

230
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,580
This is tuna tartare

231
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,890
topped with caviar and finger lime.

232
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,730
Enjoy.

233
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,580
(Sorry.)

234
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,610
Hey, everyone, come.

235
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,610
- Everyone, come.
- Philip left a message.

236
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,690
Come on, come.

237
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,300
Philip left a message.

238
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,260
Sorry.

239
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,380
Sorry.

240
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,100
Back when he was with us,

241
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,220
he wasn't this gentle.

242
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,650
He came here tonight,

243
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,340
probably to say sorry to everyone.

244
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,220
From what I know about Philip,

245
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,300
he must be convinced

246
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,340
by our food.

247
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,710
Okay, get back to work.

248
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,460
I'm still working.

249
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,780
Fine.

250
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm coming out.

251
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,090
What do you want?

252
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,400
Do you think cutting ties

253
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,470
can help you dodge debts?

254
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,890
If Jiang Fang hadn't told us
where you were,

255
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,370
how could we have found you?

256
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,180
Looks like you want to cut ties,

257
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,540
but she doesn't.

258
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,090
Stop!

259
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,010
You jerks!

260
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,220
You're asking for it!

261
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,460
Loser!

262
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,250
Get out of the way!

263
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,180
Don't hit women!

264
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,220
Stop!

265
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,780
Get down.

266
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,380
Everyone, get down.

267
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,850
Report, A fight broke out

268
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,850
at Highland Restaurant.

269
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,820
Please send backup.

270
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,610
Cover your heads.

271
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,610
Don't move.

272
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,140
Don't move.

273
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,940
Officer, we're really sorry.

274
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,370
We will cooperate fully.

275
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,820
Handle it as you see fit.

276
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,180
Are you okay, Mr. He?

277
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,370
I think a Three-Diamond judge

278
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,490
will arrive tonight.

279
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,820

(2024 Black Pearl Restaurant Guide)

281
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,610
Now, I am

282
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,820
so nervous.

283
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,820
My heart

284
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,180
is pounding out of my chest.

285
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,020
Oh, my god.

286
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
My goodness.

287
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,700
I'm nervous too.

288
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,540
It's my first time at a venue like this.

289
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,100
Black Pearl awards

290
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,250
are different every year.

291
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,580
Waiting for the email

292
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,700
is the hardest part.

293
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,890
This year, no emails beforehand,

294
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,060
and no rumors at all.

295
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,180
Enough of the useless talk.

296
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,370
I'll frequent here
with you later, Matsuo.

297
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,220
I have a hunch

298
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,610
we'll get a diamond this year.

299
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,650
Your hunch?

300
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,250
I've quit gambling completely.

301
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,220
All my hunches now

302
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,460
are focused on the right things.

303
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,420

304

to introduce and announce

Is Me Lab going
for two diamonds this year,

326
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,250

338

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,890
Yan, we're not in it.

We'll get Two Diamonds.

met my requirements, right?

miss anything?

Rest well.

388
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,060
We'll do our best.

389
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,170
Leave it to us.

390
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,100
Your hands are injured.

391
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,740
Mr. He, we're united.

392
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,410
We can do this. No problem.

393
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,020
Chef.

394
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,960
Chef.

395
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,290
Chef.

396
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,980
Liu Yan, lead the team.

397
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,020
No mistakes are allowed tonight.

398
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,540
Yes, Chef!

399
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,450
I would now like to announce

400
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,740
the remaining eight
Three-Diamond restaurants.

401
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,770
We have

402
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,410
HK Kepris (China),

403
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,890
HK VA (China),

404
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,610
Telis Hotel, China Macau.

405
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,410
Taipei Raw (China),

406
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,170
Tokyo Sukaitsuri,

407
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,340
Bangkok Cuisine.

408
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,440
Now, let's get to the last one.

409
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,210
This restaurant

410
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,580
has had its ups and downs,

411
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,580
but it is legendary.

412
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,050
Highland.

413
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,020
Chef He Guangyuan!

414
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,740
Excellent!

415
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,420
I would like to invite Chef He Guangyuan

416
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,540
to come up on stage, please!

417
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,780
I'd also like to invite
the executive president of Black Pearl

418
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,850
to come up to present the award
to He Guangyuan.

419
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,450
Chef He Guangyuan, I invite you
to give a speech, please.

420
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,290
Yesterday

421
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,850
marked Highland's 1,065th day

422
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,540
without a diamond.

423
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,260
Everyone here

424
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,100
knows

425
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,610
that when my mother was still alive,

426
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,500
Highland held Two Diamonds

427
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,690
for four years.

428
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,370
She loved food passionately.

429
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,890
Because of her,

430
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,430
I fell in love with this career.

431
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,210
The thing she said to me most was,

432
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,370
"You will never become

433
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,540
a head chef."

434
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,920
I indeed let Highland fall

435
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,080
for many years.

436
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,890
I asked myself every day,

437
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,740
"What did I do wrong?"

438
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,740
For a long time,

439
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,540
I hated myself.

440
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,340
I hated the food I made.

441
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,130
I even thought about changing careers.

442
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,890
He Guangyuan, are you a loser?

443
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,370
You don't know how to cook.

444
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,820
You'll never learn.

445
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
You'll never meet

446
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,450
my expectations.

447
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,410
You can't do this.

448
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,020
You'll never become

449
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,300
a qualified head chef!

450
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,890
But later,

451
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,100
I met another chef.

452
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,210
She was like a beam of light

453
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,210
shining on me

454
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,580
and everyone at Highland.

455
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
Being with her

456
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,020
made me realize

457
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,300
I didn't have to care so much

458
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,340
about what others think.

459
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,210
I didn't have to care

460
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,340
whether they liked me

461
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,690
or approved of me,

462
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,170
even if that person

463
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,980
was my mother.

464
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,260
Everyone

465
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,610
has the right to have opinions

466
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,650
about others,

467
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,540
and those opinions may represent

468
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,170
admiration, appreciation,

469
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,020
criticism,

470
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,780
disdain, mockery,

471
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,820
and even indifference.

472
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,820
But we should remember

473
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,450
we also have the right

474
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,020
to prove those opinions

475
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,370
aren't necessarily right.

476
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,340
Her name is Liu Yan.

477
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,820
She's from Beijing.

478
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,260
On behalf of everyone at Highland

479
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,260
to thank her.

480
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,740
Keep going.

481
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,930
Today is the first day
of our Three Diamonds.

482
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,210
I want to dedicate a quote

483
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,650
to myself,

484
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,260
to all our comrades

485
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,450
in arms at Highland,

486
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,780
and to everyone present

487
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,540
who has given their all for food.

488
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,130
It's a quote from my father,

489
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,020
Master Jue Ru.

490
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,540
"Your heart

491
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,370
is the master of yourself."

492
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,450
"Your heart

493
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,650
decides everything you create."

494
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:49,650
Highland, Highland!

495
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,100
Is this Matsuo?

496
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,970
Mr. He?

497
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,970
Good morning.

498
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,580
Why so early?

499
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,850
Is the iron tree blooming?

500
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,140
It's for you.

501
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,300
This is also for you.

502
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,410
Without you,
we wouldn't have gotten Three Diamonds.

503
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,370
So, I hope you can become

504
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,540
a head chef.

505
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,170
Highland Group

506
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,690
has many restaurants.

507
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,170
You can choose to stay here

508
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,210
or go anywhere

509
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,650
you want to shine.

510
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,850
Mr. He, I...

511
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,690
Yan,

512
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,300
I want to stay with you,

513
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,130
not just for winning diamonds,

514
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,820
and not just in the kitchen.

515
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,540
I want to accompany you

516
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,260
in everything you want to do.

517
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,930
Are you going to resign?

518
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,660
Sorry.

519
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,690
Sorry, Mr. He.

520
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,580
Really, thank you.

521
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:27,940
(Lu Tianchi,
Legal Advisor of Putai Group)

522
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,450
Putai Group has lots of resources.

523
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,450
You can do a lot here.

524
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,100
But rent in a place like this

525
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,060
must be expensive, right?

526
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,610
Of course. Every inch is valuable.

527
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,740
But our group

528
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,340
already bought this land.

529
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,890
As the group's representative,

530
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,450
I sincerely invite you

531
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,410
to be our chief legal advisor.

532
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,610
These furnishings

533
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,740
are all Italian design.

534
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,340
If you don't like them,
we can change them.

535
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,300
No, no, they're great.

536
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,450
But I don't have a lawyer's license.

537
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,410
I can only provide

538
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,580
legal advice.

539
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,420
Well.

540
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,060
Reinstating your license

541
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,300
is nothing for Putai.

542
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,370
Don't worry.

543
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,650
Thanks for your help then.

544
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,820
A win-win situation, right?

545
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,720
Yeah, win, win, win.

546
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,130
We need talent,

547
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,330
and you need a stage
to show your skills.

548
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,140
Thank you.

549
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,540
Mr. Lu.

550
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,130
Please seriously reconsider it.

551
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,740
Maybe

552
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,540
my Chinese isn't good enough.

553
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,060
This is not an invitation.

554
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,930
Sorry, sorry.

555
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,060
I dressed up a bit.

556
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,140
Does it smell good?

557
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,660
How is it?

558
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,860
Not bad.

559
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,100
Sorry, sorry.

560
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,890
This is karma for punching me before.

561
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,130
What's wrong? Why so quiet?

562
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,490
Are you tired?

563
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,100
Lu Tianchi, we need to talk.

564
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,690
Go ahead.

565
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,740
I've made a decision.

566
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,780
I'm resigning from Highland.

567
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,500
I promised Mr. He

568
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,850
I'd help him get Three Diamonds.

569
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,620
I've done everything I should.

570
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
What's next

571
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,650
for you then?

572
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,260
I haven't really thought about it.

573
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,610
But I feel like if I don't quit first,

574
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,020
I can't figure out what's next.

575
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,260
Anyway, I think

576
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,300
it is a decision

577
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,580
that only you would make.

578
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,890
No ideas on your mind?

579
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,540
Maybe I could open

580
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,610
a small restaurant

581
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,820
near Uncle Lin's shop,

582
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,930
serving food for the neighborhood.

583
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,130
That sounds good.

584
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,500
- Right?
- Yeah.

585
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,930
I'll have a free canteen, too.

586
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,800
Great.

587
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,130
You're so smart.

588
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,780
I am smart.

589
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,930
Have you thought

590
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,990
about going back to Beijing?

591
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,740
Opening a restaurant in Beijing.

592
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,250
Beijing?

593
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,450
Think about it.

594
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,980
You can open one

595
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,450
in a hutong

596
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:58,540
and try

597
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,410
some new dishes.

598
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,850
I'll just eat

599
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,410
and lie there.

600
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,850
If anyone bothers you,

601
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,610
I'll be your lawyer for free.

602
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,690
That'd be great.

603
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,050
How nice.

604
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,210
Lu Tianchi,

605
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,020
can you talk properly?

606
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,860
Is that okay?

607
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,300
You're happy. You're smiling.

608
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,410
Don't think about it.

609
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,450
You're clearly smiling.

610
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,930
You're smiling.

611
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,210
You followed my instructions?

612
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,850
This is a total

613
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,410
of 618 victims.

614
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,740
None of them gambled

615
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,580
before being scammed.

616
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,170
That's enough

617
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,740
to file a class action.

618
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,690
Do you know what you're doing?

619
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,130
A class action for mole people

620
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,210
will be explosive news.

621
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,980
It'll cross industries and circles.

622
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,820
For you,

623
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,850
this means huge income.

624
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,850
No, it's not me.

625
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,340
It's you.

626
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,100
You handled the hardest part.

627
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,500
Now, it's just about filing in court

628
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,980
and presenting to the judge.

629
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,580
Millions are at stake.

630
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,730
You don't want it?

631
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,540
I can't wait.

632
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,740
Are you

633
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,460
leaving Gaya?

634
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,430
I want to go back to Beijing

635
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,820
with my girlfriend.

636
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,610
She's been drifting outside

637
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,290
for too long.

638
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,060
I want her to settle down

639
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,050
and give her

640
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,610
a stable, comfortable life.

641
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,450
So...

642
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,210
If you come to Beijing,

643
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,330
come and visit us for a meal.

644
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,730
She's an amazing cook.

645
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,460
Invite me to your wedding, okay?

646
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,980
Of course.

647
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,100
So, please take care

648
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,090
of the rest.

649
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,020
It's almost done.

650
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,900
Everyone, come on.

651
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,860
Come on, friends inside,

652
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,770
come and eat.

653
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,860
Is pilaf okay?

654
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,580
Line up for food, please.

655
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,170
Line up, line up.

656
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,810
Sit down and eat.

657
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,770
Here's some water.

658
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,290
Matsuo, a box, please.

659
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,570
Okay.

660
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,060
Thanks to Highland's chefs.

661
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,940
Thanks to them.

662
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,730
I didn't expect Kanta to be so sweet.

663
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,010
Yan,

664
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,900
are you sure

665
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,580
about quitting?

666
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,380
I thought you wanted to be

667
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,130
the head chef
of a Three-Diamond restaurant.

668
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,330
I did, once.

669
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,580
It's like I wanted

670
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,420
to win a boxing match

671
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,610
without thinking
about whether I actually liked it.

672
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,540
Maybe I was just making excuses,

673
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,650
thinking winning meant money,

674
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,370
and then Jiang Fang
would come back for me.

675
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,770
When I chose to become a chef,

676
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,490
I realized

677
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,020
I really love cooking.

678
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,580
Liu Yan, what are you cooking?

679
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:35,970
You smell that?

680
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,330
Hold on, it's almost ready.

681
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,330
Before I turned twelve,

682
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,700
I followed Jiang Fang around.

683
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,590
After every chaotic debt collection,

684
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,610
she'd cook me something good.

685
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,170
Her catchphrase was,

686
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,060
"When you hit rock bottom, eat first."

687
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,020
After she dumped me
at the sports school,

688
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,420
- that saying helped me a lot.
- Try this.

689
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,420
Does it taste like Jiang Fang's?

690
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,090
In those years,

691
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,460
whenever I felt really sad

692
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,610
and lonely,

693
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,770
as if I had

694
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,250
hit rock bottom,

695
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,980
I'd cook myself a dish

696
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,690
she used to make for me.

697
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,130
It really worked.

698
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,260
I think cooking

699
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,500
can truly make me happy.

700
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,330
I want to cook for others.

701
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,900
I want to feed them and let them enjoy.

702
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,170
I want them

703
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,020
to feel cared for

704
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,380
through the food they eat.

705
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,380
Taste can transcend time and space.

706
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,770
It brings me right back

707
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,980
to my days with Jiang Fang.

708
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,540
When I became a chef,

709
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,770
I cooked for many people.

710
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,020
Some were very hungry.

711
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,770
Some were rarely hungry.

712
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,820
I'm just

713
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,690
obsessed with this.

714
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,900
I love noodles.

715
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,020
I want something sweet.

716
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,130
The kind that makes you happy.

717
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,770
Then I'll give it a try

718
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,240
with some cream in this dish for you.

719
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,530
How is it?

720
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,170
So good!

721
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,860
No matter who they are,

722
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,020
everyone hits rock bottom
in different ways.

723
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,210
Everyone needs attention,

724
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,380
comfort,

725
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,770
and food filled with kindness and joy.

726
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,250
I still remember Master Jue Ru saying,

727
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,980
"Food is a tool."

728
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,210
"You can cook it anywhere."

729
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,810
"What matters most

730
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,170
is what you use it to convey."

731
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,130
What I want to convey

732
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,170
fits better in other places.

733
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,220
Like here.

734
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,170
I hope you remember

735
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,580
your time at Highland
when you're back in Beijing.

736
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,330
This won't fit in my luggage.

737
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,380
Don't worry. I'll take care of it, okay?

738
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,420
Relax. Don't worry.

739
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,130
Well? Did you see it?

740
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,860
What is that?

741
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,170
You always brag.

742
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,600
Every time you said you'd come back,

743
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,140
you never did.

744
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,460
Tell me. What's going on?

745
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,300
Wang Yang,

746
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,770
I'm really coming back to Beijing.

747
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,770
Are you coming back

748
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,610
with Jiang Fang?

749
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,770
It's hard to say.

750
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,170
She disappeared again.

751
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,100
But this time,

752
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,610
I'm definitely not

753
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,650
coming back alone.

754
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,580
I knew it.

755
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,020
That guy is coming back with you.

756
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,170
It's fine.

757
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,060
For your sake,

758
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,900
if he's in Beijing,

759
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,330
I'll treat him like my brother.

760
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,940
There's someone else.

761
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,170
Who?

762
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,380
Your brother-in-law.

763
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,610
Got it.

764
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,020
That guy from Shanghai, right?

765
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,500
Guess he's not to be underestimated.

766
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,460
Fine, set the date.

767
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,580
I'll pick you up.

768
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
Oh, I still have

769
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,460
a package to open.

770
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,770
Talk to you later.

771
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:26,980
Okay, bye.

772
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,940
Listen, he underestimates Shanghainese.

773
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,290
I easily could outdrink him.

774
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,340
Do you dare?

775
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,460
No, no.

776
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,540
I quit. I quit.

777
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,580
This hasn't been packed.

778
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,810
We have to take this back.

779
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,770
It's shot so well.

780
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,540
Didn't I tell you?

781
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,770
We'll carry it back by hand.

782
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,650
These are too important to be packed.

783
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,020
Won't it be weird?

784
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,980
Then you hold it.

785
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,500
Okay, I'll hold it.

786
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,940
Face it forward, okay?

787
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,690
No, no, no.

788
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,900
That's not what I meant.

789
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,320
That's not right.

790
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,290
It's fine.

791
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,540
I'll hold it for you later.

792
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,380
Okay?

793
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,100
Have you decided where to put it?

794
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,210
It has to be

795
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,020
in the most important place for me.

796
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,540
(Lam Kee Herbal Tea)

797
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,060
Thank you.

798
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,250
- I'm starving.
- Wait.

799
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,610
Let me introduce this.

800
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,450
Go on.

801
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,130
Chef Liu's last meal.

802
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,380
This is sweet and sour ribs.

803
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,650
Sweet and sour ribs

804
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,900
are sweet,

805
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
so they

806
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
can get cloying.

807
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,650
That's why I fried

808
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,060
some shredded potatoes

809
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,860
to add more texture.

810
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,650
Here's a pomfret.

811
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,500
When steaming pomfret,

812
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,250
people like

813
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,610
to follow

814
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,290
strict timing.

815
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,580
But I think

816
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,780
feelings

817
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,980
really matter here.

818
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,610
Then how do you know it's done?

819
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,570
I just feel it.

820
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,650
When it seems about right,

821
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,020
I poke the thickest part

822
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,020
of its back

823
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,100
with chopsticks.

824
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,730
One poke, and it tells you it's done?

825
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:03,570
Yeah.

826
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,330
Next one.

827
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,170
Braised chicken with mushrooms.

828
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,500
The mushrooms...

829
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,540
I provided them.

830
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,690
These mushrooms

831
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,580
were specially air-shipped

832
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,170
by a fan from the Greater Khingan Range.

833
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,060
Good, good.

834
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,260
There's also braised beef brisket

835
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,230
with tomatoes downstairs.

836
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,210
But I forgot to buy tomatoes,

837
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,050
so Tianchi

838
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,610
went to buy some.

839
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,380
Who?

840
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,380
Tianchi.

841
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,940
Who's Tianchi?

842
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,980
Your Uncle Lu.

843
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,500
You brat, I'm gonna punch you.

844
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,340
So cheesy.

845
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,330
It's said to be a meal for us.

846
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,290
Looks like it's a meal of love.

847
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,330
Zan, do you still want to eat?

848
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,650
What are you implying?

849
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,650
Don't drag me down.

850
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,540
I'm an independent woman now.

851
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,060
I've seen through the tricks of love.

852
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,980
Sis, let's eat.

853
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,460
I can't wait any longer. I'm starving.

854
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,460
- No.
- I'm hungry.

855
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,540
The steam's all gone.

856
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,380
No.

857
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,940
Just wait.

858
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,210
Call him. What's he doing?

859
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,500
I'm so hungry.

860
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,420
I'll call him.

861
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,210
Yeah, you call him.

862
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,060
You go and call.

863
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,980
Don't eat your brother-in-law's food.

864
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,770
I'll eat it anyway.

865
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,540
Just call him.

866
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,420
I really can't wait.

867
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,260
Let me try a bite.

868
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,450
Hello?

869
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,060
Where are you now?

870
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,610
I'm coming home, aren't I?

871
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,170

872
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,460
