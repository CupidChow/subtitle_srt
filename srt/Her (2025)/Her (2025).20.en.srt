Today marks the 1020th day

00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,530
of Highland's continuous diamond loss.

Here's our new menu.

19
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,500
Thank you all

20
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,060
for your hard work lately.

21
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,460
Excellent.

22
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,020
Next week,

23
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,980
I will decide on two main courses

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,100
and the sous chef candidate.

25
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,780
Sous chef?

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,680
Highland hasn't had one

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,660
for a long time.

28
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,880
Hurry up and start the betting.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,780
Liu Yan and Kanta.

30
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,900
Why isn't it you?

31
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,620
Let's have a drink, everyone.

32
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,620
Good!

33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,780

(Creeping Rockfoil, Cowherb Seed)
We're all working for you.

38
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,380
I've also stored things properly.

39
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,140
Miss Liu,

40
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,020
I've noticed

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,740
you've been drinking iced coffee lately.

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,340
It's not great for your health.

43
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,540
Coffee is a hot-natured beverage.

44
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,260
But when you add ice,

45
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,860
it messes with your stomach.

46
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,380
As a chef,

47
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,850
you've got to take care of your stomach.

48
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,500
Alright, I'll listen to you.

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,340
I'm done with it.

50
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,740
You ignore me when I talk,

51
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,260
but you lecture her about coffee?

52
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,780
Maybe you should reflect

53
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,620
on yourself.

54
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,580
I have reflected.

55
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,540
You should reflect

56
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,380
a little, too, okay?

57
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,410
All the stuff we filmed so far,

58
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,650
it's always at the mahjong table, right?

59
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,160
Try somewhere else,

60
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,880
like the shopping mall
or amusement park.

61
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,240
I don't think that's necessary.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,560
We're just getting
a cohabitation certificate.

63
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,920
No need to make a big deal out of it.

64
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,650
I'm worried people will think

65
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,540
our evidence isn't convincing enough.

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,990
Who thinks that? I'll talk to them.

67
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,220
Besides,

68
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,910
I'm in the running

69
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,030
for Highland's sous chef position.

70
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,770
I have to get there earlier
than anyone else

71
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,780
and leave later than them.

72
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,860
I'm curious how that bald guy

73
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,170
influences you

74
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,020
so much.

75
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,300
Don't call him a bald guy.

76
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,340
He's Mr. He.

77
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,660
It's because he's that type, you know?

78
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,630
He's rigid, stubborn,

79
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,020
and overly meticulous.

80
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,060
Without meticulousness,
nothing gets done.

81
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,790
Lately, I actually understand him.

82
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,190
You're pretty good

83
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,440
at buttering up the boss.

84
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,100
Why the sarcasm?

85
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,940
Sarcasm?

86
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,140
I'm not jealous.

87
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,580
I'm just stating the facts.

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,340
Of course, you're not jealous.

89
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,260
If you were,

90
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,440
our cohabitation certificate

91
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,320
would turn real.

92
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,700
Mr. Lu, you're too professional

93
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,890
for that, right?

94
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,940
Uncle Lin, is this much enough?

95
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,980
Miss Tang.

96
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,290
Is that Shuangshuang?

97
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,140
Yeah.

98
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,820
I haven't heard

99
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,020
from Shuangshuang in ages.

100
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,620
- Move, let me see.
- So tasty!

101
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,860
Since she

102
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,900
left Gaya,

103
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,500
we have barely kept in touch.

104
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,490
She's super popular now.

105
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,900
Got loads of fans.

106
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,860
Miss Tang

107
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,100
promoted my shop,

108
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
and it blew up right away.

109
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,300
Is she livestreaming now?

110
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,620
Yeah, that's it.

111
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,670
But honestly,

112
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,980
we haven't seen her in forever.

113
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,550
Tell him,

114
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,930
I warned him not

115
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,010
to provoke those mole people.

116
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,220
Let them

117
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,220
beat him up.

118
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,650
Why wreck my shop?

119
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,720
We cleaned it up for you.

120
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,980
So don't stay mad, alright?

121
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,490
Today I prepared a big feast.

122
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,340
Hello?

123
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,880
It's all Mediterranean style.

124
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,050
Scoop up lots of lobster meat
and seafood paella.

125
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,900
Lu Tianchi,

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,050
I'm heading over to see Mr. Luo.

127
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,930
I'm eating all of this!

128
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,650
(Mangelai Restaurant)

129
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,060
Mr. Luo, let me show you.

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,780
Look, I've sliced one side.

131
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,020
It's super easy.

132
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,370
Just slice one side first,

133
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,820
then leave a gap, and slice again.

134
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,620
Skip a bit, then repeat.

135
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,980
- Let me try.
- Try it.

136
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,540
No, reverse it.

137
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,220
Let me do it.

138
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,500
Like this, see?

139
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,580
See this angle?

140
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,460
You're a bit clumsy with this.

141
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,980
Careful, you'll cut yourself.

142
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,050
And about the knife...

143
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,620
If you grip it like this, it's unstable.

144
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,260
Watch how I hold it.

145
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,100
Let me do it.

146
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,300
Wait!

147
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,060
Look at yours compared to mine.

148
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,990
The thickness is way off, right?

149
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,260
You're quite something.

150
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,020
You've been through a lot.

151
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,510
Still, you're always so cheerful.

152
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,660
Cooking

153
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,500
makes me happy.

154
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,140
For me,

155
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,260
whenever I'm upset,

156
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,000
I cook something myself.

157
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,540
Even if it's just

158
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,940
a bowl of noodles,

159
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,360
the process

160
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,300
makes worries

161
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,420
disappear.

162
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,260
Cooking, huh?

163
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,060
I remember Jiang Fang saying
when I was a kid,

164
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,420
"When you hit rock bottom, eat first."

165
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,140
When you hit rock bottom, eat first?

166
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,700
That's honestly so wise.

167
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,820
Who's Jiang Fang?

168
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,300
You know, the one who owes you money.

169
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,860
That's your mom, right?

170
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,400
You should give it a try.

171
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,260
Alright.

172
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,750
If I ever hit that low, I'll try it.

173
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,060
Go for it.

174
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,100
This tastes amazing.

175
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,020
Maybe we could

176
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,100
open a noodle shop.

177
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,490
Excuse me, may I ask

178
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,220
where BC is?

179
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,620
It should be just up ahead.

180
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,480
Go straight ahead.

181
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,320
Thank you so much.

182
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,110
Hello, are you Lin Xiangfu's family?

183
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,910
Yes. And you are?

184
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,450
- I...
- We're from legal aid.

185
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,380
Auntie,

186
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,950
please hear me out.

187
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,660
My name is Jiang Fang.

188
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,380
I used to gamble too.

189
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,850
But I've stopped gambling.

190
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,270
And now I've

191
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,260
actually become

192
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,700
an anti-gambling advocate.

193
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,220
Please let me talk to you.

194
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,280
I know you're upset right now.

195
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,350
But please, give me a chance.

196
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,650
Let me explain myself, okay?

197
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,500
Everyone, listen up.

198
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
These are the ingredients

199
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,940
for the beef main course.

200
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,580
Who wants to compete for sous chef?

201
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,770
Now's your chance.

202
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,700
You have two hours to cook.

203
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,300
- Yes, Chef!
- Yes, Chef!

204
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,660
Auntie, this is

205
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,460
how I quit gambling.

206
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,740
Girl, you really had it tough.

207
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,140
It's really not easy for you.

208
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,260
Auntie,

209
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,140
if your son

210
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,730
joins our public prosecution case,

211
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,500
he'll get compensation

212
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,970
and start

213
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,390
his gambling recovery.

214
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,160
Please trust
the gambling addiction center.

215
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,000
Look at me.

216
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,530
Seeing

217
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,510
how talented you are,

218
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,300
I'm feeling more confident now.

219
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,540
Yeah, I get it.

220
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,420
- Here, right here.
- This spot, okay?

221
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,780
- Yes, that works.
- Sure.

222
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,620
Alright.

223
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Thank you so much.

224
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,820
You... you're leaving now?

225
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,780
5% is

226
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,130
not enough.

227
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,120
It's so hot out,

228
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,360
and I'm running around with you.

229
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,460
How about 7%?

230
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,490
This money is rightfully theirs.

231
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,050
Giving you 5% is generous.

232
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,530
Tell me the truth,

233
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,460
do you think this will work?

234
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,260
I'm honestly not sure now.

235
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,030
We're hoping to unite all the families

236
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,940
to sign

237
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,230
this public prosecution agreement

238
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,320
to prove that your relatives

239
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,080
participated passively in gambling.

240
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,100
Save the speech.

241
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,220
- We're trying to prove...
- I don't believe you.

242
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,940
No, can you imagine

243
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,120
that your family member

244
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,550
actually wasn't...?

245
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,260
Little girl,

246
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,780
do you want to prove

247
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,980
that Mom never gambled before?

248
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,850
I don't know.

249
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,700
I really don't know.

250
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,980
Hey.

251
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,100
Sweety,

252
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,140
what's your name?

253
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,580
I have a daughter too.

254
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,470
When I was apart from her,

255
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,380
she was about your age back then.

256
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,500
We ended up apart

257
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,660
for... 13 years.

258
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,610
Do you know why we separated?

259
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,260
I was paying off debts,

260
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,940
so I started gambling.

261
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,780
I never wanted that life.

262
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,650
I bet your wife felt the same way.

263
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,940
We checked her background.

264
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,660
Because I know that feeling myself.

265
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,940
Please, trust me on this.

266
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,250
Honestly, I got really lucky

267
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,660
to meet Mr. Lu.

268
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,100
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

269
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,460
Really, thank you so much.

270
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,780
I hope

271
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,100
he can help you like he helped me.

272
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,700
Just sign your name here,

273
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,660
and we'll do everything we can

274
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,840
to help you through this tough time.

275
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,680
Alright?

276
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,740
Did they sign it?

277
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,700
How many more families tomorrow?

278
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,220
Just now,

279
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,620
was that for real?

280
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,220
What do you mean, for real?

281
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,170
What you said inside.

282
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,620
Don't you want signatures?

283
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,750
You can't be that naive.

284
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,040
Sometimes, I don't get it.

285
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,260
Because I genuinely think Liu Yan

286
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,140
doesn't hate you.

287
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,940
Why would she hate me?

288
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,850
Uncle Lu, you're really childish.

289
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,950
Mother and daughter, right?

290
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,560
It's the closest bond there is.

291
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm always thinking of her.

292
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,440
She just doesn't see it.

293
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,480
You know what I mean?

294
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,580
Look,

295
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,460
you can't really get it either.

296
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,980
Let me tell you...

297
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,180
Congratulations.

298
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,860
(Junior Sous Chef, Liu Yan)

299
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,300
Seriously?

300
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,240
For real?

301
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,180
Of course, it's real.

302
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,020
Was this embroidered on?

303
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,500
Hand-stitched, right?

304
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,160
Only the head chef
and sous chef get this.

305
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,180
Thank you!

306
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,420
So, what's this?

307
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,420
This is the chef's knife
Mr. He gave you.

308
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,540
No way.

309
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,460
That's too much.

310
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,500
I finally have my own knife now.

311
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,470
Also, I need to pass on

312
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,520
Mr. He's exact words,

313
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,540
"Among the existing garbage,

314
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
she's the only garbage

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,270
that's different from the others."

316
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,510
Why is she still sleeping?

317
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,900
Please, just let her sleep.

318
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,120
She talks too much.

319
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,680
Everyone's breaking down, you know?

320
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,660
Even I can't take it.

321
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,660
How has she been these days?

322
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,100
Totally addicted.

323
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,630
Addicted?

324
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,940
She's back at it?

325
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,810
No...

326
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,820
Not gambling addiction.

327
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,600
Now she's acting like

328
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,340
a gambling recovery model,
addicted to that.

329
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,570
She cries and complains
to people every day.

330
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,060
There's an older lady

331
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,180
who refuses to open the door.

332
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,030
She stands outside saying,

333
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,130
"Hello,

334
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,820
I know exactly
what you're going through."

335
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,370
Listen, your mom is a drama queen.

336
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,740
You really can't outplay her.

337
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,180
She does put on quite a show.

338
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,820
You two get along now, huh?

339
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,460
Every day at home,

340
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,260
she keeps talking about Lu.

341
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,470
Come on, she's still your mom.

342
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,520
Other boyfriends try hard

343
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,190
to please their mothers-in-law.

344
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,900
But I'm always struggling with her.

345
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,370
Who's your mother-in-law?

346
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,770
Anyway, I'm telling you,

347
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,660
you need to be careful.

348
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,770
Be smarter,
don't let her trick you again, okay?

349
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,260
I'm confident.

350
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,700
I think I can change her.

351
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,250
How many times will it take

352
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,750
for you to finally get it?

353
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,460
Bacon and egg sandwich, right?

354
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,750
I'll bring it back for both of you.

355
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,140
15 minutes until service starts.

356
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,000
Hurry up!

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,320
Yes, Chef!

358
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,760
Liu Yan.

359
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,690
The judges are coming soon.

360
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,540
Do you need anything else here?

361
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,120
I want someone
to try the dish at Highland.

362
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,850
I think she could give some advice.

363
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,180
Who?

364
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,490
The state-run head chef?

365
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,880
What does that mean?

366
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,900
It means she's the boss over there,

367
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,220
like our head chef here.

368
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,490
Isn't she a gambling addict?

369
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,900
Probably just here for free food.

370
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,340
She quit that already.

371
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,180
She quit?

372
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,100
No wonder.

373
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,960
Your mom looks much better now.

374
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,170
This snapper dish

375
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,370
is served with bamboo shoots,

376
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,520
topped with fish floss.

377
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,650
The sauce is lemon butter sauce.

378
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,120
The wine pairing for you is

379
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,390
a Gruner Veltliner

380
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,380
from Austria.

381
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,940
The taste is very pure,

382
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,080
and the acidity

383
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,140
is well-balanced.

384
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,620
For the main course, the beef

385
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,580
uses two different

386
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,540
cooking methods.

387
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,140
This side is Chinese-style

388
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,020
slow-braised beef ribs.

389
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,980
And up here on top,

390
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,220
we have a pan-seared

391
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,420
Western-style wagyu tenderloin.

392
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,420
The bread on top

393
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,980
is made with wild yeast fermentation,

394
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,580
paired with your Beijing-style

395
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,420
sesame-peanut sauce.

396
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,300
The cheese next to it

397
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,420
is Tete de Moine.

398
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Hope you enjoy your meal.

399
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,860
How was your meal today? Satisfied?

400
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,980
Yes, very good.

401
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,800
Everything was wonderful.

402
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,300
This is truly fine dining.

403
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,090
Do you have any feedback for us?

404
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,540
No, I don't.

405
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,380
Please let Mr. He know

406
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,190
that his new dishes are all great.

407
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,700
Working with him is a real honor

408
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,180
for Liu Yan.

409
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,060
Please make sure

410
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,580
he's strict with Liu Yan.

411
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,780
If she does well,

412
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,420
a little bonus would be nice.

413
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,630
Alright, I won't disturb you then.

414
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,350
- I'll get going.
- Take care.

415
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,500
Hold on a second.

416
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,220
What do you think?

417
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,660
It's good.

418
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,210
If you really liked it,

419
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,680
you wouldn't have left the sauce behind.

420
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,100
Can you tell me why?

421
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,140
It's just that

422
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,220
I'm getting older,

423
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,180
and my taste is becoming lighter.

424
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,540
I don't want too much sauce now.

425
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,390
- So...
- I know you're from Beijing.

426
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,820
People from northern China

427
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,100
tend to like bold flavors.

428
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,380
Mr. He, please don't take it to heart.

429
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,220
Well...

430
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,260
Alright, Jiang Fang.

431
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,500
Let's drop the artful talk.

432
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,900
Just tell the truth.

433
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,060
Salty, lend me a hand.

434
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,850
Jiang Fang, what are you doing?

435
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,300
Are there any red-skinned peanuts?

436
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,660
- Yeah.
- Toast some.

437
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,260
Set it to 175℃.

438
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,860
What about sesame seeds?

439
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,700
We have some.

440
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,020
(Watching you tie up your hair,)

441
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,140
(put on an apron, and start cooking,)

442
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,740
(the Highland kitchen)

443
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,590
(feels like returning)

444
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,940
(to that tiny kitchen in Beijing)

445
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,860
(when I was 12.)

446
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,740
(It really feels like a dream.)

447
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,140
(When I was little,)

448
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,860
(I had no idea the head chef)

449
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,060
(held such an important job.)

450
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,360
(Every time I asked you,)

451
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,220
(you'd say you were just a cook.)

452
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,790
(Now I finally get it.)

453
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,860
(A top chef)

454
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,690
(can change everything with one dish.)

455
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,490
(She can control people's eyes,)

456
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,620
(ears,)

457
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,350
(nose, tongue,)

458
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,020
(and heart.)

459
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,780
(Jiang Fang,)

460
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,260
(it's wonderful
to learn skills from you.)

461
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,530
(You make me proud.)

462
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,190
(I hope one day)

463
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,520
(I can make you proud, too.)

464
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,780
In Gaya, the weather is so rare.

465
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,860
It's so comfortable today.

466
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,500
You're still in your prime.

467
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,980
Prime? I feel much older.

468
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,060
Once you have something,

469
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,660
it's impossible

470
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,120
to leave it behind.

471
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,880
I've never seen

472
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,990
He Guangyuan with that look.

473
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,920
A convincing expression.

474
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,180
Was there?

475
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,040
Yeah.

476
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,500
He's usually super serious.

477
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,870
But I haven't seen

478
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,170
him looking unconvinced.

479
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,460
So there's nothing to compare.

480
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,890
Let's invite him over for dinner.

481
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,970
I told him about it.

482
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,320
When... did you tell him?

483
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,780
Just now.

484
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,500
I let him know.

485
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,890
I said, "You must come

486
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,800
to our house tomorrow.

487
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,860
We'll host you for a meal."

488
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,500
He treated me to dinner today

489
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,440
and wouldn't let me pay.

490
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,780
Salt and pepper pork chops.

491
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,210
What's the most important part

492
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,520
of salt and pepper pork chops?

493
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,220
The salt matters most.

494
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,820
What kind of salt?

495
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,060
Huai salt.

496
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,180
How do you make it?

497
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,420
Mix salt with five-spice...

498
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,900
Stir salt
and five-spice powder together.

499
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,100
Slow-fry over low heat.

500
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,740
Cook until it's light brown.

501
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,580
Not bad at all.

502
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,110
Wait,

503
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,060
He Guangyuan is my boss.

504
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,220
That's not appropriate.

505
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,460
What's wrong with it?

506
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,580
He treated me to dinner.

507
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,500
As the elder,

508
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,700
shouldn't I treat him back?

509
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,560
What elder?

510
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,180
What are you talking about?

511
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:14,380
(Liu Yan)

512
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,780
Salty.

513
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,020
Didn't expect it, did you?

514
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,130
What didn't I expect?

515
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,700
Head Chef Jiang Fang is back in action.

516
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,380
Hurry up and come back with Jiang Fang.

517
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,220
Come back to Beijing.

518
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,540
Let's open a shop together.

519
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,020
I've recently been handling several of

520
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,940
those commercial properties.

521
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,700
Long-term rates are really good.

522
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,170
How is it with

523
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,060
your Shen Linfei?

524
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,460
I'm telling you,

525
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,780
I just found out

526
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,300
she has four boyfriends.

527
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,420
And I'm one of them.

528
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,540
Four?

529
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,620
Wang Yang,

530
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,140
you've seen me get tricked

531
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,770
by people since we were kids.

532
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,440
Now it's your turn to get played.

533
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,960
Four?

534
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,480
Come on, be smarter about it.

535
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,050
Don't worry about me now.

536
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,880
Take care of yourself.

537
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,260
Oh, right.

538
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,520
Don't tell me
you're still hanging around

539
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,820
with that lawyer.

540
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,540
What do you mean?

541
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,870
Listen, don't let anyone
push you around.

542
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,820
If anything happens,

543
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,250
I'll fly over and deal with him.

544
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,210
Alright, time for bed.

545
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,580
Good night to you.

546
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,860
Okay, go get some sleep.

547
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,940
(Tang Shuangshuang)

548
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,340
The number you have dialed is off.

549
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,690
The number you have dialed is off...

550
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,880
(Tang Shuangshuang)
Welcome to Tang Shuangshuang's livestream.

551
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,420
(Wow, so many people here.)
Today's topic is

552
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,020
an American-Mexican style collection.

553
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,580
(Here to support you!)
Start with a big burger!

554
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,060
Let's scoop up a big spoonful

555
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,770
of this lobster meat and seafood paella.

556
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,260
(Making my mouth water.)

557
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,220
(What's going on?)
I want to eat it all!

558
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,390
And this one is

559
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,380
Spain Valencian pasta,

560
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,630
squid ink pasta!

561
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,130
(Live Replay)
Let me tell you,

562
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,940
it smells so good.

563
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,060
Hold on a second, lovely fans.

564
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,170
Now, let me check

565
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,040
the fans' comments.

566
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,420
(Cried again from craving today.)

567
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,650
Why is the power out?

568
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,860
The number you have dialed is off.

569
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,640
The number you have dialed is off...

570
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,940
My daughter's boss

571
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,190
insisted on visiting me.

572
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,740
How embarrassing.

573
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,340
Come on.

574
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,860
Here they come.

575
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,820
Mr. He.

576
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,890
So handsome.

577
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,260
And wealthy too.

578
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,220
Why is he buying you flowers?

579
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,070
Are you dumb?

580
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,020
Were they bought for me?

581
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,540
Those flowers are for you.

582
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,470
Hello, Mr. He.

583
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,100
- Hello.
- Auntie, sorry to bother you.

584
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,360
No trouble at all.

585
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,780
Why bring gifts?

586
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,890
You really didn't have to.

587
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,090
Sorry for the trouble.

588
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,380
Thank you so much.

589
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,230
These are for you.

590
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,230
Go on, take them.

591
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,560
These flowers are beautiful.

592
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,460
Thank you.

593
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,980
Come in, come on in.

594
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,160
- Open the door.
- Okay.

595
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,380
- Come in, Mr. He.
- Please, come in.

596
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,340
Auntie, after you.

597
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,780
Alright, you're too kind.

598
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,910
Hurry, come on in.

599
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,300
Go pour some water.

600
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,820
Have a seat.

601
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,510
Not this one.

602
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,490
Now I'm getting all nervous.

603
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,940
It's just some home cooking.

604
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,620
I'm not sure

605
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,060
about your preferences.

606
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,180
- Anyway,
- Thank you.

607
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,040
these are Liu Yan's favorites.

608
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,180
It's delicious, Auntie.

609
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,930
Eat more if you like it.

610
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,920
Liu Yan loves this too.

611
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,550
She's loved my cooking
since childhood.

612
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,060
In every dish you made,

613
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,360
I can see a bit of Liu Yan.

614
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,460
That's true.

615
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,880
Just like I can also feel

616
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,180
your mother's essence

617
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,390
in your cooking.

618
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,020
You knew my mother?

619
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,700
Not really.

620
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,890
It was a long time ago.

621
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,200
Back then, money wasn't tight.

622
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,300
So I had the chance

623
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,360
to try her food at the restaurant.

624
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,470
It had Two Diamonds...

625
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,180
back in those days.

626
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,270
Come on, let's eat.

627
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,300
Mr. He,

628
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,020
have some more, please.

629
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,520
Eat while it's hot, or it'll get cold.

630
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,380
It's fine, really.

631
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,690
My mom was always better than I was.

632
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,140
After she passed away,

633
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,060
I couldn't get Highland

634
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,330
back to its former glory.

635
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,260
Oh,

636
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,740
I haven't had

637
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,020
your cooking in so long.

638
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,260
Mr. He, actually,

639
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,300
I'm not sure

640
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,430
if I should say this.

641
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,780
Maybe you shouldn't.

642
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,460
Come on.

643
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,550
I know where to draw the line.

644
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,360
Personally, I think

645
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,580
you don't need

646
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,700
to replicate your mom's cooking style.

647
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,490
You should find your own style.

648
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
Look, for example,

649
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,360
Liu Yan has eaten my food
since childhood.

650
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,820
But when we both cook,

651
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,180
our food tastes different.

652
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,790
Yeah, you never let Mr. He

653
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,750
try the difference

654
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,590
between us.

655
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,070
Let him eat, okay?

656
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,780
I'm just happy to see Mr. He.

657
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,710
Right?

658
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,500
Look how accomplished he is.

659
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,580
That's really great.

660
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,430
Right?

661
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,220
You're lucky, you know that?

662
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,300
Work hard.

663
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,340
She's really talented.

664
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,950
Mr. He, what's your favorite food?

665
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,280
That's

666
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,120
a tough one.

667
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,690
I don't even know my own favorite.

668
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,540
We're just chatting.

669
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,380
Come on, eat up.

670
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,840
My... favorite food?

671
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,660
What he likes

672
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,630
is none of your business.

673
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,230
No, I just...

674
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,150
I'm just curious.

675
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,610
Most people, you know,

676
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,100
love their mom's cooking best.

677
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,500
- About her...
- Auntie,

678
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,440
for me, it's not the same.

679
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,860
No wonder.

680
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,810
We actually talked about this, right?

681
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,060
- Enough, Jiang Fang.
- I think

682
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,220
- What right
- you and her...

683
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,820
do you have to discuss this with him?

684
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,140
Chatting... helps us understand.

685
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,860
Mr. He,

686
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,060
I believe

687
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,150
this actually matters a lot.

688
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,940
You need to think about it.

689
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,900
Otherwise,

690
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,620
you'll always be

691
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,430
cooking like your mom did.

692
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,130
Alright, let's eat.

693
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,930
I never considered

694
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,780
this question.

695
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,380
Is it that important?

696
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,900
Look!

697
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,070
Guess what I brought.

698
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,340
Someone sent a cake for Mr. He.

699
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,210
I just learned

700
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,420
today is Mr. He's birthday.

701
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,260
Kanta.

702
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,540
What is it?

703
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,830
Mr. He and Liu Yan aren't here.

704
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,500
You're in charge of the kitchen now.

705
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,750
We'll do what you say.

706
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,910
Let's cut the cake.

707
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,020
No way.

708
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,700
The birthday star isn't here yet.

709
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,900
Why cut the cake now?

710
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,620
Everyone wants some.

711
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,460
Your call!

712
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,540
Hurry up.

713
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,860
Mr. He...

714
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,430
- Mr. He won't come.
- It's his birthday.

715
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
His biggest birthday wish

716
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,980
must be for us to earn diamonds.

717
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,800
If we don't eat well,

718
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,870
how can we earn diamonds?

719
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,460
- Come on, let's share it.
- Right?

720
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,500
This cake tastes better than Daxiang's.

721
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,380
Kanta's problem.

722
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,720
- Kanta's problem.
- Daxiang will be furious.

723
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,820
Three big pieces stuffed me full.

724
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,820
What's up?

725
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,540
Sneaking food behind my back?

726
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,380
Is that true?

727
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,790
Cake, right?

728
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,280
Not a crumb left for me?

729
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,380
How rude!

730
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,300
Here, take it.

731
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,220
Matsuo always has my back.

732
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,220
Thanks, really.

733
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,660
It's always like this.

734
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,300
So, whose birthday is it?

735
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,660
- Mr. He.
- Mr. He.

736
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,740
Unbelievable.

737
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,540
You've been eating for ages,

738
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,660
no clue whose birthday it is.

739
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,860
The cake's really good, right?

740
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,190
This one's amazing.

741
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,220
- Coming.
- Who is it?

742
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,060
Coming.

743
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,700
Sorry about that.

744
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,720
I just finished up.

745
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,900
So when you texted me earlier,

746
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,940
I didn't get a chance to reply.

747
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,300
Come on in, hurry up.

748
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,370
I might need to

749
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,540
leave Gaya for a few days.

750
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,380
Please watch

751
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,460
Jiang Fang closely.

752
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,020
Uncle Lu,

753
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,060
long time no see.

754
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,020
Why are you standing outside?

755
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,700
Come in, let's talk inside.

756
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,650
You picked the perfect day to visit.

757
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,200
We're having a family dinner today.

758
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,300
I made a bunch of dishes.

759
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,670
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. He.

760
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,800
Would you like to join us?

761
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,190
Auntie's cooking is amazing.

762
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,620
You're too kind.

763
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,950
It's just home cooking.

764
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,050
I'll let you all enjoy. I'm good.

765
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,210
Listen, Mr. Lu,

766
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,770
if you don't try my cooking,

767
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,290
you're really losing

768
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,440
hundreds of millions.

769
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,600
With that attitude,

770
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,820
just focus on cooking, alright?

771
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,780
Why gamble?

772
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,960
Nonsense!

773
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,470
Sit here. Leave no space for him.

774
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,140
Come on, sit down.

775
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,660
Did you get into some trouble?

776
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,820
Tell me!

777
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,300
It's not me in trouble.

778
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
I think Tang Shuangshuang is.

779
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,220
What happened to her?

780
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,300
Remember her livestream

781
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,560
at Uncle Lin's?

782
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,500
She seemed off to me then.

783
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,980
Her makeup was so thick.

784
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,170
Even her hands looked painted.

785
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,400
After that, I checked her profile.

786
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,420
Every pinned comment just said,

787
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,700
"Thank you".

788
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,360
I handled a lawsuit for her before.

789
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,660
Back then,

790
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,150
she was being followed and threatened.

791
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,300
We had a code word.

792
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,500
If she needed help,
she'd type "Thank you".

793
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,860
But this time, she didn't tell me

794
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,740
anything about it.

795
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,910
I called her, but she didn't answer.

796
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,740
Shouldn't you call the police?

797
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,420
No, Gaya's police

798
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,630
can't help over there anyway.

799
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,300
Then... I'll grab you the car key.

800
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,350
- Drive there.
- No, wait.

801
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,950
You still need the car yourself.

802
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,650
I'll rent one for the airport.

803
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,500
Don't worry, I'll be back in two days.

804
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,700
Be safe on the road.

805
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,380
Tang Shuangshuang,

806
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,290
I'm on my way to your place now.

807
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,340
Text me back when you get this.

808
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,300
What's going on?

809
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,140
Ping!

810
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,060
You...

811
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,420
Du,

812
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,860
call the police.

813
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,950
Everyone...

814
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,020
My head feels dizzy.

815
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,500
(Nurse Station)

816
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,120
- How are you?
- Doctor, hello.

817
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,500
- Much better.
- What happened?

818
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,890
It's food poisoning.

819
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,700
Take a break for now.

820
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,500
How are the guests doing?

821
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,260
They're all fine.

822
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,580
It's just the chefs.

823
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,520
Doctor, in this situation, how long

824
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,460
will it take to recover?

825
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,900
Judging from now,

826
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,780
they'll need at least a week in bed.

827
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,400
What did you eat?

828
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,100
That cake was too good.

829
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,940
Cake?

830
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,460
It's nothing.

831
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,860
Are you okay?

832
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,260
I'm fine.

833
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,530
Sorry.

834
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,060
Chef,

835
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,790
happy birthday.

836
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,580
Thank you.

837
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,700
Happy birthday.

838
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,060
Happy birthday!

839
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,860
(Three days ago)

840
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,220
So delicious! Oh my god!

841
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,100
Sorry, my lovely fans.

842
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,140
Right now,

843
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,340
something happened

844
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,860
at home.

845
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,700
But don't worry,

846
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,790
I'll be back soon.

847
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,530
Pierre,

848
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,980
you're home.

849
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,540
The power's out here.

850
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,560
How was work today?

851
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,060
