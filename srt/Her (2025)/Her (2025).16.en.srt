=Episode 16=

16
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,140
Mr. He,

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,500
this is my signature French cuisine.

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,690
I'm confident about our new dishes.

19
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,450
It took me an hour to make this.

20
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,740
Hang on, Mr. He.

21
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,100
Add some of my sauce.

22
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,580
The carrot puree is too sweet.

23
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,290
- Mr. He, your coffee.
- Thanks.

24
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,010
By the way, I just got a call.

25
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,130
The Bai's Dried Goods Factory

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,200
asked us to liaise with them

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,520
about the dried bamboo shoots.

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,690
They can supply us with those.

29
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,780
And the price is very reasonable.

30
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,500
Everyone, listen up.

31
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,690
Smoked bamboo shoot fish
is added to the new menu.

32
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,130
Yes, Chef.

33
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,570
- Du.
- Yes.

34
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,780
You choose a wine

35
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,680
to pair with this dish.

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,010
It should complement its aroma.

37
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,850
Alright.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,920
As for the rest of the fish,

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,360
we'll do trial dishes for a few days.

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,850
Recommend it more to our guests.

41
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,680
Okay.

42
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,900
Liu Yan,

43
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,340
you should also use this chance

44
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,980
to train on the consistency
of serving this dish.

45
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,020
Got it, Mr. He.

46
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,100
If you have confidence

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,940
in your abilities,

48
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,850
start showing me from now.

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,090
I will.

50
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,810
Mr. He,

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,620
why let some newcomers

52
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,850
teach us how to cook?

53
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,500
Are you really asking me,

54
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,660
or just venting your feelings?

55
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,660
I've been at Highland for eight years.

56
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,290
If this keeps going like this,

57
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,290
I don't see a reason to stay.

58
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,250
Kanta,

59
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,180
I think you're just letting off steam.

60
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,940
Mr. He...

61
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,460
I'll help you out.

62
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,620
Thanks.

63
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,250
Be careful.

64
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,220
Whoa, what brings you here?

65
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,410
Why start a fight right away?

66
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,460
That's how a boxer shows gratitude

67
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,700
and shares happiness.

68
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,930
Is it done?

69
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,520
So, about that...

70
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,610
Mr. Bai, who sells

71
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,130
dried bamboo shoots,
how did you convince him?

72
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,340
Should we start the timer?

73
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,140
Fine, let's start timing.

74
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,900
So how did you convince Mr. Bai?

75
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,020
You were so sure back then.

76
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,260
Don't be fooled by Mr. Bai.

77
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,290
He always acts super tough.

78
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,290
Actually, the one who calls the shots

79
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,930
is that old lady.

80
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,290
She loves

81
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,460
the dishes you make.

82
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,260
So Mr. Bai does what she says.

83
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,450
That's it.

84
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,780
You're making this up, right?

85
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,140
You know,

86
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,700
your biggest skill is

87
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,170
lying with a straight face.

88
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,290
So how did he finally agree?

89
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,700
Just tell me, okay?

90
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,170
I want to know the story

91
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,900
behind this dish.

92
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,980
Come on. It's not for free.

93
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,290
I'm even timing myself here.

94
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,850
And now you're stomping? Really?

95
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,700
Well...

96
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,850
I...

97
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,170
Then...

98
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,260
No, don't do that.

99
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,100
Is it really that serious?

100
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,950
Just let it go.

101
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,050
Come on, let it be.

102
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,300
Please, have a seat.

103
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,210
Alright.

104
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,460
That's what happened.

105
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,930
He had an apprentice

106
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,970
who suffered

107
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,020
a work injury there.

108
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,780
Then, I helped that apprentice

109
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,260
sue him.

110
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,020
He paid some compensation.

111
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,820
That's why Mr. Bai
holds a grudge toward me.

112
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,850
Then, why would he agree to help us?

113
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,820
Could it be a trap

114
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,850
for revenge?

115
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,050
It's really not that serious.

116
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,780
Because his employment contract

117
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,140
had issues.

118
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,050
Originally,

119
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,850
I could've asked him

120
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,530
for double or even triple
the compensation payment.

121
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,460
But I didn't do that.

122
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,320
If I did,
it'd be like taking advantage, right?

123
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,370
This time I explained

124
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,410
everything to him.

125
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,530
At the same time,

126
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,900
I helped him revise
a new employment contract

127
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,220
for free.

128
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,610
So that's why he...

129
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,260
That's like a thief

130
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,370
inventing an anti-theft lock, right?

131
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,260
Timer on.

132
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,260
End it.

133
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,050
I'm honestly so tired.

134
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,850
I've been way too busy lately.

135
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,900
I have so much to do every day.

136
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,610
Next time, before you come,

137
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,610
could you maybe

138
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,460
send me a message to check first?

139
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,050
Just show a little respect for my job,

140
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,890
okay?

141
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,100
Okay?

142
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,660
Lu Tianchi,

143
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,530
you're honestly acting

144
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,700
really strange today.

145
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,100
When I came, I saw

146
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,530
some sketchy people hanging around.

147
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,020
They looked like gamblers.

148
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,170
Seriously, I'm not...

149
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,010
Don't let me find out

150
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,380
that you're mixed up
with those gamblers.

151
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,610
Or we can't be friends anymore.

152
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,860
Wait a second!

153
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,860
What is it?

154
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,580
How much time is left

155
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,930
on our employment contract?

156
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,100
I'll tell you when it's done.

157
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,020
I won't come back.

158
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,580
Excuse me.

159
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,780
Line up!

160
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm going to my own place.

161
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,780
Get in line!

162
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,530
Are you serious?

163
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,290
Eating my food?

164
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,460
Drinking my drinks?

165
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,100
Go away!

166
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,940
Go!

167
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,460
Go away!

168
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,370
- Power's out.
- What's going on?

169
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,330
What's happening?

170
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,780
The power's out.

171
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,130
Why is there no power?

172
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,130
Everyone, quiet down.

173
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,770
It'll be back soon, just relax.

174
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,850
Next, please. Next one.

175
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,890
My name's Bob Marley.

176
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,060
Yeah.

177
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,210
It's me.

178
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,030
The company
that tricked you is called...

179
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,890
Putai.

180
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,810
Putai...

181
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,250
Putai, Putai.

182
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,370
- I...
- Putai.

183
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,900
Okay, I see. So when did you

184
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,090
get scammed?

185
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,420
Back in 1993.

186
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,130
When did you start betting?

187
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,230
I was just 19.

188
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,020
Started at 19, betting on...?

189
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,100
The League Cup.

190
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,650
Scored four in one match.

191
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,370
Two assists.

192
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,650
Hit the post twice.

193
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,540
Ronaldo was 19.

194
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,060
So how much did you lose?

195
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,460
10...

196
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,300
100,000?

197
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,260
Yeah, 100,000.

198
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,010
Started with 100,000.

199
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,920
Chased it to 500,000, got 150,000 back.

200
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,660
I thought that sounded good.

201
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,160
I wanted it all back.

202
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,930
That was just the start.

203
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,010
Then they said add more...

204
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,580
The total, all in!

205
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,010
So, how much in the end?

206
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,700
960,000.

207
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,490
You could borrow that much?

208
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,300
10% of 960,000 is...

209
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,850
That's 96,000.

210
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,690
Right, 96,000.

211
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,940
96,000. Listen,

212
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,500
finding Mr. Lu,

213
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,860
you've come to the right person.

214
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,940
Mr. Lu is famous for being fair

215
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,180
and just.

216
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,060
You'll get everything back.

217
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,460
I know a lot of people like that.

218
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,420
Hundreds of them.

219
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,340
I know them all.

220
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,740
Yeah, I have your contact info.

221
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,100
I can tell you're the type

222
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,780
who can turn things around.

223
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,660
So I'll get part as commission, right?

224
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,500
Alright, that's enough.

225
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,860
- That's enough.
- Sis.

226
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,110
Wait, listen to me.

227
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,980
Mr. Bob, about that...

228
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,860
Next one!

229
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,620
There are too many people.

230
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,380
- Alright.
- Next, please.

231
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,940
Can you not discuss commission

232
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,980
with my people here?

233
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,900
Then, while you're here,

234
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,340
could you keep your voice down?

235
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,420
If Liu Yan finds out you're here,

236
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,000
- she could tear my house down.
- Relax.

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,020
Once I get the money,

238
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,740
I'll disappear right away.

239
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,820
Without a trace.

240
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,540
Next...

241
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,140
One.

242
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,100
(Lu Tianchi Legal Advice)

243
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,380
Look at you.

244
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,340
Seriously, look who you bring home.

245
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,900
Don't mess with those mole people.

246
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,740
Okay?

247
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,020
You'll end up on the losing side.

248
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,140
A whole group ate

249
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,700
so much of my stuff.

250
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,620
Does this cash

251
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,220
even cover the cost?

252
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,860
Wang Daxiang, you dare come back?

253
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,540
What were you thinking?

254
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,340
You ran off when things blew up.

255
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,980
The repainting costs

256
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,660
come from my wages.

257
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,060
I didn't run away, why would I?

258
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,980
My mom's sick, so I have to
care for her at the hospital.

259
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,340
You've got the nerve
to mention your mom?

260
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,100
You're out there gambling,

261
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
leaving her alone

262
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,220
in the hospital.

263
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,780
Do you even have a conscience?

264
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,140
I heard you've started
creating new dishes.

265
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,980
All this has proved your ability.

266
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,740
Neither of us really lost anything.

267
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,900
How is that no loss?

268
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,700
Wang Daxiang, you actually came back.

269
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Does the manager know?

270
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,380
Does Mr. He know?

271
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,540
Forget them.

272
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,860
I could tear you apart myself.

273
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,780
I have my own way of coming back.

274
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,420
I never asked for your help.

275
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,340
Wang Daxiang,
did I help you for nothing?

276
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,420
Of course, I owe you big time.

277
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,140
As for the money I owe you,

278
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,020
I'll return it with interest.

279
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,140
Besides, this restaurant's huge.

280
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,650
How could I set it off
with just a cigarette?

281
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,620
Where were the hotel staff?

282
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
And sprinklers? Cameras?

283
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,860
I took the blame for the higher-ups.

284
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,700
Secretly, maybe they're grateful.

285
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,500
Where did you get the money?

286
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,500
It's my salary, just got paid.

287
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,860
Thanks for visiting my mom.

288
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,700
You're a good person.

289
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,660
Wang Daxiang, did you gamble again?

290
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,540
I honestly see you as a friend!

291
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,820
Tell me the truth.

292
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,700
I'm hurt, go easy on me.

293
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,620
- Hurry up.
- I'm injured here!

294
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,220
Easy...

295
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,260
I went gambling before.

296
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,540
Look at these scars on me.

297
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,500
They're not healed.

298
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Got some on my arm too.

299
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,100
See for yourself.

300
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,890
Forget it, I'll be honest.

301
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,300
Mr. He helped me out.

302
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,460
He looked into it.

303
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,820
I gambled out of desperation

304
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,940
for my mom's surgery.

305
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,620
He covered my expenses

306
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,020
and told me not to say.

307
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,620
If you hadn't pressured me,

308
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,700
I wouldn't have shared this.

309
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,350
I used to think Mr. He

310
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,740
wouldn't care about someone like me.

311
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,020
Give me your hand.

312
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,180
I don't want your money.

313
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,460
Table 5, four people.

314
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Table 3, two people.

315
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,020
One guest is allergic to hazelnuts.

316
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,020
Table 7, two people.

317
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
Beef two ways.

318
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,100
Table 9, three guests.

319
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,060
Beef two ways.

320
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
Table 10, one guest.

321
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,180
Beef two ways.

322
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,340
Yes, Chef!

323
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,060
Sis, are you okay?

324
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,860
Why has no one
ordered bamboo shoot fish?

325
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,180
I'm good, get back to work.

326
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,100
Put things in the fridge after using.

327
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,340
Then move on to the next task.

328
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,620
Did you marinate it

329
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,660
with pepper and salt?

330
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,940
Check it yourself.

331
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,620
Did you add herbs after searing?

332
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,700
No, I didn't.

333
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,540
Do it again.

334
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,140
Table 2.

335
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,620
Three orders of bamboo shoot fish.

336
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,680
Yes, Chef.

337
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,640
Yes, Chef!

338
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,650
Three of the stinky fish.

339
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,020
That's not stinky fish.

340
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,100
It's smoked bamboo shoot cream fish.

341
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,980
This tastes nothing like mine before.

342
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,540
Who are you to teach me?

343
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,420
Why not let our head chef try it?

344
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,430
You're not qualified
to make the sauce yet.

345
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,300
Get out!

346
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,660
New order!

347
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,200
Two orders of bamboo shoot fish.

348
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,380
Yes, Chef!

349
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,100
New order.

350
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,220
Three orders of bamboo shoot fish.

351
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,620
Yes, Chef!

352
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,980
Yes, Chef.

353
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,820
Yes, Chef!

354
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,660
Yes, Chef...

355
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,580
I think this one's too thick.

356
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,100
But this one feels a bit thin.

357
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,060
Any other suggestions?

358
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,260
Your elite world is hard

359
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,110
to understand.

360
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,470
Is this about making clothes
or drinking?

361
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,420
Let me talk to him.

362
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,020
You even managed to find this place?

363
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,980
You really surprise me.

364
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm here for something serious.

365
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,660
So, did you read the files?

366
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,340
Where did you find these people?

367
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,460
Over in Qingwan.

368
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,100
Under the casino's water pipes.

369
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
They stay in all day.

370
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,380
But at night, they're everywhere.

371
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,500
Every deal

372
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,900
in your project isn't small.

373
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,140
Add it up, it's a huge amount.

374
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,500
Didn't I tell you?

375
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,340
I have a big case for you.

376
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,580
Here's the issue I'm facing now.

377
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,460
Because I don't have a lawyer's license,

378
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,260
Putai won't

379
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,780
meet with me.

380
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,740
But you could...

381
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,820
They don't avoid you

382
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,220
because you
lack qualifications, do they?

383
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,460
They don't even care

384
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,700
about the royal legal team.

385
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,220
Chef Fabio from Qingdao Restaurant

386
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,140
has been my idol since I was a kid.

387
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,060
I want you to experience

388
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,940
the level of a master head chef.

389
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,620
He, you're here.

390
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,510
Hello, Fabio.

391
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,900
Congratulations.

392
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,020
- Thanks.
- Have a seat.

393
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,180
Congratulations.

394
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,620
You've finally become the head chef.

395
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,900
- Hello.
- This is Chef Liu Yan.

396
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,300
- Hello.
- She created

397
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,620
our two new dishes.

398
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,580
I'm really curious

399
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,200
about your evaluations of our dishes.

400
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,820
Head Chef Fabio, I just tried

401
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,380
your beef tartare.

402
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,540
The appearance of this tartare

403
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,940
looks like

404
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,220
any other tartare.

405
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,100
But its seasoning

406
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,060
is very unique.

407
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,860
We usually use mustard,

408
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,220
olive oil, and lemon juice.

409
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,380
But you added

410
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,860
crabapple

411
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,580
and pomegranate vinegar.

412
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,700
The tartness of the crabapple

413
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,060
replaced the sourness of lemon

414
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,900
while preserving
the beef's natural flavor.

415
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,020
It's really so different.

416
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,140
So you noticed, huh?

417
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,940
Alright, enjoy your meal.

418
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,660
I'll head back to the kitchen.

419
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,500
Okay.

420
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,470
Do you know
what people like that are called?

421
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,180
Mole people.

422
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,700
Or street rats.

423
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,660
They're all gambling addicts.

424
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,660
You got their money back for them,

425
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,380
but they gamble it all away again.

426
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,460
Why provoke the Putai Group

427
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,980
for their sake?

428
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,980
You think they won't see you

429
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,780
because you lack lawyer qualifications?

430
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,980
That's naive!

431
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,720
Every year,
so many people cause trouble.

432
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,100
Have you seen Gaya's media

433
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,460
report a single word about it?

434
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,060
Honestly, I think

435
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,460
gamblers are not all the same.

436
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,700
Yeah, some people just love to gamble.

437
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,660
But for the mole people,

438
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,820
they started gambling

439
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,840
because they were scammed.

440
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,740
They might

441
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,860
be called gamblers,

442
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,020
but they still have the rights

443
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,380
they deserve.

444
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,860
The law isn't only for the rich

445
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,140
or for people who seem perfect.

446
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,980
Am I right?

447
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,020
Besides,
I actually looked into Putai Group.

448
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,540
What they're running now

449
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,700
is long con, you know?

450
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,380
Mr. He, have you seen this?

451
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,900
The magazine makes it sound

452
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,780
like salted pudding
and smoked bamboo shoot fish

453
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,100
are all thanks to Kanta.

454
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,300
Are we supposed to tell the reporter

455
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,820
that our two new signature dishes

456
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,460
resulted from

457
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,450
a kitchen hand's mistake?

458
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,500
Before Highland gets Three Diamonds,

459
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,500
none of this really matters.

460
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,060
I get it.

461
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,500
Liu Yan,

462
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,020
you handled desserts at Qingdao, right?

463
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,260
Fabio is a fine dining head chef

464
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,180
with the most diamonds

465
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,220
in the world.

466
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,020
Being his sous chef

467
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,900
and pastry chef

468
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,780
is an honor.

469
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,580
You're still here?

470
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,620
Chef Yan is

471
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,260
the team leader for hot dishes now.

472
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,860
It seems

473
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,020
Highland is becoming more down-to-earth.

474
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,340
Fabio once told me,

475
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,980
"A chef's dish shows

476
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,060
who they are."

477
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,580
I really respect him.

478
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,620
I hope you'll value

479
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,660
the chance to cook with him.

480
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,340
Enjoy.

481
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,420
About that matter earlier,

482
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,420
I meant to tell you later.

483
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,700
Are you ready to lead hot line?

484
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,900
I thought you were just

485
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,460
trying to annoy him.

486
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,300
Your new uniform is ready.

487
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,500
But I don't know

488
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,820
if you want to take on this challenge.

489
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,580
I'll grab the new clothes
from the manager.

490
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,460
As a team leader,

491
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,940
you need to build authority

492
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,060
in the kitchen.

493
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,340
Otherwise, you'll lose control,

494
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,340
and the food's perfection won't last.

495
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,180
You also won't reach

496
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,660
the heights you aspire to.

497
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,500
Yes, Chef.

498
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,580
Highland is joining

499
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,060
a TV culinary show soon.

500
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,820
Some parts will be filmed
in the kitchen,

501
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,500
and some will be on livestream
at the TV station.

502
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,420
How will you get there?

503
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,020
Can you stop bothering me?

504
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,860
Just do whatever you want.

505
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,220
Can you even control it?

506
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,820
It's not about control.

507
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,140
The problem with Putai is

508
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,180
that they've set up

509
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,280
an industrial chain transitioning

510
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,260
from investment schemes to gambling.

511
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,300
Do you get what I mean?

512
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,020
Honestly, these mole people

513
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
are really struggling.

514
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,060
No one would willingly

515
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,220
provoke the Putai Group.

516
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,340
Do you get it or not?

517
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,060
I'm going to try on clothes.

518
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,060
Please select some suitable outfits

519
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,940
for Miss Liu.

520
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,100
Mr. He, that's really not needed.

521
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,880
Mr. He, are you sure this jacket

522
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,730
is meant to be draped,

523
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,860
not worn?

524
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,940
You need to come out,
so I can see properly.

525
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,820
This...

526
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,980
Is it hot or cold?

527
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,020
It actually looks great.

528
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,220
Mr. He, maybe I should change back.

529
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,900
This one's really expensive.

530
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,060
Trust me.

531
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,780
No, but...

532
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,140
Oh wow!

533
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,180
Mr. Lu, what a coincidence.

534
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,860
Do you think it works for you?

535
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,180
I'll follow your advice.

536
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,380
I think...

537
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,220
What do you think?

538
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,060
Let me pick a few more for you.

539
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,620
What brings you here?

540
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,780
I came to ask someone for help.

541
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,740
Did you get it done?

542
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,820
All settled.

543
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,220
I've got something to do,
so I'll head out.

544
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,100
I have an announcement.

545
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,620
Starting today,

546
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,740
Liu Yan is in charge of the hot line.

547
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,620
Liu Yan,

548
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,750
impressive!

549
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,900
Awesome! Congrats, sis.

550
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,780
Been here for so long
and still wash dishes?

551
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,260
Hold up, Matsuo.

552
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,540
If you cut them one by one,

553
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,460
it'll take too long.

554
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,780
So you need to cut five at once.

555
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,580
Hold it like this
and cut like this, okay?

556
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,900
- Otherwise, it takes too long.
- Okay.

557
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,260
Use this flour sieve net.

558
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,740
That one's too coarse.

559
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,580
Alright.

560
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,500
Not enough butter added.

561
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,420
Add more butter.

562
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,180
Excuse me, staff ID GK0235,

563
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,540
Liu Yan, from Beijing, China.

564
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
Please come with us

565
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,500
and cooperate with the investigation.

566
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,300
- You mean me?
- Yes.

567
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300
The police say
you may have worked here illegally.

568
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,420
They need you to go with them

569
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,340
for questioning.

570
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,900
Now?

571
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,500
Yes, right now.

572
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,060
(Liu Yan)

573
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,340
Officer, no,

574
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,260
isn't it a minute and a half

575
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,780
before your shift ends?

576
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,700
We could talk.

577
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,820
Because I'm actually

578
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,260
Miss Liu's legal consultant.

579
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,180
So, regarding her case,

580
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,500
I'm fully responsible.

581
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,260
We only handle the arrest.

582
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,820
If you want to talk,

583
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,460
- come back tomorrow morning.
- Got it.

584
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,580
But could you

585
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,500
let her go today,

586
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,780
and we'll return tomorrow?

587
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,740
I've never seen an illegal worker
who ran away come back

588
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,300
to the police station on time.

589
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,420
No, we won't run.

590
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,380
Here's my ID card.

591
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,460
Wait, you can just

592
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,420
keep my ID card for now.

593
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,780
I'll bring her back tomorrow.

594
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,380
Officer, I...

595
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,100
Here.

596
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,180
I can do it myself.

597
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,220
Does it hurt?

598
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,500
Is it sore?

599
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,060
Drink a little more?

600
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,530
But not too much,
or you'll need the restroom.

601
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,260
It's fine, you don't need to do that.

602
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,620
So she can go now?

603
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,500
Mr. He personally vouched for her.

604
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,540
So our director

605
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,940
is taking this matter seriously.

606
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,140
Today, Miss Liu can go home first.

607
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,500
But I hope you

608
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,940
- take this seriously.
- Thank you, Mr. He.

609
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,060
If her identity status

610
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,820
isn't clarified within a month,

611
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,980
Miss Liu must leave Gaya.

612
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,100
- Is there...?
- Thanks for your time.

613
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,100
No trouble.

614
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,220
Thank you.

615
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,380
Yan,

616
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,620
do you understand what he meant?

617
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,620
See you tomorrow.

618
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,140
Thanks, Mr. He.

619
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,460
No need to thank me.

620
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,980
This is a Highland matter.

621
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,860
I'll definitely handle it.

622
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,700
Mr. He,

623
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,380
are you heading back to the restaurant?

624
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,500
Yeah, I am.

625
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,860
There's still unfinished business

626
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,860
in the kitchen.

627
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,820
I'm a bit worried.

628
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,100
Let me go back with you.

629
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,460
- Sure.
- Wait, hold on.

630
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,940
I need to speak seriously

631
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,260
about this visa issue.

632
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,300
Aren't you still my client?

633
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,420
Yeah, I still am.

634
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,660
How much longer?

635
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,660
Plenty enough to discuss this.

636
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,380
But not too long either.

637
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,660
Mr. He, I won't trouble you anymore.

638
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,340
I'll get a ride back with Lu Tianchi.

639
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,660
We can settle things in the car.

640
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,980
I promise it won't affect my work.

641
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,020
Alright.

642
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,260
See you at the restaurant.

643
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,260
See you soon.

644
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,380
Thank you, Mr. He.

645
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,720
Let's go.

646
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,780
Didn't you want to talk?

647
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,860
Still hurting?

648
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,780
Aren't you going to talk to me?

649
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,340
Okay, let's talk then.

650
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,340
Go on, say it.

651
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,820
Gaya, to attract

652
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
gamblers worldwide,

653
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,100
has always

654
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,060
turned a blind eye

655
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,140
to its residency permits.

656
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,780
But why did they end up checking you?

657
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,300
Have you considered

658
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,050
it might be because your promotion
was too fast and made enemies?

659
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,140
I've had bad luck since I was a kid.

660
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,780
Any good luck I had
went to my mom's bets.

661
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,700
I'm used to it now.

662
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,740
Report information gets entered

663
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,190
into the computer system immediately.

664
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,900
So even He Guangyuan
can't stop the police.

665
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,380
You keep bringing up He Guangyuan.

666
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,420
He buys you clothes

667
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,620
and personally bails you out.

668
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,780
Now you're really on another level.

669
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,220
If...

670
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,660
Highland could sign

671
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,100
a long-term contract with me,

672
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,780
very long,

673
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:40,860
could I apply

674
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,380
for that long-term residence visa?

675
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,660
It's possible, sure.

676
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,100
But that application

677
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,540
basically takes two to three years.

678
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,500
You only have a month now.

679
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,660
So what do we do now?

680
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,540
There's an easy way.

681
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,100
You can apply for

682
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,460
a cohabitation certificate.

683
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,740
What?

684
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,100
A cohabitation certificate.

685
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,340
It's not a big deal.

686
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,550
A lot of new Gaya immigrants

687
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,700
start out this way.

688
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,980
Just find a local person

689
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,740
and hold some assets yourself.

690
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,620
Then,

691
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,140
make a joint contract.

692
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
As long as you two have

693
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,620
a shared mailing address

694
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,700
and a bill address.

695
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,160
After that, take some regular photos,

696
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,460
like a couple of pictures as proof.

697
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,140
You can get it done.

698
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,140
You're a lawyer, and this is your idea?

699
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,220
You only have one month.

700
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,620
Think about it, it's up to you.

701
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,900
This is really out there!

702
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,300
Fine, decide for yourself.

703
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,180
Keep working.

704
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,420
Don't stop!

705
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,940
Liu Yan,

706
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,900
many people have no passports,

707
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,140
let alone visas.

708
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,500
Why are you so unlucky?

709
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,900
Someone reported me.

710
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,100
Who was it?

711
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,300
Someone from our kitchen?

712
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,500
No idea.

713
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,580
Sis,

714
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,100
I heard Mr. He rescued you?

715
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,340
Mr. He really treats you well.

716
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,820
Curly,

717
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,060
you missed a spot over there.

718
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,300
Daxiang, come here and check this.

719
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,580
This part isn't clean yet.

720
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,460
(Staff Only)
Right away.

721
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,780
Geez, what took so long?

722
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,340
Being a hot line leader isn't easy.

723
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,060
Go inside where it's cooler to chat.

724
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,340
Let's talk right here.

725
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,940
Let's just stay here.

726
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,980
You've got some strength.

727
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,100
So, for your own good,

728
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
I think

729
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,020
before we start, you should know

730
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,900
a bit about these people.

731
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,940
Alright.

732
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,420
Right now, it's just these three.

733
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,180
They meet the criteria.

734
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,020
And once you sign the contract,

735
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,300
they can immediately provide

736
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,350
the cohabitation services.

737
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,540
These people

738
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,380
all have houses,

739
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,260
and you'd have a separate bedroom.

740
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,500
But during your

741
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,540
contract period,

742
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,340
you'd have to live together frequently.

743
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,420
And while you're together,

744
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,860
you need to take

745
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,100
lots of close-up photos and videos,

746
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,300
anything proving

747
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,860
your romantic relationship.

748
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,100
For example, things like...

749
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,220
this.

750
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,740
Like this one here?

751
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,580
Someone took it in a bathtub.

752
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,820
Yeah, people like that.

753
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,260
And this kind,

754
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,620
hugging on the sofa.

755
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,180
Essentially, make it look

756
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,420
as real as possible.

757
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,420
Though sometimes,

758
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,820
fake becomes real.

759
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,820
Like this couple,

760
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,420
they ended up having two kids.

761
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,940
Just get a general idea.

762
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,500
They all look pretty decent.

763
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,340
What about this one?

764
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,940
Looks good to me.

765
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,220
Bald though. You like that?

766
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,820
He's a postdoctoral researcher.

767
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,100
He could even

768
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,220
help Li Zan with tutoring.

769
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,420
Right,

770
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,020
this one has
two critically ill elders at home.

771
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,340
If you live with him,

772
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,540
you'd need to help

773
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,980
care for them too.

774
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,060
So when you take photos,

775
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,060
they even bring

776
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,980
the older people in

777
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,300
to make it believable.

778
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,660
How about this one? Seems good too.

779
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,180
This guy's pretty young.

780
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,780
And honestly, quite handsome.

781
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,300
You think he's handsome?

782
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,980
Yeah, he is.

783
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,900
He's been divorced three times.

784
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,500
The Immigration Bureau

785
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,660
catches this type immediately.

786
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,580
Cohabitation fraud

787
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,140
is a really serious crime.

788
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,660
Five years. 250,000 US dollars.

789
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,500
Can you handle that?

790
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,860
Wait, didn't you find them for me?

791
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,140
Which one do you think fits?

792
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,300
Right now,

793
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,580
it's because time is very tight.

794
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,540
So currently,

795
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,500
these are the only qualified ones.

796
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,580
Well...

797
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,860
If you think this plan works,

798
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,460
I'll try harder

799
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,060
to find you

800
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,860
one more.

801
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,940
Sounds good.

802
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,500
Then help me find someone

803
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,340
you think is suitable
for me to live with.

804
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,820
Does it work?

805
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,140
I trust you.

806
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,140
Counting on you now.

807
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,980
Let me know, help me out.

808
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,860
Really can?

809
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,220
- I'm off.
- Uh, I...

810
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,260
Then...

811
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,580
Grab me some ice water.

812
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,620
Let's all wish Shuangshuang

813
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,540
a happy marriage.

814
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,800
Happy marriage!

815
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,780
Take a photo, come on.

816
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,500
Okay, three, two, one, congrats!

817
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,820
Don't just edit yourself.

818
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,780
Where to? Don't leave.

819
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,900
Alright, we're heading out.

820
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,540
- Bye.
- Bye!

821
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,330
Take care on your way home.

822
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,580
- Sure.
- Bye!

823
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Why is everyone gone?

824
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,300
They're all my fans, you know.

825
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,660
They love me.

826
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,660
What about that girl
who toasted me just now?

827
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,500
No idea who she is.

828
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,060
What about the people I invited?

829
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,380
You're the only one who came!

830
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,340
I'm about to fall.

831
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,180
I'm slipping, help me out.

832
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,220
What's up with you and Lu Tianchi?

833
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,780
- Who?
- You and Lu Tianchi.

834
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,700
I don't even know the brand.

835
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,900
Is this also a gift

836
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,740
from Mr. He?

837
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,220
Yeah.

838
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,950
Mr. He treats you so well.

839
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,020
Does Lu Tianchi know about this?

840
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,860
The other day, Mr. He took me shopping,

841
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,500
and we actually ran into Lu Tianchi.

842
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,780
Did he totally lose it?

843
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,380
Not really, he seemed pretty chill.

844
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,860
Honestly,

845
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,180
Lu Tianchi feels like

846
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,540
he's not good enough for you.

847
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,100
He's afraid of hindering your job

848
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,700
at Highland,

849
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
and he's afraid

850
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,420
you'll suddenly go back to Beijing.

851
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,980
Basically, he's never sure of himself.

852
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,530
That's why he doesn't dare
take a step forward.

853
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,580
But now,

854
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,420
seeing Mr. He

855
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,500
treat you so well,

856
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,340
I have a feeling

857
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,220
that he's panicking inside.

858
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,460
This is really the new Tiffany.

859
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,900
It's super hard to get.

860
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,180
If you like it, it's yours!

861
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,140
Here, take it!

862
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,020
Then... I'll just try it on.

863
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,880
Let me help you put it on.

864
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,660
Wait a second.

865
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Don't touch around.

866
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,180
Hey, what happened here?

867
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,020
Why is there such a big bruise?

868
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,100
Does it look good?

869
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,790
Yeah, it looks great.

870
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,460
You are

871
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,420
the prettiest girl

872
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,140
I know.

873
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,420
But,

874
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,780
are you really sure
about getting married?

875
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,660
Shouldn't we be a bit careful with this?

876
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,860
At worst,

877
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,540
just get married and split later.

878
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,580
Cheers to my happiness.

879
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,060
You must be happy.

880
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,220
(Little turtle,
can you please bless Shuangshuang,)

881
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,580
(all my friends and coworkers,)

882
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,980
(and that little brat,)

883
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,100
(Lu Tianchi?)

884
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,020
Putai, liar!

885
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,380
Raise your signs!

886
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,180
Putai, liar!

887
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,020
Raise your signs!

888
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,100
Hold your signs up!

889
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,580
Putai, liar!

890
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,300
Putai, liar!

891
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,860
Putai, liar!

892
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,220
(Lam Kee Tea, Grocery)

893
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,020
Hello, Lu Tianchi Legal Advice.

894
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,220
Lu Tianchi,

895
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,500
I'm about to leave Gaya

896
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,740
with Pierre.

897
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,660
Won't you even say goodbye?

898
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,020
Wait, what number

899
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,220
are you calling me from?

900
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,860
This is Pierre's new number for me.

901
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,140
Looks like he really cares about you.

902
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,580
Hey,

903
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,300
well...

904
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,820
You were with Liu Yan,

905
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,820
and you two got drunk yesterday,

906
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
right?

907
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,220
Yeah, we talked about
a lot of heartfelt things.

908
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,960
If you keep stalling,

909
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,300
Liu Yan will be snatched away.

910
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,540
Who'd snatch her?

911
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,220
Stop pretending.

912
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,740
You saw it yourself.

913
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,620
Aren't you worried about He Guangyuan?

914
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,900
He's rich and good-looking.

915
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,100
Plus, he has great taste.

916
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,140
Why so quiet now?

917
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,140
Jealous, huh?

918
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,500
Why would I be jealous?

919
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,060
I just feel like

920
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,100
I'm not good enough for her.

921
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,820
No idea what He Guangyuan is thinking.

922
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,660
Lu Tianchi,

923
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,900
I've already found my happiness.

924
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,020
And I hope you

925
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,980
find yours too.

926
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,220
She's not like other girls.

927
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,580
She doesn't get

928
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,820
those love games everyone plays.

929
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,580
You really need to be more direct.

930
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,340
Alright, I got it.

931
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,580
Just live your life, okay?

932
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,900
Take care. Bye.

933
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,700
Hello,

934
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,060
do you need

935
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,020
anything else?

936
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,300
Hello, is this Lu Tianchi?

937
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,220
Hello,

938
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,020
Lu Tianchi Legal Advice.

939
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,980
Who am I speaking to?

940
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,900
I'm calling on behalf of Jiang Sheng,

941
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,140
Vice President of Putai Group.

942
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,180
We'd like to meet you.

943
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
What can I

944
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,860
do for you?

945
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,540
We'd like to discuss

946
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,100
the settlement of compensation.

947
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
So, this can be...

948
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,860
withdrawn immediately, right?

949
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,990
Yes, Mr. Lu.

950
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,980
A one-time withdrawal.

951
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,350
This is what you're owed.

952
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,020
How you distribute this money

953
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,010
amongst your friends

954
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,430
is your personal freedom.

955
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,560
We all know in Gaya,

956
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,740
when gamblers get cash,

957
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,060
it can lead to trouble.

958
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,340
So,

959
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,260
if you choose not to share,

960
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,980
you're actually helping them.

961
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,940
That was quick!

962
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,860
Wait, why are you here?

963
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,660
If something's up, I'll call you.

964
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,940
I'm the first initiator

965
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,020
of the primary plaintiff.

966
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,380
I have the duty to know

967
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,380
how things are going,

968
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,380
right?

969
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,060
Got it?

970
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,420
Impressive!

971
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,860
How much is it?

972
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,980
Let me open it.

973
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,020
A check.

974
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,140
I can feel

975
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,620
the other party's sincerity.

976
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,180
How much?

977
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,420
I didn't tear it!

978
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,900
Why is it only half?

979
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,780
I tore it.

980
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,140
You tore it?

981
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,420
Why did you do that?

982
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,340
Was it not enough?

983
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,020
500,000.

984
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,020
500,000?

985
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,780
In US dollars.

986
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,300
500,000 dollars?

987
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,140
Why did you tear it up?

988
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,380
Is this even your money?

989
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,900
That's my friends' money.

990
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,380
What gives you the right to rip it up?

991
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,380
As your legal counsel,

992
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,580
I know what the best solution

993
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,260
is for the client.

994
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,060
Are you upset that the pay's too low?

995
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,820
You just want your commission, right?

996
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,700
I did the work.

997
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,940
So what if I want my commission?

998
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,980
That's only fair.

999
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,740
Do you know every single plaintiff here

1000
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,420
was each cheated out
of nearly a million?

1001
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,420
Adding late fees over the years

1002
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,540
and other damages too.

1003
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,500
Do you know Putai Group

1004
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,530
owes each of them at least

1005
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,780
500,000 dollars in compensation?

1006
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:19,900
But now?

1007
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,100
They offer 500,000 dollars

1008
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,620
to settle this privately?

1009
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,640
Do you think I'm the fool,

1010
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,490
or are they the fools?

1011
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,460
You're the fool!

1012
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,020
Once this goes to court,

1013
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,060
have you ever seen a judge

1014
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,740
who treats gamblers fairly?

1015
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,780
What are the odds

1016
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,220
you'd win this case?

1017
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,660
Now they're willing

1018
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,420
to put up 500,000 to solve the problem.

1019
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,220
This is a windfall!

1020
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,100
Don't you know?

1021
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,500
According to the original plan,

1022
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,900
we take this through the legal process

1023
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,180
and make them pay out
those 25 million bucks.

1024
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,340
If that happens,

1025
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,820
your commission
could easily top a million.

1026
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,700
Lu Tianchi,

1027
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,500
trust me. I want to make money

1028
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,180
more than you do, right?

1029
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,200
But from filing the case to trial,

1030
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,530
then waiting for the compensation,

1031
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,580
how long will that take?

1032
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,740
Five years, maybe even eight.

1033
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,740
All these years,

1034
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,220
day after day,

1035
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,580
these are real people here.

1036
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,820
How many are

1037
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,740
being hunted down?

1038
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,020
How many commit suicide?

1039
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,180
How many need medical care?

1040
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,490
How many need to spend that money?

1041
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,460
Do you even realize that?

1042
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,940
You haven't been scammed like this,

1043
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,060
so you don't get it at all.

1044
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,300
Why act like you're the expert?

1045
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,340
Of course I get it!

1046
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,760
Mr. Lu, the bottom line is,

1047
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,780
they're offering 500,000 dollars

1048
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,660
to settle all of this now.

1049
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,140
We've already hit the jackpot.

1050
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,180
You get what I mean?

1051
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,060
Yeah, I get it.

1052
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,260
So, about this 500,000...

1053
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,980
I can still talk

1054
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,820
to Putai Group.

1055
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,380
But once we get the money,

1056
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,620
how do you want to split it?

1057
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,020
Of course, we'll decide together.

1058
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,860
Right?

1059
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,700
You did most of the work.

1060
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,420
You've been running around nonstop.

1061
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,060
Honestly, I don't really care.

1062
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,460
How about you decide the split?

1063
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,460
I'd never sell you out.

1064
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,820
As for this 500,000,

1065
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:29,900
the others...

1066
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,140
don't have to know.

1067
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,900
Are you going right now?

1068
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,380
What?

1069
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,460
- Come on, get out.
- No, I'm not!

1070
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,300
I thought

1071
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,780
you wanted to help your friends.

1072
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,700
Now I see you want this money

1073
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,780
to gamble, right?

1074
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,140
You're a hopeless gambler at heart.

1075
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,180
Why do you blame

1076
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,380
the kid?

1077
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,420
I've long suspected

1078
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,230
the stories you told Liu Yan
were all made up.

1079
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,540
Don't expect

1080
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,420
to squeeze money out of me.

1081
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,900
Lu Tianchi,

1082
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,820
stop pretending to be the good guy.

1083
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,430
You took this case

1084
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,060
to exploit

1085
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,620
their miserable stories,

1086
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,580
win the lawsuit,

1087
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,420
and make a lot more money,

1088
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,620
didn't you?

1089
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,160
- Step outside.
- How am I different from you?

1090
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,460
Be gentle!

1091
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,300
Come out, now.

1092
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,460
I know you're strapped for cash.

1093
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,380
If you want to get something

1094
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,780
out of this mess,

1095
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:22,940
from now on,

1096
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,380
stop asking Liu Yan for money.

1097
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,380
All the troubles in her life

1098
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,740
were caused by your lies.

1099
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,460
When did I ever hurt her?

1100
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,780
Say it straight.

1101
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,660
Why can't I go see her?

1102
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,260
Besides, she's my own daughter!

1103
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,120
I brought her into this world!

1104
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,990
If I want to reach out, I will!

1105
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,100
Don't walk away.

1106
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,060
Come back down!

1107
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,220
Lu Tianchi, come down here!

1108
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,460
You...

1109
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,940
