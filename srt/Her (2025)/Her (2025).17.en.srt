What are you doing?

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,860
Come down, hurry.

17
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,100
Don't break it.

18
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,730
Look, this one's for sale.

19
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,460
This one, yes.

20
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,100
I'll sell that one to buy this one.

21
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,530
No, no. Cheaper?

22
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,810
Don't haggle.

23
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,130
Deal.

24
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,220
You need money fast?

25
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,720
It's for a good thing.

26
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,020
=Episode 17=

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,140
What are you thinking?

28
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,930
You're broke,

29
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,860
and you still won't take
half a million dollars?

30
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,860
The compensation should be
over a hundred million yuan.

31
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,760
Half a million dollars

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,410
is too little.

33
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,530
Would you accept that?

34
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,290
That number is just hypothetical.

35
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,380
With Putai Group's power,

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,690
it isn't something

37
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,850
you can take down

38
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,060
just by digging up a few rats.

39
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,530
Besides,

40
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,500
look at those gamblers.

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,790
No one wants to fight a lawsuit

42
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,900
for a bunch of gamblers.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,500
Any money we win for them

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,410
would be wasted.

45
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,620
Exactly, so not a single cent

46
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,130
of the money I win will go to them.

47
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,180
What do you mean?

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,780
Ideally, here's how it would go.

49
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,410
I'd win the full compensation.

50
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,660
If it's 500,000 dollars each,

51
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,340
that's a huge sum.

52
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,460
Then I'd work
with the gambling rehab center

53
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,380
at the police station
to set up a special fund.

54
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,690
We'd open

55
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,250
a dedicated bank account

56
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,530
and deposit

57
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,690
all the compensation into it,

58
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,660
and everyone involved

59
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,620
would have to go through rehab first.

60
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,730
Only after they

61
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,850
quit gambling

62
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,290
can they claim

63
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,940
their compensation with proof.

64
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,780
How great that'd be.

65
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,370
Impressive.

66
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,460
No wonder you were a top student.

67
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,010
But I have a suggestion.

68
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,530
With just this data,

69
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,850
how do you file a case?

70
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,970
You'll need at least

71
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,690
ten times the number of plaintiffs

72
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,940
to initiate a class action.

73
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,570
You can pursue it as illegal fundraising

74
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,290
or a fraudulent

75
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,690
investment scheme.

76
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,340
That's a good idea.

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,300
Why are you here?

78
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,900
I came to talk about something.

79
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,340
Is it okay to drink this so late?

80
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,660
I really can't stand anymore.

81
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,580
Why hasn't the car arrived yet?

82
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,030
Why not talk in your car?

83
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,290
I didn't drive today.

84
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,970
Maybe you should take a cab.

85
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,530
What's up?

86
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,100
I found the right person to apply

87
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,930
for your cohabitation certificate.

88
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,460
Since your current contract

89
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,580
is almost up,

90
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,900
you need to decide asap

91
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,040
whether you want to proceed.

92
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,260
How much time do I have left?

93
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,100
Fifteen minutes.

94
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,900
You'd better make up your mind soon.

95
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,220
You're the one who came to me today.

96
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,140
This doesn't count.

97
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,930
Today doesn't count. It's fine.

98
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,290
Then let me see the documents.

99
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,060
Documents?

100
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,260
I think...

101
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,170
I think it's better

102
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,220
if you meet in person,

103
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,170
see if you two click,

104
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,780
and check

105
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,050
if this person is

106
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,500
honest

107
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,540
and kind.

108
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,740
- So...
- Well.

109
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,450
Well.

110
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,700
How about the day after tomorrow?

111
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,780
In the alley behind your place.

112
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,530
Does this person you picked

113
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,970
have any conditions for me?

114
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,170
Do I need to prepare anything?

115
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,050
No, nothing.

116
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,220
One more thing.

117
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,660
I'll definitely take Li Zan

118
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,970
back to Beijing for college.

119
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,410
This visa is only for use

120
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,490
while I'm working.

121
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,820
When I cancel
the cohabitation certificate,

122
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,100
will that person cooperate?

123
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,530
Well, if...

124
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,820
If it comes to that

125
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,850
and you must leave Gaya,

126
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,730
I promise this person won't

127
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,490
pester you.

128
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,140
See you the day after tomorrow.

129
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,940
Yan.

130
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,370
Mr. He.

131
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,820
Are you heading home?

132
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,860
I'll give you a ride.

133
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,900
It's fine. I'll wait a bit longer.

134
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,820
You're tired.

135
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,020
Why don't you get in the car?

136
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,410
OK, I'm leaving. I'm exhausted.

137
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,290
Mr. He, I'll take the car.

138
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,420
Wait.

139
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,350
How long did you say I have left

140
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,200
on our contract?

141
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,570
Mr. He.

142
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,340
Is 15 minutes enough to get to my place?

143
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,340
It's late. It should be fine.

144
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,610
Thanks for the trouble.

145
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,810
Don't mention it.

146
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,020
It tastes good if you get used to it.

147
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,610
But don't be like me.

148
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,020
With too much iced Americano at night,

149
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,020
you'll lose sleep.

150
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,660
Don't drink mine.

151
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,020
I'll move forward a bit.

152
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,140
Why don't you move up a little too?

153
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,980
Sure.

154
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,010
Thanks.

155
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,050
Then I'll move up a bit, too.

156
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,180
Mr. He,

157
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,100
could you please

158
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,490
turn up the AC a bit?

159
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,220
You mean this one?

160
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,820
Thanks.

161
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,850
No problem.

162
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,690
Are you cold?

163
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,940
No.

164
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,250
OK.

165
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,420
Tell me if you're cold.

166
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,650
I already said I'm not cold.

167
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,240
I just don't want you to be cold.

168
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,220
(Staff Only)

169
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,890
11 minutes before we start.

170
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,060
Hurry, hurry.

171
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,130
Yes, Chef.

172
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,420
One guest ordered Qiangguo noodles.

173
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,600
Nothing else?

174
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,650
No, she said she'd order more
after the noodles.

175
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,700
She also asked me to pick a wine
to pair with it.

176
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,450
She's probably here to make trouble.

177
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,590
What if it's a journalist

178
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,710
or a critic?

179
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,460
This is when they come for reviews.

180
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,770
Better safe than sorry.

181
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,340
She said she just wants

182
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,400
a bite of home-style food.

183
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,460
Qiangguo noodles are easy.

184
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,340
I'll take care of it.

185
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,010
I need tomatoes, scallions,

186
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,420
and that curly Italian pasta.

187
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,180
Got it. Matsuo, pass me a scallion.

188
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,330
Mr. He.

189
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,180
Qiangguo noodles.

190
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,490
Just a moment.

191
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,700
The guest was really satisfied.

192
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,850
She finished the whole bowl.

193
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,140
She said she wants to meet
the chef who made the noodles.

194
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,140
Salty.

195
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,340
Don't let her in.

196
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,130
Salty, Salty.

197
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,760
Sorry.

198
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,100
The kitchen isn't open to guests.

199
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,700
Please take a seat.

200
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,460
I need to talk to you, Salty.

201
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,650
Please sit down.

202
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,090
How is it?

203
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,230
What do you think of the new look?

204
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,540
Am I

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,870
handsome?

206
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,340
Are you alright?

207
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,820
Why are you here again?

208
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,370
I came to talk

209
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,460
about the cohabitation certificate.

210
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,490
We had an appointment.

211
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,300
Are you okay?

212
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,300
We need to talk.

213
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,100
What's wrong?

214
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,820
Jiang Fang came to the restaurant today.

215
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,250
What did she say to you?

216
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,730
I didn't hear clearly.

217
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,910
I turned and went back to the kitchen.

218
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,220
Didn't you want to see her?

219
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,730
But she showed up so suddenly...

220
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,570
I didn't know

221
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,370
how to face her.

222
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,000
So, are we still talking

223
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,180
about the cohabitation certificate?

224
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,780
Yes, we are.

225
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,850
Salty.

226
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,570
Salty.

227
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,460
Salty, don't go. Salty.

228
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,030
Salty, Salty.

229
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,890
I know you're angry.

230
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,730
I know you're upset.

231
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,650
But Salty, please believe me.

232
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,970
I was wrong. I really was.

233
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,650
All these years,

234
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,520
I've been missing you.

235
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,850
I've been missing you every day.

236
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,300
Yet you never contacted me

237
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,440
after 12 years and 6 months?

238
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,180
No, Salty.

239
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,700
That's not it.

240
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,250
After I got here,

241
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,890
so many things happened.

242
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,850
It was a mess. I couldn't handle it.

243
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,340
I couldn't go back and get you.

244
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,300
Do you understand?

245
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,540
I couldn't even go to see you.

246
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,820
But it's all better now.

247
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,850
Everything's settled.

248
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,670
What did you settle?

249
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,040
I was the one who paid your debts.

250
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,060
Yes, yes, I know.

251
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,300
That's why I'm here.

252
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,100
Salty, look.

253
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,330
Look.

254
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,610
Do you remember this?

255
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,340
This was our token.

256
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,130
We said next time we saw each other,

257
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,100
we'd bring it out.

258
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,090
Right?

259
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,300
It must've been hard

260
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,700
for you to find it, Jiang Fang.

261
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,010
It looks a lot like the one I had.

262
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,100
Too bad it's not the same.

263
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,330
Do you know what's the funniest?

264
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,420
I have yours.

265
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,220
You must've been in a hurry
when you ran off

266
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,410
and forgotten to take it.

267
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,060
Yes, yes, really.

268
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,930
When I ran away,

269
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,980
I almost lost my life,

270
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,890
so I left it behind.

271
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,950
Lu Tianchi, take me home.

272
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,130
Even if it's a substitute,

273
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,340
it proves that I...

274
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,820
Don't go, please.

275
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,060
She's made herself clear.

276
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
Stop bothering her, okay?

277
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,130
Lu Tianchi, this is
between my daughter and me.

278
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,130
Why are you interfering?

279
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,500
You know him?

280
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,900
Of course.

281
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,900
Lu Tianchi,

282
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,610
you didn't tell Salty

283
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,690
that we knew each other?

284
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,890
You're so cruel.

285
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,730
Lu Tianchi.

286
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,100
What's going on?

287
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,130
I'll explain everything later.

288
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,480
Explain my foot. Let me tell you.

289
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,700
- Don't.
- Don't believe her.

290
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,850
We've long known each other.

291
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,170
Six months? At least six months.

292
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,110
There were several times
I wanted to see Salty,

293
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,890
- and you stopped me.
- One question.

294
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,710
Have you two known each other all along?

295
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,690
Yeah.

296
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,370
I'm such an idiot.

297
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,210
- Liu Yan.
- Salty.

298
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,130
Don't follow me.

299
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,260
- Don't follow me.
- Salty.

300
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,890
Salty, don't go.

301
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,890
I'm dying.

302
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,340
Terminal illness.

303
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,020
Just give me one more chance.

304
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,660
You're back.

305
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,740
Why so late?

306
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,820
Do you get overtime pay
for working this late?

307
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,660
Come in.

308
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,940
Who's here?

309
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,180
Zan.

310
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,210
My goodness.

311
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,100
Long time no see.

312
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,780
Holy hell.

313
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,020
What terminal illness?

314
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:26,940
Brain tumor.

315
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,060
When were you diagnosed?

316
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,780
Just recently.

317
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,380
Which hospital?

318
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,740
A hospital in Indonesia.

319
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,540
Do you need surgery?

320
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,460
How long do you have?
How much is the surgery?

321
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,660
Where's the medical report?

322
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,060
The results aren't good.

323
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,900
I don't plan to get treated.

324
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,060
I think it's called a brainstem tumor.

325
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,540
I know you don't believe me.

326
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,180
I won't live much longer.

327
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,060
My death will prove it to you.

328
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,300
Jiang Fang,

329
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,980
can you say one thing that's true?

330
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,820
Li Zan,

331
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,820
go to the supermarket
and buy a bedding set.

332
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,300
Sis,

333
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,740
do you really plan to let her move in?

334
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,900
Go now.

335
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,340
She's a liar.

336
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,500
Letting her in is like inviting
a wolf into the house.

337
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,700
Jiang Fang,

338
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,780
I don't believe a word

339
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,900
you just said.

340
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,380
Even if it's true,

341
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,020
don't think we're paying
for your surgery.

342
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,540
Enough, go now.

343
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,820
She never tells the truth.

344
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
She's acting.

345
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,940
It's all fake. Don't trust her.

346
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,780
Go.

347
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,020
Why won't you believe me?

348
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,860
Have you forgotten my phone number?

349
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,460
1361106

350
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,580
325.

351
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,780
010443322.

352
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,180
And then 213.

353
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,020
I remember your number.

354
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,420
Then why didn't you call me?

355
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,620
It's a long story.

356
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,000
When I first got here,

357
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,580
I promised myself

358
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,500
I'd bring you over

359
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,780
as soon as I settled down.

360
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,220
To stay here,

361
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,300
I faked a marriage

362
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,500
with Li Zan's father.

363
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,940
But not long after,

364
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,260
he got sick

365
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,660
and owed debts.

366
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,180
Li Zan's dad

367
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,100
was good to me before,

368
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,460
and the kid was too young

369
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,780
to live alone.

370
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,620
So, I thought

371
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,860
if I could make money

372
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,300
to treat his illness

373
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,500
and bring you over,

374
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,100
wouldn't that be the best?

375
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,820
Unexpectedly,

376
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,140
my luck was so bad back then.

377
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,380
Everything I did lost money.

378
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,260
Li Zan probably told you

379
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,700
about what happened later.

380
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,940
Why was there a car accident?

381
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,620
That day I got up late

382
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,700
and missed the bus,

383
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,420
so...

384
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,820
Later,

385
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,060
things just spiraled.

386
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,240
I only found out what happened

387
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,360
from the news.

388
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,160
I owed Mr. Luo so much money,

389
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,260
so I thought

390
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,860
if this accident could make him think

391
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,700
I was really dead,

392
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,500
maybe my debts

393
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,340
would be written off.

394
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,940
I thought it all through.

395
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,020
However,

396
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,980
you suddenly showed up

397
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,260
and even paid off my debts.

398
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,260
I...

399
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,620
I almost died

400
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,740
trying to clear your debt.

401
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,700
Do you know that?

402
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,220
I do.

403
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,420
I really do.

404
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,860
I went to the hospital.

405
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,580
When I saw you there,

406
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,340
your whole leg was in a cast,

407
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,740
and your face was unrecognizable.

408
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,260
The only one there with you

409
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,580
was Mr. Lu.

410
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,860
I thought...

411
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,460
So, you two met there?

412
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,180
Yeah.

413
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,580
I actually wanted

414
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,380
to stay and look after you,

415
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,060
but...

416
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,500
Mr. Lu said it wasn't a good idea.

417
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,980
So, I left.

418
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,880
You sent the dandelions, right?

419
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,980
Yes.

420
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,460
I remembered your birthday was coming.

421
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,020
After all these years,

422
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,000
I never once celebrated your birthday.

423
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,820
I didn't have much money

424
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,860
and didn't dare disturb you.

425
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,560
Didn't dare disturb me?

426
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,900
If that's true,

427
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,820
why did you show up at Highland today?

428
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,180
I had made up my mind

429
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,940
never to see you again.

430
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,500
But a few days ago,

431
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,560
I started getting headaches every day.

432
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,260
I thought maybe my days were numbered.

433
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,190
The more that feeling grew,

434
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,180
the more I missed you.

435
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,660
I've truly hit rock bottom.

436
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,940
You hit rock bottom,

437
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,420
so you came to Highland to eat first?

438
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,260
That's right.

439
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,140
When you hit rock bottom, eat first.

440
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,620
Then why did you run

441
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,140
when I went to the hotel to see you?

442
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,340
That was my fault.

443
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,100
That night, I had a dream.

444
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
I dreamed about you.

445
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,380
I missed you so much.

446
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,900
I told Mr. Lu

447
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,100
I couldn't take it anymore.

448
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,020
I wanted to see you.

449
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,820
I wanted to see you, Salty.

450
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,980
I begged him to bring you to me.

451
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,420
But before you arrived,

452
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,380
I suddenly remembered

453
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,460
that he once told me

454
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,620
that in my current state,

455
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,500
if I...

456
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,260
If I stayed with you,

457
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,540
you'd suffer.

458
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,900
You'd be in pain.

459
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,740
I...

460
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,380
Salty, should I not have come?

461
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,100
Was it wrong for me to see you?

462
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,700
Did I commit some crime?

463
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,900
Why are you interrogating me like this?

464
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,500
Neither of you believes me.

465
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,340
Salty,

466
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,700
if I wasn't

467
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,940
running out of time,

468
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,060
and if I didn't miss you so much,

469
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,780
I wouldn't have come.

470
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,740
I had planned

471
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,540
never to see you again.

472
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,700
It's all my fault.

473
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,340
Why couldn't I hold back?

474
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,660
My stomach hurts.

475
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,780
Salty, why are you sleeping here?

476
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,140
The bed's wide enough for both of us.

477
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,300
We can squeeze a little.

478
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,460
We're not close enough

479
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,780
to share a bed, are we?

480
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,100
When you were little, you couldn't sleep

481
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
without touching my hair.
Did you forget that?

482
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,660
It's been so many years.

483
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,180
I just want to get closer to you...

484
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,340
I'm fine. Don't move.

485
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,500
Talk to me.

486
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,620
A lot has happened

487
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,580
these years, right?

488
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,230
Obviously.

489
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,180
As soon as I took a bite

490
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
of the noodles today,

491
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,710
I knew they were made by you.

492
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,460
That taste was just like mine.

493
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,830
The scallion oil

494
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,420
was perfectly done.

495
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,740
But

496
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,740
the tomato wasn't good.

497
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,700
It was peeled.

498
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
I guess that's how

499
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,160
Western cuisine does it, right?

500
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,300
Still, I believe

501
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,140
once you blanch a tomato and peel it,

502
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,300
no matter what you do after...

503
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,060
Jiang Fang, are you here

504
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,180
to teach me how to cook?

505
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,660
No.

506
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,980
I couldn't teach you anyway, right?

507
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,640
Chinese and Western cuisine
are different.

508
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,460
The pay at Highland Restaurant

509
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,940
must be great, right?

510
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,660
How much is your monthly wage?

511
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,180
Do you have nothing better to do?

512
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,780
I have to work tomorrow.

513
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,580
Then I'll ask one serious question.

514
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,100
Just one.

515
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,220
Is that Mr. Lu

516
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,700
hitting on you?

517
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,420
- Go to sleep.
- Don't fall for a man's tricks.

518
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,300
Let me tell you.

519
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,420
I'm not you.

520
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,180
He's not your first love, is he?

521
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,180
- Listen.
- One more word,

522
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,420
and I'm moving out.

523
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,140
So noisy.

524
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,620
Did you forget how you were as a kid?

525
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,180
You couldn't sleep without noise.

526
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,220
I remember every day after school,

527
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,020
you'd run

528
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,870
to the back kitchen

529
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,900
to nap.

530
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,980
- Quiet.
- One day...

531
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,900
Enough already.

532
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,860
You're grown-ups now.

533
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,740
My stomach really hurts.

534
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,180
How am I supposed to sleep like this?

535
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,100
Not being able to sleep

536
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,660
every night

537
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,660
is the worst.

538
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,780
Wow.

539
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,660
Yet you fell asleep so soon.

540
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,100
Don't just stand there.

541
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,650
Eat while it's hot. It's tasty now.

542
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,500
Hurry, hurry.

543
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,780
Jiang Fang, you really are ruthless.

544
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,980
You made this, huh?

545
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,660
I've lived with you for ten years.

546
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,300
Whenever you do something awful,

547
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,580
you make a meal to calm me down.

548
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,100
You must want something.

549
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,060
I know exactly

550
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,220
what kind of person you are.

551
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,060
Let me tell you.

552
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,420
I know exactly

553
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,800
where everything is in this house.

554
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,060
You must've stolen something.

555
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,220
Yes, this house

556
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,460
was furnished by you two,

557
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,620
but I bought

558
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,740
this dining table,

559
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,380
and the pots and pans, right?

560
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,220
I'm part of this family too.

561
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,180
- Where's the money?
- What money?

562
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,020
The money in the box.

563
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,380
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

564
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,300
There was money here.

565
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,540
Now, it's gone. Where did it go?

566
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,020
I really don't know.

567
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,580
- I like money, but...
- Stop arguing.

568
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,540
I gave her the money.

569
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,380
Don't try to fool me.
When did you give it?

570
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,660
You slept so soundly.

571
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,020
I gave it to her when I got up.

572
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,060
It's to go buy groceries.

573
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,020
Go buy groceries.

574
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,460
OK.

575
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,540
What do you want for lunch?

576
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,400
Anything is fine.

577
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,640
Then I'll buy whatever I want.

578
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,140
Eat quickly.

579
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,300
It won't taste good cold.

580
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,820
Don't cry after you finish it.

581
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,740
It's delicious.

582
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,060
What are you doing?

583
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,740
Why did you give her the keys?

584
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,140
It's the key to our house.

585
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,580
Are you crazy?

586
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,740
I'll go after her.

587
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,940
Save me a bite.

588
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,820
(Jiang Fang, you really are ruthless.)

589
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,940
(Fine.)

590
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,780
(You win.)

591
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,780
(A few pieces of steamed buns)

592
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,500
(drove my hatred away.)

593
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,540
(I know)

594
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,660
(you might lie to me again.)

595
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,460
(But I'll accept it.)

596
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,980
(At least I)

597
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,500
(have a mother now.)

598
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,500
Ms. Liu,

599
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,260
here's your car key.

600
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,580
Salty...

601
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,500
Yan? Salty?

602
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,740
Shuangshuang, I've been calling you.

603
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,560
Why don't you answer?

604
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,220
I have something to ask.

605
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,260
Which is the best hospital

606
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,660
for a brain tumor in Gaya?

607
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,860
Do you know any

608
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,140
famous brain specialists?

609
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,840
I shouldn't have hidden
Jiang Fang's situation from you.

610
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,660
But the truth is definitely not

611
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,500
what she said.

612
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,700
The day you were in a coma,

613
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,860
she came to the hospital

614
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,940
and then left.

615
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,980
If she came,

616
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,820
why leave?

617
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,620
Because you were unconscious.

618
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,860
You were worthless to her.

619
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,360
She sees you're getting better now,

620
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,180
so she's coming back

621
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,100
for gambling money.

622
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,420
Can't she get close to me

623
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,260
because she misses me,
loves me, and needs me?

624
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,500
Why does it have to be related
to gambling?

625
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,560
I haven't seen anyone
come to collect debt,

626
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,680
so she doesn't owe money.

627
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,620
That doesn't mean

628
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,820
she quit gambling.

629
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,980
It's okay if she hasn't quit.

630
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,460
She's sick now.

631
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,900
It's okay for me to spend money
on my mom's treatment, right?

632
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,860
No, I don't think a terminal illness

633
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,980
could be used as an excuse.

634
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,380
She's my mom.

635
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,900
She doesn't need an excuse

636
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,980
to see her daughter.

637
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,620
What do you want me to do?

638
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,060
Just watch her die?

639
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,300
If she really dies,

640
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,860
I'll regret it.

641
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,500
If you lend her money

642
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,620
because of another lie,
then you'll regret it.

643
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,380
I already regret trusting you.

644
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,780
I just want to protect you.

645
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,660
At least my lie

646
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,700
is a well-meaning one.

647
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,260
Lu Tianchi,

648
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,180
whether Jiang Fang
has quit gambling or not,

649
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,220
and however well-meaning

650
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,980
your lie is,

651
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,940
shouldn't you

652
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,460
have told me?

653
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,780
That's my mom, not yours.

654
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,660
Who gave you the right to decide

655
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,940
whether I should see her or not?

656
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,020
No, one month is too long.

657
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,260
Is there any way to speed it up?

658
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,820
You have my phone number.

659
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,800
If you think of anything,

660
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,700
call me anytime.

661
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,540
Okay?

662
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,820
Mr. He.

663
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,220
Does this affect your mood?

664
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,580
What?

665
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,340
Since your mom came to Highland

666
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,220
to look for you,

667
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,860
you've been like this.

668
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,180
You have six hours

669
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,900
to be away from the kitchen
before dinner.

670
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,740
Speed it up, speed it up.

671
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,060
Coming, coming.

672
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,140
Everyone,

673
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,300
tonight is very important.

674
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,900
The CEO of ZJ Group

675
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,780
and Mr. He's mother

676
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,840
have been longtime friends.

677
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,860
He was one of our earliest guests.

678
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,240
His reputation carries

679
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,560
a lot of weight in the industry.

680
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,770
We hope everyone can offer him

681
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,610
an amazing night.

682
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,260
This is very important for Highland.

683
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,070
French blue lobster.

684
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,280
Obviously, it was air-shipped

685
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,980
from France.

686
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,520
Are we doing carpaccio again this time?

687
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,480
Or lobster pasta?

688
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,360
Yan,

689
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,020
do you remember the test we did before

690
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,580
with the lobster in puff pastry?

691
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,220
Yes.

692
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,980
You said
it wasn't suitable for Highland.

693
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,100
But it's suitable for ZJ.

694
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,100
Good, then let's do that dish today.

695
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,700
Liu Yan and I will handle it.

696
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,660
Kanta,

697
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,500
you take care of the regular dishes.

698
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,820
Hasn't she been a bit off lately?

699
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,780
I can do it.

700
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,620
I can handle it.

701
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,580
The baking timing is very important.

702
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,940
No mistakes are allowed.

703
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,860
Yes, Chef.

704
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,420
Hurry up, hurry up.

705
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,700
Yes, Chef.

706
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,620
(Clinic)

707
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,740
Small onions.

708
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,380
Easy on them.

709
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,180
- Enough.
- Yes, Chef.

710
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
185 degrees, fan speed level 3.

711
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,420
For 10 to 12 minutes.

712
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,260
Yes, Chef.

713
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,140
So many missed calls.

714
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,220
Something might be wrong.

715
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,660
Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on it.

716
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,180
Thanks, Kanta.

717
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,860
Watch the oven for me.

718
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,900
I'll be right back.

719
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,780
Thanks, thanks.

720
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,980
Hello, doctor?

721
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,700
Doctor, can you hear me now?

722
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,940
Sorry, I was inside.

723
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,180
The signal was bad.

724
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,780
Yes, I called you this morning.

725
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,900
I wanted to ask you

726
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,120
about the treatment protocol

727
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,540
for a brain tumor.

728
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,700
I don't understand it.

729
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,260
Please let me
introduce this dish to you.

730
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,820
So, this is the oyster with vichyssoise
and Fuyang tofu skin on top

731
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,420
with a little bit of

732
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,940
Jinhua ham on it.

733
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,460
- Nick.
- Mr. He.

734
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,020
- Hi, Nick.
- Mr. He.

735
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,300
So, Chef He will prepare

736
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,940
a very special lobster dish

737
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,900
for everybody later.

738
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,140
Toast to Chef.

739
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,780
Toast to Chef.

740
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

741
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,500
- Enjoy.
- Thank you very much.

742
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,300
Yes, a family member.

743
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,780
A woman in her fifties.

744
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,700
Where's the lobster?

745
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,100
Where's Liu Yan?

746
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,700
Where's Liu Yan, Kanta?

747
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,140
Where's the head of the hot line?

748
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,100
It's already burnt.

749
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,060
Where did Yan go?

750
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
Cancel the lobster.

751
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Bring the beef now.

752
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,540
Yes, Chef.

753
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,500
Mr. He, I'm sorry.

754
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,420
I know I shouldn't have left today.

755
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,700
I promise it won't happen again.

756
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,460
You're not right for Gaya.

757
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,460
Your visa's about to expire anyway.

758
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,620
The manager will handle

759
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,220
your severance per the contract.

760
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,180
That's not necessary to fire me.

761
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,820
I asked if you wanted to be

762
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,980
someone indispensable.

763
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,900
You said yes.

764
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,980
I do want that.

765
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,480
So, every second you leave the kitchen

766
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,800
is a betrayal of my trust.

767
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,500
I want to lead Highland
to earn Three Diamonds.

768
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,700
I need someone trustworthy

769
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,580
to stand by my side.

770
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,300
You get distracted too easily.

771
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,070
You won't become

772
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,460
an excellent chef this way.
