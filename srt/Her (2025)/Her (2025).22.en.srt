16
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,250
Sorry, Lady.

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,850
- What?
- You're on the blacklist.

18
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,810
You don't remember me?

19
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,020
You must leave now.

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,380
We will not let you in,
even if anyone comes.

21
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,530
David is my friend.

22
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,970
I'm sorry, you must leave.

23
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,020
David!

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,310
- You must leave.
- David...

25
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,410
Hello, what's up?

26
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,970
Hello, Jiang Fang.

27
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,090
I'm home now.

28
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,260
I'm starving. When will you be back?

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,500
I'm buying groceries
right now.

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,340
Just wait a bit.

31
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,530
Boss, I ordered pork belly.

32
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,810
What kind of meat is this?

33
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,540
It's too fatty. How do I eat this?

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,010
Alright, I'll head back soon.

35
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,020
Just wait at home.

36
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,140
When I have money,
I won't even come here if you invite me.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,050
Right here!

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,210
Waiting for me, huh?

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,930
That's so sweet of you.

40
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,770
Quite a splurge, Zan.

41
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,060
When you were young,
you loved these egg tarts.

42
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,900
Remember that?

43
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,010
Yeah, I remember.

44
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,850
This tastes amazing.

45
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,180
So amazing.

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,900
Let's head home. It's boiling out.

47
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,770
Let's eat at home.

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,740
Go on without me.

49
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,740
I'm taking the bus to school.

50
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,650
What's up?

51
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,700
You're not coming with me,

52
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,770
you little sneak?

53
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,180
No.

54
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,090
I used to think it was your fault.

55
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,210
Now I think it's
actually Liu Yan's fault.

56
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,650
She isn't very sharp.

57
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,300
You're totally gaslighting her.

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,460
What?

59
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,060
English?

60
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,740
Go wherever you want.

61
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,260
I'm warning you one last time.

62
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,540
Stay away from Liu Yan.

63
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,650
That's your own daughter.

64
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,740
Jiang Fang,

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,890
try being a decent person.

66
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,780
Here's your appetizer.

67
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,580
It's an otoro

68
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,930
and caviar tartare.

69
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,610
On top is finger lime.

70
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,580
And underneath

71
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,100
is the wild yeast seeded bread

72
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,900
we introduced earlier.

73
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,340
It's sliced thin

74
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,740
and baked into crisps.

75
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,180
Eat it in one bite.

76
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,940
Making things so classy now?

77
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,090
Wait, hold on.

78
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,930
Take your time.

79
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,810
Okay, okay.

80
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,250
Turn up the heat to reduce the sauce.

81
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,180
Yes, Chef!

82
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,020
Each piece must be 0.5 centimeters.

83
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,940
- All right?
- Okay.

84
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,260
Is this 0.5 centimeters?

85
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,370
After each cut,

86
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,530
you should check yourself

87
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,700
if it's 0.5 centimeters.

88
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,570
Okay, got it.

89
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,610
No problem.

90
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,740
Don't worry about it.

91
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,660
Daxiang, the lobster
is almost ready soon.

92
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,100
Add a bit of baijiu.

93
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,700
- Yes, Chef!
- After you add baijiu,

94
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,020
serve it directly on the board.

95
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,860
Yes, Chef!

96
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,930
Everyone, speed up.

97
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,780
Hurry up!

98
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,900
Yes, Chef!

99
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,370
Jiang Fang showed up so suddenly.

100
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,540
I'm afraid she might trick you.

101
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,690
Things are good
between me and Jiang Fang now.

102
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,730
- Are you sure?
- She has changed this time

103
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,850
and quit gambling for good.

104
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,010
Don't worry anymore.

105
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,540
Really.

106
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,930
Salty...

107
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,570
Why are you so fussy?

108
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,970
Aside from Jiang Fang,

109
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,140
is everything else okay?

110
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,010
Yeah, it's all good.

111
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,420
What's up?

112
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,660
Nothing, really.

113
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,130
I'm just asking.

114
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,180
You haven't dated anyone before.

115
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,780
In a foreign land,

116
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,700
I'm afraid

117
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,660
you might get hurt by men.

118
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,100
Alright, stop nagging, let's go.

119
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,780
If you keep nagging,
the plane will take off.

120
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,860
I'm leaving.

121
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,970
I'll go.

122
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,840
Bye.

123
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,410
If you don't reply to my messages,

124
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,300
I'll come over again.

125
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,720
Alright, got it.

126
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,930
It's packed cleaner
than a moving company.

127
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,970
Sold everything

128
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,930
except the tables and chairs?

129
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,010
Look down on them, huh?

130
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,490
What about the little turtle?

131
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,250
What did you say?

132
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
Little turtle.

133
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,300
She even sold the car?

134
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,970
My relationship

135
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,010
with Jiang Fang needs to change.

136
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,340
Since you already think that way,

137
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,340
I think it's better

138
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,260
to seize this chance

139
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,220
to send her
to the gambling addiction center.

140
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,540
Lu Tianchi,

141
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,250
I need to tell you something.

142
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,140
I think I have to move

143
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,100
to Highland to live.

144
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,570
Highland is about to earn diamonds soon.

145
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,610
I'm the sous chef now.

146
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,860
The chefs are still recovering.

147
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,220
I need to help out more.

148
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,220
Weren't we talking about your mom?

149
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,780
How did we switch to Highland?

150
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,560
Can't you work from here, too?

151
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,210
Neither of us has a car now.

152
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,380
If I live here,
I have to take the bus every day.

153
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,050
It's too much time wasted.

154
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,180
But if you're not living at home,

155
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,930
the evidence of cohabitation

156
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,130
we need to collect

157
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,730
won't be enough.

158
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,020
Mr. He said on the way

159
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,500
that Highland Group will guarantee me.

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,660
They'll bring me in as a special talent.

161
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,660
It should be approved.

162
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,420
So, if it's not necessary,
let's not proceed.

163
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,260
Right?

164
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,970
We've put in so much effort.

165
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,850
Lu Tianchi,

166
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,460
during my temple visit,

167
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,020
I figured out a lot.

168
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,420
I came to Gaya

169
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,690
to find Jiang Fang.

170
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,780
Now I stay here

171
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,180
because I have other things
to accomplish.

172
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,420
So,

173
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,210
is earning diamonds

174
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,380
really that important to you?

175
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,650
Or is there someone else

176
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,140
who matters more to you?

177
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,090
Let's discuss this

178
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,660
another day when we have time.

179
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,180
I really don't have time lately.

180
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,940
Can you regularly help send

181
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,690
some food to Wang Daxiang's mom?

182
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,580
No one's looking after her these days.

183
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,970
I'll go pack my things first.

184
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,540
Lu Tianchi, are you leaving?

185
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,620
No, just getting some air.

186
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,180
I'll take you to Highland later.

187
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,810
Lu Tianchi,

188
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,770
(Liu Yan)

189
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,690
thanks for everything.

190
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,180
Good night.

191
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,900
Liu Yan?

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,550
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

193
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,140
What brings you here?

194
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,540
I'm here for work.

195
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,940
No, I mean,

196
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,080
why so early,

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,940
Mr. He?

198
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,500
I come at this time every day.

199
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,180
What time is it now?

200
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,050
It's 5 AM?

201
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,490
Mr. He, do you ever sleep?

202
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,490
Come on, get up now.

203
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,460
Put your clothes on.

204
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,780
Don't sleep on the floor here.

205
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,300
Alright.

206
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,420
Mr. He,

207
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,570
this is Highland Group's hotel.

208
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,680
It's close to the restaurant.

209
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,370
You should stay here for now.

210
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,420
No need, Mr. He.

211
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,780
This is the chef's order.

212
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,210
It's not up for discussion.

213
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,260
Thank you.

214
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,540
I have a question for you.

215
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,260
Go ahead.

216
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,140
I think,

217
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,820
besides assisting the head chef

218
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,090
in making great food,

219
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,730
the sous chef should also

220
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,330
handle team management, right?

221
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,530
Right.

222
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,300
A sous chef is like glue,

223
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,060
always in touch with the staff,

224
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,180
such as interacting

225
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,100
and communicating with the staff.

226
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,060
So the kitchen can be

227
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,850
a cohesive place. Isn't that right?

228
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,100
Highland is very cohesive.

229
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,180
Chef, I think our kitchen

230
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,330
isn't about cohesion.

231
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,540
It's fear.

232
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,740
Everyone is scared of you.

233
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,310
Sous Chef, watch your words.

234
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,730
Well,

235
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,130
during my temple visit,

236
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,730
I figured out a lot.

237
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,620
For example?

238
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,540
For example, earning Three Diamonds

239
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,260
takes a ton of hard work.

240
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,180
But it's not just about cuisine.

241
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,660
Since you made me sous chef,

242
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,700
I really want to take

243
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,900
this responsibility seriously.

244
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,660
So how do you plan to do that?

245
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,300
I think the kitchen should

246
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,420
have its own set of rules.

247
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,610
Even if you're the head chef,

248
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,500
you can't break rules or cheat.

249
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,260
What do you mean?

250
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,900
Is this really pasta?

251
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,780
Does pasta have toppings?

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,720
Kind of the toppings
for noodles with soybean paste.

253
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,140
Have you eaten that?

254
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,340
Yeah, I'm from the north.

255
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,660
Pasta with toppings?

256
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,970
Noodles with soybean paste?

257
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,660
- Smells so good.
- That's it.

258
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,340
I have a few words to say.

259
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,220
Before,

260
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,540
I wasn't confident in myself,

261
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,300
so I often lost my temper.

262
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,060
I didn't consider everyone's feelings.

263
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,010
Today, I want

264
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,260
to sincerely apologize.

265
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,890
Today's staff meal was cooked by me.

266
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,330
Eat well to work well.

267
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,180
Right.

268
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,200
So, starting today,

269
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,180
working on an empty stomach
will result in a pay deduction.

270
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,580
Every night before service,

271
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,890
let's all eat together.

272
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,650
And to make this meal

273
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,770
more enjoyable,

274
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,060
I think we should

275
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,140
change the music.

276
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,540
Change the music?

277
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,090
Will Mr. He allow it?

278
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,930
We've listened to this for years.

279
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,350
Do we really need a new one?

280
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,210
Time to eat!

281
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,890
Alright, let's eat.

282
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,730
- Some manners, please.
- Everyone's ready.

283
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,810
Hand it to me.

284
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,690
Shake before eating.

285
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,260
Mr. He.

286
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,900
Beijing noodles with soybean paste.

287
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,590
What's that music outside?

288
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,690
It's for the noodles.

289
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,020
Give it a try.

290
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,620

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,510
What is this? It's too ugly.

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,220
Ugly? I don't think so.

312
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,580
This is my order as the sous chef.

313
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,300
No room for negotiation.

314

Okay, I'll peel them now.

331
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,340
Chef,

332
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,440
all pudding ingredients at the market

333
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,600
have been completely sold out.

334
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,900
How is that possible?

335
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,140
Who leaked our new menu?

336
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,490
I heard someone

337
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,400
copied the menu

338
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,890
and bought out the ingredients.

339
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,450
If we can't get those ingredients,

340
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,600
what are we supposed to cook?

341
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,590
We can't make any dishes now.

342
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,850
Even desserts are off the table.

343
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,610
Should we try out-of-town suppliers?

344
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,700
Can they deliver in time?

345
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,280
It's too late.

346
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,210
The selection started over a week ago.

347
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,630
If we don't open tomorrow,

348
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,460
Highland basically gives up.

349
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,280
I have a few connections

350
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,540
to get some ingredients.

351
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,850
But what about the salted pudding?

352
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,220
Let's get moving, everyone.

353
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,490
Go grab the other ingredients.

354
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,180
For the vanilla pods in salted pudding,

355
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,180
I'll figure something out.

356
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,580
I'm sorry!

357
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,970
I...

358
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,790
I messed up.

359
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,060
What do you mean?

360
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,210
It was me.

361
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,100
- What?
- How?

362
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,710
I leaked the menu.

363
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,620
During the TV competition,

364
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,030
I was the one
who burned the foie gras, too.

365
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,690
Sorry, I really messed up.

366
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,060
I'm sorry.

367
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,040
I lost another bet,

368
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,180
and I took Philip's money.

369
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,340
You brat!

370
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,820
- Seriously?
- Why did you come back?

371
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,120
Calm down!

372
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,240
Call the police now!

373
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,090
All of you have been so good to me.

Mr. He and Liu Yan

375
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,440
even helped me like that.

376
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,020
Doing this

377
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,460
has been tormenting me.

378
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,760
I have a request.

379
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,380
Please let me try my recipe.

380
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,060
To make amends,

381
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,550
I've been secretly testing it for days.

382
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,650
How could yours possibly

383
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,620
be better than Liu Yan's?

384
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,320
Why even bother coming back now?

385
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,650
No one wanted you to return.

386
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,060
Get out!

387
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,210
Call the police. Right now!

388
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,060
Get lost!

389
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,940
Drag him out!

390
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,800
Wait a second!

391
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,900
Challenging my salted pudding, huh?

392
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,900
We can't let him off so easily.

393
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,450
Let him cook.

394
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,830
Taste it, then call the police.

395
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,580
Wang Daxiang,

396
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,090
if you can't make the pudding
of Three Diamonds,

397
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,330
I'll take you
to the police station myself.

398
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,620
Soybeans. Flour.

399
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,000
Mr. He, please try it.

400
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,600
I'm really disappointed in you.

401
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,380
First,

402
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,700
you crossed the line completely

403
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,900
and sold out Highland.

404
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,970
Second,

405
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,100
you were foolish enough

406
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,920
to think leaking the menu

407
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,800
could threaten

408
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,860
a top-level chef.

409
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,100
Let me tell you,

410
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,700
even with the same recipe

411
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,820
and the same ingredients,

412
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,010
different hands

413
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,990
create different flavors.

414
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,930
Cooking isn't as simple as

415
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,900
following instructions.

416
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,730
After all these years at Highland,

417
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,950
don't you get it?

418
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,900
I know I ruined everything.

419
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,820
I'm sorry.

420
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,730
Really, I'm sorry.

421
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,900
This dessert

422
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,370
is the most special one

423
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,730
you've made since joining Highland.

424
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,530
Because in this dessert,

425
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,940
there's so much of your feeling

426
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,180
and all your emotions.

427
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,810
To win Three Diamonds,

428
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,720
I need the best pastry chef.

429
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,360
Can I still trust you?

430
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,690
I can!

431
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,460
I really want to stay at Highland.

432
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,200
So how will you convince

433
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,290
the other chefs?

434
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,930
I can't promise

435
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,930
I'll quit gambling
completely right away.

436
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,820
But I swear

437
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,310
that I could never quit the kitchen.

438
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,260
It's what I love most

439
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,610
and the only thing I'm good at.

440
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,490
I know trusting me is hard.

441
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,430
But trust your tongues, please.

442
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,820
Please!

443
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,530
Please.

444
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,010
This is insanely good!

445
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,610
How did you even dare come back?

446
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,830
Turns out you had a secret weapon.

447
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,970
You brat,

448
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,020
you developed a new recipe
behind my back?

449
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,980
Show me how to make it.

450
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,460
Right now. No waiting.

451
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,610
I want to add this dessert

452
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,450
and the sesame pastry

453
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,840
to our new menu.

454
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,140
Oh wow.

455
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,420
That's definitely going
to earn diamonds.

456
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,970
Thank you.

457
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,250
I'm sorry.

458
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,680
Then Highland can reopen.

459
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,650
Let's do our best

460
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,120
and get ready
for the Black Pearl Selection.

461
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,420
Highland!

462
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,210
Fighting!

463
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,320
How many bookings today?

464
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,450
None so far.

465
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,060
It's fine, let's wait a bit.

466
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,930
Alright.

467
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,080
Do you think something's up?

468
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,460
All previous reservations

469
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,450
were canceled, too.

470
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,420
Mr. He, look at this.

471
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,780
It's Philip again.

472
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,130
He's spreading rumors everywhere

473
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,930
and saying not just our staff,

474
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,660
but even customers
ended up hospitalized.

475
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,500
Everyone's going to Ching To for dinner.

476
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,740
(Liu Yan: Emergency, need help!)

477
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,860
What are you holding there?

478
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,580
What is that?

479
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,010
You all seem

480
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,100
pretty relaxed here.

481
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,490
Did you figure out a plan yet?

482
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,960
Well, aren't you treating us to a feast?

483
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,940
We?

484
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,840
Zan!

485
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,650
Tang Shuangshuang?

486
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,530
Liu Yan!

487
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,040
When did you get back?

488
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,580
This place is huge.

489
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,860
This morning,

490
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,210
I just had a feeling

491
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,130
that you needed me.

492
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,140
So I came back.

493
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,490
How long are you staying?

494
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,580
Left with nothing.

495
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,540
Wow, congrats.

496
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,450
Why are you here?

497
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,380
For free?

498
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,130
Who said free food?

499
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,650
Didn't you promise a free feast?

500
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,500
She means you're clueless.

501
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
You're the clueless one.

502
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,350
Alright, alright.

503
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,420
You wouldn't appreciate it anyway.
Get to work.

504
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,540
So, what do I do?

505
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,390
What do you mean?

506
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,830
All this equipment costs money.

507
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,050
Everybody, stand up.

508
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,200
Now, listen to...

509
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,100
Mr. Lu, Miss Tang.

510
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,760
Thank you for coming.

511
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,890
No need to thank.

512
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,420
Okay! Hello, everyone.

513
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,770
I'm a food blogger, Tang Shuangshuang.

514
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,210
Let's start!

515
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,420
Hi everyone,
it's Tang Shuangshuang here.

516
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,410
I'm at Gaya's

517
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,600
famous restaurant,

518
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,040
Highland Restaurant.

519
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,450
It's one of the most talked-about

520
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,860
mid-tier fine dining spots

521
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,670
in Gaya.

522
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,300
It held Two Diamonds
for years consecutively.

523
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,550
Food lovers

524
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,620
from all over the world

525
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,140
make pilgrimages here.

526
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,700
The new head chef, He Guangyuan,

527
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,810
aims to reclaim diamonds

528
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,060
for Highland.

529
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,150
So he has launched a brand-new menu.

530
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,130
Based on
Highland's long-standing foundation

531
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,100
in French cuisine,

532
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,500
it incorporates heavy Chinese elements.

533
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
The plating is stunning.

534
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,900
Mainly,

535
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,420
every new dish

536
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,630
is seriously delicious.

537
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,750
Hello, may I help you?

538
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,860
This is Highland Restaurant.

539
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,760
Hello, Highland Restaurant.

540
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,280
The reservation? For sure, yes.

541
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,840
Yes, no problem.

542
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,890
How many people, may I ask?

543
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,450
New order.

544
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,430
Three orders of sesame pastry.

545
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,250
Yes, Chef!

546
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,240
The judge should be at Table 12.

547
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,210
You figured it out again.

548
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,170
He's dressed really classy.

549
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,120
The manager said he booked early

550
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,570
and didn't answer

551
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,530
multiple calls.

552
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,640
He's probably a One-Diamond judge.

553
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,060
Let me introduce this main course.

554
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,200
This one's the beef dish.

555
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,500
Three different presentations.

556
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,520
First, here

557
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,370
we have Wagyu,

558
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,600
grilled

559
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,240
the classic French way.

560
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,120
Over here,

561
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,480
you can scoop this directly.

562
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,590
It has two layers of mashed potato

563
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,460
with a crispy cracker.

564
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,360
We've paired this with a table wine,

565
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,840
Matthieu Barret.

566
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
It's from

567
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,510
the Cornas region in the Rhone Valley.

568
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,060
Long time no see, Florence.

569
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,040
This way, please.

570
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,930
Who's that?

571
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Florence.

572
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,490
She's been a best friend
before Mrs. He passed.

573
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,780
These two breads are

574
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,620
wild yeast grain seeded breads.

575
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,030
She has a super picky palate.

576
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,200
Please enjoy.

577
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,740
It's fine.

578
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,060
Let her try the new menu.

579
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,710
Florence,

580
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,230
this oyster dish

581
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,930
features tofu skin and Jinhua ham.

582
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,820
It's a fusion of Chinese and Western.

583
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,010
Please enjoy.

584
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,640
Here's the pan-seared snapper.

585
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,260
It's paired with dill sauce,

586
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,640
fish floss,

587
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,450
and bamboo shoot sheaths.

588
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,540
We prepared the sheaths

589
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,340
using a unique Western technique.

590
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,610
Plus, there's cream on the side.

591
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,900
Hope you like it.

592
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,440
How is it?

593
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,300
She hasn't touched it?

594
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,820
Is she always like this?

595
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,080
There was once.

596
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,230
When my mother and her daughter

597
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,860
did a piano duet here at Highland,

598
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,270
she ate.

599
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,080
Emily.

600
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,370
That incredibly talented chef,

601
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,150
who later went back to China
to join relief efforts?

602
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,970
Emily.

603
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,770
Hello, Florence.

604
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,620
I'm the sous chef at Highland.

605
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,470
My name's Liu Yan.

606
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,460
I heard you're

607
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,010
Chef Emily's mother.

608
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,300
I just looked up

609
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,290
her social media.

610
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,420
This is a tomato noodle dish

611
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,360
she recently developed.

612
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,970
I did my best.

613
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,220
Please give it a try.

614
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,900
You really look like my daughter.

615
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,500
Yes, I saw

616
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,350
her pictures

617
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,370
when I browsed...

618
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,660
But the flavors

619
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,700
might be different.

620
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,630
I haven't seen her in so long.

621
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,520
I don't remember the taste of her food.

622
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,680
Auntie,

623
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,450
being a chef

624
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,870
is truly tough.

625
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,620
Especially for those wanting

626
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,720
to help others through food,

627
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,020
it's even harder.

628
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,900
They're barely at home for years.

629
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,230
But I believe,

630
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,430
no matter where she is,

631
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,350
she absolutely

632
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,330
pours all her emotion

633
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,820
into her cooking.

634
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,180
That's her recipe.

635
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,280
Maybe

636
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,220
you'll find her presence

637
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,220
in these noodles.

638
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,780
Enjoy your meal.

639
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,980
Don't go over.

640
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,960
Just let Florence cry.

641
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,550
I think Highland should cook

642
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,910
what the guests really want.

643
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,210
Even if it's not necessarily
what we excel at.

644
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,990
Hello.

645
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,930
Are you Liu Yan?

646
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,300
Yeah, who is this?

647
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,020
Your mom, Jiang Fang,

648
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,420
owes money to our casino.

649
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,180
Come sort this out.

650
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,830
Where's your casino?

651
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,030
Jiang Fang, right?

652
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,320
What's your relationship?

653
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,750
- I don't know her.
- Mother and daughter.

654
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,120
Did you bring enough money?

655
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,860
What did I tell you?

656
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,600
Didn't I tell you not to answer?

657
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,100
You gave them so much money.

658
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,890
Give it to me, I'd double it for sure!

659
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,980
You're wasting money.

660
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,730
Stop following me!

661
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,980
Didn't I say this before?

662
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,410
Why do you interfere?

663
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,210
Do I need you to save me?

664
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,840
For all those years,

665
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,170
you had your life, and I had mine.

666
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,500
Weren't we both doing fine?

667
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,620
Stay away from me!

668
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,780
Stop following me!

669
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,260
If you keep following me,

670
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,110
I'll call the police!

671
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,420
You really have money to burn!

672
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,060
Go ahead, break your bones again!

673
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,100
You brought this on yourself!

674
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,320
Stop acting like
some devoted mother-daughter pair!

675
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,820
Who said I care about you?

676
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,560
I haven't seen you in 13 years!

677
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,100
I feel nothing for you, understand?

678
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,410
Such a drama queen!

679
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,620
(Na Tcha Temple)

680
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,210
With the deities as my witness,

681
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,710
I, Jiang Fang, have burned incense

682
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,850
and prayed for over 20 years.

683
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,210
I've only ever asked for wealth.

684
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,500
But today, that's not what I want.

685
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,580
Today, I ask you to be my witness.

686
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,240
I, Jiang Fang, and Liu Yan,

687
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,540
from now on,

688
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,770
sever our mother-daughter ties.

689
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,080
No ties remain.

690
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,580
If I ever break this vow,

691
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,020
may I be struck by lightning.

692
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,730
Jiang Fang!

693
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,570
Take care.

694
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,310
Stay safe.

695
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:07,660
(Jiang Fang & Liu Yan:
Sever mother-daughter ties)

696
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,090
What's wrong?

697
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,060
She wrote this for me.

698
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,300
She chose gambling over me
completely this time.

699
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,250
Are you even human?

700
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,150
No, it's just a piece of paper.

701
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,050
It has no legal effect.

702
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,920
She signed it in front of Na Tcha.

703
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,100
Even with Sun Wukong there,
it means nothing.

704
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,190
You two are related by blood,

705
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,460
and DNA can't be changed.

706
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,650
And your mother-daughter status

707
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,540
can't be erased by law.

708
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,990
Even if you could dissolve it,

709
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,060
wouldn't that be

710
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,910
a good thing?

711
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,670
What do you mean?

712
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,580
Can you

713
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,420
not joke right now?

714
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,760
I think

715
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,570
you shouldn't deceive yourself.

716
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,020
What do you mean?

717
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,000
I've told you before.

718
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,390
If you truly want to help a gambler,

719
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,760
the best way is to send them

720
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,210
to a gambling addiction center.

721
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,210
That place is like a prison.

722
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,170
You've been there?

723
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,970
She can't handle it.

724
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,290
Why can't she handle it?

725
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,500
Or is it you who can't take it?

726
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,980
Afraid of being seen as unfilial?

727
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,280
Scared people will say

728
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,350
you're not a good daughter?

729
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,360
What's wrong with wanting to be filial?

730
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,450
I want to be good to my own mother.

731
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,390
Is that wrong?

732
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,200
Being a pushover is meaningless.

733
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,920
Why?

734
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,240
Why must your words

735
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,480
be so harsh, Lu Tianchi?

736
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,690
Yeah, you're right.

737
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,500
I...

738
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,990
My words are rough,
but the reasoning isn't.

739
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,810
Why must you insist

740
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,230
on dragging Jiang Fang back

741
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,350
into your life?

742
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,610
Because in my life,

743
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,500
I've never had
a normal emotional relationship.

744
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,550
I just want to experience

745
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,350
what everyone else

746
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,720
goes through every single day.

747
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,310
Just something ordinary,

748
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,140
real, and normal.

749
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,490
I just want to live

750
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,600
like a normal person.

751
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,410
What's wrong with that, Lu Tianchi?

752
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,500
Why is it that every time

753
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,120
I try talking to you,

754
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,810
you're either smirking

755
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,700
or wearing

756
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,490
this... attitude?

757
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,650
Anyway, I don't think

758
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,810
you're abnormal.

759
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,140
Let me ask, are you sick?

760
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,760
Go after her!

761
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,970
For what?

762
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,350
What's the point?

763
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,440
Should I just go and say,

764
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,680
"Sorry, my bad"? Then what?

765
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,190
Let Jiang Fang keep fooling her?

766
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,740
Who told you to talk about her mom?

767
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,650
Then what should I say?

768
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,650
She just poured her heart

769
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,930
out to you.

770
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:46,780
And you?

771
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,000
What? Mr. Enlightened?

772
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,280
Seeing through worldly illusions?

773
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,610
I was reasoning with her.

774
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,540
Was reason what she needed?

775
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,560
Lu Tianchi,

776
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,850
don't you understand?

777
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,070
When she said she wants

778
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,690
a normal emotional relationship,

779
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,610
did she mean only Jiang Fang?

780
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,550
Or is it about you, too?

781
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,160
Let me ask you something.

782
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,830
If you really lose her,

783
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:14,940
would it be worth it?

784
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,250
Liu Yan!

785
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,560
Liu Yan.

786
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,970
Liu Yan!

787
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,940
Liu Yan.

788
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,860
Don't stay in the ocean

789
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:37,930
this late!

790
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,080
Get out of there!

791
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,590
Liu Yan!

792
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,810
I need to talk to you.

793
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,810
Please, just come up.

794
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,500
It's dangerous! Too dark!

795
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,750
Stop swimming, okay?

796
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,500
I can't swim. Can you come up?

797
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,560
Too dark!

798
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,800
Please come up!

799
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,960
Come back. I really can't swim!

800
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,660
I...

801
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,690
Liu Yan!

802
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,410
Wait, can I live with you?

803
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,860
I'll rent a two-bedroom place.

804
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,910
That way, Li Zan

805
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,020
can have his own room!

806
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,480
You cook,

807
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,140
and I'll handle the dishes.

808
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,690
Can you please come back first?

809
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,690
Can you even hear me?

810
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,290
Why are you yelling at the sea?

811
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,330
Weren't you just over there?

812
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,620
That's a reef, man!

813
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,770
So, did you hear me or not?

814
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,760
Try talking underwater yourself.

815
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,730
Can you hear anything?

816
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,730
No sound at all?

817
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,640
You try it.

818
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,130
Wait, I can't swim.

819
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:11,980
Could you

820
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,900
pull me back a little?

821
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,410
If you can't swim,

822
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,980
why recklessly show off?

823
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,250
I was looking for you!

824
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,000
Give me a hand.

825
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,850
You're too heavy!

826
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,370
Can't swim...

827
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,890
You're from Shanghai,

828
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,850
how come you can't swim?

829
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,200
Since when must

830
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,350
a person from Shanghai swim?

831
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,130
Turn off the light.

832
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:32,870
I can't sleep.

833
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,860
Why?

834
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,980
The bed shakes when you move!

835
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,210
Sorry.

836
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,660
Why aren't you asleep?

837
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,230
The bed shakes when I move.

838
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:56,630
Good night.

839
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,340
Lu Tianchi, what are you doing?

840
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,880
What are you doing?

841
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,460
I'm testing if you can hear

842
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,460
outside sounds underwater.

843
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,260
It's perfect you're here.

844
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,540
I'll go under again.

845
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,440
Say something

846
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,540
after my signal.

847
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,460
Can you hear me?

848
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,500
Lu Tianchi, can you hear me?

849
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,100
Did you hear that?

850
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,160
So... you heard

851
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,140
everything I said

852
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,740
in the ocean?
