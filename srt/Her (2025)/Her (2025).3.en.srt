Let go of me.

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,020
Lawyer, right?

19
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,820
No, no, no.

20
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,460

Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,500
It's Jiang Fang's fault.

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,180
Jiang Fang sold my dad's house

27
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,300
and used the money to pay off Mr. Luo.

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,540
Then she went gambling.

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,740
She lost everything.

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,980
After losing, she ran away.

31
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,580
Then something happened to her.

32
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,860
It's got nothing to do with me.

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,460
I had no choice.

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,660
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,620
It's Jiang Fang's fault.

36
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,260
She owed Mr. Luo a huge sum.

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,940
She left, so they came after me.

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,590
I had no choice

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,300
but to write the letter
to trick you here.

40
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,940
Who knew you'd actually come?

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,620
If I hadn't played along

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,100
and tricked you to sign that document,

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,500
Jiang Fang's debt would've been on me.

44
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,140
Where's Jiang Fang now?

45
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,720
How should I know where that gambler is?

46
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,260
You asked me to pay respects yesterday,

47
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,380
and now she's only a gambler?

48
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,840
She doesn't want me to call her Mom,

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,540
and neither do I.

50
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,480
She doesn't deserve it.

51
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,680
Jiang Fang wasted her time
raising you all these years.

52
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,660
She didn't raise me.

53
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,780
It's good enough

54
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,740
that she didn't sell me.

55
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,920
Your dad's from Fuzhou,

56
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,340
but you speak with a Beijing accent.

57
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,700
If you're not raised by Jiang Fang,

58
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,540
then who raised you?

59
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,540
What an ingrate.

60
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,980
Why can't you believe it?

61
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,380
Don't you know who Jiang Fang is?

62
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,780
I know exactly who she is.

63
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,700
She'd do anything for gambling.

64
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,780
Where is Jiang Fang?

65
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,540
She ran away on a bus,

66
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,800
trying to leave the country,
but got into a car accident.

67
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,340
Everyone on the bus burned to death.

68
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,780
The bus company contacted me

69
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,100
to do a DNA test on the relatives

70
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,100
to confirm if Jiang Fang
was among the victims.

71
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,740
However, I'm not related to her

72
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,700
by blood.

73
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,100
It's also pointless for me to try.

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,400
You can do a DNA test,

75
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,540
but I can't.

76
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,900
Since you're here,

77
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,060
just go do it.

78
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,380
How?

79
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,940
Are you even human? Stop looking.

80
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,100
What does "no match" mean?

81
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,980
It means Jiang Fang's not in that body.

82
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,460
You should be grateful.

83
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,140
It means your mother

84
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,740
might not be among the victims.

85
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,820
I knew it.

86
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,740
She's trouble that'll live forever.

87
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,500
Handsome, take a look at this agreement.

88
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,920
If there's no problem, just sign it.

89
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,980
So, if I sign,

90
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,520
I'll get the compensation money, right?

91
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,900
Right, that'll close the case.

92
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,660
But we'll also stop searching

93
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,740
for Jiang Fang.

94
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,340
It's fine. Where should I sign?

95
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,340
What are you doing?

96
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,820
Signing. There's money.

97
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,060
If you sign, they won't look for her.

98
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,500
Jiang Fang definitely made this up

99
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,180
to dodge debts,

100
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,740
so everyone would think she's dead.

101
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,420
She's definitely alive.

102
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,140
I've known Jiang Fang for 13 years.

103
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,380
I know her better than you.

104
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,260
You two talk.

105
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,940
Funny.

106
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,740
I've also known her for 13 years.

107
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,340
I know her now better than you.

108
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,460
Her worst state right now

109
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,380
is being alive.

110
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,380
If she's dead, I'll get more money

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,440
to pay off Mr. Luo's debts.

112
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,540
How can you say that?

113
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,740
You don't treat her like a mom,

114
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,580
but I do.

115
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,740
Why do you curse my mom?

116
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,180
She's still alive.

117
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,700
How can you treat her like she's dead?

118
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,340
What trick did Jiang Fang use on you

119
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,500
while raising you?

120
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,060
If she's alive,
why hasn't she come back?

121
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,980
When she left, she stole my power bank

122
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,260
and took my new sneakers.

123
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,060
She's a liar. Got it?

124
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,020
She's a big gambler.

125
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,340
Why do you trust her?

126
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,180
Go on, hit me.

127
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,120
What else can you do except that?

128
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,900
Where are you going?

Exactly, I'm going to find Jiang Fang.

Only when I find her

132
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,420
can I ask everything clearly.

133
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,540
Go find her. I won't stop you.

134
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,340
What about Mr. Luo's debt?

135
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,140
Do you know who Mr. Luo is?

136

Do you know

137
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,300
why no one dares to owe him money?

138
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,500
So many debts.

139
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,300
Who will die for it, you or me?

140

Smile.

189
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,460
Good.

190
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,540
Mr. Lu.

191
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,820
You can use this photo however you want.

192
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,700
You know our situation.

193
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,780
So, I want to ask

194
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,060
if the consulting fee

195
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,260
can be deducted.

196
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,460
Yes, please help us.

197
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,940
We'll help promote your business

198
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,260
back in the countryside.

199
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,100
Well.

200
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,700
Thanks for the promotion.

201
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,580
Thanks for that.

202
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,460
But the consulting fee

203
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,300
can't be waived.

204
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,660
I need to live after all.

205
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,020
But I have

206
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,380
one important suggestion.

207
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,020
No matter who comes to you,

208
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,780
you must give up

209
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,220
the traffic accident lawsuit.

210
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,220
- Give up?
- Why?

211
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,140
Listen. If a Ferrari or Maserati

212
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,740
hits the kid,

213
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,340
we can fight and get compensation.

214
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,820
But now it is

215
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,540
a peasant's tractor.

216
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,020
Right? There's no chance.

217
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,700
No, no. We can't give up.

218
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,180
- Dear.
- Traffic accident compensation

219
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,740
- is supposed to be high.
- I mean

220
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,580
to give up the lawsuit.

221
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,780
I have other ideas for money.

222
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,660
Calm down, dear.

223
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,220
- Listen.
- If it were your daughter,

224
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,300
would you give up?

225
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,900
Go and raise the money first.

226
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,460
When you have it, come to me.

227
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,740
I'll help you win.

228
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,220
I will. No problem.

229
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,060
Definitely.

230
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,380
Sorry, sorry.

231
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,820
Please help us.

232
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,900
Don't forget the consulting fee.

233
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,740
OK.

234
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,740
Thanks.

235
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,660
The stairs are narrow.

236
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,980
Be careful going down.

237
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
What do you need?

238
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,940
Never mind, no need.

239
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,780
Do you just take any job?

240
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,740
What are you doing?

241
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,100
What are you doing?

242
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,060
I...

243
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,420
Do you have some misunderstanding
about me or what?

244
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,860
I'm calling the police. I'm serious.

245
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,820
This is my coffin money.

246
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,060
I won't touch it

247
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,320
until I have to buy my own urn.

248
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,820
Please sit.

249
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,540
For trustworthy, quality clients,

250
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,020
we can talk things out.

251
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,100
Miss Liu,

252
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,460
what service do you want?

253
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,400
I want to find someone.

254
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,420
Who do you want to find?

255
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,330
- What does she do?
- She's my mom.

256
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,940
(Lin's Herbal Tea, Grocery)

257
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,020
What does "includes
but is not limited to" mean?

258
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,820
It's a legal term.

259
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,660
You don't understand it,

260
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,980
and you don't believe me, right?

261
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,580
You've been nitpicking my words.

262
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Isn't that contradictory?

263
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,740
As long as you find Jiang Fang,

264
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,660
I'll take any punches you throw.

265
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,060
Let me make one thing clear.

266
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,660
I hate violence.

267
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,660
I don't hit people.

268
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,440
So, don't talk to me

269
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,380
about throwing punches.

270
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,220
Got it?

271
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,380
It's just a metaphor.

272
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,180
Let me remind you.

273
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,940
In my rights and obligations,

274
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,070
it clearly states that

275
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,930
if you show

276
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,770
any violent behavior

277
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,020
during our contract period,

278
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,120
I can immediately terminate

279
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,080
our cooperation,

280
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,780
and you bear the losses.

281
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,500
How vindictive.

282
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,580
Deal or not?

283
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,740
Fine, no problem.

284
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,140
That's settled then.

285
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,260
I'll confirm
if she's alive in one month.

286
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,980
We'll talk money after I find her.

287
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,460
Why?

288
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,340
Taking calls here doesn't count

289
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,360
as billable time, right?

290
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,780
It's your first time. It's free.

291
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,980
Hello?

292
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,900
Hello, Miss Liu?

293
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,060
I'm Li Zan's teacher.

294
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,900
My last name's He.

295
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,860
Hello, Ms. He.

296
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
I want to talk to you

297
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
about Li Zan.

298
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,660
The police came to see me yesterday.

299
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,500
Police?

300
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,140
What happened?

301
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,780
Here's the thing.

302
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,140
Li Zan's had

303
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,140
some trouble lately,

304
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,700
and neither of his parents

305
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,940
is around anymore.

306
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,360
We were going to have him

307
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
live with social workers,

308
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,260
but he said he has a sister,

309
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,660
so I wanted to meet you

310
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,860
to understand the situation.

311
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,460
Do we have to talk face-to-face?

312
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,060
Can't we just talk on the phone?

313
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,220
I used to talk with Ms. Jiang,

314
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,860
but now she's unreachable.

315
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,820
You mean Jiang Fang?

316
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,860
Yes.

317
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,060
You're saying

318
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,700
the previous home visits

319
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,300
were all with Jiang Fang?

320
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,140
Yes.

321
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,140
Maybe we should

322
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,220
meet and talk.

323
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,700
I'll schedule a home visit with you.

324
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,420
OK, I understand, Ms. He.

325
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,420
No problem.

326
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Alright.

327
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,540
Let's do that.

328
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,580
See you then.

329
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,380
OK. It's settled.

330
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,740
Sure. Bye.

331
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,460
You didn't say you had a kid?

332
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Not mine.

333
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,380
Jiang Fang's stepson.

334
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,340
The one who tricked me here.

335
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,780
You have a lot on your plate.

336
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,060
That brat told me

337
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,700
Jiang Fang ignores him.

338
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
I have no home.
Where should I meet the teacher?

339
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,380
Excuse me.

340
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,420
So, the family address

341
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,500
you wrote there

342
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,340
isn't your real

343
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,300
home address?

344
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,300
It's where I live,

345
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,100
but I can't meet the teacher there.

346
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,380
The house's mortgaged

347
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,700
to Mr. Luo.

348
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,940
Home visit...

349
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,620
I have a question.

350
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,180
How did your house

351
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,620
get mortgaged to Mr. Luo?

352
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,180
You'll know when you find Jiang Fang.

353
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,920
Do you always

354
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,020
call your mom by name?

355
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,660
She never let me call her Mom.

356
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,740
She said calling her by name is safer.

357
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,540
Nonsense.

358
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,380
Sorry to inform you, Ms. Liu,

359
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,900
that I might have to destroy

360
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,460
our contract.

361
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,540
I can't fulfill it.

362
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,180
I already signed it.

363
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,400
You drafted this contract.

364
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,220
Look at it yourself.

365
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,620
That means triple compensation.

366
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,300
Liu Yan!

367
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,420
Come on!

368
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,260
Has your short stay here

369
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,900
made you

370
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,850
a local?

371
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,860
Are you crazy?

372
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,500
Let me ask you.

373
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,380
Who told you to answer that phone?

374
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,300
Do you always answer

375
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,180
any unknown calls?

376
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,220
How was I supposed to know

377
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,540
it was your teacher?

378
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,660
Thanks to you,

379
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,980
the police contacted your school,

380
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,020
and now I've suddenly

381
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,100
become a minor's guardian.

382
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,660
That means I let the wolf in, huh?

383
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,180
- I'm the wolf?
- What else?

384
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,140
You're the biggest wolf

385
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,260
in this house.

386
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,860
You're a blockhead.

387
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,060
Ms. He wanted to come

388
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,980
to convince me not to drop out.

389
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,460
What's it got to do with you?

390
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,820
Just tell her

391
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,100
this was settled long ago

392
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,740
and have me handle the paperwork.

393
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,980
You want to drop out?

394
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,660
Yeah, so I can go to work

395
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
and start paying for utilities.

396
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,940
Dropping out is good.

397
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,780
Hurry up and quit.

398
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,620
You deserve to quit.

399
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
Get a job afterward.

400
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,900
Remember to pay off your mom's debts.

401
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,860
Deal then.

402
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,900
You just need to show up

403
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,740
when you should.

404
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,940
Don't worry about the rest.

405
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,420
I can handle myself.

406
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,060
Fine.

407
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,620
Ms. He.

408
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,550
Sorry.

409
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,380
There was a sudden
termite outbreak at home.

410
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,540
It's under pest control,

411
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,420
so meeting at school

412
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,380
is more convenient.

413
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Are you Li Zan's sister?

414
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,260
Hello, Ms. He, I'm Liu Yan.

415
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,380
Your last name is Liu,

416
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,340
his mom's last name is Jiang,

417
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,540
and his dad's last name is Li.

418
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,780
Yes, she took my grandma's surname

419
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,220
to honor her.

420
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,660
She just wants to ask

421
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,140
about the withdrawal

422
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,060
procedure.

423
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,580
Can we talk privately?

424
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,820
Sure.

425
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,060
Li Zan, why don't you leave us?

426
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,220
I'll talk with Ms. He alone.

427
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,620
OK. Ms. He,

428
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,580
my sister just arrived here.

429
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,960
She's not used to the environment,

430
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,220
and she's quite introverted.

431
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,020
She barely talks. Please don't mind.

432
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,740
Just leave us.

433
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,860
The police came yesterday

434
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,580
to confirm Li Zan's identity.

435
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,340
That's when I found out he has a sister.

436
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,540
Let me first brief you

437
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,660
on Li Zan's situation.

438
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,380
This is a report he wrote

439
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,260
about Euler's polyhedron formula.

440
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,100
And this one.

441
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,020
It's about knights

442
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,820
and the history of modern warfare.

443
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,980
Actually, I always knew

444
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,260
he charged others at school

445
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,820
to do their homework.

446
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,220
Sorry, Ms. He.

447
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,500
I'll process his withdrawal now,

448
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,620
so you don't have to worry

449
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,500
about it anymore.

450
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,380
But Li Zan's homework

451
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,740
has always been among the top ten

452
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,140
at our school.

453
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,460
He's one of the most gifted students

454
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,780
I've taught over several years.

455
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,820
Isn't his performance terrible?

456
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,060
He's not a troublemaker?

457
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,060
He's never fallen out of the top five.

458
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,140
I think he has

459
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,100
great potential.

460
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,420
We want to nurture him properly.

461
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,220
Ms. He,

462
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,220
did my mom use to come to school often?

463
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,780
Did she care about Li Zan's studies?

464
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,140
Yes, she came a lot.

465
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,460
We talked quite a few times.

466
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,620
She came every time?

467
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,940
Right, Miss Liu.

468
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,820
Last Mid-Autumn Festival,

469
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,940
she sent mooncakes to our office.

470
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,260
I ate her mooncakes,

471
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,340
and she promised to discipline Li Zan.

472
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,780
How did she look then?

473
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,180
Nothing special.

474
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,370
I just remember she came here

475
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,540
specifically to pay respects.

476
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,860
Was her hair long

477
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,620
or short then?

478
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,500
Long.

479
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,180
Was it loose

480
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,660
or tied up?

481
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,500
Or...?

482
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,300
Tied up, I think.

483
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,980
Did she mention Beijing?

484
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,420
No.

485
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,980
Those mooncakes

486
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,340
had date paste, right?

487
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,300
Yes.

488
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,620
Didn't you say Jiang Fang ignored you?

489
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,540
If she did,

490
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,600
why would Ms. He get to eat

491
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,260
the best date mooncakes in Beijing?

492
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,420
She lost my school fees

493
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,100
gambling the night before.

494
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,920
You believe she went to see the teacher?

495
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,940
You...

496
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,220
What about me?

497
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,600
You're actually a top student.

498
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,020
The cutest one you've seen, right?

499
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,380
Then why drop out?

500
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,980
What else to do?

501
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,420
Go to university.

502
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,420
What good would a university do?

503
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,980
It'll be easier to get a job?

504
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,300
I never went to college.

505
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,180
How would I know?

506
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,660
Look.

507
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,060
If you don't know, don't talk nonsense.

508
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,780
University is just

509
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,300
for studying or making money.

510
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,420
I don't want to study,

511
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,380
and if I earn money

512
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,860
after school,

513
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,820
I'll starve to death.

514
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,980
People like me didn't starve,

515
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,020
and you surely wouldn't.

516
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,740
Where's the money for college?

517
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,020
If I can afford college

518
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,100
but can't pay back Mr. Luo,

519
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,940
I'll still be dead.

520
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,260
I've thought about everything.

521
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,460
This is the best choice.

522
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,700
Just cooperate.

523
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,860
We have a gentleman's agreement.

524
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,380
Go back.

525
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,120
We have a deal.

526
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,540
A gentleman's agreement.

527
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,340
Besides, whether I go to college or not

528
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,620
is none of your business.

529
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,660
Even Jiang Fang knows

530
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,240
to have the teacher watch your studies.

531
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,780
I can't be worse than Jiang Fang.

532
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Stop talking nonsense.

533
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,500
I already told your teacher.

534
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,020
Your mom and my dad
were just partners in life.

535
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,100
When things got tough,
they each ran their own way.

536
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Getting you here

537
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,780
was pure dumb luck.

538
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,060
I don't expect anything from you.

539
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,660
I don't need you to act like my sister.

540
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,060
I can take care of myself.

541
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,940
Take a look.

542
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,260
There's so much stuff inside.

543
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,980
Hurry up, please.

544
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,020
Here.

545
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,740
Nothing's changed,

546
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,180
and you said it was all cleared?

547
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,740
Oh, no.

548
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,260
Don't make a sound.

549
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,340
I left something important.

550
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,380
This is stalking.

551
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,020
This distance might expose us.

552
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,500
Bro, we're following a garbage truck.

553
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,060
What's there to expose?

554
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,660
Fair point.

555
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,820
Today,

556
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,100
I have to count the taxi night fare.

557
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,860
I'm giving you clues.

558
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,300
I'm providing service.

559
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,150
Take it or leave it.

560
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,180
Get off if you want.

561
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,740
He's back.

562
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,300
Are we talking to him?

563
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,140
Who's gonna talk?

564
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,980
You go.

565
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,060
I don't have money.

566
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,060
I do, I do.

567
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,140
Here, take it.

568
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,990
You're so rich.

569
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,980
Why claim to be poor?

570
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,500
Money should be spent wisely.

571
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,020
Your brother's more sensible than you.

572
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,620
Thanks for the hard work.

573
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,740
Sorry, sir.

574
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,580
What's up?

575
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,100
What is he talking about?

576
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,540
Why is he smiling?

577
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
He's talking business.

578
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,820
He's pointing at us.

579
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,660
Let's go, come on.

580
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,860
He wants to talk to you for a while.

581
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,780
Little sister.

582
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,460
- Hi, sir.
- Hi.

583
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,660
Your friend said you like me a lot.

584
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,740
Is that true?

585
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,740
Your friend.

586
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,140
- I...
- Your friend said

587
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,380
he was introducing

588
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,420
a girl to me.

589
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,300
Is that you?

590
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,860
It's you.

591
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,300
He said you like me

592
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,700
because I look like Xu Jinjiang.

593
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,420
- You...
- Where are you going?

594
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,620
Is it because of the beard?

595
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,420
It should be...

596
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,940
Your silhouette.

597
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,820
Silhouette?

598
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,700
Help me carry that bag.

599
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,260
I like you too.

600
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,300
Do you like me?

601
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,020
Here.

602
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,780
What's this?

603
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,940
Look for yourself.

604
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,940
Little sister,

605
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,860
leave me your number.

606
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,100
- Remember to call me.
- OK.

607
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,300
Stop talking, stop talking.

608
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,140
Let's go.

609
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,740
Why do you want so much junk?

610
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,800
What's the point?

611
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,640
Put some effort in.

612
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,500
Don't think about it.

613
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,940
I won't help you.

614
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,880
Even if you have to wear yourself out,

615
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,080
I won't help you.

616
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,940
It's too heavy.

617
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,740
Then don't pick it up.

618
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,380
Why pick up this junk?

619
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,220
You spent so much on a taxi

620
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,980
and didn't bring back any treasure.

621
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,020
What's it to you?

622
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,340
Money is my business.

623
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,620
I care about money.

624
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,820
Ms. He said today

625
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,140
about your tuition fees.

626
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,540
Jiang Fang scammed my money.

627
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,580
Now, Jiang Fang's daughter

628
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,420
wants to teach me how to spend money.

629
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,620
Li Zan, you don't need
to be sarcastic with me.

630
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,700
When I find Jiang Fang,

631
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,260
you deal with her yourself.

632
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,380
What's the point
of saying that to me here?

633
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,300
Just be grateful.

634
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,060
When my mom left,
she didn't even leave me a photo.

635
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,180
I was only five years old that year.

636
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,140
If I don't think carefully,

637
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,500
I can remember something.

638
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,340
But if I think hard,

639
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,180
her face will blur.

640
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,820
Look.

641
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,180
What Ms. He said is right.

642
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,340
You were raised by Jiang Fang.

643
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,300
I had to live with her.

644
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,900
Jiang Fang

645
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,820
never told you about me?

646
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,060
Or about Beijing?

647
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,140
She did.

648
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,780
Otherwise, how did I send you

649
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,620
the lawyer's letter?

650
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,660
I can't believe

651
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,900
you're still at that sports school.

652
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,500
I waited for her all these years.

653
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,500
Am I waiting to give her

654
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,540
another chance to ruin me?

655
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,040
I don't think she's as bad to you

656
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,780
as you say.

657
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,380
Ms. He said

658
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,300
Jiang Fang didn't miss

659
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,620
a single parent meeting back then.

660
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,460
Of course.

661
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,540
My dad paid her every time.

662
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,580
She wanted to go eight times a week
if she could.

663
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,380
Ms. He told me

664
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,940
Jiang Fang made you lunchboxes

665
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,340
for you to eat with your classmates.

666
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,680
That was her trying to make money.

667
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,220
She sold each lunchbox for five dollars

668
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,180
and made four dollars.

669
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,660
Ms. He said Jiang Fang...

670
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,700
Stop mentioning Jiang Fang.

671
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,820
Without Jiang Fang,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

672
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,780
Just study.

673
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,920
Stop pretending to be tough.

674
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,260
When did I do that?

675
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,180
When have I ever done that?

676
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,960
I don't even know
where I'll sleep tonight.

677
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,220
I'll just find a bench on the street

678
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,580
and make do for one night.

679
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,420
What about you?

680
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,020
You're a minor.

681
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,300
You can't sleep on the street.

682
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,700
Do you have any classmates

683
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,860
who can let you stay over?

684
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,140
They pay my salary.

685
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,820
They're my clients.

686
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,860
Does the worker sleep
at the client's place?

687
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,600
So, you want to sleep
in the park with me?

688
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,860
That's not right.

689
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,220
We're both clients.

690
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,940
Mr. Lu.

691
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,660
Mr. Lu, open the door.

692
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,620
Hey, Lu.

693
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,260
- Come out.
- Mr. Lu.

694
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,020
Your client's here. Come out.

695
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,860
Mr. Lu.

696
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,340
What time is it?

697
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,220
- No watch.
- I need sleep.

698
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,060
Mr. Lu.

699
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,260
Please let us stay here tonight.

700
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,660
Let us stay over, please.
Name your price.

701
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,520
Go to a hotel.

702
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,500
I have no place for you.

703
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,900
Hotels are too expensive.

704
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,620
Is this how you treat your clients?

705
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,460
And the underage family member
of your client?

706
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,140
You're quite eloquent.

707
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,580
- 300.
- 300?

708
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,420
Fifty.

709
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,660
Wait, wait.

710
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,740
One hundred.

711
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,900
100 today and 200 tomorrow, okay?

712
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,740
Let's go.

713
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,020
- Let's go.
- We're leaving.

714
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,940
- Wait.
- Let's go.

715
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
We'll stay.

716
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,860
He's already left.

717
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,540
- We'll stay.
- You two decide.

718
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
Will you stay or not?

719
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,460
Come back.

720
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,340
You'll pay.

721
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,580
I...

722
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,940
- Staying or not?
- Open the door.

723
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,220
(Lin's Herbal Tea, Grocery)

724
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,340
I don't have a place
to put these things.

725
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,700
Over there.

726
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,780
You'll pay. I have no money.

727
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,060
Fine, I'll pay.

728
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,020
Are you asleep?

729
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Thanks for Jiang Fang's photo album.

730
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,260
Well.

731
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,900
We each pay half for the room.

732
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,380
(Jiang Fang,)

733
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,460
(even in Jaya,)

734
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,220
(I could even be kicked out
of my own home.)

735
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,420
(Thanks to you.)

736
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,620
Salty, remember this later, okay?

737
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,480
Got it.

738
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Don't get too close,

739
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,940
but don't be too far either.

740
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,900
And I have to keep watching you.

741
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,060
Right.

742
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,660
Then hurry and go.

743
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,500
OK.

744
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,300
Put your clothes on.

745
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,740
(But I'm used to it.)

746
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,220
(When I was 12,)

747
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,140
(you got me to another school
to avoid debt)

748
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,900
(and ran away,)

749
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,980
(leaving me with no home.)

750
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,780
What are you doing?

751
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,860
They won't realize

752
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,900
we've left.

753
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,620
Here, food on the road.

754
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,540
What filling is this?

755
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,380
Smell it.

756
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,740
Zucchini.

757
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,340
Zucchini and Paicha crisps.

758
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,700
How can you eat this without garlic?

759
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,540
Here. Done.

760
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,460
Jiang Fang,

761
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,140
when are we going home?

762
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,940
These debt collectors are easy to fool.

763
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,580
We should be back in a couple of days.

764
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,420
Let's go.

765
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,860
(I always thought you were)

766
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,980
(my only relative in this world.)

767
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,220
(Now, I suddenly have
a younger brother.)

768
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,580
(Jiang Fang,)

769
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,820
(I'm so glad you're not dead,)

770
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,460
(but where are you?)

771
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,220
(Lin's Herbal Tea, Grocery)

772
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,260
Soaking it again?

773
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,900
What do you need?

774
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,060
I do need something.

775
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,340
Give me a pack.

776
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,580
I'll cook it.

777
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,100
It'll definitely taste better
than yours.

778
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
Instant noodles
are supposed to be soaked.

779
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,420
If not, it's dry.

780
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,460
I saw that the other day.

781
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,060
It's not edible at all.

782
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,620
Cooking doesn't count against rent.

783
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,220
You're so stingy.

784
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,260
I don't need a deduction.

785
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,020
Can I use some scraps from here?

786
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,900
No pork jerky.

787
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,700
Add some spice for me.

788
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,100
Then...

789
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,780
Never mind, just do as you like.

790
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,220
Just don't let Uncle Lin find out,

791
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,060
okay?

792
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,580
Just wait.

793
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,060
What are you doing?

794
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,060
Steaming it.

795
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,660
It's instant noodles.

796
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,540
Why steam it?

797
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,060
It tastes better this way.

798
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,960
It would've been ready by now
if I had soaked them.

799
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,380
I don't get it.

800
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,380
Why do you put

801
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,820
so much effort

802
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,180
into cooking?

803
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,140
Mr. Lu, maybe it's because

804
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,540
you've never hit rock bottom before.

805
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,660
What do you mean?

806
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,940
When you hit rock bottom, eat first.

807
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,620
That's what Jiang Fang said.

808
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,540
What a joke.

809
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,140
Did you put vinegar?

810
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,380
That's too much.

811
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
I told you no pork jerky.

812
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,020
Don't talk.

813
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,180
Amazing.

814
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,940
You should open a noodle shop.

815
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,340
Amazing.

816
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,020
(Golden Sea Hotel)

817
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,860
Hello.

818
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,620
Is this the Golden Sea Hotel?

819
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,460
Hello, here's the thing.

820
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,300
My aunt

821
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,180
is staying at your hotel.

822
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,060
I want to give her something.

823
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,860
Could you please check

824
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,820
if she's there?

825
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,380
(Golden Sea Hotel)

826
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,380
You've followed me for three days.

827
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,220
What do you want?

828
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,220
I'm growing gourds.

829
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,100
You could have told me
when we went downstairs.

830
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,500
Sir.

831
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,520
You're looking for me?

832
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,420
I'm a consultant.

833
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,100
My client is looking

834
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,380
for someone named Jiang Fang.

835
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,980
She's about 50.

836
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,700
I heard she used
to hang around with you.

837
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,900
Never heard of her.

838
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,340
Well, maybe.

839
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:47,960
If you can give me

840
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,300
any information about Jiang Fang,

841
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,220
my client is willing to pay.

842
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,180
So annoying.

843
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,460
Who are you?

844
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,620
Looks like you really don't know.

845
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,220
Then this is going to be hard.

846
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,940
She owes money to Mr. Luo.

847
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,460
I have to get it from you.

848
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,180
What do you mean?

849
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,540
You know Mr. Luo?

850
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,860
He's an old client of mine.

851
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,020
He doesn't want to worry about this,

852
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,060
so I hope you can cooperate.

853
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,260
Mr. Luo and our business

854
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,340
have always respected each other.

855
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,220
We all respect Mr. Luo.

856
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,740
You wouldn't bother

857
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,180
an old man lightly, right?

858
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,460
Of course not.

859
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,580
The woman you're asking about

860
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,850
has been here before.

861
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,960
Do you know where she is?

862
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,140
I don't know.

863
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,060
Doesn't she have two kids?

864
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,420
That's enough.

865
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,260
Get the money from them.
