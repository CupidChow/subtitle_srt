=HER=

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,090
Why are you looking for me?

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,060
(2009 Qingming)
What does that mean?

17
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,480
Her daughter is also a ghost.

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,380
Wang Yang,

19
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,360
can you stop with the questions?

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,340
You've interrupted me so many times.

21
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,940
You've killed the mood.

22
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,780
To be honest,

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,980
Mr. Zhang's storytelling has declined

24
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,060
over the past years.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,170
Like raising turtles in a jar,

26
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,220
it's just getting weirder.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,610
But your jokes lately

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,140
have really improved.

29
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,220
Turn it off.

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,140
I picked up some new jokes

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,330
from my grandma.

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,480
Let me tell you.

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,950
A dung beetle is clinging
to a railroad track

34
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,750
pretending to be a big rivet.

35
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,600
Wearing an apron bare-assed,

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,990
it's only covering the start,
not the end.

37
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,920
Anything else?

38
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,790
A bat with chicken feathers stuck in it,

39
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,050
who do you think you are?

40
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,420
Did you bring the stuff?

41
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,060
Harder!

42
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,420
Holy...

43
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,490
Who did this?

44
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,420
(2011 Qingming)

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,700
Salty, stop combing.

46
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,780
That's too scary.

47
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,900
Quiet!

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,860
Qingming Festival
calls for ghost stories.

49
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,100
Wang Yang, we had a deal.

50
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,990
Let's make a pinky promise.

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
What's going on?

52
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,090
What kind of mother

53
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,340
is she?

54
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,780
On Qingming Festival, of all days,

55
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,840
letting debt collectors in?

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,360
That's practically waiting for trouble.

57
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,120
If you can't raise a kid,
don't have one...

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,240
Isn't this sinful?

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,860
(Pay up; Die)
Don't talk bad about Salty's mom!

60
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,220
Stop it! Go away!

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,380
- Let's go.
- Get out of here!

62
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,300
Let's go!

63
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,430
(2019 Qingming)
Recently, a family was joyfully

64
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,850
welcoming a newborn

65
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,600
when doctors informed the family

66
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,450
- Are you tired? Take a break.
- that the baby's mom was hospitalized.

67
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,960
It turns out the woman had six abortions

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,950
with different men
in the past three years.

69
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,090
The couple immediately had a big fight,

70
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,840
and the woman fell
to her death on the spot.

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,380
- Is that for real?
- The man...

72
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,930
During Qingming...

73
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,160
News these days

74
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,810
is so intense.

75
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,550
Anyway, they're scarier

76
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,390
than yours.

77
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,930
Your ghost stories

78
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,060
get worse every year.

79
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,020
But isn't that

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,150
our Qingming tradition?

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,850
We spend it together every year.

82
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,260
Where are

83
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,980
all your team members?

84
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,010
I was hoping to give them some tips.

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,820
Then I'll stay here tonight.

86
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,940
No way.

87
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,860
I'll take the top bunk.

88
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,910
Nope.

89
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,790
Why not?

90
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,020
Dorm rules.

91
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,100
No guests allowed overnight.

92
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,700
But I'm not really a guest.

93
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,040
- You're not a guest?
- I know everyone

94
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,900
in your club.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,740
Fine, not staying is fine.

96
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,100
Then practice a bit longer with me.

97
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,100
- You want...
- The next one.

98
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,020
Teach me the next part.

99
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,860
I forgot how it goes.

100
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,850
How did you say it last time?

101
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,820
- Like this...
- You...

102
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,680
move your arms like this.

103
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,380
- Like this...?
- And then...

104
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,230
No, the other way.

105
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,470
- The other side.
- Like this?

106
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,780
Now lock it in place.

107
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,590
Your arm goes through here.

108
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,730
- How? Like this?
- Yeah, just...

109
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,080
Right, by the neck.

110
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,500
- Then what? The other...
- Lock it there.

111
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,480
Then from here, right?

112
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,230
Here.

113
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,810
Like this.

114
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,910
Maybe...

115
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,340
we should just get together.

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,270
You're...

117
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,260
talking nonsense on Qingming Festival.

118
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,770
Anyway,

119
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,940
we grew up together.

120
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,140
So, no need

121
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,710
to make it official.

122
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,340
We won't separate anyway.

123
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,810
Alright, fine.

124
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,740
Ouch, that hurts.

125
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
It hurts so much.

126
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,860
Playing dead on Qingming
attracts ghosts.

127
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,620
(2024 Qingming)

128
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,180
=Episode 8=

129
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,330
Are you okay?

130
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,540
Not... not really.

131
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,420
Could you come in?

132
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,090
Sorry about that!

133
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,330
Come help me change my dressing.

134
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,280
I can't feed you.

135
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,230
Is this dressing change okay?

136
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,490
That's a different thing.

137
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,630
Hurry up, come on in.

138
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,510
Watch your step.

139
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,250
Close the door.

140
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,940
The wind makes my wound hurt.

141
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,740
Peel that scab off.

142
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,060
Apply the medicine.

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,990
But it's already scabbed over.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,850
Why take the scab off?

145
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,060
It's not healed underneath.

146
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,180
Only the top has a scab.

147
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,270
You need to peel it off.

148
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,280
It's fine, just change it.

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,320
Don't look at it.

150
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,800
Wait, hold on a second!

151
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,100
Your yelling scares me, too.

152
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,450
Just do it, be quick.

153
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,220
Alright, all done.

154
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,420
You've got quite...

155
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,920
a few scars.

156
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,740
Chen Xiuli.

157
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,510
What?

158
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,260
That scar's called Chen Xiuli.

159
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,110
I got it years ago,

160
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,460
being a sparring partner

161
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,620
for an athlete named Chen Xiuli.

162
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,780
She later won

163
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,100
two bronze medals at the National Games.

164
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,300
Do you really...

165
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,420
give every scar a name?

166
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,450
This one's Wang Yang.

167
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,410
My very first scar.

168
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,100
We used to play together as kids.

169
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,100
I got it falling from a tree.

170
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,010
You mean the guy
who calls you every day?

171
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,450
Aren't you two childhood sweethearts?

172
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,170
Were you ever together?

173
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,820
No.

174
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,710
We're...

175
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,100
family,

176
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,720
siblings,

177
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,980
and buddies.

178
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,340
Someone like me

179
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,360
shouldn't drag anyone down.

180
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,820
What do you mean, drag down?

181
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,330
Drag down...

182
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
It means

183
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,420
holding someone back.

184
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,550
Wait, that's not quite it.

185
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,920
Maybe making trouble?

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,140
That's not right either.

187
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,840
Beijing slang is hard to explain.

188
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,940
It's pretty nuanced.

189
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,580
There's nothing nuanced about it.

190
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,200
You just don't like him.

191
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,170
Am I right?

192
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,500
If you like someone,
you can drag them down.

193
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,230
Is that what you mean?

194
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,480
I said I don't like him.

195
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,660
It's not that complicated, right?

196
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,990
Anyway, in the end,

197
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,520
who damaged whom isn't clear.

198
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,700
Lu Tianchi!

199
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,830
I knew all along

200
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,740
you were a beast!

201
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,650
And you lied to me!

202
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,300
My sis's leg is injured so badly,

203
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,280
yet you won't leave her alone.

204
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,890
How could you be like this?

205
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,040
- No...
- Come out!

206
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,080
Come out here!

207
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,890
You think you can bully us
because there's no man here?

208
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,930
Come out, now!

209
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,290
Fight me if you dare!

210
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,450
Come on!

211
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,720
I...

212
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,770
- You go first.
- You go first.

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,020
You know how to come back.

214
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,140
You know I should be back?

215
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,820
I won.

216
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,980
The debt's paid off.

217
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,780
I almost

218
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,860
ended up alone again.

219
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,990
Almost.

220
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,490
It won't happen.

221
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,230
You like his type, huh?

222
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,420
What are you talking about?

223
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,660
If you didn't like his type,

224
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,150
why let him help you change clothes?

225
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,860
You're pretty open-minded.

226
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,820
Was I letting him help me
change clothes?

227
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,460
He was changing my dressing.

228
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,200
I was afraid you'd get hurt.

229
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,700
Lu Tianchi's ex-girlfriend

230
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,100
was like Tang Shuangshuang.

231
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,680
Did they get together?

232
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,970
Isn't it obvious?

233
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,160
Lu Tianchi treats you differently

234
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,500
from Tang Shuangshuang.

235
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,330
What do you mean? Aren't we all clients?

236
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,220
How is it not the same?

237
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,750
Lu Tianchi to you

238
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,380
is like the news,

239
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,820
bravely saving a drowning child.

240
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,250
It's heroic,

241
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,070
overflowing sympathy, and a good deed.

242
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,010
Do you get it now?

243
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,880
Let me lay it out for you.

244
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,170
You and Tang Shuangshuang

245
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,250
are totally different types.

246
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,230
You have to admit that, right?

247
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,040
Well, I...

248
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,800
Why are you here again?

249
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,890
Just grabbing something.

250
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,070
I'm a bit bored.

251
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,550
Alright, go, go.

252
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,690
Close the door!

253
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,190
So, what style

254
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,420
do you think I am?

255
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,550
You are...

256
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,140
a complicated style.

257
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,670
Li Zan,

258
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,490
the doctor said I can't fight anymore,

259
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,420
but I can still

260
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,620
take you

261
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,500
down!

262
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,800
Honestly, it was
because you had no money

263
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,780
and no mom,
but you were in debt and hurt.

264
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,500
Now the debts are paid off,

265
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,700
and you've healed up.

266
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,770
Don't waste your time on him.

267
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,340
I need to use the bathroom.

268
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,050
What's wrong with this guy?

269
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,940
You women

270
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,300
don't understand

271
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,610
what men are thinking.

272
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,770
Think about it carefully.

273
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,740
Why is Tang Shuangshuang always

274
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,220
hovering around Lu Tianchi?

275
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,180
Just stop pushing it.

276
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,150
Are you done yet?

277
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,490
Almost finished.

278
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,980
Why are you so attentive?

279
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,970
Don't come back!

280
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,190
Did Tang Shuangshuang

281
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,020
tell you all this?

282
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,420
Isn't it obvious?

283
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,020
Why do you women

284
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,410
all like bad guys?

285
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,640
You'd hit your brother

286
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
over a bad guy?

287
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,050
Alright, alright.

288
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,530
You're underage,

289
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,840
what do you know?

290
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,620
Stop acting all grown up here.

291
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,580
I just think Lu Tianchi

292
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,520
is a decent guy.

293
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,480
So what?

294
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,370
So we can still be friends.

295
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,020
Hello.

296
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,850
Wang Yang?

297
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,980
Where are you right now?

298
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,060
This place is nice,

299
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,740
but too stuffy.

300
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,780
Was this car a taxi before?

301
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,990
The air conditioning is too old.

302
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,940
Salty's really thoughtful.

303
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,660
Thanks for picking me up.

304
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,900
You're Salty's...

305
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,340
lawyer, right?

306
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,240
Consultant.

307
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,110
When I called Salty that day,

308
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,140
why were you consulting at home?

309
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,110
She's my friend.

310
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,000
So I'm helping her

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,860
with some other stuff.

312
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,630
What kind of stuff exactly?

313
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,610
I don't know if she mentioned

314
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,340
that the two of us

315
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,540
grew up together since we were kids.

316
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,990
I've always handled

317
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,610
her affairs.

318
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,420
How did she suddenly find you?

319
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,280
If there's something you don't know,

320
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,140
ask her yourself.

321
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,940
What is all this stuff?

322
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,260
You're quite the player.

323
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,470
Hiding a beauty in the car.

324
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,050
I'll leave it here for you.

325
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,160
When you have some free time,

326
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,460
bring your wife and kid

327
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,480
to Beijing to visit.

328
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,260
I'm not married and have no kids.

329
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,060
Really? You don't look like it.

330
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,740
You seem so mature and steady,

331
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,780
but still single?

332
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,930
Okay.

333
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,300
Your music...

334
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,640
I was about to say

335
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,500
your song is quite catchy.

336
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,670
It's more exciting than your car.

337
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,140
When the pan heats up,

338
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,220
it dries out quickly.

339
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,980
You don't even need to touch it.

340
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,620
Wipe the water off the spatula, too.

341
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
The smoke stings my eyes.

342
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,450
Can't you be more refined?

343
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,450
A bit more, just a bit more.

344
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,700
That's it. No, that's not it!

345
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,560
Alright, alright.

346
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,150
Stir it. Go ahead and stir it.

347
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,100
Stir, keep stirring.

348
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,700
- Move faster, hurry up.
- Okay, okay.

349
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,580
It's starting to smoke.

350
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,320
That's about it.

351
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,390
Just remember what I told you.

352
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,420
It's Jiang Fang...

353
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,960
Okay, I got it.

354
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
From now on,

355
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,820
my whole body from throat to colon

356
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,900
is inflamed.

357
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,010
Fine, just play mute then.

358
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,880
Alright.

359
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,680
Zan!

360
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,960
Coming!

361
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,200
Hey, you can leave
your suitcase at the door.

362
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,540
Is this Salty's brother?

363
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,400
Yeah, that's Zan.

364
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,490
Wow, you're really tall.

365
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,710
Hello.

366
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,970
Did we run out of slippers?

367
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,840
You can wear shoes inside.

368
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,650
Hey man...

369
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,720
just take your shoes off outside.

370
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,690
Do you have socks on?

371
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,690
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

372
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,650
The floor's pretty cold.

373
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,480
Just wear shoes inside.

374
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,300
It's fine.

375
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,140
Salty.

376
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,590
Wang Yang.

377
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,820
What happened to you?

378
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,740
It's nothing.

379
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,380
Just a small match, that's all.

380
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,060
Who did you play against?

381
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
Doesn't matter, really.

382
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,500
Have a seat.

383
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,380
Seriously, I'm confused.

384
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,330
She got hurt this badly,

385
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,540
and you guys just stood by?

386
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,650
- She got hurt in the match...
- Wang Yang.

387
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,300
Why were you pretending in the car?

388
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,930
I didn't want you to worry.

389
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,240
We're taking good care of her now.

390
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,310
She's recovering.

391
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,160
Yeah.

392
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,020
Wang Yang.

393
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,880
What happened? Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,990
Sit down first.

395
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,700
The noodles will get cold soon.

396
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
How could I think about eating?

397
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,170
You have to try.

398
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,320
Hurry up.

399
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,870
Li Zan.

400
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,340
Let me see your hand.

401
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,980
It looks twisted. Does it hurt?

402
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,880
It's fine.

403
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,870
Come on, Li Zan.

404
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,140
I'm really okay.

405
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,980
Are you alright sitting here?

406
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,000
Where else could I sit?

407
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,400
Sit where I was sitting.

408
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,580
Would sitting there be proper?

409
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,420
Come on. Stand up.

410
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,320
Stand up. Give that to me.

411
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,580
You're not comfy on this seat.

412
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,450
Here, have my seat.

413
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,580
I'll take this one instead.

414
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,820
- Talk later.
- Didn't you say

415
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,710
you came here to get money?

416
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,130
Let's eat first. We can talk later.

417
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,100
I'm starving.

418
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,010
Eat slowly. Your mouth still hurts.

419
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,500
- You made this?
- Yeah.

420
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,860
Your sis really taught you well.

421
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,200
Not bad, Li Zan.

422
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,110
Right?

423
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,300
Mr. Lu talked to you, right?

424
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,700
I joined a local competition

425
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,780
and made some money from it.

426
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,640
My memory is so bad.

427
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,850
I got the inheritance first.

428
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,770
I was happy about it.

429
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,300
So I joined a local competition.

430
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
The last four digits on your passport

431
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,940
are 1232, right?

432
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,870
Yeah.

433
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,790
I bought tickets for us both

434
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,900
to Beijing the day after tomorrow.

435
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,740
Let's go back to Beijing
to recover. Eat now.

436
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,060
Sis, what about me?

437
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,900
How did you manage before she came?

438
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,860
Just keep doing what you did.

439
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,190
Who is he anyway?

440
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,300
What right

441
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,330
does he have to boss us around?

442
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,210
And the money

443
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,210
was originally

444
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,710
for me to use to settle things in Jaya.

445
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,080
Now it just came in handy.

446
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,520
Let's consider it as tuition

447
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,700
for your cheap brother.

448
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,190
Well, Salty,

449
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,200
why would you lie to me?

450
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,920
Look at the place you live in.

451
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,510
Can you really fool me?

452
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,920
Mr. Lu, that's too much vinegar.

453
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,400
It's Italian balsamic vinegar.

454
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,480
You shouldn't use that much.

455
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,090
- Mr. Wang...
- No.

456
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,460
Who said you could speak here?

457
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,660
One of you claims to be her brother.

458
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,770
The other claims to be her friend.

459
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,540
Wang Yang.

460
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,450
Liu Yan, you can stop talking now.

461
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,890
Do I not know you?

462
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,810
I've spoiled you too much before.

463
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,930
This time, whatever you say,

464
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,540
you're coming back with me.

465
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,250
Let's head back to Beijing.

466
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,180
When we get there,

467
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,660
heal your injuries properly.

468
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,560
As for finding Jiang Fang,

469
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,500
Mr. Lu, the lawyer, can handle it.

470
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,850
Right?

471
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,100
Staying in Jaya or Beijing,

472
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,430
there's really no difference.

473
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,360
Even if we find her,

474
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,720
you can fly back right away, right?

475
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,970
Mr. Lu,

476
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,260
don't just wash one plate.

477
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,500
They're almost worn thin.

478
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,810
Your sis's childhood friend

479
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,650
really cares about her, huh?

480
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,120
That's nonsense.

481
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,800
If your sis doesn't come back,

482
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,690
you'll have to

483
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,730
live the way you used to, right?

484
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,190
She will just go back
to heal her injuries

485
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,230
and come back once she's better.

486
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,970
But I don't see her planning to return.

487
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,300
No, my sis wouldn't do that.

488
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,110
But I promised
to support Li Zan's studies.

489
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,090
I know it's really tough for that kid.

490
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:57,960
But in Beijing,

491
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
we can send money back, right?

492
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,540
Alright, stop hesitating.

493
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,780
Go back to Beijing.

494
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,230
But what can I even do there?

495
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,080
That guy kept repeating just now,

496
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,340
"Go back, go back."

497
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
What does "go back" mean?

498
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,680
It means someone returning

499
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,980
to where she truly belongs.

500
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,140
Seriously, this guy...

501
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,230
Who gave him the confidence

502
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,080
that your sis

503
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,970
belongs to him, right?

504
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,700
Anything's better than staying here.

505
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,010
You don't even know anyone.

506
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,920
If there's any real trouble,

507
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,880
- which friend...?
- Enough.

508
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,910
Stop rubbing my turtle.

509
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,770
Give it to me.

510
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,100
Anything's better than staying here.

511
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,510
How about you tell me the truth?

512
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,410
Are you in a relationship here?

513
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
Is that why you won't go back?

514
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,340
You've rubbed

515
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,520
its skin raw.

516
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,680
What pisses me off the most?

517
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,500
He doesn't see you

518
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,620
as Liu Yan's brother at all.

519
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,380
And he disrespects your work.

520
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,120
Did you see his face eating noodles?

521
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,880
Yeah.

522
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,210
Honestly,

523
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,680
these are

524
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,680
the best noodles I've had in Jaya.

525
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,760
Really?

526
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,290
I thought so too.

527
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,360
In that case,

528
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,290
I'll go talk to him.

529
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,030
Are you planning
to take my sis to Beijing,

530
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,880
and never come back here?

531
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm still discussing

532
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,810
the details with Salty.

533
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,010
I'll be upfront about this.

534
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,500
No way.

535
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,220
Are you out of your mind?

536
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,580
What does it matter to you

537
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,120
whether we return to Beijing?

538
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,420
You really think

539
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,540
you're someone, huh?

540
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,500
Such a big attitude.

541
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,580
You think you're her brother now?

542
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,410
Listen, as her elder brother,

543
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,340
I haven't agreed yet.

544
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,210
My sis has a home here,

545
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,870
family, and friends.

546
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,330
What does Beijing have for her?

547
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,780
I haven't even settled the score

548
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,680
with you for tricking Salty

549
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,750
into suffering in Jaya, you know?

550
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,580
- Enough.
- Bring it up.

551
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,730
If you can, then do it.

552
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,890
Who do you think you are?

553
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,300
Just a petty agent, Wang.

554
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,510
Li Zan!

555
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,540
I really don't want to hit a minor.

556
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,620
As if you could beat a minor anyway.

557
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,880
- You two...
- Seriously, you need to learn.

558
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,690
So what now?

559
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,500
What do you want?

560
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,370
Say that again.

561
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,250
I said. What's the problem?

562
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,500
I even gave you a shove.

563
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,990
- You dare push me?
- Hey, chill.

564
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,730
- What if I push you again?
- Go on, try it.

565
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,560
- Still pushing?
- What?

566
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
No, doing laundry.

567
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,260
Just laundry. That's all.

568
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,460
Just washing.

569
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,690
Brother-in-law!

570
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,390
You don't want my sis
back in Beijing, right?

571
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
Say something, will you?

572
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,640
Wait,

573
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,290
what do you mean by "brother-in-law"?

574
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,530
Don't listen to his nonsense.

575
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,180
What's this got to do with him?

576
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,100
When my sis came to Jaya,

577
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,130
my brother-in-law

578
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,140
handled lots of things.

579
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,820
Can you stop talking?

580
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,560
Wasn't it you
who tricked Salty into Jaya?

581
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,270
Brother-in-law, say something, please.

582
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,140
Everyone, get out!

583
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,310
Out!

584
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,820
What? Brother-in-law?

585
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,490
No.

586
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,450
You too, out!

587
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,900
Salty...

588
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,420
(Lin's Herbal Tea, Grocery)

589
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,860
(Call me and you'll win.
There must be money.)

590
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,980
(Supplementary Agreement)

591
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,460
(Supplementary Agreement:
This agreement...)

592
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,590
Sis,

593
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,300
are you going out?

594
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,760
You're not even healed yet.

595
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,660
Can you go out now?

596
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,930
It's fine.

597
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,790
Don't worry about me.

598
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,760
Just focus on school.

599
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,660
No skipping classes.

600
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,560
I know.

601
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,910
Well,

602
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,310
going out during Qingming Festival

603
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,450
is not the best idea, right?

604
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,450
Be gentle.

605
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,820
Take it slowly.

606
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm okay.

607
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,340
Every year on Qingming,

608
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,590
we spend it together.

609
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,670
We never missed a year.

610
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,880
Study well.

611
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,400
About that...

612
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,010
Just be gentle.

613
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,490
- Be gentle.
- It's fine.

614
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,490
You should head back.

615
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,160
Keep an eye on the car.

616
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,510
Don't worry.

617
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,210
I thought on this Qingming,

618
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,730
we'd finally break tradition

619
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,640
and not get together.

620
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,860
How could that happen?

621
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,960
This is our old tradition.

622
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,060
Every Qingming, I help you be brave.

623
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,130
That courage just won't build.

624
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,290
If I go back to Beijing,

625
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,380
what can I do there?

626
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,210
You should heal first, then decide.

627
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,850
Besides Boxing...

628
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
How about this?

629
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,580
Come do real estate with me.

630
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,020
I'll show you the ropes

631
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,340
and save you a lot of trouble.

632
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,220
Anything else?

633
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,750
Tell me.

634
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,590
What strengths do I have?

635
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,220
Let me pause this first.

636
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,350
Strengths?

637
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,300
Then I have to think hard.

638
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,700
You're healthy.

639
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,260
Even in Beijing's winter,

640
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,980
you don't need leggings.

641
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,520
And also,

642
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,130
your cooking is amazing.

643
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,520
So I should move back to Beijing

644
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,930
and be a housekeeper
in Shunyi villa area?

645
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,940
After all, you're

646
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,270
the descendant of a state-run head chef.

647
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,730
You've got strength too.

648
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,950
Go toss that big wok.

649
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,580
You think I could be a chef?

650
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,500
Sure, you could.

651
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,780
Be a chef.

652
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,140
Yeah, be a chef.

653
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,780
What are you watching? Eat.

654
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,860
Food gets cold if you wait.

655
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,700
It's not as good
as Jiang Fang's cooking.

656
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,830
It's not as good as yours either.

657
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,280
What are you bragging about?

658
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,120
Really.

659
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,900
I know several

660
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,110
who run restaurants in Beijing.

661
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,680
After we go back there,

662
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,420
make them a few signature dishes.

663
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,890
Probably then,

664
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,550
they'll all be fighting to have you.

665
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,480
Your chef's hat

666
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,000
will reach as high as the ceiling.

667
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,420
Come on, Chef Liu.

668
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,730
Put on the chef's hat.

669
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,810
That actually suits you.

670
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,700
Yeah, that's the vibe.

671
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,440
Let me see.

672
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,410
Looks good.

673
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,660
Hello, Chef Liu.

674
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,100
Hello.

675
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,570
Since I'm the head chef now,

676
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,790
I should tidy up

677
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,640
these dishes.

678
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,490
Please.

679
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,380
What's this?

680
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,840
Can I try it now?

681
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,960
Give it a shot.

682
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,420
Smells amazing.

683
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Try this one first.

684
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Alright, I'm eating.

685
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,310
This is so much better

686
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,800
than Jaya's Western food.

687
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,740
You really nailed it.

688
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,780
The color of the sand ginger chicken
shouldn't be too dark.

689
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,000
Come on, speed up.

690
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,890
Move your hands faster.

691
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,700
The tofu sauce should be softer.

692
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,780
Don't let it get too sticky.

693
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,980
Ms. Liu!

694
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,520
Ms. Liu Yan!

695
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,940
Hello.

696
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,240
Sorry, about your agreement,

697
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,730
there's an urgent issue now.

698
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,410
Could you come to the law firm with me?

699
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,090
- Let's talk inside.
- Yeah.

700
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,620
Law is a very precise field.

701
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,500
Professionals need to work

702
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,340
in an environment that matches.

703
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,260
Why are you suddenly saying this?

704
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,290
If you want,

705
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,270
we can start here.

706
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,500
I can start charging from now.

707
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,820
But given the environment here

708
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,690
is too poor,

709
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,750
I might charge

710
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,900
double the fee.

711
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,600
No, no!

712
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,940
Go to the law firm.

713
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,640
Take me to the law firm.

714
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,660
Let me help you.

715
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,800
We're dealing

716
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,870
with legal procedures now.

717
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,020
Please don't disdain the law.

718
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,400
Then I'll go with you.

719
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,260
Slow down.

720
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,100
My car

721
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,050
is packed with stuff.

722
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:49,930
So there might

723
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:50,840
not be room.

724
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,890
Just send me the address.

725
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,990
Salty and I will grab a cab.

726
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,560
- Salty.
- It's fine, Yang.

727
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,330
Wait for me at home.

728
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,020
Mr. Lu is... very professional.

729
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,210
Slow down!

730
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,900
Why are you so serious?

731
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,750
What's up? Want to talk?

732
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,390
Let's discuss it at the law firm.

733
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,050
For the first time,

734
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,220
you seem like a proper lawyer.

735
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,150
(Call me and you'll win. There must be money.)
Wait,

736
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,380
can't we talk downstairs?

737
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,310
I've already

738
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,250
said clearly.

739
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,890
Professionals need

740
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,980
a matching work environment.

741
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,340
So please understand.

742
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,210
Lu Tianchi,

743
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,830
if you can't make sense of it,

744
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,020
you'll see how I handle you.

745
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,050
This is

746
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,370
our supplementary agreement.

747
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,460
Please have a look.

748
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,950
What does it add?

749
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,920
Previously, our agreement

750
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,200
required both parties to be

751
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,500
(Call me and you'll win. There must be money.)
in Jaya.

752
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,720
But since you might leave Jaya,

753
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,810
I need to add

754
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,740
some specific terms.

755
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,820
Finding Jiang Fang has nothing to do

756
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,700
with me being in Jaya.

757
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,900
Just focus on your search.

758
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,140
If you find her, I'll come back.

759
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,010
Finding Jiang Fang

760
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,300
is my responsibility to you.

761
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,570
But I don't have the right

762
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,420
to confine Jiang Fang.

763
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,170
So, in this clause,

764
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,010
I added a note.

765
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,470
If within 60 minutes

766
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,800
after I find Jiang Fang,

767
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,000
you haven't arrived on site.

768
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,840
60 minutes?

769
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,720
How is that possible?

770
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,340
I couldn't even get here
from Beijing by rocket.

771
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:28,940
Miss Liu,

772
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,600
that's why I had to put this condition

773
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,010
into our supplementary agreement.

774
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,730
Because you're not in Jaya,

775
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,180
you miss seeing Jiang Fang.

776
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,380
That doesn't count as my breach

777
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,680
and agreement completed, right?

778
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,590
So if we hit the next stage,

779
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,380
which makes finding Jiang Fang harder,

780
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,480
all losses can't be counted

781
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,140
within my responsibility.

782
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,350
I need to put all of this

783
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,580
down in writing, officially.

784
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,860
Can't you call the police?

785
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,860
Police only take direct family cases.

786
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,870
But everything you said

787
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,170
might not even happen, right?

788
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,980
If you find Jiang Fang,

789
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,740
just tell her the debt is paid off.

790
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,750
She won't have to hide anymore.

791
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,770
Miss Liu,

792
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,360
as a legal consultant,

793
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,660
my job is prevention first

794
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,900
and remediation second.

795
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,510
As for those risks in between,

796
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,580
I suggest you

797
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,990
don't count on luck too much.

798
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,730
Otherwise, all your hard work

799
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,860
could go to waste.

800
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,840
Go to waste?

801
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,540
There's more to lose?

802
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,320
So, what you mean is

803
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,360
that I have to sign this agreement.

804
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,460
And after that,
I can't return to Beijing, right?

805
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,500
Miss Liu,

806
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,580
I think

807
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,770
you can't summarize it

808
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,620
that way.

809
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,760
- Actually...
- Pen.

810
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,860
(Call me and you'll win.
There must be money.)

811
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,500
(Liu)

812
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,700
Is there anything else, Mr. Lu?

813
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,130
That's all.

814
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,380
Your services cover
giving me a ride back, right?

815
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,780
Of course.

816
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,020
(Call me and you'll win. There must be money.)
Terrible service!

817
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,060
I'll try my best to keep it stable.

818
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,730
Have you tried

819
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,040
those food stalls at Jaya?

820
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,880
Let me take you
for braised pork trotters with ginger.

821
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,810
Eat some pork trotters
to nourish your feet.

822
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,260
What's up with you?

823
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,590
You... Is your mouth not working either?

824
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,580
Anyway, the agreement's signed.

825
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,780
Everything else will be easier now.

826
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,020
Don't be too nervous.

827
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,660
Lighten up a bit.

828
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,570
What are you doing?

829
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,540
Let me play you a new song.

830
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,610
How about this one?

831
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,660
Did you just glance at me?

832
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,360
Bro,

833
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,410
you don't know

834
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,260
that your sis has had it too hard.

835
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,750
I know, I get it.

836
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,280
No, you don't.

837
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,140
She has no father

838
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,300
and no mother either.

839
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,820
Coincidentally,

840
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,240
I don't have parents either.

841
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,720
Your sis and I

842
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,280
were childhood sweethearts

843
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,280
and innocent playmates.

844
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,870
We used to practice boxing as kids.

845
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,660
She was so talented,

846
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,620
always beating me up.

847
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,020
After that, seeing me in pain,

848
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,700
she would make me

849
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,060
something delicious at home,

850
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,550
like noodles with soybean paste.

851
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,740
Every year during Qingming Festival,

852
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,990
we'd always spend it together.

853
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,180
She'd mess with me and pretend

854
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,530
to be a ghost to scare me.

855
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,420
That's why even today,

856
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,630
I have never been toughened up.

857
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,270
Right, Salty?

858
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,740
Exactly.

859
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,070
In summer,

860
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,830
we'd both sleep on one mat

861
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,940
in the yard.

862
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,920
And in winter, you remember?

863
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,570
In winter,

864
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,290
I was always freezing.

865
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,080
Your sis would give me

866
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,090
her thick leggings.

867
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,160
She didn't wear them.

868
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,020
That's because I just hate them.

869
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,890
Your sis

870
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,380
is not good at expressing herself.

871
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,340
Drink less.

872
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,400
It's fine.

873
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,960
We're...

874
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,440
developing on our own paths.

875
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,480
But

876
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,100
we're destined

877
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,420
to stay together forever.

878
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,100
Even though this time,

879
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,620
she won't come back with me.

880
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,770
But your sis will eventually

881
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,060
return to Beijing.

882
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,020
Do you get that?

883
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,130
Are you angry with me?

884
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,370
If you don't say, I'll go.

885
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,580
All we talked about last night

886
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,670
was for nothing, huh?

887
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,860
I need to find Jiang Fang.

888
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,270
I have to see her face

889
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,240
at first sight.

890
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,620
There are so many questions

891
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,580
I want to ask her.

892
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,350
I can't let her slip away again.

893
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,640
She can't just run off, you know?

894
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,220
About looking for Jiang Fang,

895
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,220
I understand it

896
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,230
and support you.

897
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,380
But ultimately,

898
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,210
you need to think about yourself.

899
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,770
Can't we just...

900
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,830
live our own lives?

901
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,100
Well,

902
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,520
I feel like I have never thought about

903
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,500
what I actually like.

904
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,020
It's like when someone asks about

905
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,810
what flavor of ice cream you like,

906
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:18,880
you say chocolate.

907
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,740
As time goes by,

908
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,740
you and everyone else really believe

909
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,490
that chocolate's your favorite.

910
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,450
But I've never tried other flavors.

911
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,670
I have no choice.

912
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,670
I need you to understand me.

913
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,660
I can't go back to Beijing yet.

914
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,980
Yeah, I'm trying to understand.

915
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,790
I have to find Jiang Fang.

916
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,220
I know no one supports me

917
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,830
when it comes to finding Jiang Fang.

918
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,280
But that's because they don't know her.

919
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,690
You're different, Wang Yang.

920
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,270
I'll remember what you said

921
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,180
last night forever.

922
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,100
Alright, you should go back now.

923
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,720
If you don't go, you'll miss the flight.

924
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,590
It's okay. If anything comes up,

925
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,540
I'll come and find you again.

926
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,390
If the mountain
doesn't come to me, I'll go to it.

927
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,200
Stop it. As long as you're here,

928
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,720
I'll have to look after you.

929
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,980
Beijing is our home.

930
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,160
Just do your best over there.

931
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,970
Otherwise, when I go back,

932
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,130
I won't have any family

933
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,050
to turn to at all.

934
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,940
What are you doing?

935
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,900
(Waiting for you to come back)

936
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,170
Are you bored or what?

937
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,510
I'm leaving.

938
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,140
♪Mother, I've grown up♪

939
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:35,180
♪No longer crave my embrace♪

940
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:42,380
♪No longer need my approval♪

941
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:49,540
♪No longer afraid
to realize I'm still here♪

942
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,940
♪Countless disappointments;
