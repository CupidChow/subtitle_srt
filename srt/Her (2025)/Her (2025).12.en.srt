15
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,780
Where's Philip?

16
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,860
He's inside.

17
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,820
Philip.

18
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,220
Philip!

19
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,700
What are you here

20
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,300
to fix at this hour?

21
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,220
So you're Philip?

22
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,260
Yeah, that's me. Who are you?

23
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,740
(Watch Your Step)

24
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,140
=Episode 12=

25
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,140
Forget it, I can't say it.

26
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,100
It's eating me up.

27
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,740
Then don't say anything.

28
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,060
Honestly, I shouldn't

29
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,100
get involved with you two.

30
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,990
But I still want to give advice.

31
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,620
Lu Tianchi has his issues,

32
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,340
but I think

33
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,500
he really cares about you.

34
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,540
Your sudden change in attitude

35
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,760
feels jarring.

36
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,020
Though I've dated countless men,

37
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,770
I understand what real feelings mean.

38
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,630
You two aren't really experienced,

39
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,700
so minor conflicts

40
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,540
early on

41
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,380
are perfectly normal.

42
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,700
Arguments help people

43
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,020
understand each other better.

44
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,220
I'm not even sure

45
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,580
if what we had counted as dating.

46
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,660
Does this count as a breakup?

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,980
Of course, it counts as dating!

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,460
Frankly, I don't know

49
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,810
what happened between you two.

50
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,110
But don't let Lu Tianchi's height

51
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,920
fool you.

52
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,660
He's actually super timid and stubborn.

53
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,500
Yeah, he's definitely timid.

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,340
I'm out.

55
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,140
Are you really leaving?

56
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,220
Keep an eye on Li Zan for me.

57
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,500
I'm counting on you.

58
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,260
Don't worry.

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,340
Bye.

60
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,100
Isn't this the upright lawyer,

61
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,220
Lu?

62
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,300
- 4543?
- Yeah, 4543.

63
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,020
Quiet! Geez.

64
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,340
You can leave now.

65
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,780
Lucky day.

66
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,500
And you stay.

67
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,620
You... you want back in?

68
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,460
Or what?

69
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,180
Why didn't you dodge?

70
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,660
I accept my punishment.

71
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,850
Stop pretending to care.

72
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,710
You fought for her.

73
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,770
Why didn't you tell her?

74
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
You didn't say it, right?

75
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,370
Hey! You promised me you wouldn't.

76
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,220
You said you wouldn't tell her.

77
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,980
I didn't.

78
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,140
Let her do what she wants.

79
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,060
I'm letting you

80
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,980
do what you want to do, too.

81
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,740
This is too much. I can't take it.

82
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,910
I didn't ask you to come,
and you chose to.

83
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,060
You...

84
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,050
You're really driving me crazy.

85
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,980
Do you know how much I paid

86
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,110
for your bail to get you out?

87
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Just ask him

88
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,160
to give the money back.

89
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,490
What, you enjoy being locked up now?

90
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,700
It's just two weeks.

91
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,220
Don't waste money.

92
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,620
It's your money anyway.

93
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Then how did you know

94
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,590
my password?

95
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,620
It's not hard to guess.

96
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,420
It's either your birthday,

97
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,670
mine, or Liu Yan's birthday.

98
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,740
And it turned out

99
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,980
to be Liu Yan's birthday.

100
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,100
You're poor enough
to only have this face left,

101
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,050
and now it's scarred.

102
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,360
Let me take a look.

103
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,650
- Let me see.
- What for?

104
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,660
You're bleeding here.

105
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,690
It's deep, might leave a scar.

106
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,100
A scar?

107
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,460
Do you really...

108
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,780
give every scar a name?

109
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,260
Of course.

110
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,860
This one's the Liu Yan scar.

111
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,620
I'm heading out.

112
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,260
Salty,

113
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,790
today Wang Yang even rented a car.

114
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,660
I thought he'd take me for a drive.

115
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,880
Turned out it was to pick you up.

116
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,380
Lin Fei, no need to call her sis.

117
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,300
We're all the same age.

118
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,140
Just being polite.

119
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,420
Salty.

120
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,550
How did you two meet?

121
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,550
- Frisbee.
- Blind date.

122
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,380
No chemistry at all.

123
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,050
You owe me a camping trip this weekend.

124
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,390
Salty, have you been camping?

125
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,780
No.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,070
It's really fun.

127
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,060
Tons of food stalls around.

128
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,070
Everything tastes amazing.

129
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,120
And you told Salty it's amazing?

130
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,950
Let me tell you,

131
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,300
I've never met anyone who cooks

132
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,250
better than Salty.

133
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,460
Well, I haven't tried it.

134
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,720
But I've had your cooking.

135
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,500
Salty, I bet you don't know this.

136
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,180
Wang Yang grills

137
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,420
the best meat skewers.

138
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,820
Salty, haven't you tried them?

139
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,750
No, I haven't.

140
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,370
Those meat skewers are super tender.

141
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,620
And they're really juicy.

142
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,690
Plus, they're really light.

143
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,180
Juicy and not heavy at all?

144
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,050
Did you actually cook them through?

145
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,100
Of course I did.

146
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,890
I learned all my cooking from you.

147
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,580
With you back,

148
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,170
I can finally eat
the noodles with soybean paste

149
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,100
I've been craving.

150
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,020
Did you buy groceries?

151
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,100
Of course.

152
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,300
Alright.

153
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,470
When you hit rock bottom, eat first.

154
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,560
What's wrong? Just tell me.

155
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,700
Did you get garlic?

156
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,860
Of course.

157
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,100
Noodles without garlic

158
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,970
aren't as fun.

159
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,540
Salty, let's add each other on WeChat.

160
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,620
- Okay.
- Wang Yang's been super busy lately,

161
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,820
so if you need anything,

162
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,220
just reach out to me.

163
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,770
Alright.

164
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,060
Here, Fei.

165
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,370
This one's your veggie sauce.

166
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,080
- Thanks, Salty.
- All egg, no meat at all.

167
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,900
Great.

168
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,570
And here's our minced meat fried sauce.

169
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,780
And...

170
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,030
this is the topping.

171
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,430
See, there's Chinese toon,

172
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,830
plus cabbage and celery.

173
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,250
- Let's dig in.
- Go ahead.

174
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,220
Come on.

175
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,940
Add a bit more oil.

176
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,640
That already looks so tasty.

177
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,700
Salty, how are you this good?

178
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,500
Listen,

179
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,430
with skills like yours,

180
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,540
you could easily get into that big hotel

181
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,930
in the China World Trade Center.

182
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,580
By the way,

183
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,120
my friend's uncle is...

184
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,450
What's that hotel?

185
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,250
Anyway, he's the executive chef
at a top hotel.

186
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,260
I could introduce you.

187
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,840
Yes, that'd be great.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,320
I don't want to stay in the kitchen now.

189
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,060
Well, I haven't asked you

190
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,890
why you suddenly came back.

191
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,860
Returning to roots.

192
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,780
Honestly,

193
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,460
I just like Beijing's dryness

194
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,460
and aridness.

195
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,700
That sharp spring wind hits your face.

196
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,620
It's like

197
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,080
steel wool scrubbing a burnt pot bottom.

198
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,350
Be honest with me,

199
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,060
did something happen to you in Jaya?

200
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,160
Almost got stabbed.

201
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,800
With your lousy acting,

202
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,060
try acting more convincingly.

203
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,300
If you could bear that,

204
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,100
you'd definitely use that...

205
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,730
what's it called, jujitsu,

206
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,750
to break people's arms or legs.

207
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,260
I'm back to make money.

208
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,610
What else would I do?

209
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,940
Salty,

210
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,450
let us give you a ride home.

211
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,420
- No.
- It's...

212
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,090
Just stay here, don't bother.

213
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,260
I've checked out some nearby homestays.

214
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,660
They're all close.

215
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,750
- That works...
- Don't play dumb

216
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,360
with me.

217
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,700
This has been your home since childhood.

218
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,830
Just stay here, don't bother.

219
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,420
Yang's right.

220
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,360
Since you're back in Beijing,

221
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,400
how can we let you stay outside?

222
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,040
Or you could crash at my place.

223
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,710
Alright, just take him home then.

224
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,150
- No...
- I'm not leaving.

225
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,990
Okay.

226
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,610
We haven't fully moved in together.

227
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,450
No way.

228
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,470
Why are you so shy about it?

229
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,340
It's just how it is.

230
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,520
What's up with you today?

231
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm making a call.

232
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,580
You guys go ahead and eat.

233
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,700
Who are you checking in with?

234
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,620
Li Zan!

235
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,190
That kid never picks up my calls.

236
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,860
Stop staring.

237
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,460
You're spacing out
on this junk tricycle.

238
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,650
What's going on with you?

239
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,660
Thinking of fixing it?

240
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,090
Probably.

241
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,420
It doesn't look too bad.

242
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,180
After fixing, what for?

243
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,550
Probably easy to fix.

244
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,960
No, these metal parts are fixable.

245
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,300
Look, it still moves.

246
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,490
The key is the electrics, that's tricky.

247
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,140
Are you going to push it yourself later?

248
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,180
That'll be a pain.

249
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,070
Yang's back.

250
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,980
Hello, sir.

251
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,940
Perfect timing. Help her think it over.

252
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,820
You two talk it out.

253
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,690
I'll get going now.

254
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,580
Take care.

255
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,140
What are you up to now?

256
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,900
Start a business.

257
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,400
Start a business? Collect recyclables?

258
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,810
Run a street stall.

259
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,740
I need to call

260
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,280
those burdens in Jaya.

261
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,480
You, a Black Pearl chef, won't cook.

262
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,540
But a guerrilla style?

263
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,580
Wasn't it you calling me daily

264
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,650
to urge me to come back?

265
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,870
I do want you to come back.

266
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,610
But you always leave on a whim,

267
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,670
then suddenly come back.

268
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,860
This time...

269
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,120
you can't leave on an impulse, right?

270
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,860
Beijing is my real home.

271
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,990
I'm not leaving again, for sure.

272
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,790
You really mean it?

273
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,740
I mean it!

274
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,100
Alright, let me take a look.

275
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
But this one...

276
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,160
Why did you suddenly leave?

277
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,140
Let me give you a ride.

278
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,440
No need, a friend is waiting for me.

279
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,840
It's fine. I'll wait with you.

280
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,690
We're here for the same reason.

281
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,460
Hitting on me really gets you nowhere.

282
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,780
Is everything okay?

283
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,660
Finally, you made it.

284
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,260
I've actually been waiting for you.

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,940
Thanks for what you did.

286
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,500
I'm Tang Shuangshuang.

287
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,460
Pierre.

288
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,500
Nice to meet you.

289
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,010
Nice to meet you, too.

290
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,830
Do you live around here?

291
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,670
Yeah.

292
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,460
You want me to help find Li Zan?

293
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,510
No, didn't you promise her

294
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,490
that you'd look after the kid?

295
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,100
I've got something urgent here.

296
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,800
Alright, I get it.

297
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,620
Where are you off to?

298
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,760
You never answer the calls.

299
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,100
Extra lessons.

300
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,820
Got any books? Let me see.

301
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,690
Is that your business?

302
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,700
Just go home, alright?

303
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,340
Don't touch me.

304
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,700
- What?
- If it weren't for you,

305
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,650
my sis wouldn't have left.

306
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,540
Alright, let's go.

307
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,580
Talk it over at home.

308
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,600
Don't touch me.

309
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,340
Okay, calm down.

310
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,180
Don't be mad.

311
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,020
Let go of me!

312
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,230
What's with your hair?

313
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,070
We can talk at home.

314
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,070
Let's go, alright?

315
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,120
Let go, just let go!

316
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,220
Can you try a little harder?

317
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,440
Come on, open the door.

318
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,180
Cheers.

319
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,060
Are you out of hope or what?

320
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,440
Why do you have to drink like that?

321
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,780
When you hit rock bottom,

322
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,640
drink first.

323
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,970
That's not how it goes.

324
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,210
Did your sis ask
who's looking after you?

325
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,060
I knew it.

326
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,900
You claim to be taking care of me.

327
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,990
But you're up to no good.

328
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,100
Can you see it?

329
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,050
Your eyes just met.

330
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,710
Drink up.
Just quit thinking about my sis.

331
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,960
Nice work environment.

332
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,220
So, what brings you here?

333
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,060
Got a way to make some money.

334
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,530
Wanted to do it together.

335
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,980
I promised my sis
I'd focus on school.

336
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,810
Relax, it won't mess with your studies.

337
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,770
It's super simple.

338
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,560
Just debt collection.

339
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,980
We'll be assistants, okay?

340
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,120
You really are something.

341
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,300
Too scared to go alone?

342
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,220
Have to drag me down?

343
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,200
That's why I'm counting on you.

344
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,900
You're smart, so we'll be fine.

345
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,990
Heading out already?

346
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,100
No, just...

347
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,900
Forgot to leave this here.

348
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,040
Your sis left you so much good food.

349
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,010
(Braised beef.
Eat sliced or cubed. 7 days.)

350
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,410
(Foodie Detective. Livestream)
I don't know the time.

351
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,530
(Cloud Queue)
I'm always here.

352
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,150
(So many people! Insane!)
Queued for three hours.

353
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,300
(What's this for?)
Haven't made it yet.

354
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
(Massive crowd!)
Really?

355
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,150
(Eat! Dying of envy!)
I came for the hype, too.

356
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,850
(Can't escape this.)
I saw it online.

357
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,220
(I could eat this a year!)
Drove three hours

358
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,330
(Carbs+Iced drinks!)
and queued three hours

359
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,360
(Almost cried for this.)
for this

360
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,220
(Interesting!)
black truffle fried rice.

361
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,450
(Where is it?)
We came two days ago.

362
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,920
(Screenshot frenzy!)
When we got here,

363
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,100
(Wipe your drool.)
she had just packed up.

364
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,150
(Feel the wok aroma!)
It was that popular.

365
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,300
(I almost cried for this.)

366
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,420
(Such skilled technique.)

367
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,370
Smells amazing, right?

368
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,670
(Two more eggs, please!)

369
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,810
You're a genius!

370
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,180
Here you go.

371
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,180
(Black truffle. That toss was epic.)

372
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,020
(Green onions are key.)

373
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,420
(The rice grains literally shine.)

374
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,340
Black truffle.

375
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,500
(Literally the master of fried rice.)

376
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,240
- Here you go.
- Is this free?

377
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,600
- Free, totally free.
- Awesome.

378
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,600
(Black Truffle Fried Rice. Cold Brew Jasmine Tea)
Without this,

379
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,020
(Never heard of it.)
its flavor loses half.

380
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,520
Honestly, it's super tasty.

381
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,610
Try it, try the fried rice.

382
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,810
Go on, try a bite.

383
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,830
Let's see if I'm just imagining things

384
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,280
or if this is amazing.

385
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,340
You know what,

386
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,960
it's really good.

387
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,260
She nailed it with this dish.

388
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,220
15?

389
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,610
Are you doing charity?

390
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,150
I've also got cold brew jasmine tea.

391
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,990
Try some too.

392
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,900
Thanks.

393
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,020
Here comes the marketing.

394
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,000
Isn't this just summer in Beijing?

395
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,740
Nice, you really nailed it.

396
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,910
Thanks for your support.

397
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,930
If there's anything to improve,

398
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,860
just let me know.

399
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,330
Nothing, because at this hour...

400
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,700
When the urban management officers come,

401
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,770
no stalls operate on this street,

402
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,660
except yours.

403
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,190
You're already doing great!

404
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,570
Break it up!

405
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,940
Sorry, everyone.

406
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,180
We're closing for today.

407
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,220
That's it for today.

408
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,620
Wait, there's still one left.

409
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,540
- Get in the car.
- Still one left.

410
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,600
Wait, what about the pot?

411
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,690
(More Jasmine, please.)
Just flip it?

412
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,580
(Runaway wok skills!)
Flip it.

413
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,250
(What's going on?)
This is fun!

414
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,650
(Laughing till my stomach hurts!)
Nice!

415
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,550
(For the show, right?)
My first time.

416
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,700
(Suggest a combo meal!)
Never seen this before.

417
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,070
(What kind of move is this?)
This is fun!

418
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,930
(Runaway wok skills, haha.)
Where did you learn this?

419
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,600
(Safety first!)
My mom was a state-owned restaurant chef.

420
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,330
(The camera can't keep up, haha.)
You're definitely going viral.

421
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,500
How long have you been cooking here?

422
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,420
Just started!

423
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,130
- Just started?
- Please help promote me.

424
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,490
Sure. You're Beijing's
number one fried rice.

425
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,680
Thanks, I'll take that luck.

426
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,990
(Even the bystanders are shocked, haha.)

427
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,820
It's a win-win!

428
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,620
(Red braised pork.
Reheat with water. 5 days.)

429
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,740
This tastes amazing.

430
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,220
No idea

431
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,760
when I'll get to eat her cooking again.

432
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,580
(Li Zan)
My sis sent someone

433
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,890
to stay at my place and watch me.

434
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,780
Now I can't go out at night.

435
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,290
Give me a few days to figure this out.

436
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,820
Oh no, the house is on fire!

437
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,380
What are you doing?

438
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,460
Come on, just try it.

439
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,450
No way. Is that even edible?

440
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,540
I followed

441
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,100
your sis's recipes exactly.

442
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,940
Just give it a shot.

443
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,490
Careful, it's hot.

444
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,540
Come on.

445
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,170
I need to use the bathroom.

446
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,260
Go ahead, go.

447
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,090
Not sure who's helping whom here.

448
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,700
Can you hand me the wine first?

449
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,900
Your sis and I...

450
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,770
haven't broken up.

451
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,950
Drink yourself to death.

452
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,360
Did my sis text you back?

453
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,250
Lu Tianchi.

454
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,100
Lu Tianchi...

455
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,300
Oh wow.

456
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,770
Do you think my sis

457
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,620
could really forget about us?

458
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,130
And now she's with Yang?

459
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,080
No way, that's impossible.

460
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,780
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

461
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,620
Thanks!

462
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,740
- Excuse me!
- Two yuan!

463
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,600
- Excuse me!
- Two yuan!

464
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,220
The investment is looking good.

465
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,230
Seriously? For real?

466
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,920
Listen up, everyone!

467
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,710
Everything you ate today

468
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,840
is on me, okay?

469
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,990
Good!

470
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,630
But when you're done,

471
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,880
could you post it

472
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,740
on social media?

473
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,780
This is

474
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,530
Chef Liu Yan from fine dining!

475
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,020
Post it later and help promote.

476
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,410
Drinks are on me.

477
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,500
Thanks!

478
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,340
Really, thank you.

479
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,700
Wait, Liu Yan is
"salt" as in table salt,

480
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,580
not "language" as in words.

481
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,500
Don't get it wrong.

482
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,420
Got it.

483
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,970
So, how many did you order?

484
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,050
- Four.
- Two.

485
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,320
Count me in!

486
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,300
Alright.

487
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,720
More drinks, anyone?

488
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,540
Salty!

489
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,300
Salty.

490
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,930
Just now, Ms. Du's assistant

491
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,850
messaged me.

492
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
She wants me over

493
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,060
before noon.

494
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,580
- Really?
- But we can't go empty-handed.

495
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,050
Anything you want me to take?

496
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,900
Let her taste it.

497
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,740
We can't serve the boss street food.

498
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,020
How is that street food?

499
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,330
Yours is Black Pearl level.

500
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,460
Fine dining apprentice fried rice.

501
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,980
- Think quickly.
- No...

502
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,530
- What should we make?
- Let me think.

503
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,370
Let me think.

504
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,480
There's still some meat in the fridge.

505
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,980
- The meat! Okay.
- I'll...

506
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,880
I'll take a look.

507
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,140
With our Black Pearl level,

508
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,250
shouldn't it have

509
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,900
some special meat?

510
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,460
Chicken?

511
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,940
It deserves

512
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,340
beef or something.

513
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,760
Pork and beef are no good.

514
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,860
Shouldn't we use...

515
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,060
that food warmer?

516
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,600
Right, it'd be dry by arrival.

517
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,160
The texture would get tough.

518
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,820
But chicken doesn't have that issue.

519
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,580
The skin might lose its crispiness,

520
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,820
but the flavor stays spot on.

521
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,060
Classy.

522
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,620
What's the name of this dish?

523
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,890
How should I introduce it to her?

524
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,700
Teriyaki chicken.

525
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,020
- Teriyaki chicken.
- Teriyaki chicken.

526
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,010
How's it going? Ready?

527
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,380
Yeah, it's ready.

528
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,900
Here she comes.

529
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,940
Shirley!

530
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,780
Shirley.

531
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,590
Mr. Wang, right?

532
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,980
Yes, that's me. Sorry to trouble you

533
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,330
to come out personally.

534
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,280
Apologies, Mr. Wang.

535
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,980
Ms. Du asked me to tell you,

536
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,100
about investing in the restaurant,

537
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,390
she's putting it on hold for now.

538
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,220
Wait, why is that?

539
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,580
I was talking with Jenny before,

540
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,530
and she was quite interested.

541
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,700
It was only after you told Jenny

542
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,980
that the Highland chef was back
to start a business

543
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,100
that she showed interest.

544
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,540
But we've checked.

545
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,870
The head chef at Highland Restaurant

546
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,980
is Philip.

547
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,020
The person you mentioned,

548
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,380
Miss Liu, was just
a junior staff member.

549
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,070
And she was eliminated.

550
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,430
I wasn't eliminated!

551
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,740
I wasn't eliminated.

552
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,890
Is this Miss Liu?

553
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,330
Well, Miss Liu made this.

554
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,830
Could you have Jenny try it?

555
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,540
I think

556
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,500
she'll change her mind.

557
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,940
No, just take a look.

558
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,010
It's teriyaki chicken.

559
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,460
Wait...

560
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,680
What are you doing?

561
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,860
Don't go.

562
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,180
I'll handle it.

563
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,830
This is so frustrating.

564
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,420
Let's go.

565
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,360
Let's just leave, no more waiting.

566
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,170
Let's try another way.

567
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,660
Let's wait longer.

568
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,060
I'm really sorry.

569
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,700
If only I could've explained
more clearly...

570
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,780
Come on, you explained it well.

571
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,380
My friend Liu Yan is

572
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,730
the top fine dining chef

573
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,970
from Highland Restaurant of Jaya.

574
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,940
Maybe if I'd been less clear, it'd help.

575
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,410
Who knew Ms. Du would have

576
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,420
such wide connections?

577
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,850
She knows people
from Highland Restaurant.

578
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,740
She actually checked.

579
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,820
I know.

580
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,660
If they really eliminated you,

581
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,140
you wouldn't be back in Beijing.

582
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,180
You're honestly the type,

583
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,240
like dumplings in a teapot.

584
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,250
Full of substance

585
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,450
but can't pour it out.

586
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,680
Yeah, I acted on impulse coming back.

587
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,820
But lately,

588
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,720
seeing people lining up
for my fried rice

589
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,700
and how happy they are after eating,

590
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,140
I feel coming back was right.

591
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,740
No way.

592
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,260
We have to try one more time.

593
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,140
I'm Liu Yan!

594
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,460
I really am a junior staff member

595
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,180
of Highland Restaurant.

596
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,740
My friend was trying to help me

597
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,900
by exaggerating my experience.

598
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,010
I'm really sorry.

599
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,590
I hope you won't be too upset.

600
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,460
Those two kids are still here.

601
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,140
When I left home this morning,

602
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,090
I specially prepared

603
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,940
some food for you.

604
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,660
But things got messed up.

605
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,350
So there was no chance
to give it to you.

606
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,660
Could you give me a chance

607
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,940
to make you some snacks?

608
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,020
Please, just give it a try.

609
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,120
Not bad, you've got some skills.

610
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,960
Alright.

611
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,180
Aren't you going to try it?

612
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,300
If Ms. Du tries it,

613
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,760
wouldn't that just be nitpicking?

614
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,380
I didn't mean it that way.

615
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,860
Miss Liu,

616
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,330
I think you're still very far

617
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,900
from opening your own restaurant.

618
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,060
Wait, if you don't eat it,

619
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
how do you know?

620
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,500
I know the taste is passable

621
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,610
without tasting it.

622
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,810
You could open a restaurant

623
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,510
based on your cooking skills.

624
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,580
But having

625
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,420
a good concept

626
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,950
and solid management
are even more crucial.

627
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,260
I don't think you two

628
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,500
possess these qualities.

629
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,080
So, my food is just not tasty enough?

630
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,100
As long as the food is truly delicious,

631
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,620
even without a proper space,

632
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,690
no matter how hot or cold it gets,

633
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,680
even with wind, rain,
or large hailstones,

634
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,190
people will still line up for it.

635
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,600
Okay, so I hope she can keep pushing it.

636
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,860
You should keep pushing.

637
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
I promise I'll give it my all.

638
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,540
A restaurant is just a shell.

639
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,920
It's great food that gives it life.

640
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,540
Who said that?

641
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,580
Highland's head chef, Philip?

642
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,900
No, it was said by Mr. He Guangyuan,

643
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,980
the owner of Highland Restaurant.

644
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,700
Miss Liu,

645
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,660
many people in the culinary world

646
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,680
copy Mr. He's rhetoric,

647
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,770
but few truly

648
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,700
master his skills.

649
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,120
I hope you're not just a copycat.

650
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,860
Please.

651
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,820
Alright.

652
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,540
Ms. Du,

653
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,040
no, Ms. Jenny, I'm really sorry.

654
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,780
We prepared food today,

655
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,680
but I ended up spilling it.

656
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,460
The ingredients weren't utilized well.

657
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,470
Next time

658
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,900
we'll definitely have a real meal.

659
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,740
Let's go, Salty.

660
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,990
Going out wandering so late at night?

661
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,760
You're quite energetic.

662
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,340
I can't sleep.

663
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,690
Don't wander too far.

664
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,190
It's pitch dark out.

665
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,780
Sir.

666
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,420
Salty.

667
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,180
Salty!

668
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,860
- Wow...
- Classy.

669
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,540
(Bada Shanren)

670
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,760
Not going so well, is it?

671
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,100
Kind of.

672
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,260
I told you it's quite normal.

673
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,870
Liu Yan was just doing odd jobs

674
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,490
for a fine dining restaurant.

675
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,420
It was generous of her to come.

676
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,030
She is a proper chef.

677
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,980
Really.

678
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,840
Alright, I don't mean anything else.

679
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,180
I think that after she came back,

680
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,900
you've been

681
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,830
acting off.

682
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,020
Liu Yan finally

683
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,960
made it back to Beijing.

684
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,120
You know how tough it's been for her.

685
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,940
How could I just ignore her?

686
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,140
Right?

687
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,460
What do you mean?

688
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,680
Are you going to invest in her?

689
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,180
No.

690
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,450
Look, I support whatever you do,

691
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,690
but

692
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,980
this is absolutely not.

693
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,580
Don't worry.

694
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,740
I'll just help her organize things.

695
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,000
At most, I'd just get a small bonus.

696
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,300
Plus,

697
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,770
with Liu Yan's personality,
she'd never let me invest for her.

698
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,820
But right now,

699
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,650
we're off to a bad start.

700
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,760
It's kind of embarrassing.

701
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,500
I don't know how to face her.

702
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,050
Come on, let's have a drink.

703
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,350
Cheers!

704
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,030
Sis.

705
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,360
Come on, let's do this!

706
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,650
Down it, come on!

707
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,660
Here we go, all in!

708
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,810
♪Night Shanghai♪

709
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,640
♪You are a city that never sleeps♪

710
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,490
♪Lights are bright, cars on the street♪

♪Music and laughter fill the air♪

712
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,310
Let's do another round!

713
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,180
Come on!

714
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,540
Fill the glasses again.

715
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,240
Alright, come on!

716
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,360
Thanks.

717
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,940
Fill up the glasses.

718
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,540
On it!

719
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,570
Let's have a toast.

720
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,090
Cheers!

721
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,220
Wang, what are you doing?

722
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,700
Come on, focus up.

723
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,720
Come here. Sit over there.

724
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,740
Sit here.

725
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,900
Fill Wang's glass.

726
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,980
Fill it, right?

727
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,140
Down it. Let's go!

728
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,340
Good!

729
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,180
Good.

730
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,580
Sis,

731
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,840
this is the proposal Salty and I

732
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,960
put together.

733
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,900
Wang.

734
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,260
About this thing,

735
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,940
I might not be able to help much,

736
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,400
but I do have

737
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,390
some advice.

738
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,330
Please, I'd love your guidance.

739
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,090
When an investor puts in money,

740
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,590
do you think
it's just about the project?

741
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,780
It's not!

742
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,780
The key is always the people.

743
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,540
We're giving your friend

744
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,650
a large sum of money.

745
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,860
Is this person reliable?

746
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,750
Can they really be trusted?

747
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,770
That's what Ms. Du and I
care about most.

748
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,230
Listen, I promise you,

749
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,850
my friend is absolutely reliable.

750
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,500
And you or Ms. Jenny

751
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,490
can contact me anytime.

752
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,740
I definitely trust you.

753
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,940
But what about Ms. Du?

754
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,470
You should

755
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,620
reassure Ms. Du, too.

756
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,100
How should I show it?

757
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,380
You need to put in some capital.

758
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,850
Alright, how much do you want?

759
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,820
That much?

760
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,390
If you miss this chance

761
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,610
and she gets even more popular later,

762
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,350
you won't be able to find her.

763
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,260
Finish it all!

764
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,620
Drank it straight down!

765
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,060
Be a chef.

766
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,680
You think I could be a chef?

767
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,740
Sure, you could.

768
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,930
Did she really say there's a chance?

769
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,250
Of course, why else give us a shot

770
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,380
to meet with Ms. Du?

771
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,980
The place we're finding for Ms. Du

772
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,820
definitely needs to

773
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,830
- be special.
- For sure.

774
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,260
This is a big deal for you.

775
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,110
We must find at least

776
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,460
a place with a decent environment.

777
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,860
Not too crowded.

778
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,250
This place feels packed.

779
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,290
You mean something more private, right?

780
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,680
There are places like that.

781
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,220
Let's look around here first.

782
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,900
If this doesn't work out,

783
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,880
I'll ask my friend.

784
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,320
Is it true?

785
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,570
How could it be different

786
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,780
from what he says?

787
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,880
What kind of place is this?

788
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,840
It used to be a bar, I think.

789
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,260
Is that okay? It seems big enough.

790
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,080
- Is that okay?
- But for places like this...

791
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,380
That one's good.

792
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,700
But isn't that one pricey?

793
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,980
You think that place would work?

794
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,480
I'll check around later.

795
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,020
I know all these agents here.

796
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,820
They'll definitely give us a deal.

797
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,710
For real?

798
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,140
Same line of work, of course.

799
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,930
This place is nice, right?

800
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
Yeah, it's really good.

801
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,950
Good design and great environment.

802
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,220
This one's better than the last few.

803
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,350
Take a look at the kitchen.

804
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,460
I've checked. I think it's great.

805
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,890
Yeah, and the price is fair.

806
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,590
What time are we talking about?

807
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,740
Before 9 AM

808
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,790
or after 9 PM?

809
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
That won't work.

810
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,620
We can't treat Ms. Du

811
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,700
to breakfast or a midnight snack.

812
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,860
Alright, got it.

813
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,700
We'll keep looking.

814
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,660
I'll call you if anything comes up.

815
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,530
This place is pretty good.

816
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,100
Did your pants get ripped?

817
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,230
Want me to fix them for you?

818
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,410
Are you bored or what?

819
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,150
As your brother-in-law,

820
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,340
I really hope

821
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,210
our living situation can be better.

822
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,340
My sis's gone now.

823
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,330
What brother-in-law?

824
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,120
She's not gone. She's right here!

825
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,360
She's with you like...

826
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,120
You have to believe she'll come back.

827
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,190
She will come back.

828
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,020
Didn't you love filming?

829
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,780
Ready, action.

830
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,260
Go ahead, keep filming.

831
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,820
Don't stop now.

832
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,940
How long do I have to climb?

833
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,550
Your moves aren't standard at all.

834
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,340
I'm already this perfect,
and it's still not standard?

835
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,900
Big Beast is huge.

836
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,500
Try it again.

837
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,220
No, not "ah", it's...

838
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,420
(Little turtle,)

839
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,220
(just hiding behind your shell.)

840
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,760
(Lu Tianchi, you're the little turtle.)

841
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,820
