(Animal feet, aminal head,
animal neck, front leg)

191
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,790
(Front rib, pork shoulder, belly,
tenderloin, hind leg)

192
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,540
(Ham, rump, top of rump)

193
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,780
Li Zan, what are you doing?

194
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,620
Why are you here?

195
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,260
Ms. He called me again today,

196
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,200
saying you skipped
half your classes this week.

197
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,540
I'm about to turn 18.

198
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,020
I might as well go to work.

199
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,780
Why are you so shortsighted?

200
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,260
Even after this is all over,

201
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,860
I'm not going to leave you behind.

202
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,900
I'll support you through college.

203
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,180
So, stop worrying

204
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,420
about this kind of thing, okay?

205
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,980
The most educated person I've met

206
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,820
was my dad.

207
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,220
The least educated

208
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,420
is Luo Zheng.

209
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,580
Who?

210
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,340
Luo Zheng. Mr. Luo.

211
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,140
If I had collected debts

212
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,980
with those debt collectors

213
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,380
back then,

214
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,100
would I have been rich by now?

215
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,300
You're a smart kid.

216
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,540
But I just don't get

217
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,640
how your brain works.

218
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
Other people drop out to do that

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,780
because they don't have
the brains to study.

220
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,760
You're a top student

221
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,980
obsessed with living like a dropout.

222
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,820
Why?

223
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,500
My dad

224
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,820
always cared a lot about my studies.

225
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,740
The worst I ever did

226
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,100
was the year I got chickenpox,

227
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,020
and I still came third
in the whole grade.

228
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,340
Listen, I would've loved it

229
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,820
if someone cared about my studies.

230
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,980
Sis, with the way your brain works,

231
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,120
someone watching over you
wouldn't have helped much.

232
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,060
When I was five,

233
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,500
my mom asked my dad to buy a house.

234
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,360
He didn't have the money.

235
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,180
They fought,

236
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,620
and my mom died of a heart attack.

237
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,620
After that, my dad

238
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,060
never made any money in his life.

239
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,140
The year he died of cancer,

240
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,460
I got first place in the whole city.

241
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,060
What good did that do?

242
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,380
What kind of logic is that?

243
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,660
If my dad had money

244
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,100
and bought two apartments,

245
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,540
one for weekdays

246
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,780
and one

247
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,740
for weekends,

248
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,460
my mom wouldn't have gotten mad.

249
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,900
Then she wouldn't have

250
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,220
had a heart attack and died.

251
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,060
If we had enough money

252
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,780
when my dad had cancer,

253
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,360
we could've put him in the ICU

254
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,100
and hired foreign specialists,

255
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,820
and he might've lived another ten years.

256
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,820
But we didn't, so we were helpless.

257
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,380
Money does solve a lot of problems,

258
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,580
but it causes a lot too.

259
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,140
Look at your face. It's filthy.

260
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,900
It doesn't add up.

261
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,900
Hold on.

262
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,260
Did I miss something?

263
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,220
Five, six,

264
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,060
seven, eight.

265
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,900
That's right.

266
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,180
Without education,

267
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,340
I can't even count money.

268
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,300
It's that room from earlier.

269
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,460
Keep your voice down.

270
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,900
Someone might hear.

271
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,300
They paid,

272
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,420
so we have to meet

273
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,740
their requirements.

274
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,780
You knock on the door later.

275
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,260
I'll hide first.

276
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,620
OK.

277
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,380
Weren't you supposed
to stall Jiang Fang?

278
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,820
I stalled her for so long.

279
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,460
I was more anxious than you.

280
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,260
- Anyway...
- Do you not need her anymore?

281
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,740
13,000. Thanks.

282
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,460
She can't use this phone anyway.

283
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,140
What's the point of my
spending that money?

284
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,100
10,000, okay?

285
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,140
No.

286
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,140
Do you know how much I had to say

287
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,680
just to convince her to sell that phone?

288
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,900
And all this stuff.

289
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,940
They cost me a lot of effort.

290
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,740
Next time she comes,

291
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,900
stall her again

292
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,020
and call me.

293
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,860
Okay?

294
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,100
Sure.

295
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,020
What a coincidence.

296
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,180
That friend

297
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,140
specializes in phone repairs.

298
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,300
However,

299
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,620
the price was agreed on. No refunds.

300
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,860
Sorry.

301
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,900
Sorry, sorry.

302
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,320
It's a misunderstanding.

303
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,020
Sorry, sorry.

304
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,960
It's a misunderstanding.

305
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,880
Wait.

306
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,260
It's a misunderstanding.

307
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,100
Sorry, sorry.

308
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,980
Sorry, it's a misunderstanding.

309
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,020
(The Coolest Chef)

310
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,700
(Chef Liu Yan, happy birthday)

311
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,390
Hey.

312
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,100
I sent you

313
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,180
a birthday award ceremony.

314
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,620
Did you get the surprise?

315
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,980
I did. It was very surprising.

316
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,100
Your two friends are pretty nice

317
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
and really warm.

318
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,120
That's good.

319
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,580
Are you getting used to the new job?

320
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,300
Should I send some flowers
to your office?

321
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,770
That's enough.

322
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,180
I just started.

323
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,380
Let's keep it low-key.

324
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,420
Alright, how is it?

325
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,860
How are you planning to celebrate?

326
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,020
Throw a party?

327
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,580
The restaurant's busy today.

328
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,260
Everyone in the kitchen
is waiting to celebrate for me.

329
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,500
Talk to you later.

330
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,540
I gotta go celebrate.

331
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,060
Thanks for the cake.

332
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,060
Bye-bye.

333
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,540
Who threw this at the door again?

334
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,460
What are you doing with that noise?

335
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,820
I'm cleaning.

336
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,780
The door is all sticky.

337
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,660
Which drunkard

338
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,110
threw trash here again?

339
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,260
Once I make money,

340
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,460
I'm definitely moving.

341
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,300
What a dump.

342
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,500
I'm not used to having nothing to do,

343
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,700
so I'm cleaning up.

344
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
Where were you going?

345
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,440
I went to buy instant noodles.

346
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,440
I'm hungry.

347
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,540
So you don't have to cook.

348
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,540
You look tired.

349
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,700
Yeah, I am pretty tired.

350
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,580
My head hurts

351
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,860
from tallying the accounts today.

352
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,220
I'm going to sleep first.

353
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,020
Okay, go and sleep.

354
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,380
(Chef Liu Yan, happy birthday)

355
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,300
How much longer?

356
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,160
Soon.

357
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,460
How soon is that?

358
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,300
Soon.

359
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,580
Hello?

360
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,900
Sorry, sorry.

361
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,740
I have something urgent now.

362
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,100
Maybe I...

363
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,820
Soon.

364
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,820
Soon...

365
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,340
I'm not hungry.

366
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,100
I've soaked the noodles.

367
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,420
Just try a bite.

368
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,820
It's really good.

369
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,540
How good can instant noodles be?

370
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,260
Mine are different

371
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,400
from regular instant noodles.

372
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,300
Look at it.

373
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,580
Isn't it just normal instant noodles?

374
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,860
There's more.

375
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,700
Good.

376
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,900
You have to eat the whole noodle
on your birthday.

377
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,840
How'd you know it's my birthday?

378
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,980
I'm smart.

379
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,100
The coolest chef.

380
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,620
Is that the right pronunciation?

381
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,740
Why are you so bold
when uneducated?

382
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,740
I...

383
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,060
It's the right pronunciation.

384
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,220
"The coolest chef."

385
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,500
Touched, huh?

386
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,340
I knew it.

387
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,980
Girls love this kind

388
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,180
of formal stuff.

389
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,300
I'll remember it.

390
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,700
Every year on your birthday,

391
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,460
I'll personally tie your noodles.

392
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,740
In past years, only Yang

393
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,020
and some promo messages

394
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,060
remembered my birthday.

395
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,260
This year, I remember.

396
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,220
Yang remembers.

397
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,920
Who else do you want to remember?

398
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,620
Sorry.

399
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,700
You kept saying "soon".

400
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,220
I've waited for hours.

401
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,460
Add some money, okay?

402
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,020
Soon.

403
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,460
Soon, soon.

404
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,300
Your phone.

405
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,420
Transferring now?

406
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,500
Yeah.

407
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,820
(Liu Yan, Lu Tianchi)
Want to meet?

408
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,300
(Retract)

409
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,340
(You retracted a message)

410
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,300
Thanks for your gift.

411
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,660
There's another proper gift.

412
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,460
I don't like wearing jewelry.

413
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,500
It's troublesome.

414
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,500
My mom wore this at her wedding.

415
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,420
Try it on.

416
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,340
Turn around. Turn.

417
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,380
I'll put it on for you.

418
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,540
Here.

419
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,820
Looks good.

420
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,380
It's so valuable,

421
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,220
and you're giving it to me?

422
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,020
I don't have anything else to give you.

423
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,100
I don't have much money.

424
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,020
It'd be lost if I left it here.

425
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,820
It's better on you.

426
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,140
I can at least see it.

427
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,980
Sis, happy birthday.

428
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,260
(Lu Tianchi)
Ms. Liu Yan, my client.

429
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,580
Happy birthday on your second day.

430
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,980
Settle all consultation fees today,

431
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,820
and you'll get a surprise gift.

432
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,220
(Lu Tianchi)

433
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,020
Uncle Lin.

434
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,060
Are you there, Uncle Lin?

435
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,500
Okay, thanks.

436
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,860
Why didn't you answer my call?

437
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,100
I was busy sharpening knives.

438
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,980
Didn't I tell you?

439
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,540
No.

440
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,500
You really didn't.

441
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,580
Maybe I forgot

442
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,620
to press "Send".

443
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,180
What's up?

444
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,940
Happy birthday.

445
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,060
That was yesterday. It's over now.

446
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,020
Yesterday, I went to see...

447
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,180
No, I have a case unfinished,

448
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,700
so I...

449
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,580
But I got you a gift.

450
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,420
Look.

451
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,220
This is the gift you mentioned
for paying fees,

452
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,660
right?

453
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,300
Let me see.

454
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,500
Tang Shuangshuang was right.

455
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,380
You're good at photography.

456
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,340
This would make

457
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,500
a good memorial photo.

458
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,020
It feels like I'll be reborn
after death.

459
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,060
What are you talking about?

460
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,700
Your gift

461
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,540
is a reward for paying fees,

462
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,700
and then it's something
you've long prepared for me.

463
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,980
You can say whatever you want.

464
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,540
Are you going to raise the price again?

465
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,460
I've never been that scared.

466
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,340
Don't put it that way.

467
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,800
No one says it that way.

468
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,540
Are you free this weekend?
I want to ask you out.

469
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,300
This isn't really

470
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,720
in my business scope,

471
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,400
- but I think...
- I've got other things.

472
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,360
No, listen.

473
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,980
What now?

474
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,000
There's some blood here.

475
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,700
Sir.

476
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,300
Who let you in?

477
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,140
Get out.

478
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,580
(Lam Kee Herbal Tea, Grocery)

479
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,380
Lu,

480
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,180
what's that smell in your place?

481
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
So pungent.

482
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,940
I planted some scallions.

483
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,340
Jiang Fang even went

484
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,080
to Highland to eat?

485
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,800
- You don't believe me?
- Of course, I do.

486
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,020
Every piece of info I found

487
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,020
is real,

488
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,550
and the daily itinerary is right here.

489
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,300
She even went to Dahuanglou?

490
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
She even placed bets

491
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,980
on several boxing matches over there.

492
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,620
Right here.

493
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,180
That fight almost killed someone.

494
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,860
She's such a lousy gambler.

495
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,700
If she loses,
she'll sleep under a bridge.

496
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,060
If she wins, she'll squander it.

497
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,740
How about this?

498
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,100
Let's have a drink.

499
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,260
I quit it.

500
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,940
So slippery.

501
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,220
Why are you here?

502
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,180
Your place is nice.

503
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,060
It's cool.

504
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,100
You're the first to approve

505
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
my job.

506
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,020
I need your help after all.

507
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,300
Why don't you come out?

508
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,420
We're both wearing boots.

509
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,980
Those are different boots.

510
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,860
Here's the thing.

511
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,460
I want to invite you this weekend

512
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,220
to Antonio's company's

513
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,580
10th anniversary party.

514
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,580
Why should I go?

515
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,820
I don't know anyone.

516
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,180
You have to come.

517
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,020
I'm getting proposed to there.

518
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,580
Shuangshuang,

519
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,580
congratulations!

520
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,700
No, no, stop that.

521
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,020
Well, whether the proposal will happen

522
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,060
depends on whether you come and help me.

523
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,440
Antonio has bought the ring.

524
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,340
He booked the restaurant
and flowers at Highland.

525
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,020
He's planning to propose there.

526
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,620
That's great.

527
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,820
Not at all.

528
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,260
If the proposal

529
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,300
happens there,

530
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,090
the witnesses

531
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,340
will be people who have nothing

532
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,540
to do with his daily life.

533
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
But if it is

534
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,460
at this business party,

535
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,940
the effect will be totally different.

536
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,300
It's still a proposal,

537
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,820
but I need witnesses.

538
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,100
Take this first.

539
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,420
What does this have to do

540
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,540
with your relationship?

541
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,400
You clearly haven't tasted

542
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
the bitterness of love.

543
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,300
The bitterness of love?

544
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,740
The bitterness of love...

545
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,860
I've had plenty of other bitterness.

546
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,700
Is love's bitterness worse?

547
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,380
You could say I'm cursed.

548
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,180
Anytime I fall for someone,

549
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,620
it ends badly.

550
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,060
Including my old friend.

551
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,700
Who?

552
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,460
Lu.

553
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,780
Liu Yan, will you help me?

554
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,180
If you help me,

555
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,420
I'll return the favor.

556
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,540
No favors are needed.

557
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,580
Just tell me how I can help.

558
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,900
Tang Shuangshuang.

559
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,860
Let me see.

560
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,900
This one won't do.

561
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,820
Come out.

562
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,020
This one really won't do.

563
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,980
Hurry and come out.

564
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,140
Your clothes are all too tight.

565
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,500
They look great.

566
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,660
Look in the mirror yourself.

567
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,820
This part needs to go lower.

568
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,700
It can't.

569
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,980
You need to show your shoulders.

570
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,460
Not everyone can pull this off.

571
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,500
Wow, your figure is pretty good.

572
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,180
Listen.

573
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,460
There can be absolutely
no mistakes this weekend.

574
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,900
Not one mistake is allowed.

575
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,300
If you mess this up,

576
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,740
it'll be my farewell party
to the local socialite circle.

577
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,820
Anyway,

578
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,580
remember my reminders that day.

579
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,520
One of my hands will cover
my mouth in surprise.

580
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,340
The other

581
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,860
will show the ring to everyone.

582
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,300
Make sure you record

583
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,740
my tears and smiles.

584
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,580
Well.

585
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,420
Thank you, everyone.

586
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,140
Okay, I'll record it for you.

587
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,220
Thanks.

588
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,020
May I ask you something personal?

589
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,500
Rarely do you ask.

590
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,750
Go ahead.

591
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,540
Did you two use to date?

592
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,540
With Lu Tianchi?

593
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,340
What did he say?

594
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,420
You didn't get it?

595
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,420
I don't understand these things.

596
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,740
Anyway, I'm getting married.

597
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,580
It's okay to tell you this.

598
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,260
He is

599
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,100
older now,

600
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,020
but hasn't grown any wiser.

601
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,940
Lu Tianchi is exactly the kind of man

602
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,260
who can give you everything

603
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,660
and do everything for you,

604
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,020
but can't live a life

605
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,300
with you.

606
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,020
I don't get it.

607
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,940
So, you two used to date?

608
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,020
My relationship with Lu

609
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,140
goes beyond a lot of things.

610
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,640
It can't be explained in a few words.

611
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,300
Anyway, don't worry.

612
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,900
I won't get jealous.

613
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,260
That's not what I meant.

614
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,020
Why don't you try

615
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,860
on the other outfit?

616
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,370
What are you doing?

617
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,980
Did you see those two dust covers
I have?

618
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,200
Why are you looking for those?

619
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,030
I need to cover

620
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,580
Tang Shuangshuang's clothes.

621
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,220
I thought they were trash

622
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,060
and threw them out.

623
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,260
Why throw them out?

624
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,060
I didn't know they were useful.

625
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,940
I have to wash them

626
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,220
before giving them back.

627
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,980
Li Zan!

628
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,540
Li Zan, Li Zan!

629
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,820
Come out!

630
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,180
Why shout at this hour?

631
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,020
Look.

632
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,460
This is from Jiang Fang.

633
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,860
Where's Jiang Fang?

634
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,820
Jiang Fang!

635
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,540
- Stop shouting!
- Jiang Fang!

636
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,420
Stop shouting. You'll attract attention.

637
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,540
Stop shouting. Where are you going?

638
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,900
Jiang Fang!

639
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,340
Where are you going so late?

640
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,460
Jiang Fang!

641
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,900
(Liu Yan)
Don't sleep. I'll be there soon.

642
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,260
(Lu Tianchi)
Not sleeping. I'm waiting.

643
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,860
Lu Tianchi!

644
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,580
Lu Tianchi, open the door!

645
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,900
Lu Tianchi!

646
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,820
Lu Tianchi!

647
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,540
Open the door!

648
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,180
Jiang Fang...

649
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,220
Jiang Fang's here.

650
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,420
What does that prove?

651
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,180
It proves Jiang Fang is still alive.

652
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,820
It proves trouble lasts.

653
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,460
It proves she knows I'm in Jaya.

654
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,060
She knows where I live.

655
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,020
She...

656
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,100
She knows where I live,

657
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,620
so why doesn't she just knock?

658
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,460
She's definitely embarrassed.

659
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,580
No.

660
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,780
Jiang Fang

661
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,720
wouldn't be embarrassed.

662
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,620
She doesn't know I've cleared the debts.

663
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,680
She definitely doesn't know

664
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,020
I'm awesome enough to clear

665
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,060
all those debts,

666
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,540
so she can't come straight to me

667
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,160
due to fear of exposing her whereabouts.

668
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,500
Jiang Fang has always been

669
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,740
a very cautious person.

670
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,540
- Tell me.
- Is it possible

671
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,800
that your neighbor just happened

672
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,160
to dump a pot of unwanted flowers

673
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,700
at your door?

674
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,900
No way.

675
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,740
Listen.

676
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,660
Before I turned 13,

677
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,100
every year on my birthday,

678
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,940
Jiang Fang gave me

679
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,340
a pot of dandelions just like this.

680
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,460
It can't be a coincidence.

681
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,410
Who else has such a stingy mom?

682
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,260
If you're sure

683
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,100
this was from Jiang Fang,

684
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
I suggest

685
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,380
we observe her actions first

686
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,860
before we decide

687
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,300
what to do next.

688
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,840
Alright?

689
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,740
Okay.

690
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,260
You saw the messages from me, right?

691
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,340
Lu Tianchi,

692
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,820
there's nothing more important now

693
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,900
than finding Jiang Fang.

694
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,980
You know that, right?

695
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,180
Yes.

696
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,500
Understood.

697
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,300
What's that smell in your room?

698
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Scallions.

699
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,900
Oh, my.

700
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,660
A few days ago, a customer said

701
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,060
the place smelled like fleas.

702
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,020
He's eaten fleas before?

703
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,860
Scallions and cilantro are the soul.

704
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,700
Li Zan.

705
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,300
Are you asleep?

706
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,220
Li Zan?

707
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,540
I'm asleep.

708
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,100
What did I say?

709
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,900
I knew she'd still be alive.

710
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,660
Trouble always lasts.

711
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,900
You risked your life to clear the debts.

712
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,140
Now, she's back.

713
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,540
What's her intention?

714
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,780
She definitely didn't expect me

715
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,340
to help clear all her debts in one go.

716
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,580
I didn't expect you to survive

717
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,020
with this brain for so long either.

718
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,920
Alright, I've got three hours
before school.

719
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,060
I need to sleep first.

720
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,220
Oh, my.

721
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,340
Amazing.

722
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:49,420
(Ganga Hostel)

723
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
Hello.

724
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,980
Over there.

725
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,350
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

726
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,820
You broke some promises.

727
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,380
Oh, my.

728
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,540
You've won.

729
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,620
I don't want it.

730
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,420
How did you get in?

731
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,020
You're amazing.

732
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,540
Let's talk outside.

733
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,300
Wait. I'm on a lucky streak.

734
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,620
Can't you see? It's a double win.

735
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,500
- No.
- We don't want this either.

736
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,340
Thanks.

737
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,500
Why did you give her

738
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
the dandelions?

739
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,820
I haven't given her
a birthday gift in years.

740
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,540
Did she guess it was from me?

741
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,020
I'm so sorry.

742
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,460
I just wanted to express something.

743
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,140
I couldn't help it.
I missed her too much.

744
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,780
If that's true,

745
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,140
you'd have gone to Beijing for her.

746
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,600
In my situation,

747
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,580
how could I go find her?

748
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,780
Wouldn't that just burden her?

749
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,060
You're torturing her now.

750
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,980
You know what I mean?

751
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,380
She always believes you are in Jaya,

752
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,500
so she keeps looking for you.

753
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,440
You keep avoiding her,

754
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,900
so why send her dandelions?

755
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,780
You don't understand her. She's fine.

756
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,140
I think you two

757
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,380
should have a proper talk.

758
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,480
Tell her everything you said

759
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,540
at the hospital that day.

760
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,340
She'll decide
how to handle things herself.

761
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,960
Judging by this,

762
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,140
you must have feelings

763
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,540
for Salty, right?

764
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,340
She's my client.

765
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,780
I do what I should do.

766
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,860
You're her mother.

767
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,300
Please do what you should do too.

768
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,140
Okay?

769
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,420
Your face is all red.

770
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,220
Take a breath before you speak.

771
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,300
Are you going to see her or not?

772
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,180
You can bring her here anytime.

773
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,020
I'm always here.

774
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,140
If you don't want

775
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,220
to treat me to a meal,

776
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,100
then bye.

777
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,020
Why are you here?

778
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,740
You're harder to find

779
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,780
than Jiang Fang now.

780
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,900
I've been busy.

781
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,460
What's up? Did you find Jiang Fang?

782
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,460
Have you thought

783
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,500
about canceling

784
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,020
your

785
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,660
contract?

786
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,460
We've signed it.

787
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,660
You've got to help me find her.

788
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,860
What if I can't find her?

789
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,080
Is it that you can't find her,
or that you don't want to?

790
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,780
Now that the debts are cleared,

791
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,220
have you thought

792
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,460
about starting a new life?

793
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,380
Jiang Fang's shown up,

794
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,700
and you want me to give up now?

795
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,340
Are you sure you want to know?

796
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,700
Now, Jiang Fang...

797
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,540
Wait a moment.

798
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,440
Alright, think it over, okay?

799
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,100
Water.

800
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,540
It's been put here for days.

801
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,180
It's fine.

802
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:00,940
Tell me.

803
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,660
Did you see her?

804
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,420
Here's a piece of advice.

805
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,340
Seeing her might not be a good thing.

806
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,060
She'll only drag you down.

807
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,740
I've seen too many gamblers.

808
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,660
They really can't quit.

809
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,620
Take me to find her.

810
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,180
She can quit.

811
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,160
If there's something more important
than gambling,

812
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,840
she can quit.

813
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,020
Jiang Fang.

814
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,180
Jiang Fang?

815
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,500
The bathroom's still wet.

816
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,420
She must have just left.

817
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,620
Jiang Fang.

818
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,580
Jiang Fang!

819
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,500
Jiang Fang!

820

Jiang Fang, come out now!

Of course, we have it.

837
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,140
And it's a special one.

838
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,960
Don't let it fall.

839
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,620
Come on, blow the candle.

One.

Two.

842
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:41,990
This is Jiang Fang's

843
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,110
travel record for the past few months.

844
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,540
She won the bet at my match
in Dahuanglou

845
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,060
and then went to eat at Highland.

846
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,600
When you were in the hospital.

847
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:07,860
When did you find out?

848
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,370
Two days before your birthday.

849
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,480
Why didn't you tell me?

850
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,300
Why didn't you tell me?

851
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,860
Do you still think she's your mom?

852
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,180
Can you stop

853
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,060
with these unrealistic fantasies?

854
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,980
Didn't you smash the dandelion?

855
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,780
She threw you away for 13 years.

856
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,140
She's never cared about you, right?

857
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,680
You were so badly hurt in the hospital,

858
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,600
but she never cared.

859
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,460
I'm willing.

860
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,300
Willing for what?

861
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,260
Have you asked yourself?

862
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,340
Are you really willing?

863
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,860
When you were searching for her

864
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,370
on the street today, were you willing?

865
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,460
When everyone was staring at you,

866
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,380
were you willing?

867
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,420
You didn't even dare call her "Mom".

868
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,380
What did you call her?

869
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,100
You called her name, right?

870
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,950
I'm just unwanted.

871
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,060
Is that what you think?

872
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,380
- I didn't mean that.
- I'm mad.

873
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,860
- I didn't...
- I don't have a dad.

874
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,820
- Listen to me.
- Even my mom abandoned me.

875
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,300
In all my life,

876
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,500
it keeps happening.

877
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,360
How many times
do I have to be abandoned

878
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,960
before it's enough?

879
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,340
I've raised myself

880
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,860
this far.

881
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,700
Even if

882
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,460
there's just a tiny bit

883
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,260
of something good,

884
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,820
it's something others gave me

885
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,960
because they didn't want it.

886
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,940
Isn't that right?

887
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,140
Even you were given to me
because Tang Shuangshuang

888
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:39,980
didn't want you.

889
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,660
Are you out of your mind?

890
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,020
What's wrong?

891
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:47,940
Did I say something wrong?

892
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,620
Why don't you admit it, Lu Tianchi?

893
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,830
I'm not as pretty as Tang Shuangshuang.

894
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,700
I'm not good-looking.

895
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,440
I don't know how to dress.

896
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,900
I can't act cute.

897
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,780
I'm just rough.

898
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,060
But I can fight!

899
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,220
I can only fight!

900
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,580
Is that enough?

901
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,300
I...

902
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,300
Enough, enough.

903
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,930
Stop it.

904
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,980
Why doesn't my mom love me?

905
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,500
Why doesn't she want me?

906
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,460
I'm just a burden.

907
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,660
I know I'm a burden.

908
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,620
I know.

909
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,700
I know I'm a burden.

910
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,140
My mom has so many boyfriends.

911
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,740
Why can't she love me?

912
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,940
Why can't she love me?

913
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,210
Why does no one love me?

914
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,130
Idiot.
