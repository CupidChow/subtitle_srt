15
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,000
Let me tell you.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,100
For this wedding apartment,

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,530
even if you search all of Beijing,

18
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,380
you won't find another one

19
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,940
with a better price-to-value ratio.

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,050
It's got great airflow.

21
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,330
Two bedrooms and a living room.

22
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,530
Right outside the window
is the greenbelt.

23
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,860
The environment is great.

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,530
Every day, you two can sit right here

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,830
and enjoy life.

26
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,890
Over here is the master bedroom.

27
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,330
And its space

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,940
is impressively large.

29
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,890
The usable area rate for this apartment

30
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,140
is 85%.

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,100
There's also a bathtub.

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,140
Whether it's two or three people,

33
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,570
even if you bring a kid,

34
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,060
there's room for everyone to soak.

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,690
Over here,

36
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,660
there's a small bedroom.

37
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,290
Your child can have
their own little world

38
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,530
from a young age.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,050
There's a primary school behind.

40
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,080
When your child goes to school,

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,620
it's just a short walk away.

42
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,970
This side.

43
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,620
By the way, do you usually cook?

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,450
I'm telling you.

45
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,850
Food is the first necessity
of the people.

46
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,970
We can't take meals lightly.

47
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,970
Check out this kitchen.

48
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,570
It's got everything you need.

49
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,970
Work in Beijing is stressful.

50
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,940
No matter how tired you are after work,

51
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,250
coming home to a good meal
hits the spot.

52
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,010
Helps you unwind, right?

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,130
Let's go with this one.

54
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,970
Okay.

55
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,370
Thank you.

56
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,460
Thanks.

57
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,340
=Episode 24=

58
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,250
I told you she'd manage it.

59
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,410
Yeah, just try harder.

60
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,380
It has to work out.

61
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,730
I really owe you one.

62
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,500
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,660
70 square meters, right?

64
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,530
Well, I don't deal
with such small units now.

65
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,250
Find someone named Liu Yan
at our company.

66
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,460
She's a young girl.

67
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,250
One two three four,
five six seven eight.

68
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,810
Two two three four,
five six seven eight.

Satisfaction has no finish line.

71
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,500
Charge to the peak.

72
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,810
Show the style.

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,340

Two two three four,

Service has no end, only a beginning!

76

(Sijiu City Realty)

80
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,970
At least have some food, okay?

81
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,010
I'm not hungry.

82
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,690
You still need to eat,
or you'll be tired.

83
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,530
Hurry up.

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,150
Hello, this is Sijiu City Realty.
Service has no end,

85

only a beginning.
Satisfaction has no finish line.

86
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,850
How can I help you?

87
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,620
Call the owner for me, will you?

88
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,530
I need to go out.

89
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,810
Have lunch on your own, okay?

90
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,340
You must be hungry. Eat up.

91
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm heading out now.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,780
Hello, this is Sijiu City Realty.
Service has no end,

93
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,450
only a beginning.
Satisfaction has no finish line.

94
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,460
How can I help you?

95
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,890
Breakfast.

96
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,490
Stop buying for me. It's a waste.

97
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,850
Come on, eat up.

98
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,460
About your last request,

99
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,780
I've already talked

100
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,660
to the landlord.

101
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,490
And the landlord is quite reasonable.

102
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,370
All your layout changes

103
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,580
have been approved.

104
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,420
And today,

105
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,700
I've also brought the contract.

106
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,850
You can take a look.

107
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,900
If everything looks fine,

108
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,730
we can sign the contract today.

109
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,290
The landlord has already signed.

110
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,180
Let me see first.

111
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,250
Alright.

112
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,460
This isn't

113
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,660
what you told me last time.

114
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,100
An open kitchen.

115
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,490
Just like those abroad.

116
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,930
At the very least,

117
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,730
you'll have to
move the water pipes over.

118
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,020
I think I get it.

119
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,860
You're looking for

120
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,850
the kind of open Western-style kitchen.

121
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,370
However,

122
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,290
if you move the stove

123
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,050
to the living room,

124
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,610
even the best range hood

125
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,780
won't clear the smoke.

126
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,820
After a while,

127
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,530
the place will smell greasy.

128
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,290
How long have you been an agent?

129
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,370
Since when do you care
what clients like?

130
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,490
Stop wasting words on her.

131
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,580
People like them

132
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,780
haven't seen real nice homes anyway.

133
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,780
That's not fair.

134
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,680
Just because she's low-end,

135
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,490
she shows me a low-end house?

136
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,900
The balcony is actually nice.

137
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,020
We could plant some flowers

138
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,610
or do some yoga outside.

139
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,610
It's not bad at all.

140
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,700
Actually, you probably
can't use this privately.

141
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,660
I paid for this place.

142
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,220
Why can't I use it myself?

143
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,610
Go ahead, open it up.

144
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,220
I want to go out and look.

145
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,970
How do I see from here?

146
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,220
Okay, please wait a moment.

147
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,340
Here, let me pull you.

148
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,180
Wait.

149
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,610
Don't let my sis fall!

150
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,780
Such a hassle.

151
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,180
It's alright.

152
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,490
Here, let me pull you.

153
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,130
Wait...

154
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,780
No, this won't work.

155
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,170
I buy a house and have to

156
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,610
jump up and down every day?

157
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,900
Knock down this wall for me.

158
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,780
This can't be knocked down.

159
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,880
There are water pipes underneath.

160
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,660
If it can't go, what am I to do?

161
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,700
Sis, I told you not to trust them.

162
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,970
You can't trust those guys.

163
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,610
Move this thing for me!

164
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,220
Alright, I'm on it.

165
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,500
Off work?

166
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,260
Your first meal of the day again.

167
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,820
How many times

168
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,250
have I told you?
Don't eat facing the wind.

169
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,850
Otherwise, you'll get a stomachache.

170
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,100
I brewed it this afternoon.

171
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,200
But right as I started, a client came.

172
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,580
I didn't want to bother the client.

173
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,970
So I left my food outside.

174
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,050
It's added some hot water

175
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,890
and is still edible.

176
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,930
And you dare say

177
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,170
that you made it this afternoon?

178
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,010
What?

179
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,660
Are you qualified to lecture me?

180
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,780
Knocking on your door

181
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,860
couldn't wake you up at all.

182
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,370
- I...
- The manager said

183
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,340
he was docking your pay.

184
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,850
Did the house on Church Alley

185
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,730
finally get signed?

186
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,570
It fell through.

187
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,850
Client backed out at the last minute.

188
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,050
It's fine. It's normal.

189
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,530
I probably can't get

190
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,220
an e-scooter this month.

191
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,340
It's fine, I'll give you a ride.

192
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,580
No need.

193
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,970
I've never been on board

194
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,020
with your riding idea.

195
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,860
Let me tell you.

196
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,200
You've been so distracted lately.

197
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,850
Who knows what you're thinking
when you're riding?

198
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,290
If something happens to you...

199
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,970
Alright, your noodles have gone soggy.

200
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,370
Stop eating, let's head home.

201
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,020
We'll have skewers at home.

202
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,490
I can't. I still have an order.

203
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,140
There's one more order?

204
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,820
Yes, my client works late

205
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,240
and can only view
the house late at night.

206
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,050
Listen, don't take
those late-night orders

207
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,140
like this.

208
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,970
You never know who you'll run into.

209
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,980
Let's go.

210
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,580
No need. I'll finish eating shortly.

211
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,730
Then I'll take a bus there.

212
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,850
Enough talk, come here.

213
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,140
Hurry up, stop eating.

214
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,140
Let's go to Madian.

215
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,770
Salty,

216
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,530
I had a dream last night.

217
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,250
What kind of dream?

218
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,290
Maybe this dream

219
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,140
is good news for you.

220
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,050
But for me...

221
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,130
Then don't say it.

222
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,970
Service has no end, only a beginning.

223
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,340
Satisfaction has no finish line.

224
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,300
Charge to the peak.

225
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,370
Show the style.

226
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,730
This is a new apartment.

227
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,820
The previous owner

228
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,770
didn't live here long

229
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,940
before moving out.

230
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,700
So I was thinking, whenever you're free,

231
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,540
- let's set...
- Liu Yan.

232
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,260
You're the chef at Highland Restaurant,

233
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,060
Liu Yan, right?

234
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
I'm sorry. I...

235
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,700
Don't you remember me?

236
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,370
I watched

237
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,730
your interview with He Guangyuan.

238
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,250
I even went with my boss to eat there.

239
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,650
You were seriously impressive.

240
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,970
Small operations nowadays probably

241
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,060
can't afford you, right?

242
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,140
No...

243
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,580
What are you doing here now?

244
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,690
I...

245
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,020
I'm in real estate.

246
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,340
(Sijiu City Realty)
Real estate?

247
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,820
It's such a shame
you're not cooking anymore.

248
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,180
Just wanted to try something new.

249
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,100
Seriously, I'll set up
a meeting with Ms. Du.

250
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,580
- Let's...
- Shirley! Sis Shirley!

251
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,580
Wang?

252
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,490
What brings you here?

253
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,490
I'm here to buy a house.

254
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,400
Ran into her by chance.

255
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,730
A big deal? Find Zhao.

256
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,850
Zhao, come help here.

257
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,130
The properties she handles

258
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,220
are all really good.

259
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,060
Salty.

260
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,450
She...

261
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,610
She really isn't cooking anymore?

262
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,250
Bring those files with you!

263
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,820
That's such a shame.

264
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,060
Here's our business card.

265
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,100
If your company needs a place,

266
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,220
just reach out to me.

267
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,490
Zhao, take over.

268
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,300
We're off to see a client.

269
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,730
If you need anything, tell Zhao.

270
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,820
Or you can message me

271
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,700
on WeChat anytime.

272
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,260
We're leaving, bye.

273
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,780
Hello.

274
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,650
Hello, Mr. Sun.

275
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,220
Sorry to bother you so late.

276
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,130
Just wanted to ask if you and your wife

277
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,420
have talked things over yet.

278
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,370
I've managed things with the landlord.

279
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,300
Alright.

280
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,730
Come in.

281
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,300
No one else is here.

282
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:33,970
He's not here?

283
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,700
Why didn't you go to evening class?

284
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,460
I'm a top student.

285
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,650
I don't need evening classes.

286
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,650
All I need is good food and drinks.

287
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
You're just teasing me.

288
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,820
You said food was good at university.

289
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,180
It's totally not like that.

290
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:50,970
Sis,

291
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,220
can you cook something nice for me?

292
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,370
Look how thin I am.

293
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,820
My ribs are sticking out.

294
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,260
Look.

295
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,100
I'm actually getting hungry.

296
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,220
Wait, what is that?

297
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,420
Can that still be eaten?

298
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,100
It's leftover instant noodles.

299
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,460
Heating it up to eat?

300
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,540
How gross...

301
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,770
You want some? I can make it.

302
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,770
No.

303
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,650
Some fresh noodles.

304
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,490
No, I'm good.

305
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,940
You spoiled my palate,

306
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,710
and now you want me
to recall past hardships?

307
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,730
I can't do it.

308
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,060
You want to eat out?

309
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,300
I'll ask Yang to take you.

310
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,490
That agent, Wang, isn't my brother.

311
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,210
Li Zan.

312
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,340
We can't talk like that.

313
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,540
Sis, you still don't get it.

314
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,770
He wants to keep you around.

315
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,540
That's why
he's doing real estate with you.

316
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,730
I've told you so many times.

317
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,010
I chose to do this myself.

318
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,010
Yang didn't talk me into it.

319
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,700
You're such a talented chef.

320
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,850
But look at you now.

321
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,700
Eating a bowl
of leftover instant noodles.

322
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,130
And you think it's great?

323
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,010
To make room for me,
Wang Yang lied to his mother

324
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,940
to send her to stay

325
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,130
at his grandma's house.

326
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,180
Half your tuition

327
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,820
was covered by him.

328
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,260
Li Zan,

329
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,770
your biggest concern for me

330
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,250
is studying hard.

331
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,100
You get that, right?

332
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,300
Go back early.

333
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,780
It's quite late.

334
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,460
Your noodles are ready.

335
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,730
Hello, this is Sijiu City Realty.
Service has no end,

336
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,390
only a beginning.
Satisfaction has no finish line.

337
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,540
How can I help you?

338
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,100
Alright, got it.

339
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,490
Please hold on a moment.

340
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,420
Could you repeat that?

341
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,460
Okay, tomorrow at 3 PM, right?

342
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

343
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,540
Salty,

344
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,850
it's getting colder these days.

345
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,380
Yeah.

346
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,730
That's why I'm thinking,

347
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,700
maybe I should get a car.

348
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,100
You could sit in the front.

349
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,610
Isn't that better
than riding this e-scooter?

350
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,210
Salty,

351
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,420
what if we get together?

352
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,250
I'll be your driver,

353
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,830
and your daily reminder.

354
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,540
If you don't mind,

355
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,820
I can also be your chef.

356
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,730
Say something.

357
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,810
I finally...

358
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,980
I finally get sentimental for once.

359
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,490
You don't want to hear
what I'm going to say.

360
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,540
Then I'll just wait.

361
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,220
Wait till you say what I want to hear.

362
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,340
Seriously? Wait for what?

363
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,980
You'll turn into
an old man from Beijing.

364
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,340
Sounds about right.

365
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,370
Paired with you,

366
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,200
an old lady from Beijing.

367
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,370
Old Wang from Dongcheng District,

368
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,730
on his 60th birthday,

369
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,570
finally

370
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,890
became a couple with

371
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,890
his childhood friend, Old Liu.

372
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,610
Nothing beats growing old together.

373
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,850
Right?

374
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,540
Right here?

375
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,750
(Sijiu City Realty)

376
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,650
- Let's go.
- My legs are killing me.

377
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,650
Who knew you'd wear such high heels?

378
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,820
Who knew
you'd pick me up in this old car?

379
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,710
It's fine.

380
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,010
Where's your workstation?

381
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,180
Over there.

382
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,850
How long?

383
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,490
I'm leaving tomorrow.

384
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,100
Frequent flyer, huh?

385
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,490
Nowadays, brands cover
all my travel expenses.

386
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,820
And you know my personality.

387
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,890
If you don't serve me well,
my words can be sharp.

388
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,150
Lots of people in this industry

389
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,730
wonder what you're up to.

390
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,370
Why are they so interested in me?

391
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,010
Looking to rent an apartment?

392
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,890
If anyone asks you again,

393
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,420
just say I quit being a chef.

394
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,210
No.

395
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,610
Do you realize

396
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,700
information carries energy?

397
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,520
For example,
the more you say something daily,

398
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,370
the higher its chance of becoming real.

399
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,460
So these days, for example,

400
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,610
I keep repeating to myself,

401
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,580
"I want to make more money.

402
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,130
I want to get rich.

403
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,610
I want to be prettier, slimmer,

404
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,300
and cooler."

405
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,100
You would scare my colleagues.

406
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,220
I'm having
a diamond-rated Japanese cuisine

407
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,820
at China World Trade Center tonight.

408
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,060
Coming?

409
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,340
I've got work tonight.

410
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
What?

411
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,610
Can you cook for me?

412
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,500
I haven't had your food in ages.

413
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,260
Next time... you're back.

414
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,260
You said that last time, too.

415
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,210
Go make some money.

416
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,610
Didn't you want to get rich?

417
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,450
Hurry up.

418
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,100
I'm meeting two clients tonight.

419
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,140
(Property for sale)

420
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,180
Who is it?

421
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,740
This is my place.

422
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,890
Be honest with me.

423
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,300
Or I'll call the police.

424
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,780
Ding Huijing is my mom.

425
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,100
I'm her son.

426
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,930
This is my home.

427
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,540
I was born here.

428
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,260
The house is up for sale now.

429
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,370
You can't stay here anymore.

430
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,130
I just wanted
to finish my homework here.

431
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,380
(Chinese)

432
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,210
The house is in a court auction.

433
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,370
Your parents should know.

434
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,490
I don't have a dad.

435
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,580
You should head home.

436
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,170
I'll bring workers to fix it tomorrow.

437
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,340
You can't stay here anymore.

438
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,820
(Bada Shanren)

439
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,660
Wang Yang,

440
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,740
I think I've arrived.

441
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,540
Is this the Bada Shanren?

442
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,170
That sign also has

443
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,450
buns or peaches?

444
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,660
Hello.

445
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,290
Hello.

446
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,250
What will you drink?

447
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,260
Sorry, I don't drink alcohol.

448
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,450
Why come to a bar then?

449
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,690
I'm waiting for someone.

450
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,420
That's boring.

451
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,370
Water, then?

452
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,370
Water isn't free.

453
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,820
Thanks.

454
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,580
Yan,

455
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,980
long time no see.

456
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:32,970
Mr. He?

457
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,610
Why are you here?

458
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,690
Don't tell me
today's guests all don't drink.

459
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,340
I'll have a drink.

460
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,370
Let me check the menu.

461
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,020
This brand is pretty interesting.

462
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,260
Bada Shanren.

463
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,540
That's an eye on the label.

464
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,060
It's an eye looking to the sky.

465
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,410
Really suits you two.

466
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,860
Thanks.

467
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,740
What brings you here?

468
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,100
Highland is expanding

469
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,260
to Beijing.

470
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,100
Highland's coming to Beijing?

471
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,690
Restaurants here

472
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,820
better watch out.

473
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,300
They should watch out for you.

474
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,980
You're the youngest chef

475
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,610
ever to earn Three Diamonds.

476
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,740
Here's your Diamond Romance.

477
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,970
Thanks.

478
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,690
Tastes great.

479
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,580
(Liu Yan)
I'm doing great now.

480
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,610
If Highland needs

481
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,850
Beijing venues,

482
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,690
come to me.

483
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,100
I'll find you prime spots.

484
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,610
Let me tell you.

485
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,980
Our slogan is epic.

486
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,580
Let me show you.

487
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,020
Service has no end, only a beginning.

488
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,890
Satisfaction has no finish line.

489
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,540
Charge to the peak.

490
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,780
(Four hours ago)
Show the style.

491
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,970
Let's get to work!

492
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,410
Go ahead and eat.

493
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,890
You've seen how things are.

494
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,130
It's been a while since she got back.

495
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,020
The stove's never been used once.

496
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,020
Just instant noodles daily.

497
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,180
Let's brainstorm

498
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,410
some solutions.

499
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,780
Thanks for your trouble.

500
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,210
By the way,

501
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,170
didn't she always say,

502
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,020
"When you hit rock bottom, eat first"?

503
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,210
Yeah.

504
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,500
"When you hit rock bottom, eat first."

505
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,340
I've said that many times.

506
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,820
It's useless.

507
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,650
Show the style.

508
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,690
What do you think?

509
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,060
Why are you giving up?

510
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,410
If routine life

511
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,300
ever makes

512
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,930
you restless,

513
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,540
you deserve a proper drink.

514
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,020
Like a rainy day.

515
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,930
Like snowfall.

516
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,850
Just like right now.

517
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,500
The sound of this moment.

518
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,620
So sweet.

519
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,690
Come on.

520
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,420
Hey, wow.

521
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,450
You really went all in tonight.

522
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,890
The bar owner's a friend of mine.

523
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,020
No wonder you get so many drinks.

524
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,860
Slow down.

525
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,540
Lean here first.

526
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,820
Guess who I met today?

527
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,210
Who was it?

528
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,850
You had a random encounter?

529
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,580
No wonder you're so drunk.

530
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,450
He Guangyuan.

531
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,210
He...

532
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,450
He Guangyuan from Highland Restaurant?

533
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,100
Sounds like a romantic encounter.

534
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,690
What did you talk about?

535
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,850
There's so much to talk about.

536
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,380
So much?

537
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,250
Come on, tell me.

538
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,780
I'm here.

539
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
Help me up.

540
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,610
Alright, up you go.

541
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,730
Let's head back.

542
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,930
Wait...

543
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,210
Wait a second.

544
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,450
Let's go.

545
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,980
- Bag.
- Wait, shoes.

546
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,340
Put your shoes on, slow down.

547
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,180
Wang Yang.

548
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,900
Thanks.

549
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,980
- Let me see.
- I'm alright.

550
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,930
Don't worry about me.

551
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,850
You guys really don't have to worry.

552
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,450
Got it.

553
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,060
- These old shoes...
- Easy.

554
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,370
They're killing my feet!

555
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,210
Yeah, I know.

556
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,260
(Six months ago)

557
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,840
Dumplings when leaving,
noodles when returning.

558
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,890
Eat this.

559
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,930
When you're back,

560
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,130
I'll make you noodles.

561
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,130
No room for debate.

562
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,450
After Lu Tianchi left,

563
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,580
you really changed a lot.

564
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,940
I should've changed earlier.

565
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,900
Salty!

566
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,540
Salty, I don't want to go!

567
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,340
Salty, you...

568
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,450
How can you be so cold, Salty?

569
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,370
This isn't a place for people!

570
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,300
I won't run.

571
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,260
I won't run, please.

572
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,820
Listen, please. Salty,

573
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,200
I really know I was wrong.

574
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,170
If I ever gamble again...

575
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,690
I swear, if I gamble again,

576
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,500
I'll cut off my own hands and feet.

577
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,980
Is that enough, Salty?

578
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,180
- Salty.
- Mom.

579
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,730
Mom,

580
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,540
am I a burden to you?

581
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,820
Jiang Fang, am I a burden to you?

582
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,690
Mom!

583
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,580
My dear girl,

584
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,930
I'm the one who's your burden.

585
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,130
I'm sorry.

586
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,300
Mom.

587
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,100
Mom!

588
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,500
Mom...

589
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,740
I'll wait for you to come back.

590
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,250
Mom!

591
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,380
Sir,

592
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,740
these were wrapped this morning.

593
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,130
Please take them.

594
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,300
- Don't worry.
- Alright.

595
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,140
Thanks.

596
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,930
Sir, could you please

597
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,410
check this room again?

598
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,610
Why are you still here?

599
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,500
I already told you before.

600
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,100
I just want to do my homework at home.

601
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,500
Are you skipping school?

602
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,540
If I skipped, why would I do homework?

603
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

604
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,850
Hello, are you Chen Kai's mom?

605
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,100
Who is this?

606
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,930
I'm from the real estate agency.

607
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,650
Your son is

608
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,890
at your old place,

609
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,020
Shenyuan Road No. 11.

610
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,540
Would you come get him?

611
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,080
Why did he go there?

612
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,020
Hello.

613
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,540
Your dad already sold that place.

614
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,820
Why did you go back there?

615
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,660
No reason.

616
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,930
It's close to school.

617
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,980
I come here after class

618
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,130
to do homework.

619
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,850
When will you pick me up?

620
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,980
I'm hungry.

621
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,930
How are you hungry again?

622
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,780
Actually, I'm not that hungry.

623
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,850
Don't be mad.

624
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,100
Fine, come back soon.

625
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,130
- Okay.
- Alright.

626
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:08,970
Thanks.

627
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,810
No problem.

628
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,820
Bye.

629
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,850
Here's some change.

630
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,370
Go grab something to eat.

631
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,420
Don't starve.

632
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,370
Want me to go downstairs with you

633
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,370
and get something warm?

634
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,940
Have a taste.

635
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,450
I'm not hungry.

636
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,020
How are you not hungry?

637
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,650
Your stomach's been growling.

638
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,490
Eat it.

639
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,660
What's wrong?

640
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,690
This is amazing.

641
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,580
It's better than

642
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,100
what my dad ever cooked at home.

643
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,930
Really?

644
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,420
Sister,

645
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,260
can you teach me how to cook this?

646
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,410
There's not much to learn.

647
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,930
It's just something to fill up.

648
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,300
I want to cook for my mom.

649
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,060
She doesn't know how to cook.

650
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,610
My dad and she got divorced.

651
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,650
She's looking for work now.

652
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,940
It's been tough for her.

653
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,500
I want to cheer her up.

654
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,060
I can teach you.

655
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,340
But remember.

656
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,450
Let adults handle

657
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,450
adult matters.

658
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,770
As for you,

659
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,740
just eat well

660
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,650
and study hard.

661
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,410
Focus on what's in front of you.

662
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,540
If you ever feel overwhelmed,

663
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,690
you...

664
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,740
When you hit rock bottom,

665
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,850
eat first.

666
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,450
Now, let's go over

667
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,980
what we talked about today.

668
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,210
I know you mentioned

669
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,780
needing some time

670
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,850
to think it over, right?

671
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,690
Give me a second.

672
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,260
Let me check my file.

673
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,260
I'll be quick, really.

674
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,340
Just a second.

675
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,610
Sorry, Ms. Li.

676
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,690
I'll call you back soon.

677
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,610
Is that okay? Sure.

678
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,100
I'll find a quiet spot

679
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,540
to call you back.

680
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,540
(Ten months ago)

681
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,890
Remember last time?

682
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,740
I was beaten unconscious for days.

683
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,890
You stayed with me then.

684
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,060
I believe you can hear me

685
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
and see this now.

686
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,500
Now you're

687
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,650
leaving this body behind.

688
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,100
I know it's really hard,

689
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,170
but we all must

690
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,330
accept this.

691
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,250
I don't know

692
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,650
what you can hear

693
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,580
or what you can see.

694
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,980
But I hope you won't be scared.

695
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,210
Don't worry about

696
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,730
your clients.

697
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,900
Don't worry about your family.

698
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,940
Don't worry about me.

699
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,580
Stop worrying about

700
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,940
anything related

701
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,170
to Lu Tianchi.

702
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,740
I love you.

703
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,380
Go now.

704
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,520
(Recently, the Gaya judicial authorities
held a public trial.)

705
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
(Putai Group was accused of killing
Lu Tianchi, a legal adviser,)

706
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,640
(and financial fraud
through illegal means.)

707
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,480
(Jiang Sheng, president of Putai Group,
was judicially tried)

708
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,340
(and convicted of fraud and murder.)

709
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,240
(With combined punishments,
he was sentenced to death.)

710
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,170
(Other accomplices, based on
the severity of their crimes,)

711
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,220
(may face sentences of more than
ten years or life in prison.)

712
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,210
Tried so long,
but still not working.

713
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,500
Right, I have the contract for you.

714
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,580
Let's stop up ahead.

715
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,690
Put it in my bag later.

716
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,120
I'll give you the contract.
Wait a moment.

717
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,060
No, later.

718
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,650
Why are you rushing to put it now?

719
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,130
I'm afraid I'll forget

720
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,210
when I go back.

721
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,730
That's so troublesome.

722
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,690
Honestly, with your memory,

723
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,770
you'd forget in seconds.

724
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,900
Where are the keys? Trunk?

725
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,050
No, not there.

726
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,460
Hurry up, it's freezing.

727
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,980
Just put it in my bag.

728
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,860
I'm telling you, this is a big deal.

729
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,690
Put it in your trunk.

730
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,130
Salty.

731
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
What does that mean?

732
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,100
Forgot to eat it, left it here.

733
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,540
Forgot to eat it, left it here?

734
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,380
Since you got back,

735
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,060
it has been either

736
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,460
instant noodles or cold buns.

737
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,820
Now you don't even eat buns, huh?

738
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,020
No, that's not it.

739
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,420
I just forgot, that's all.

740
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,290
Are you angry?

741
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,290
Fine, isn't this eating buns?

742
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,610
I'll eat it then.

743
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,130
What's wrong with you?

744
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,610
What are you thinking?

745
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,980
Why are you so mad?

746
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,820
What happened?

747
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,100
Say it. Can you tell me?

748
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,650
Can you tell me what's on your mind?

749
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,810
Even if I say it,

750
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,290
you won't really get it.

751
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,250
We're childhood friends.

752
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,170
We grew up together.

753
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,080
What could I not understand?

754
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,090
- Just say it!
- Fine!

755
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,330
We grew up together.

756
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,540
Can you understand
my bond with Jiang Fang?

757
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,330
I was raised in a sports school.

758
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,540
I endured beatings and scoldings
to get through it.

759
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,330
Do you get what that feels like?

760
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,250
I finally dared

761
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,060
to love someone,

762
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,250
but then he died
without even saying goodbye.

763
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,130
Can you really get that?

764
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,730
I just don't want you

765
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,690
to fool yourself, you know?

766
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,980
How am I fooling myself?

767
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,860
You think I can't see

768
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,580
that you don't want this agency job?

769
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,100
You're there every day,

770
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,020
shouting earnestly

771
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,100
and desperately.

772
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,550
But all you think about
is Lu Tianchi, right?

773
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,420
Yeah.

774
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,940
I don't go a day
without thinking of him.

775
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,330
From the moment I wake up
till I fall asleep,

776
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,290
even in my dreams...

777
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,900
You know,

778
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,980
I really

779
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,330
want to get him

780
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,730
out of my mind.

781
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,770
But I can't do it.

782
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,550
Do you know

783
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,730
how much your words hurt me?

784
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,610
I want what's best for you.

785
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,610
I want to help you.

786
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,690
You can't help me.

787
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,100
I don't want to deceive myself

788
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,730
by saying anyone can help me

789
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,380
endure this suffering.

790
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,060
I know you care about me.

791
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,540
I know that no matter what I'm like,

792
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,980
you want to stay by my side.

793
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,420
But I don't want
to rely on anyone anymore,

794
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,260
Wang Yang.

795
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,220
I know.

796
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,770
It's easy to lift that manhole cover

797
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,980
and take out the little turtle.

798
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,740
But I didn't do it.

799
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,970
Why?

800
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,940
I've always felt
I don't deserve anything good.

801
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,900
So,

802
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,860
whenever I find something I like,

803
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,130
I cling to it desperately.

804
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,940
If I don't like it,
I dismiss it outright.

805
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,770
I could never notice

806
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,290
that what I like and dislike

807
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,690
is constantly changing.

808
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,380
It's all changing,

809
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,420
whether I'm willing or not.

810
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,420
I never used to wear skirts.

811
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,610
Now I really feel

812
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,170
that the pants of this uniform

813
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,580
are too uncomfortable to wear.

814
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,850
I never used to eat Western food.

815
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,250
Later, when I was in Gaya,

816
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,810
I thought the lettuce they ate

817
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,250
with a bit of salt was quite tasty.

818
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,810
I used to only drink jasmine tea.

819
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,500
Later, if I don't drink iced coffee,

820
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,770
I wouldn't even know how to cook.

821
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,460
People really do change.

822
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,460
Now I want to change, too.

823
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,500
I never want to

824
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,940
dream of Lu Tianchi again.

825
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,650
He's in the past.

826
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,980
I don't want to dwell on the past,

827
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,610
or think much about the future.

828
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,060
I want to accept these changes.

829
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,450
Let's go.

830
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,060
Aren't you cold?

831
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,290
Let's go home.

832
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,280
♪My true heart♪

833
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,880
♪Longing for true love♪

834
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,460
♪Love left me completely broken♪

835
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:15,050
♪Why do sweet dreams fade so fast♪

836
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,740
Salty.

837
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,550
I brought you some Yangzhou fried rice.

838
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,410
You want some?

839
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,560
This is it.

840
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,500
Just this?

841
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,340
You should aim for something fancier,

842
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,180
like that kind of...

843
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,820
fine dining.

844
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,780
Who said I want to do fine dining?

845
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,780
Alright.

846
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,300
Whatever you want.

847
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,940
Even if it's airplanes or cannons,

848
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,900
I'll make it happen for you.

849
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,980
(One month later)

850
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,780
(Salty)

851
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,200
(Salty)

852
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,080
(Shiitake mushroom, black fungus, and dried daylily;
Spicy pepper eggplant with truffle)

853
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,000
(Salty)

854
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,220
(Alleyway noodles with soybean paste)

855
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,030
Let's get started.

856
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:54,880
Hurry up.

857
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,020
Yes, Chef!

858
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,340
(Shiitake mushroom, black fungus, and dried daylily;
Spicy pepper eggplant with truffle)

859
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,460
Are these noodles?

860
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,740
- Please sit.
- Yeah, noodles.

861
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,580
Is this the noodles?

862
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,420
Have a bowl?

863
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,380
Liu Yan,

864
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,220
is this the food you want to make?

865
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,380
Yeah.

866
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,260
Is this the life you want?

867
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,220
Your noodles.

868
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,180
Yes.

869
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,180
Is this how you survive and live?

870
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,220
Yeah.

871
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,220
Tastes amazing.

872
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,820
Your bowl's coming right away.

873
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,820
In the alleyway,

874
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,700
a little unlucky kid
who grew up getting beaten

875
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,460
has what I have today.

876
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,820
I can wake up happy every day.

877
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,300
- Add some more.
- Come on.

878
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,700
Braised beef cubes.

879
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,100
- Tastes amazing.
- Is it good?

880
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,420
These noodles are really good.

881
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,380
As long as you like it.

882
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,620
This will always be you.

883
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,650
You haven't even shown up,

884
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,900
but we hear your laughter first.

885
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,600
Today, I brought all my gear.

886
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,100
I'll livestream,
and your business will boom!

887
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,780
Really? Tell me,
what noodles do you want?

888
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,420
Today, we're at Salty Resto.

889
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,420
Alleyway noodles with soybean paste.

890
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,260
Liu Yan.

891
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,260
When you hit rock bottom, eat first.

892
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,740
Serve them.

893
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,380
Excuse me, you two...

894
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,540
Sesame-peanut sauce.

895
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,900
This is so tasty.

896
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,740
Liu Yan,

897
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,340
can I get another bowl?

898
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,150
(Alleyway noodles with soybean paste)
The same?

899
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,060
Yeah.

900
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,380
Mr. He?

901
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,060
You all...

902
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,100
Liu Yan! Liu Yan!

903
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,500
Highland loves Salty!

Former sous chef, current sous chef.

905
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,620
What to eat?

906
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,540
Order noodles.

907
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,700
What, it's not... not tasty?

908
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,700
It smells amazing.

909
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,820
That scared me!

910
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,900
Alright, alright.

911
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,140
Ms. Du?

912
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,020
Mr. He, long time no see.

913
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,850
I'll have a bowl, please.

914
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,860
Come on. What to eat?

915
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,180
- What do you want?
- Come on.

916
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,740
Say hello.

917
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,860
Eat more if it's tasty.

918
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,700
Sure.

919
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:12,920
This is amazing.

920
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,340
Which noodles are you having?

921
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,050
(Tang Shuangshuang)
Friends over here, is it tasty?

922
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,480
(So many. Where is it?)
My fourth bowl.

923
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,800
(My mouth's watering.)
At least give a follow.

924
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,740
(Great, haha.)
Please check out

925
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,820

(Want to try so badly, drooling.)
Mr. He Guangyuan.

927
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,460
He's super cool and reserved.

928
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,820
Now, so many people

929
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,180
are queuing up.

930
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,020
This is the Drum Tower.

931
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:31,860
Introduce it.

932
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,260
Meet our head chef.

933
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,820

937
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,940
When you hit rock bottom, eat first.

938
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,100
Eat first!

939
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:45,100
Thank you.

940
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,140
(Alleyway noodles with soybean paste)

941
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,040
Here you go.

942
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,890
Thank you.

943
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,910
No worries, take a napkin. Make room.

944
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,700
Luckily,

945
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,540
I hid three bowls of noodles.

946
00:47:59,100 --> 00:47:59,940
Otherwise,

947
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,660
I'd be hungry with you again.

948
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,740
You two worked hard.

949
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,380
Let's dig in.

950
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,780
Let's eat.

951
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,800
This is a bowl of cold noodles.

952
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,660
I even blew on it.

953
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:14,780
I'm starving.

954
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,260
So good.

955
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,300
(Salty)

956
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,140
Salty,

957
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,580
here comes a troublemaker.

958
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,020
She tasted all the sauces,

959
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,580
then said some were bland,
some too strong.

960
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,980
And she said the pork cracklings
weren't fried crispy enough.

961
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,860
So, which noodle did she choose?

962
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,140
None of them.

963
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,700
She insisted on

964
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:48,740
having a bowl

965
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,580
of Qiangguo noodles.

966
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,260
Sir, let me explain.

967
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,060
My daughter has been swamped lately.

968
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,060
You know, it's just...

969
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,740
She must have overlooked something.

970
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,180
Just come back tomorrow.

971
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,100
I promise that you'll get a bowl

972
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,980
of authentic one.

973
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,900
Don't eat this.
It's not authentic, really.

974
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,660
- This...
- It's pretty good!

975
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,700
Your standards are too low.

976
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,820
Stop eating for now.

977
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,900
Later, I'll have my daughter

978
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,860
make you another bowl.

979
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,420
(Jiang Fang is right.)

980
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,420
(When you hit rock bottom,)

981
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,580
(eat first.)

982
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,210
(As long as you're alive,
nothing is too big a deal.)

983
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,340
(All settled.)

984
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,980
(My story is about to end.)

985
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,980
(Wait a moment.)

986
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,500
(I'll boldly say one more thing.)

987
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,700
(Jiang Fang isn't
entirely right either.)

988
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,180
(There's never really been)

989
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,060
(a true dead end in life.)

990
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,740
