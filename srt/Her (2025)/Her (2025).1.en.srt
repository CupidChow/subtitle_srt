(Welcome)

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,320
Sir.

18
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,910
Another five lottery tickets, please.

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,430
Thanks, sir.

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,880
Salty, wait for me.

21
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,400
Wait for me.

22
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,790
Why are you walking so fast?

23
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,980
I'll pay you back
once my luck turns around.

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,910
Let me tell you.

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,070
Today is the day of my suffering.

26
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,480
The day I gave birth to you,

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,080
I went through hell.

28
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,000
You better not embarrass me.

29
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,100
Don't touch my head.

30
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,830
Touching the head brings bad luck.

31
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,280
Salty.

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,780
The clear stew with radish and lamb.

33
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,140
It smells too gamey.

34
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,940
That's not lamb.

35
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,700
It's goat meat.

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,980
So, what should be added?

37
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Old ginger.

38
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,140
That's right.

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,140
Come here. Don't run.

40
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,460
The stir-fried pork with garlic sprouts.

41
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,380
With Pixian bean paste.

42
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,900
You can even smell that?

43
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,420
Uncle Deng.

44
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,340
Your braised pork is burning.

45
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,860
Turn off the heat now.

46
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,100
He used the vinegar trick.

47
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,300
There's also Laba garlic.

48
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,340
So, what is that vinegar?

49
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,420
Laba vinegar.

50
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,060
My daughter is so amazing.

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,940
What kind of birthday is this.

52
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,260
Not even a cake.

53
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,420
If it weren't for
those crummy lottery tickets,

54
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,140
I could've added a chicken leg.

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,300
With your luck,

56
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,620
you won't win.

57
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,460
You'll be poor all year.

58
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,580
You little brat.

59
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,940
Please ignore that.

60
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,340
Follow me like this.

61
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,580
No, not like that.

62
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,540
Here, knead it first.

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,420
Look, knead it.

64
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,660
Each time you knead, flip it once.

65
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,060
Look at my hands.

66
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,220
Flip it once.

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,940
Jiang Fang,
I'll make it snow for you.

68
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,300
What is that?

69
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,680
It should fall like this.

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,020
This is what snowing looks like.

71
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,520
- Come on.
- I'm all white now.

72
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,420
What's inside?

73
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,740
Wild veggies.

74
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,780
What kind of wild veggies?

75
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,180
The wild veggies that you stole.

76
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,160
That's not stealing.

77
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,620
The wild veggies grow in the field.

78
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,580
Nobody wants them.

79
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,380
We give them a second life.

80
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,740
It's delicious, right?

81
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,900
Come on, eat.

82
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,940
Mr. Zhang, are you usually busy?

83
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,540
Not really.

84
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,580
Leaders like you

85
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,500
must be a lot busier than we are.

86
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,140
Sort of.

87
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,420
Raising your daughter alone

88
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,540
can't be easy.

89
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,900
Why isn't she back yet?

90
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,440
- Jiang Fang.
- Probably lost in play.

91
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,840
Where did you run off to?

92
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,700
I played every single one of them.

93
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,740
So much fun.

94
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
Aren't you going to thank Uncle Zhang?

95
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,820
- Thanks, Uncle Zhang.
- Good girl.

96
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,980
You're all sweaty.

97
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,140
Silly girl.

98
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,900
Take me on the Ferris wheel.

99
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,220
What's so fun about that?

100
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,420
Locked in a little cage

101
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,500
and stuck in there for ages.

102
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,620
Then why did you go

103
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,060
on so many rounds with Uncle Zhang?

104
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,540
That Ferris wheel wasn't any fun.

105
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,460
There's a big new one in the southeast.

106
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,860
Next time I'll take you on that one.

107
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,420
What's this?

108
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,740
It's the bread I bought.

109
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,820
And a Popsicle.

110
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,580
I stuffed the Popsicle inside.

111
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,900
The Popsicle is sweet,

112
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,340
and the bread smells fragrant.

113
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,980
When they melt together,

114
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,260
it tastes really good.

115
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,420
My daughter got this from me.

116
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,800
She knows how to make tasty stuff.

117
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,420
I've already set it up.

118
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,820
You just need to press the button.

119
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,700
Take one more vertically.

120
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,220
- One more vertical shot.
- OK.

121
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,060

Of course, we have it.

135

And it's a special one.

Come on, Salty.

137
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,740
Make a wish.

All deities above, Amitabha.

Today is Salty's birthday.

140
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,740
I'll make a big wish here.

141
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,380
May Jiang Fang get rich.

142
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,260
The richer the better.

143
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,300
Don't hold back.

144
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,680
Five million from the lottery
wouldn't be too little.

145
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,140
Even five yuan wouldn't be too much.

146
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,220
Wait, no.
Five million wouldn't be too much.

147
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,580
Five yuan wouldn't be too little.

148
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,580
May I always win with All One Suit
and Seven Pairs.

149
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,220
Special Seven Pairs
would be even better.

150
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,900
A Pure Straight is also fine.

151
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,980
Jiang Fang,
why are you making the wish again?

152
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,860
Your wishes are worthless.

153
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,290
- (Although)
- Come on.

154
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,980
- (after this birthday,)
- Blow them out.

155
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,020
(Jiang Fang disappeared,)

156
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,380
(she has always been)

157
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,340
(the most important person
in Liu Yan's heart.)

158
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,440
(Beijing Free Combat Sports School)
After today,

159
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,600
you're a big kid.

160
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,860
You need to go where big kids go.

161
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,420
Don't break it.

162
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,300
What is this place?

163
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,180
This is your new school.

164
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,380
Salty,

165
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,780
study hard here.

166
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,680
If you do well, I'll follow your lead.

167
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,820
From now on, no one will dare bully us.

168
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,260
Wait a sec.

169
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,340
Is anyone here?

170
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,940
Hello.

171
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,500
I'm Liu Yan's mother.

172
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,340
Yes.

173
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,490
Hello.

174
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,060
Let's shake hands.

175
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,340
I'm Liu Yan.

176
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,460
What's your name?

177
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,500
What are you doing here all day?

178
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,380
Salty.

179
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,740
Liu Yan, come on.

180
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,020
Hurry up.

181
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,540
Come.

182
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,930
(Little Liu Yan kept waiting
for Jiang Fang to pick her up.)

183
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,660
(Until this year,)

184
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,660
(I turned 25.)

185
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,490
(Yes.)

186
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,660
(I'm Liu Yan,)

187
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,700
(the unlucky one
getting beaten up here.)

188
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,140
In this match,

189
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,980
Xu Yinghui faces Liu Yan.

00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,180
Liu Yan

191
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,300
is a 25-year-old veteran.

192
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,160
I remember Liu Yan.

193
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,300
A few years ago,
she was suspended for other reasons.

194
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,440
She hasn't competed in years.

195
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,500
- Really?
- Yeah.

196
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,960
That makes her comeback in this match

197
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,500
highly anticipated.

198
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,460
Liu Yan starts
with an aggressive offense.

199
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,920
Of course, as a 25-year-old veteran,

200
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,300
after such a long suspension,

201
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,140
she has to prove herself fast

202
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,140
that she still belongs in the ring.

203
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,180
Fight!

204
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,020
- Nice.
- Good kick.

205
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,540
That's Samart's Teep.

206
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,140
A technique from 20 or 30 years ago

207
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,420
was revived in the ring.

208
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,540
You have the nerve to drink?

209
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,420
I held back.

210
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,660
She wouldn't land a hit on me.

211
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,180
Can we not mess around? Take it easy.

212
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,500
You even used the Teep.

213
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,340
They're cursing.

214
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,460
Are you trying to kill her?

215
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,620
I haven't used my legs in ages.

216
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,620
Feels great.

217
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,500
Maybe for you.

218
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,020
Do you still want to go
to the world championships?

219
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,300
If I let her win this one,

220
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,060
I'm guaranteed
a spot at the worlds, huh?

221
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,500
The higher-ups promised you.

222
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,780
Can we stick to the plan?

223
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,660
Can we?

224
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,900
OK, OK.

225
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,300
Then follow my lead.

226
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,460
Let her get enough points.

227
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,220
Is it enough?

228
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,100
Not yet?

229
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,940
Think of the worlds.

230
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,860
Almost there.

231
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,140
Continue.

232
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,820
We have the match result.

233
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,020
All three judges unanimously decide that

234
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,180
the winner is

235
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,860
the blue corner.

236
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,940
Congratulations to Xu Yinghui.

237
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,900
Miss,

238
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,020
can I have that aluminum can?

239
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,500
- Here.
- Thanks.

240
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,820
Do you want these?

241
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,820
No.

242
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,040
It's not worth anything.

243
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,420
Not worth a cent.

244
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,980
Then don't worry about it.

245
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,060
I'll clean it up for you.

246
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,910
Alright.

247
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,100
Thanks for the help.

248
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,540
Little scavenger.

249
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,900
Liu Yan.

250
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,980
There's more over there.

251
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,830
There, there.

252
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,460
I got it, Liu Yan.

253
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,460
You want the empty bottles

254
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,300
without water, right?

255
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,620
Here, I'll help you.

256
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,380
I can't drink anymore.

257
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,060
Here, take it.

258
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,420
Good job.

259
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,380
Here's another one.

260
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,540
More here, more here.

261
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,300
You know what?

262
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,020
You're just a burden to the team.

263
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,580
They put you in the ring
to be cannon fodder.

264
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,620
But show off once you're in the ring.

265
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,030
What have you got?

266
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,780
Do you really think
you'll go to the worlds?

267
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,540
You're not just a burden.

268
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,860
You're also a cook.

269
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,740
A dorm keeper.

270
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,140
And a cleaner.

271
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,460
Besides,

272
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,180
she's parentless.

273
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,460
Watch your mouth.

274
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,420
You can insult me,

275
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,060
but if anyone humiliates my mom,

276
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,900
I won't let it go.

277
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,820
I'll hit them.

278
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,700
Your mom dumped you in the team

279
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,740
over ten years ago

280
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,260
and never came back once.

281
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,340
That makes you parentless.

282
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,500
- Say that again.
- What?

283
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,580
Ignore her.

284
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,780
Don't mess with her. Let's go.

285
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,660
Exactly, Wu Shuang.

286
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,340
Don't let her
mess up your future matches.

287
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,200
Who's scared of you?

288
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,100
She's not worth it.

289
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,340
Let's go.

290
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,780
- Liu Yan, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

291
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,620
Does it hurt?

292
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,460
Look at what I got today.

293
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,820
Two bags.

294
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,820
There's so much left.

295
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,980
Today beats every previous day.

296
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,660
All these sausages and chips...

297
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,900
All yours.

298
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,060
Alright.

299
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,340
Hurry up.

300
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,000
Clean up and meet me
for extra training.

301
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,900
Coming, coming.

302
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,620
Scrap collection!

303
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,590
- Scrap collection!
- Ma'am.

304
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,980
You're here.

305
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,460
Is your workplace shutting down?

306
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,300
This is too little.

307
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,980
Wish for something better.

308
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,980
Our team is going

309
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,980
to the world championships next month.

310
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,480
- Alright.
- Bye.

311
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,100
You haven't paid me yet.

312
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,260
I'll pay you next time.

313
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,120
No, not next time.

314
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Ma'am, give it to me now?

315
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,870
This is a new car.

316
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,940
I'm not good at using it.

317
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,720
- You didn't pay me last time.
- Let me go.

318
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,580
No, Ma'am, seriously.

319
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,700
You can't do this.

320
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,940
- I'll pay you next time.
- No.

321
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,980
Don't get so close to me.

322
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,040
Don't make it hard for me.

323
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,480
I'm not skilled with this new car.

324
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,330
No, stop chasing me.

325
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,660
Ma'am, stop saying "next time".

326
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,580
Next time, I will transfer it on WeChat.

327
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,420
Please just...

328
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,060
Liu Yan, what are you cooking?

329
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,780
You smell that?

330
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,380
Hold on, it's almost ready.

331
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,140
Good for you.

332
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,580
No one wants the junk there,

333
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,460
but you clean it up
and turn it into treasure.

334
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,300
I can't let it go to waste.

335
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,500
Here, try it.

336
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,900
Tastes good.

337
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,500
Perfection on a plate.

338
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,460
Oh, don't worry about the asparagus fern

339
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,460
in my room.

340
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,180
But help me water that money tree.

341
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,020
Got it.

342
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,700
Liu Yan.

343
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,700
I forgot to close my window.

344
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,340
- Let it air out.
- OK.

345
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,500
Here's the key.

346
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,820
Thanks.

347
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,060
- I'm leaving.
- Bye-bye.

348
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,900
Bye-bye.

349
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,660
Liu Yan, the key.

350
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,290
I'll just leave it here for you.

351
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,050
Okay.

352
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,020
Don't forget to bring in the clothes
in the yard.

353
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,970
The ride's not here yet.

354
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,580
You have time. Go do it yourself.

355
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,740
She's not busy anyway.

356
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,960
She's got nothing to do today.

357
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,060
You're so bossy.

358
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,500
I gave her a tip.

359
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,700
Unlike you guys.

360
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,100
You always boss her around for free.

361
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,580
The participant list

362
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,460
for the worlds is out.

363
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,620
I'm on it.

364
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,820
(Notice)

365
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,900
Why are you on it?

366
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,220
You're on it.

367
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,820
Why are you on it?

368
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,180
I'm on it.

369
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,500
Why did you lie to me?

370
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,420
You said if I threw one match,

371
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,680
I'd get to go next time.

372
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,620
How many times have you lied to me?

373
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,780
In the youth trials in 2013,

374
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,980
I won,

375
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,300
but you didn't let me into the finals.

376
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,540
In the winter free combat championship
in 2019,

377
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,420
I had enough points to qualify,

378
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,260
but you told me to be noble
and sit it out,

379
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,180
so Wu Shuang

380
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,460
wouldn't get crushed.

381
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
What a joke.

382
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,980
Don't chime in.

383
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,410
Just last week...

384
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,980
I trained for the U-Series Invitational

385
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,780
for three years.

386
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,160
How many three-year stretches

387
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,340
does an athlete get?

388
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,220
And what did you say?

389
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,800
You said if I lost to Xu Yinghui,

390
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,700
you'd register me
for the world championships.

391
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,140
She's nowhere near my level.

392
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,420
I could've beaten her easily.

393
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,260
Fine.

394
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,700
I let her win.

395
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,540
But I'm not even on the list

396
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,860
you just posted outside.

397
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,460
Who do you have to blame
for being banned for three years?

398
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,980
Am I the one who told you to fight?

399
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,540
You didn't join in too?

400
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,100
What's wrong?

401
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,800
We're having a meeting.

402
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,600
A bunch of people

403
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,320
in this room were also in that fight.

404
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,930
When the cops showed up,

405
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,440
you all ran faster than anyone.

406
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,260
Come on.

407
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,980
Who's this?

408
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,980
Sorry, Mr. Ji.

409
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,920
I forgot.

410
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,460
I forgot to introduce myself.

411
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,420
You probably don't know who I am.

412
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,580
I'm Liu Yan.

413
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,700
I won a national championship at 14.

414
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,860
I'm a very obedient athlete.

415
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,860
However...

416
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,740
I just hope the club

417
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,220
can keep its word.

418
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,100
You said I'd get to go to the worlds.

419
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,740
You can't go back on that.

420
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,340
I...

421
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,460
I've made so many compromises.

422
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,900
I'm 25 now.

423
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,140
If I don't go this year,

424
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,260
I won't get another chance.

425
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,880
Seriously? What were you doing just now?

426
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,220
Are you crazy?

427
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,780
Coach Zhang, the meeting's over?

428
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,980
Does Mr. Ji remember who I am now?

429
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,140
Can you stop acting like this?

430
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,500
Mr. Ji knows

431
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,340
who you are.

432
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,900
He decided all this.

433
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,900
Then why did you come?

434
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,300
To comfort me?

435
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,300
Wu Shuang's 25.

436
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,950
If she doesn't fight now, she's done.

437
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,540
Besides, Mr. Ji thinks

438
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,780
she's more marketable.

439
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,220
Everything's been arranged.

440
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,140
I'm 25 too.

441
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
The worlds are only once
every three years.

442
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,660
You know that.

443
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,740
The rankings are public.

444
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,380
Even if they tricked me

445
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,460
into losing one spot,

446
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,940
my total points are enough.

447
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,980
By all logic,

448
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,860
they shouldn't keep me off the roster.

449
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,740
Yes.

450
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,500
You're absolutely right.

451
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,260
I've said everything I can.

452
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,060
In the end, the boss compromised too.

453
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,320
You'll get to fight this one.

454
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,500
- Really?
- Really.

455
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,900
I get to fight?

456
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,540
Yes, you'll fight.

457
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,260
Stop.

458
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,580
However,

459
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,540
you can't win.

460
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,700
You have to lose.

461
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,460
Why?

462
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,540
Even if I lose,

463
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,300
I'm almost ready to retire anyway.

464
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,260
Why can't you let me win?

465
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,200
Wu Shuang earned her place
through punches,

466
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
and so did I.

467
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,660
Right.

468
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,380
But we're not losing for nothing.

469
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,660
You'll get another three-year contract
as a sparring partner.

470
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,740
I have to win.

471
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,220
If this club doesn't want me,

472
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,660
I'll go to another one.

473
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,380
I don't want to be
a sparring partner forever.

474
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,220
What's so bad about that?

475
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,300
If it weren't for these jobs here,

476
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,020
my mom wouldn't be able
to afford her medicine.

477
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,960
She'd be gone by now.

478
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,080
Don't you want to stay here

479
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,280
and wait for your mom?

480
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,300
A three-year contract is perfect.

481
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,940
Another punch from Wu Shuang.

482
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,760
Liu Yan is forced into the corner again.

483
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,740
Liu Yan doesn't seem to be
in good form today.

484
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,940
She's been on the defensive.

485
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,700
Wu Shuang has been going all in
on offense.

486
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,140
She looks like she's in great shape.

487
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,820
Liu Yan is pushed back
into the corner again.

488
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,260
If this keeps up,

489
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,860
it'll be hard for Liu Yan to win.

490
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,460
After Liu Yan's suspension,

491
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,020
she also lost her first comeback match.

492
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,540
If she loses this one too,

493
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,460
it really shows she no longer has

494
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,340
what it takes to be a boxer.

495
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,620
Wu Shuang suddenly knocks Liu Yan down.

496
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,140
That seemed an infraction.

497
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,300
She broke the rules.

498
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,780
An infraction. Didn't you see that?

499
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,660
Go back.

500
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,330
- As we can see,
- Go back.

501
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,380
there's some tension.

502
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,440
The referee doesn't think

503
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,620
Wu Shuang violated any rules.

504
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,540
There's definitely bad blood
between them.

505
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,110
Yes.

506
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,240
Liu Yan and Wu Shuang
have faced off several times.

507
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,840
This is enemies crossing paths.

508
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,420
Drink some water.

509
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,620
Spit.

510
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,500
Here, ice it.

511
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,420
Come here.

512
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,900
Stop going against Wu Shuang, alright?

513
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,940
Just lose this one safely.

514
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,290
Losing is our fate.

515
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,420
You hear me?

516
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,180
If I were Liu Yan,

517
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,580
I'd just throw in the towel.

518
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,500
Giving up can be a valid choice too.

519
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,500
Fight!

520
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,620
Go. Go.

521
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,460
Liu Yan is testing the waters.

522
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,460
She's becoming more aggressive.

523
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,180
Incredible!

524
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,340
Wu Shuang tried to use
Liu Yan's signature move,

525
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,580
but it backfired.

526
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,420
Liu Yan seems to have found her rhythm.

527
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,260
She's becoming more aggressive.

528
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,900
She's slowly taking control,

529
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,620
forcing Wu Shuang

530
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,420
to resort to clinching tactics.

531
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,740
If you dare to win,

532
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,340
you and Coach Zhang are both out.

533
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,780
Watch behind you.

534
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,660
Stop.

535
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,660
Five.

536
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,060
Four.

537
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,580
Three.

538
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,980
Two.

539
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,260
One.

540
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,620
It's over.

541
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,820
Congratulations to Wu Shuang.

542
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,980
You're too gullible.

543
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,820
You lost.

544
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,860
Coach Zhang is still out.

545
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,420
Stop it. Stop the fight. Stop it.

546
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,820
Stop it. Stop the fight.

547
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,420
Someone come!

548
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,310
Why is my Blackie here?

549
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,250
No, no.

550
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,680
You need an access pass to enter.

551
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,820
Sir, I'm Liu Yan.

552
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,980
That doesn't matter. You need a pass.

553
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,180
You need an access pass.

554
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,320
The pass is inside. I'll go get it.

555
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,160
You need a pass.

556
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
No pass, no entry.

557
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,470
Yes, my pass is inside, sir.

558
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,650
No. You have to have a pass.

559
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,820
So, the one
who follows the rules the most

560
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,460
at this club is our security guard, huh?

561
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,700
You fired me.

562
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,460
Can't I at least grab my stuff?

563
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,580
Fine, no need to blow the whistle.

564
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,420
Sir.

565
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,980
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

566
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,620
You're back.

567
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,020
Ding, look who's back.

568
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,180
That's right. It's Salty.

569
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,180
You came back from a match?

570
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,060
Yeah.

571
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,940
Did you win?

572
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,780
It was fine.

573
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,460
Liu Yan.

574
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,940
Jiang Fang's daughter.

575
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,260
Who's Jiang Fang?

576
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,980
Don't play dumb.

577
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,500
- Grandpa Hao.
- Your wife even

578
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,940
caused a scene at their place before.

579
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,660
Uncle, Aunt.

580
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,000
Look at that face full of bruises.

581
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Here to see Yang again?

582
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
That kid's been frail since birth.

583
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,060
That two-bedroom house

584
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,140
you saw the other day...

585
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,270
If you're free,

586
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,820
maybe come by the office this afternoon?

587
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,280
Yeah, I'll be there in the afternoon.

588
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,540
Then I'll ask the landlord

589
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,660
if the price can come down.

590
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,460
Yes, he's coming
to check it out next week.

591
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,740
Three people.

592
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,940
Two bedrooms and a living room.

593
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,780
Yeah.

594
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,180
I told him 13,000.

595
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,380
So I guess I'll head

596
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,340
back to the office now?

597
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Why didn't you say anything
when you came back?

598
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,980
If I'd known,
I would've snuck out of work.

599
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,160
I spent the whole day
wandering around with clients,

600
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,880
but didn't close a single deal.

601
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,980
Why did you suddenly come back?

602
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,180
You could've told me.

603
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,580
You guys on break?

604
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,100
No.

605
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Look at your face.

606
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,460
You didn't use
the face cream I gave you,

607
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:14,940
did you?

608
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,620
I don't like that stuff.

609
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,060
It feels sticky.

610
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,860
What's on the menu today?

611
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,900
Fried leftover pancakes.

612
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,020
It'll be done soon.

613
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,140
So, did your club make you lose

614
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,940
this time again?

615
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,740
I won.

616
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,340
You won? Who's your rival?

617
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,340
Wu Shuang.

618
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,900
You beat Wu Shuang?

619
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,700
My god. Hold on.

620
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,980
Does that mean you're

621
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,540
your club's champion now?

622
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,700
Let me tell you.

623
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,780
Not just Wu Shuang.

624
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,480
- I also beat the referee.
- What?

625
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,820
He was the men's national champion

626
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,300
at the National Games ten years ago.

627
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,700
I hit him with a huge hook.

628
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,380
And Wu Shuang's coach.

629
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,340
I gave him a combo:
hook, uppercut, straight,

630
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,540
plus a knee to take down a guy

631
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,460
who tried to gouge my eye out.

632
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,500
Wait.

633
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,740
Let me process this.

634
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,620
So, now you've beaten

635
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,580
the coach,

636
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,060
then the referee,

637
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,820
and the whole ring.

638
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,980
With that combo,

639
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,220
you're getting banned again, right?

640
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,140
I'm fired. They got rid of me for good.

641
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,980
It's fine.

642
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,780
We'll figure out a way to go back.

643
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,660
This is all Jiang Fang's fault.

644
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,380
She dumped you there,

645
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,060
but hasn't sent a single word for years,

646
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,920
and left you there
to be treated like dirt.

647
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,380
It's so good.

648
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,180
Delicious.

649
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,740
I mean serious.

650
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,520
What are you planning to do next?

651
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,610
We've got to find a way to go back.

652
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,900
Jiang Fang said,

653
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,540
"When you hit rock bottom, eat first."

654
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,420
(Yeah.)

655
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,620
(When you hit rock bottom, eat first.)

656
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,940
(Right, Jiang Fang?)

657
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,820
Salty.

658
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,420
Smells so good.

659
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,340
Smells good, right?

660
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,920
Are you hungry?

661
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,780
Yes.

662
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,620
Go wash your hands.

663
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,860
Come on, you two.

664
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,060
Still thinking about food even now.

665
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,940
It's not like we're eating your food.

666
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,180
He's so nosy.

667
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,500
Jiang Fang,

668
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,060
when that guy hit you,

669
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,220
why didn't you dodge?

670
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,260
Didn't you say he treated you well?

671
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,240
I was on a winning streak
playing mahjong today.

672
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,340
If I hit him,
I was afraid it'd ruin my luck.

673
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,580
Then why'd you hit him back later?

674
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,020
He started cursing you.

675
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,140
His mouth was filthy.

676
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,380
I had to beat him.

677
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,100
- Mom.
- What should you call me?

678
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,460
Jiang Fang, Jiang Fang.

679
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,780
Someone said I don't have a dad.

680
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,460
That's not true.

681
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,660
You have a dad.

682
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,620
When you were in my belly,

683
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,600
your dad had an accident
and passed away.

684
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,220
Next time someone says

685
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,260
you don't have a dad,

686
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,940
you slap them hard.

687
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,380
Swing big and slap them.

688
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,620
Then why can everyone else call "Mom",

689
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,900
but I can't?

690
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,700
Didn't I tell you?

691
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,220
When your dad passed,

692
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,620
he left behind a mountain of debt.

693
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,860
People came to collect debts every day.

694
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,420
I didn't want them to know

695
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,300
who you were.

696
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,820
That's called safety awareness.

697
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,660
Understand?

698
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,900
Come on, eat while it's hot.

699
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,980
Smell good?

700
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,380
- Jiang Fang, open the door.
- Go hide.

701
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,460
You owe us money. Open the door.

702
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,060
Eat fried hairtail while it's hot.

703
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,740
This is the apartment from my workplace.

704
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,700
When Jiang Fang left,

705
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
she still owed two months' rent.

706
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,020
Enough.

707
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,580
Can't we talk in our own home?

708
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,620
Why does Liu Yan run back here

709
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,800
every time something happens?

710
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,660
She really thinks this is her home?

711
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,860
Did she hear

712
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,420
we're getting relocated

713
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,740
and came back to cozy up to you?

714
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,100
That's enough, Mom. Keep it down.

715
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,220
What kind of woman is Jiang Fang?

716
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,980
Like mother, like daughter.

717
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,540
Taking advantage with no shame.

718
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,380
Back when Jiang Fang was head chef,

719
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,140
we were always kissing up to her

720
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,340
for free food and drinks.

721
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,620
That was
because the state-run restaurant

722
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,900
gave out so much stuff.

723
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,640
She couldn't finish it all,
so she gave us some.

724
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,340
People get impulsive in the ring.

725
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,380
Alright then.

726
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,980
If your club

727
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,140
has any opportunities,

728
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,300
let me know, okay?

729
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,340
Sure.

730
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,860
OK, thanks. Bye.

731
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,380
Hello, Chen?

732
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,540
It's me, Liu Yan.

733
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,980
Anything's fine.

734
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,600
It doesn't have to be
a sparring partner.

735
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,620
I'll do anything.

736
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,260
No.

737
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,940
Where did you go?

738
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,260
It's not like I kicked you out.

739
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,420
Where are you going

740
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,460
with such a big suitcase?

741
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,740
You found a job?

742
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,620
I did.

743
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,500
Lots of clubs are short
on sparring partners.

744
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,340
Liu Yan.

745
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,660
You can tell me the truth.

746
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,300
The truth?

747
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,180
That is the truth.

748
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,540
Still using the same old suitcase, huh?

749
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,900
Doesn't your club

750
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,740
even give you guys matching ones?

751
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,860
I sold it a long time ago.

752
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,580
Burlap sack for grass sack,

753
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,540
things always get worse.

754
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,220
Alright, you found a job.

755
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,020
And then?

756
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,580
Then I'll go to work.

757
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,740
Work?

758
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,730
It's just a few hundred a month.

759
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,100
Where will you live?

760
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,600
Will you have enough food?

761
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,380
When you were on the team,

762
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,220
you didn't make much,

763
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,940
but they covered your food and housing.

764
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,460
Listen to me.

765
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,580
Go back

766
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,450
and beg your manager.

767
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,480
Let's sign that three-year

768
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,760
sparring partner contract first.

769
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,580
After you retire,

770
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,340
we can figure out what's next.

771
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,180
Is that okay?

772
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,140
Didn't you see? They sent my stuff back.

773
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,460
That means kicking me out.

774
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,980
What am I going back for?

775
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,580
If you won't go back,

776
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,460
then marriage is your only option.

777
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,980
Why not just settle

778
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,820
and be with me?

779
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,100
You've lived in this room
since you were a kid, right?

780
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,300
Just keep living here.

781
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,960
As long as I have a bite to eat,

782
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,880
you'll never go hungry.

783
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,720
Deal?

784
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,500
You call yourself my brother like that?

785
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,740
Have some shame, will you?

786
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,980
Then be a real estate agent with me.

787
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,140
Is that okay?

788
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,000
I'll teach you.

789
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,860
When I'm with clients,

790
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,300
I can't even talk properly.

791
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,520
When I'm upset, I become violent.

792
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,900
It's not a good fit for me.

793
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,660
Listen to me.

794
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,940
If you see me as your brother,

795
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,880
you should listen to me.

796
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,220
You can't be so impulsive anymore.

797
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,980
Look at your club.

798
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,240
Those with less skill than you

799
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,620
ended up being your bosses.

800
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,460
Why?

801
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,820
You should learn from them.

802
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,460
How?

803
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,340
Take your boss out for dinner.

804
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,500
That'll make things easier.

805
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,020
Come on. Seriously?

806
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,940
I've been in real estate long enough.

807
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,220
This is the wisdom I've gained.

808
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,900
See this?

809
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,100
The top restaurant in Beijing.

810
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,000
I already booked it.

811
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,360
- Go tomorrow.
- You booked it?

812
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,140
- No.
- Cut it out.

813
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,700
The deposit is 500. It's not refundable.

814
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,140
I don't want to treat them to dinner.

815
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,980
- Salty.
- What am I supposed to say to them?

816
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,020
You went to sports school at 13.

817
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,140
Besides boxing,

818
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,860
what else can you do?

819
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,580
I'm still not going.

820
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,300
Ms. Liu.

821
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,300
Your 500-yuan deposit

822
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,140
is non-refundable.

823
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,860
It's included in today's bill.

824
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,460
Also, our private room

825
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,420
has a minimum spend.

826
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,260
It's 4,500 yuan,

827
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,060
plus a 10% service charge.

828
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
Just letting you know.

829
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,580
So, can we start ordering now?

830
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,640
What can you order with 4,500?

831
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,500
Eat. This beef's really good.

832
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,060
Eat.

833
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,980
Mr. Ji.

834
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,840
- Sure.
- Let me pour you a drink.

835
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,860
I'll drink with you.

836
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,060
- Fill it up.
- Sorry to trouble you.

837
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,700
It's fine. It's fine.

838
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,940
I'll drink with you.

839
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,780
I'll drink.

840
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,820
Let me tell you

841
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,260
how Liu ended up here.

842
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,620
Her mom

843
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,100
is totally unreliable.

844
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,340
She acted like a boss,

845
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,860
dumped the kid at the club,

846
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,100
and just vanished.

847
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,980
She's gone.

848
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,060
Liu,

849
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,340
the club

850
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,420
basically raised you.

851
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,580
- You're an adult now.
- Yes.

852
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
The club is your home,

853
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,540
right?

854
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,820
- You're right.
- Yes.

855
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,980
Look at Liu.

856
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,900
Listen to me.

857
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,220
None of you can compare.

858
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,080
Good.

859
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,740
Liu, you're good.

860
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
I don't think
we've drunk together before,

861
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
but you can totally hold your liquor.

862
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,860
No, no.

863
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,800
I just feel like maybe

864
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,300
you get it

865
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,140
from your parents.

866
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,460
Cheers.

867
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,060
Mr. Ji, you can really drink.

868
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,900
Yeah.

869
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,360
Liu Yan, good. Cheers.

870
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,100
Liu Yan,

871
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,580
you had mail at the security office.

872
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,530
I picked it up for you.

873
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,740
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

874
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,580
Do you all know Mr. Ji

875
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,780
sings beautifully?

876
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,540
Come on, Mr. Ji. Sing one for us.

877
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,300
- Let's hear it.
- Sing for us.

878
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,220
Mr. Ji, come on.

879
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,060
Sing for us.

Hello, may we serve

889
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,100
the main courses now?

890
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,020
Can you pack everything up, please?

891
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,400
Once you've finished,

892
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,580
- we'll help you pack.
- No.

893
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,740
Right now. Pack everything.

894
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,580
I'm taking it all.

895
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,220
You're packing before we eat?

896
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,380
Liu Yan, what are you doing?

897
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,200
Mr. Ji, say something.

898
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,980
Why did you pack everything?

899
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,140
So, you didn't eat

900
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,140
and only talked?

901
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,660
Oh, what did your boss say?

902
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,820
They agreed, right?

903
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,860
I told you. Dinner always works.

904
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,660
Why do you smell like alcohol?

905
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,620
Did you drink?

906
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,580
You know you can't drink.

907
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,420
What's this?

908
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,580
Give it to me.

909
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,980
Jaya?

910
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,500
Overseas?

911
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,260
Jiang Fang?

912
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,620
Your mom?

913
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,220
It's from your mom?

914
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,500
She's dead.

915
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,860
What?

916
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,620
She's dead.

917
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,540
That kid

918
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,380
is really sturdy.

919
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,860
Just a little reckless.

920
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,660
Sometimes, she offends people,

921
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,940
but except for that, she's good.

922
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,020
Anyway, please take care of her.

923
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,100
Once I'm done with my side,

924
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,960
I'll come and get her.

925
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,980
OK. Don't worry.

926
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,820
Leave her with us.

927
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,020
You can rest easy.

928
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,960
We'll take care of her.

929
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,810
Thanks, Coach Zhang.

930
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,670
Thank you.

931
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,620
Salty.

932
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,100
Stay here and listen to your coach.

933
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,180
Train hard.

934
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,170
If you win a match,

935
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,980
you'll make money.

936
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,180
Uncle Wang, Uncle Liu, Uncle Li.

937
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,460
Don't they want to be my dad?

938
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,500
Just stay here with them.

939
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,020
Marry one of them.

940
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,540
Don't go.

941
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,300
Kid, you don't understand.

942
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,860
Marriage isn't that easy.

943
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,580
Once I settle down,

944
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,140
I'll come and get you.

945
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,980
I'll give Wang Yang the cat

946
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,140
and go with you.

947
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,780
Jiang Fang,

948
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,140
why didn't you bring my cat?

949
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,940
They don't allow pets here.

950
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,420
Jiang Fang, where's my cat?

951
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,980
You didn't sell it, did you?

952
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,180
No.

953
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,860
It's not even worth much.

954
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,740
What's wrong with you?

955
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,620
You're leaving,

956
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,020
and you sold my cat?

957
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,470
Alright, alright.

958
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,340
You're too old to be crying like this.

959
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,500
Alright, stop crying.

960
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,700
I have a gift, Salty.

961
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,140
A gift for you.

962
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,860
Isn't this pretty?

963
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,060
This one's for me.

964
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,500
This one's for you.

965
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,120
These are our tokens

966
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,060
for our next meeting,

967
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,020
okay?

968
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,940
Jiang Fang,

969
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,460
am I a burden to you?

970
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,060
Your mom left you money.

971
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,980
Salty.

972
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,060
Salty.

973
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,540
She even left you a house.

974
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,780
Salty, there's so much.

975
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,140
Honestly,

976
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,180
your mom's good.

977
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,860
She reached out a hand
in your darkest moment.

978
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,540
Did I say something wrong?

979
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,700
Slow down, slow down.

980
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,700
I'm fine. I'm fine, really.

981
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,100
I'm fine.

982
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,420
I'm not drunk.

983
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,260
I've got something to do.

984
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,180
Don't follow me.

985
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,500
Do not follow me.

986
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,990
Son.

987
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,780
(Son,)

988
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,580
(in this compound,)

989
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,500
(everyone thinks we're a burden.)

990
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,180
(I'm going to find my mom.)

991
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,620
(You should go find yours too.)

992
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,900
Salty.

993
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,820
You're not a burden to me.

994
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,900
You're my lucky star.

995
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,940
The day I gave birth to you,

996
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,540
I won a heavenly hand in mahjong.

997
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Jiang Fang, I'll wait for you.

998
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,620
(Jiang Fang,)

999
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,900
(I've waited for 13 years for you.)

1000
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,580
(Today, the wait is over.)

1001
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,670
(How could you just die)

1002
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,640
(without saying a word?)

1003
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,960
Jiang Fang,
I'll wait for you to pick me up.

1004
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,100
(All these years,)

1005
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,700
(I kept wondering)

1006
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,580
(why you haven't come back for me.)

1007
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,780
(During our last meeting,)

1008
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,140
(you said I was your lucky star,)

1009
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,580
(not your burden.)

1010
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,540
(Was that a lie?)

1011
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,220
(Two days later)

1012
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,980
(Jaya)
(Jiang Fang,)

1013
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,540
(since you didn't come to find me,)

1014
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,300
(I'm here to see you.)

1015
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,740
Jiang Fang,

1016
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,630
as I walked over,

1017
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,280
I saw everyone else
living in row houses,

1018
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,740
but you're out here in a villa
on a mountaintop.

1019
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,620
