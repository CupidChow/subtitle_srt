15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,140
(Two years ago)

16
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,990
Come in.

17
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,190
Come on.

18
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,480
Downstairs is a herbal tea shop.

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,510
The owner, Uncle Lin, is my good friend.

20
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,880
He's been trying to rent out
the second floor.

21
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,750
But it hasn't been rented.

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,040
So I took the place for you.

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,550
No rush on the rent,

24
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,480
take your time.

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,150
Look, once you're up here,

26
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,430
the bathroom's right over there.

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,110
This spot, honestly,

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,730
is a bit

29
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,930
crowded.

30
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,950
But let me tell you,

31
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,000
once it's cleaned up,

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,510
the space is actually pretty big.

33
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,670
Have a seat.

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,390
Before you came,

35
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,350
I did a little decorating in here.

36
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,730
I thought, since you just got out,

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,860
maybe this would bring you luck.

38
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,860
Can you hold this for me?

39
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,060
Thanks a lot.

40
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,420
No, I should thank you.

41
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,860
You've done so much for me.

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,140
I believe our connection runs deep.

43
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,860
Come on, stand up.

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,380
Om Namah Shivaya!

45
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,500
It's quite romantic, like a wedding.

46
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,540
Say the blessing for good luck.

47
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,060
Om Namah Shivaya!

48
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,460
Lu Tianchi, your luck is changing!

49
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,460
Om Namah Shivaya!

50
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,540
Drink this.

51
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,620
It's a lucky beginning.

52
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,490
Lu Tianchi, listen,

53
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,780
on this bedsheet cover,

54
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,220
my name is stitched on it.

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,150
You can't use Uncle Lin's

56
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,220
washing machine to wash it.

57
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,780
It might ruin it.

58
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,980
Lu Tianchi,

59
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,140
during those two years inside,

60
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,580
did you ever think of me?

61
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,780
Tell me, is this love?

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
If it isn't,

63
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,260
then why?

64
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,860
You don't have much money.

65
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,580
And...

66
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,340
you're always scruffy like this.

67
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,780
Yet I kept thinking of you.

68
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,900
No one has ever

69
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,980
protected me like you did.

70
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,540
Will you always protect me?

71
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,700
=Episode 10=

72
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,780
This is the rest of the information

73
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,940
about Jiang Fang.

74
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,300
So,

75
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,460
have you decided?

76
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,060
I won't look for her anymore.

77
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,700
Alright, I'm heading out.

78
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,420
Wait a second.

79
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,140
Your mouth...

80
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,060
Liu Yan!

81
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,060
You went on a date today?

82
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,380
You're wearing my clothes.

83
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,220
No, I didn't.

84
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,070
Honestly, my outfit

85
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,660
looks perfect on our Chef Liu.

86
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,220
I'm just a kitchen helper.

87
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,740
No, her usual style

88
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,780
actually looks nice too.

89
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,020
Did you two just get back?

90
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,100
Or are you heading out?

91
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,720
We just finished checking the agreement.

92
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,420
This commission's been dragging on.

93
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,980
Lu Tianchi's really unreliable.

94
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,100
Listen, I recently met

95
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,980
a very capable lawyer.

96
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,900
I can introduce you.

97
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,460
Don't steal my client, okay?

98
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,380
Those capable lawyers you mentioned,

99
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,520
she can't afford them anyway.

100
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,940
Li Zan!

101
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,500
Where are you going?

102
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,220
Give the siblings a moment.

103
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,780
By the way, I have something for you.

104
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,180
Come over to my place for a bit.

105
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,900
I'm planning to change

106
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
my approach recently.

107
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,820
I'm too tired. Let's talk tomorrow.

108
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,660
Lu Tianchi!

109
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,220
What's up?

110
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,500
Let's set a time for tomorrow.

111
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,540
Whose cake is this for?

112
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,020
I made it for myself.

113
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,700
All cleaned up.

114
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,780
And you toss that dandelion too?

115
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,620
Isn't it like your lifeline?

116
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,900
Sis,

117
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,740
so...

118
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,340
did you find Jiang Fang or not?

119
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,260
I don't want her to come back.

120
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,560
But she's still a person.

121
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,730
I don't want anything bad to happen.

122
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,540
Right?

123
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,220
Li Zan.

124
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,420
Tell me,

125
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,620
how many times can one person

126
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,660
be abandoned by the same person?

127
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,260
What do you mean?

128
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,980
It's nothing.

129
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,900
I just feel like

130
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,100
I have a home,

131
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,660
a brother,

132
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,460
friends, and a job.

133
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,260
That's enough.

134
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,180
But what about Jiang Fang?

135
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,940
I quit.

136
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,940
Lu Tianchi was right.

137
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,540
You shouldn't hold

138
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,060
unrealistic expectations for anyone.

139
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,700
Are you sure about this?

140
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,580
Really not looking?

141
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,820
Not looking.

142
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,660
Sis...

143
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,300
What's wrong?

144
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,860
You don't think I can do it?

145
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,220
That's not it.

146
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,700
You need to wash your hair.

147
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,900
It's so sticky now.

148
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,740
Go away.

149
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,100
(Debt repaid)

150
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,260
(Attorney-Client Engagement Agreement.
Liu Yan)

151
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,180
(Lu Tianchi)
Miss Liu, as of today,

152
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,420
our professional relationship

153
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,500
is formally terminated.

154
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,180
Thank you for your trust all along.

155
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,300
Good night.

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,840
Thanks a lot.

157
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,740
(Liu Yan)

158
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,450
Shuangshuang, where exactly are you?

159
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,940
I've walked around three times.

160
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,820
Antonio's been by the door all along.

161
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,980
Didn't you see him?

162
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,620
Where? I didn't see him.

163
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,460
Shuangshuang, can you come get me?

164
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,820
Liu Yan!

165
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,740
What are you doing? We've been waiting.

166
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,700
What's up?

167
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,340
All good.

168
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,980
Let me help you stretch out.

169
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,580
Almost done.

170
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,300
What are you up to?

171
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,180
Shuangshuang...

172
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,820
Let's go.

173
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,860
Wait.

174
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,980
Where's the photo?

175
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,060
Here it is.

176
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,500
You didn't send it to others, right?

177
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,460
Of course not.

178
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,100
Why did you delete it?

179
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,340
Come on, let's grab a drink.

180
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,540
You should meet more people.

181
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,940
Shuangshuang,
don't be so hard on yourself.

182
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
If your boss treats you badly,

183
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
would you quit?

184
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,500
He pays your salary.

185
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,740
So why quit?

186
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,060
As long as the money's right,

187
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,540
anything can be discussed.

188
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,140
Keep what happened today confidential.

189
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,060
That's not the same thing!

190
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,400
Shuangshuang,

191
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,500
look what kind of bag you gave me.

192
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,060
It can't hold anything.

193
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,140
It's just for looking cute.

194
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,060
You guys, cheer up.

195
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,580
Here's a drink for you. Come on.

196
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,460
Cheers.

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,980
Miss Tang,

198
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,580
I think this is for you.

199
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,740
Thank you.

200
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,700
Oh my god, Antonio.

201
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,700
Is this for me?

202
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,490
Oh my god.

203
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,780
Yes, I do!

204
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,500
Congratulations!

205
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,380
Shuangshuang, what does this mean?

206
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,060
You know this is my business party.

207
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,260
Since we are so much in love,

208
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,300
we should let everyone

209
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,660
witness it.

210
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,580
You feel the same, right?

211
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,820
Thanks, everyone.

212
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,940
I didn't even know
this party was for me.

213
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,340
You don't look that happy.

214
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,260
That's not true.

215
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,540
My friend's getting married.

216
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,340
Why would I be upset about it?

217
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,700
And you are?

218
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,980
He Guangyuan.

219
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,820
Hello,

220
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,140
I'm Liu Yan.

221
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,660
You might know my mom.

222
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,600
Row 5, No. 166 of Holy Spirit Cemetery.

223
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,860
What kind of awful place is this?

224
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,700
This...

225
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,100
You don't belong here.

226
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,300
Don't touch me!

227
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,540
I said. Don't touch me!

228
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,820
I'm sorry.

229
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,860
I'm really sorry.

230
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,420
I had just arrived back then.

231
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,100
I... was deceived.

232
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,740
The match at the Dahuanglou,

233
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,620
I was there too.

234
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,260
Jaya is so small.

235
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,740
I've seen your late mother before.

236
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,860
You almost witnessed my death.

237
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,260
So, roughly speaking,

238
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,420
we've shared near-death twice.

239
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
Are you hungry?

240
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,020
Me?

241
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,860
I'm not hungry.

242
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,260
I wanted to cook you something.

243
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,820
Sort of as an apology.

244
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,380
Kuchisabishii.

245
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,140
What does that mean?

246
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,380
My English isn't great.

247
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,700
It means not really hungry,

248
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,780
but still wants to eat.

249
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,620
Basically, peckish.

250
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,060
I'll make you something now.

251
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,620
Thank you.

252
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,300
(Highland Restaurant)

253
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,700
Hello, let me introduce

254
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,920
this appetizer to you.

255
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,220
The base is a tart shell.

256
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,860
You can eat it by hand.

257
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,480
Inside is tuna tartare.

258
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,310
On top are caviar and finger limes.

259
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,100
The champagne we've paired for you

260
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,370
is Champagne Marguet.

261
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,990
Let me pour you a taste.

262
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,260
It's the first winery in this region

263
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,660
to practice biodynamic methods.

264
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,740
It's made

265
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,780
from 100% Pinot Noir.

266
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,880
Here is pan-seared snapper.

267
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,020
Served with squid ink

268
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,340
and a Riesling sauce.

269
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,740
Next is pan-seared Wagyu tenderloin.

270
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,130
Served with buttered mashed potatoes

271
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,940
and morel mushrooms.

272
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,620
Stuffed inside is chicken mousse.

273
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,500
The wine pairing

274
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,420
is from Burgundy.

275
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,970
In 2019, from
Earl Bertrand Machard de Gramont,

276
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,780
the village of

277
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,660
Nuits-Saint-Georges region.

278
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,940
Hi, Kang Qiaoli.

279
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,700
Hello, Mr. He.

280
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,940
This is the Armandi chocolate mousse.

281
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,580
It's our classic dessert.

282
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,940
Du.

283
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,180
This wine is a Malmsey Madeira

284
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,040
from Columbus.

285
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,260
Known as the "immortal wine".

286
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,640
Kang Qiaoli,

287
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,180
we've upgraded this wine

288
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,740
from five years to ten years aged.

289
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,140
So, paired with this dessert,

290
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,580
the flavors will be more balanced.

291
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,980
What do you think?

292
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,420
Very good.

293
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,460
It has the flavor

294
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,900
of your mother, Mrs. He,

295
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,940
when she used to run things.

296
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,220
My mom cared very much

297
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,540
about your opinion on the dishes.

298
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,300
We hope you'll be satisfied.

299
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,580
Rest assured.

300
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,340
You've replicated

301
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,060
your mom's unique taste perfectly.

302
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,420
But I'm not sure

303
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,500
if that's good for you or not.

304
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,060
Because it might make you

305
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,140
afraid to discover

306
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,260
your own sense of taste.

307
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,380
Very special.

308
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,660
You covered it

309
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,580
to enrich the flavors, right?

310
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,060
Yeah.

311
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,380
Mr. He, do you know about cooking?

312
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,900
I just really love it.

313
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,300
Loving it matters most.

314
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,740
My mom always says,

315
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,660
"When you enjoy cooking,

316
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,620
your mood improves.

317
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,860
A good mood makes food taste better."

318
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,900
We need to renegotiate

319
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,380
the rental contract.

320
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,260
If you pass the interview,

321
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,060
the rent only goes up 5%.

322
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,540
Interview?

323
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,300
Has no one from Highland called you?

324
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,700
Highland?

325
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,540
Yeah.

326
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,340
Highland Group is Jaya's

327
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,100
top hotel group.

328
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,820
Its restaurants always win diamonds.

329
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,020
Diamond-rated restaurants?

330
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,420
- Yeah.
- Such a fancy place,

331
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,900
would they hire me?

332
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,820
Wait, last night,

333
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,180
do you remember He Guangyuan?

334
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,460
That guy with the shaved head.

335
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,500
He Guangyuan calls the shots on this?

336
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,300
Of course, he owns Highland Restaurant.

337
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,580
Anyway, he told me,

338
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,900
"Your friend

339
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,180
really has a knack for cooking

340
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,340
and lots of creativity with food."

341
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,620
I immediately

342
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,340
recommended you.

343
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,860
Seriously, I couldn't praise you more.

344
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,100
He said

345
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,980
he'd set up an interview at Highland.

346
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,980
About my rent,

347
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,460
it only goes up 5%.

348
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,580
Pretty generous, right?

349
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
With your future salary,

350
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,740
you'll more

351
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,940
than cover it.

352
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,980
Haven't you paid off your debts?

353
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
You can handle this.

354
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,340
I'll do your hair and makeup for free.

355
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,180
Consider it a gift.

356
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,440
It's win-win for us.

357
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,380
(Highland Restaurant)

358
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,540
Highland...

359
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,900
Hello,

360
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,860
Miss Liu.

361
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,380
I'm the manager at Highland Restaurant.

362
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,220
My surname is Lin.

363
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,420
Hello.

364
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,420
Come with me.

365
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,180
Head Chef,

366
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,480
the one's here for the interview.

367
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,260
What exactly are you making here?

368
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,580
Serve the dishes.

369
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,140
Hello.

370
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,580
Go back.

371
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,020
How much longer?

372
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,500
It'll take five more minutes.

373
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,660
How long for the oysters?

374
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,140
Oysters need five more minutes, too.

375
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,020
Ten minutes in total?

376
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,660
Five minutes in total.

377
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,500
Hurry up, come on!

378
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,380
Yes, Chef!

379
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,340
Beef, coming up now.

380
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,180
Move faster!

381
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,900
What is this mess?

382
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,190
Do it again.

383
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,100
Yes, Chef.

384
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,940
Where did you work before?

385
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,860
I haven't worked in a restaurant.

386
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,140
I'm here for the interview.

387
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,980
I trust Mr. He's judgment.

388
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,100
What can you do?

389
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,580
I can cook.

390
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,580
Impressive.

391
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,300
Finally, someone who can cook.

392
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,620
Come with me.

393
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,400
This is Head Chef Philip.

394
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,020
(Head Chef, Philip)
You've met him.

395
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
His skills are famous

396
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,890
among chefs worldwide.

397
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,220
Over there, that's Kanta
in charge of sauces.

398
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,700
(Sauces, Kanta)
He's been at Highland the longest.

399
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,020
He's the most experienced here.

400
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,120
(Hot Dishes, Curly)
This is Curly, who does hot dishes.

401
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,460
Curly.

402
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,580
Curly?

403
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,340
Curly.

404
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,200
(Appetizers, Matsuo)
Matsuo, from Japan.

405
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,660
His Chinese isn't very good.

406
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,200
He works with Jing.

407
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,830
(Snacks, Jing)
They handle appetizers and snacks.

408
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,580
(Pastry, Wang Daxiang)
Wang Daxiang, our Pastry Chef.

409
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,580
He's won a lot of awards.

410
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,500
Wang Daxiang.

411
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,420
In the front, that's the quiet one.

412
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,400
He's a guy from China Taiwan.

413
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,740
(Sommelier, Du)
That's our Sommelier Du.

414
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,340
Our restaurant's goal this year

415
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,460
is to win Three Diamonds.

416
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,940
The pressure's intense.

417
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,460
The restaurant opens at 11 AM

418
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,740
and closes around 2 AM.

419
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,340
Overtime's pretty much guaranteed.

420
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,800
Once you're in a fine dining kitchen,

421
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,820
you're basically saying goodbye

422
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,940
to any normal life.

423
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,380
Got it?

424
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,580
Start by washing dishes with Ping.

425
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,620
Starting today?

426
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,220
I thought today was just the interview.

427
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,020
I haven't quit my last job yet.

428
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,940
So why are you here?

429
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,740
There's the back door. Take care.

430
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,180
That's not what I meant.

431
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,060
I'll do it.

432
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,180
I'm on it.

433
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,780
Start by washing these up.

434
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,620
Alright.

435
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,720
Curly, are you alright?

436
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,590
Curly!

437
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,160
What are you doing?

438
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,100
Matsuo, grab this side.

439
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,760
Are you okay?

440
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,680
Backstage service, stand by.

441
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,820
Yes, Chef.

442
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,780
Jing.

443
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,620
Yes, Chef.

444
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,380
Dishwashers can't touch ingredients.

445
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,260
That's the rule.

446
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,420
Clean up the floor.

447
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,260
Okay.

448
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,060
Hurry up!

449
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,540
Yes, Chef!

450
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,860
(If you have time to lean)
♪I'm just a fool♪

451
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:55,060
(You have time to clean)
♪Silently gazing at you♪

452
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,500
♪I'm just a fool♪

453
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,780
Hello, everyone.

454
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,750
Curly, feeling better?

455
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,740
I mixed some sugar water.

456
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,580
Have a sip.

457
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,620
I just took some nitroglycerin.

458
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm feeling better now.

459
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,180
I feel he's not out of danger yet.

460
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,620
A glass of sugar water won't cut it.

461
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,420
Should we tell Head Chef?

462
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,780
You should head to the hospital.

463
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,940
We can't waste any time here.

464
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,580
Curly, quit pretending.

465
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,100
If you're faking, just move aside.

466
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,740
You almost dropped my pastry molds.

467
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,700
Relax, I know what I'm doing.

468
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,100
Didn't you see when I came out,

469
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,500
I didn't even walk your way?

470
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
So you were faking, right?

471
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,500
You really had me scared there.

472
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,980
I thought working at a fine restaurant
would be that stressful.

473
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,820
Hello,

474
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,580
I'm Wang Daxiang, from Jilin.

475
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,820
Highland Restaurant's Head Pastry Chef.

476
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,020
Hello.

477
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,740
Head Pastry Chef?

478
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,380
He's the only one in pastry.

479
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,220
So what?

480
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,820
Everyone calls me Curly.

481
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,940
You can probably tell why.

482
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,820
Curly...

483
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,660
And this guy?

484
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,580
Jing.

485
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,500
He might look quiet,

486
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,780
but his life is pretty wild.

487
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,780
Except for Antarctica,

488
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,480
he's cooked everywhere.

489
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,540
No, not everywhere.

490
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,500
Mainly in Europe,

491
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,340
and also in South America.

492
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,210
Places like Africa,

493
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,380
I wouldn't go there.

494
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,460
So, where are you from?

495
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,500
I'm from Beijing.

496
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,380
Which culinary school?

497
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,020
Not a professional
cooking school graduate.

498
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,180
Then, which restaurant are you from?

499
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,540
I've never worked in a restaurant.

500
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,300
Rookie.

501
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,340
Still, that's impressive.

502
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,850
You've got some strong connections.

503
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,660
Just stick with Ping.

504
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,580
Do your best, okay?

505
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
He's been waiting a long time
for a successor.

506
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,620
Yeah, I'll give it my all.

507
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,460
I'll do my best.

508
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,660
Thanks for your hard work.

509
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,700
Senior,

510
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,100
are you feeling better now?

511
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,980
- He...
- My health?

512
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,570
I'm alright.

513
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,300
I took a break and feel better.

514
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,540
Just tired from cleaning fish earlier.

515
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,380
Hello,

516
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,100
I'm Matsuo.

517
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,420
I'm from Osaka, Japan.

518
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,500
Nice to meet you.

519
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

520
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,620
- I'm Liu Yan, from Beijing.
- Liu Yan...

521
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,340
Kanta.

522
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,420
Off work?

523
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,660
Is the cleaning done?

524
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,800
Keep cleaning.

525
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,820
Did you prepare the food?

526
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,340
Did you place the orders?

527
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,780
Curly,

528
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,540
did you slip up earlier,

529
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,020
then you pretended to be sick?

530
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,980
I'll get back to work.

531
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
I'll scrub the floor properly.

532
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,100
Hello, Kanta.

533
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,180
Manager introduced me just now.

534
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,100
Hope you'll teach me more from now on.

535
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,220
I only teach chefs here,

536
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,540
not dishwashers in heels.

537
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,820
Work hard.

538
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,940
(If you have time to lean)

539
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,420
(You have time to clean)

540
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,700
The dishes are as usual.

541
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,940
Mediocre and uninspired.

542
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
Every dish seems complete,

543
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
but there's no

544
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,780
human warmth.

545
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,220
Dishes lack

546
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,340
logical progression.

547
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,300
The wine list

548
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,540
is picked right,

549
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,900
but paired with the food,

550
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
it doesn't elevate the meal.

551
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,060
Dessert

552
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,780
tastes fine,

553
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,780
but it's too conservative.

554
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,980
We have declined

555
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,700
since

556
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,260
Mrs. He left.

557
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,140
That's how the magazine sees us.

558
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,580
Today marks Highland's 784th day

559
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,180
without diamonds.

560
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,380
There are only

561
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,500
40,000 restaurants in Jaya.

562
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,980
17 earned diamonds last year.

563
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,580
But Highland wasn't one of them.

564
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,380
If we don't win diamonds this year,

565
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,380
all of you

566
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,220
will be heading home together.

567
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,100
Get ready.

568
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,820
Let's get started.

569
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,940
Welcome to Highland.

570
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
Let me give it a shot.

571
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,540
At Highland, there are no trials.

572
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,420
If you want to try,

573
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,260
maybe pick another place.

574
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,900
I'm here to earn the diamonds!

575
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,260
What exactly

576
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,700
does this mirror mean?

577
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,700
This is my unique invention.

578
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,740
With this mirror,

579
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,100
I can see each one of them

580
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,260
while I work,

581
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,540
observing how they do their jobs.

582
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,020
In that way, I can work

583
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,100
and learn at the same time.

584
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,860
During work hours, I watch more.

585
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,940
After going home, I practice more.

586
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,100
I don't want to wash dishes forever.

587
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,460
Manager Lin said

588
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,500
that working in a fine dining kitchen

589
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,380
means giving up a normal life,

590
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,140
but she doesn't know me.

591
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,020
I've grown up

592
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,980
without ever having

593
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,260
a normal life anyway.

594
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,100
Wow, this stinks so much.

595
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,900
What's that awful smell?

596
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,500
Chef!

597
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,180
It's coming from here.

598
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,980
I saw the chefs

599
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,500
chop piles of onions every day.

600
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,620
So I practiced at home.

601
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,580
Onions need

602
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,980
to be diced or sliced, not mixed up.

603
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,540
These sizes

604
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,380
don't work.

605
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,140
Learn to wash dishes first,

606
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,580
then think about prepping food.

607
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,060
Life in Highland's kitchen

608
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,380
is a lot like sports school.

609
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,460
Every day it's the same.

610
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,180
Work, wash dishes, and train.

611
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,700
Nothing else to worry about.

612
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,860
Diced onions must be even.

613
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,500
Asparagus trimmed just right,

614
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,180
no more than a millimeter off.

615
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,140
Even the time and heat for boiling eggs

616
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,840
have precise
second-by-second requirements.

617
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,100
Jiang Fang never

618
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,100
taught me these things.

619
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,780
But come on,

620
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,220
I'm the head Chef's daughter.

621
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,220
I can't wash dishes forever.

622
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,420
From now on, it's all on you, Liu Yan!

623
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,780
Keep it up!

624
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,260
(5 minutes, 8 minutes)

625
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,060
(58℃, Sous Vide)

626
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,860
Liu Yan,

627
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,600
why are you here this late every day?

628
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,740
You're always working so hard.

629
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,500
My kitchen at home is a mess.

630
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,700
Only here can I
learn all the ingredients.

631
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,780
It wasn't easy getting this job
at Highland.

632
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,260
I don't want to wash dishes every day.

633
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
Just look at this room.

634
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,330
Look at Ping,

635
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,340
he's been stuck here for years.

636
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,620
Head Chef.

637
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,540
Head Chef, I'm sorry.

638
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,170
I brought these ingredients from home.

639
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,700
I didn't touch anything in the kitchen.

640
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,660
My home doesn't have
a sous-vide machine,

641
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,020
so I brought eggs here

642
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,980
to experiment.

643
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,850
I've also taken some notes recently.

644
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,620
Next time,

645
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,700
maybe try 60 ℃ to 64 ℃

646
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,100
because it looks better.

647
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,940
Starting tomorrow,

648
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,260
leave the dishwashing room

649
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,180
and prep ingredients instead.

650
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,460
Yes, Chef!

651
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,660
Right here.

652
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,440
Liu Yan,

653
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,890
guess you have some real connections.

654
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,650
I didn't expect it this soon.

655
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,830
Ping's probably going to cry again.

656
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,420
Mr. He.

657
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,380
Li Zan,

658
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,900
eat before you go.

659
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,740
What breakfast?

660
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,380
Minced onion sandwich.

661
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,340
Please, no more onions.

662
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,380
- Just eat.
- Spare me, please.

663
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,260
Have a little.

664
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,700
Hi.

665
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,620
Hi.

666
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,900
Why does it smell so good again?

667
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,540
You're drunk?

668
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,940
I'm starving.

669
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,940
Sit down and eat some.

670
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,660
Such delicious food.

671
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,900
Li Zan doesn't get it.

672
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,820
(5 minutes)

673
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,780
I'm so hungry.

674
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,940
I'll slice you some.

675
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,580
A girl who can cook

676
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,180
is really likable.

677
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,260
Drunk?

678
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,100
No, I haven't.

679
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,580
Come on, you totally have.

680
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,860
You're talking nonsense now.

681
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,700
Go on, eat up.

682
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,260
Stop messing around.

683
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,100
See? Highland chefs are different.

684
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,900
Delicious?

685
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,420
Shuangshuang,

686
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,060
you're acting different today.

687
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,580
We've known each other so long.

688
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,900
You always nag

689
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,340
about not eating carbs,

690
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,700
but you seem to love them now.

691
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,260
That was for work before.

692
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,700
Now I'm out of a job!

693
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,540
So I don't have to care anymore.

694
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,180
You're out of work?

695
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,060
Antonio, that jerk.

696
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,500
He dumped me.

697
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,060
He said I was getting boring

698
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,620
and less exciting now.

699
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,340
Shuangshuang, hey.

700
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,020
That's actually a good thing.

701
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,190
Really, it's for the best.

702
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,620
If you stayed with that jerk forever,

703
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,580
you'd be miserable.

704
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,460
No way, before this,

705
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,020
I was always the one leaving others.

706
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,820
I've never been dumped before.

707
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,780
Luckily, I'm smart enough.

708
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,020
How are you smart?

709
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,980
Antonio

710
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,300
wanted to take back

711
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,580
everything he gave me.

712
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,560
Shu, Xu,

713
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,780
and Lu

714
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,060
helped me get quite a bit back.

715
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,140
Are you okay?

716
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,620
How are you doing?

717
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,460
Nothing much.

718
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,820
Let me tell you, men like Lu

719
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,020
are just naive idealists.

720
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,860
Most importantly,

721
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,340
you're working at Highland now.

722
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,940
There are tons

723
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,600
of high-quality resources,

724
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,680
especially among the guests.

725
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,140
You must pay close attention,

726
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,020
seriously.

727
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,580
Why are your hands so cold?

728
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,780
Warm them up.

729
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,460
Why are you back?

730
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,980
What are you talking about?

731
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,620
Nothing.

732
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,180
Why aren't you at school?

733
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,860
I forgot something.

734
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,700
(Lam Kee Herbal Tea, Grocery)

735
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,900
Lu Tianchi,

736
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,700
are you seeing her now?

737
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,580
What?

738
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,420
Turn it off.

739
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,270
Why?

740
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,300
Take a sip.

741
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,380
No, I feel sick.

742
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,460
What are you doing?

743
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,780
Just one sip, come on.

744
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,260
No, I'm done. I quit.

745
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,260
Seriously, I quit.

746
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,420
Why her?

747
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,780
None of the others

748
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,980
have any problems with you.

749
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,100
So why her?

750
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,860
It's got nothing to do with others.

751
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,730
Alright?

752
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,300
Just let this go, okay?

753
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,180
You're serious about this.

754
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,940
Liar.

755
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,940
We've been through so much together.

756
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,900
How could you

757
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,460
take someone else seriously?

758
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,700
Really, drink less.

759
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,940
If you keep drinking like this,

760
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,860
your brain will rot.

761
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,700
Let's not make a scene, alright?

762
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,420
I like you.

763
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,940
You know that.

764
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,420
I've always liked you.

765
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,980
Come on, Tang Shuangshuang.

766
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,300
Please drink less.

767
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,140
Come here.

768
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,220
Wow,

769
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,340
look at the state you're in.

770
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,880
With everything you've got,

771
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,780
I bet your admirers could form

772
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,980
a line out the door.

773
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,820
Right?

774
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,100
You don't have to come here

775
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,540
and show off every time you break up.

776
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,380
What are you doing?

777
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,740
Does she know you went to jail for me?

778
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,360
Are you worried she'll get jealous?

779
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,020
Or are you scared she'll judge you...?

780
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,420
Alright, stop drinking.

781
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,820
Come on.

782
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,580
About going to jail,

783
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,460
it's because I genuinely wanted

784
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,420
your case

785
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,580
to have a fair

786
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,260
and just outcome.

787
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,660
Of course, I made mistakes too.

788
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,020
So I got

789
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,340
the punishment I deserved.

790
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,200
But you're still my client now, right?

791
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,220
I have to protect your privacy.

792
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,100
I won't tell anyone

793
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,220
about this.

794
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,060
If you say you two are friends,

795
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,900
you should tell her.

796
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,750
I...

797
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,220
I can't control your choices,

798
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,060
right?

799
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,780
Let me call you a ride.

800
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,740
Okay, I'll head out soon.

801
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,140
I'll leave in a bit.

802
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,610
Lu Tianchi,

803
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,780
do you think

804
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,220
parallel worlds exist?

805
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,240
Where I haven't lived through all that,

806
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,500
and you never went to jail for me.

807
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,780
Where we got married instead

808
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,740
and had a good friend named Liu Yan.

809
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,380
Still here this late?

810
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,140
Head Chef said my eggs aren't great.

811
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,550
The heat control was acceptable,

812
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,700
but he dislikes

813
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,900
you wasting ingredients.

814
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,500
I can't do boxing.

815
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,500
But the kitchen feels a lot
like the boxing ring.

816
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,500
Taking hits is part of the journey.

817
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,780
That's true.

818
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,300
Mr. He,

819
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,780
this magazine says

820
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,420
Highland used to have Two Diamonds.

821
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,660
Past gold medals

822
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,180
don't guarantee the next win.

823
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,220
Yeah, but I think

824
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,100
we should analyze

825
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,300
why we won before

826
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,220
developing new strategies.

827
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,420
I've been watching...

828
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,460
Did you try anything?

829
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,500
The first day working at Highland,

830
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,940
you said you wanted to "try".

831
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,940
I just wanted to test

832
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,800
whether I really could

833
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,900
work as a chef
in a fine dining restaurant like this.

834
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,700
I wanted to try

835
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,100
to see if my life had another path.

836
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,740
Unless you become indispensable,

837
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,900
it's tough to stay at Highland.

838
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,300
How skilled must one be
to be indispensable?

839
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,060
You've got great taste.

840
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,220
I like her too.

841
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,660
You and she are among the few

842
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,580
who make me feel safe.

843
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,820
You two are actually alike.

844
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,740
You both really care

845
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,820
about your own world,

846
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,180
even when the world feels harsh.

847
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,580
Whereas I despise this world.

848
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,700
Liu Yan seems like a failure, too.

849
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,940
Her mom left her behind,

850
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,660
and even her job was through me.

851
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,620
But every time, she bounces back.

852
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,500
That's why you like her, right?

853
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,620
Hope you two stay happy!

854
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,060
Hope you're still here
when Highland gets Three Diamonds.

855
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,140
I'll be here, Mr. He!

856
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,700
Don't bring outside ingredients
to Highland.

857
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,780
I'll tell Chef

858
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,260
to use Highland's ingredients.

859
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,580
Thank you, Mr. He.

860
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,180
