=Episode 15=

16
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,610
How have you two been lately?

17
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,860
I talked with Liu Yan

18
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,780
and told her

19
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,860
all about your selfless

20
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,300
good deeds.

21
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,250
I've talked you up so much.

22
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,380
It's almost making me fall in love again.

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,500
Did you see the photo?

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,860
Her face was as red as a little peach.

25
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,660
Can you stop talking about her?

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,580
Anyway, I probably

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,380
won't see her much anymore.

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,620
What's going on with you?

29
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,130
Her contract's about to end.

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,410
Once it ends,

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,970
I won't see her again.

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,250
What's wrong with you?

33
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,250
Why suddenly act like a professional?

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,100
You're crazy.

35
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,900
I came to remind you.

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,500
Liu Yan isn't a dishwasher

37
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,060
at Highland anymore.

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,610
There are so many rich, handsome guys

39
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,700
in that restaurant.

40
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,970
If you don't try harder,

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,130
she'll slip
right from under your nose again.

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,380
I've drafted a prenup for you.

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,500
You haven't known

44
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,660
Pierre long,

45
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,010
and he's already proposed?

46
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,940
He hasn't proposed.

47
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,500
But I need one anyway.

48
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,250
Wait, we're talking about you.

49
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,940
What's going on with you?

50
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,380
I'm fine.

51
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,010
Just not a good match.

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,690
Stop the vague talk.

53
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,810
Give me the real reason.

54
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,660
The real reason

55
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,570
is that she's too short.

56
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,560
Put some thought into it.

57
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,410
I'm nine years older than she is.

58
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,570
She's still young.

59
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,500
Second, she's officially

60
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,530
a chef now.

61
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,340
That means she has a bright future.

62
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,900
You know this is where I work.

63
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,380
This is something my coworkers and I

64
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,850
prepared with great care.

65
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,300
Maybe you just can't tell

66
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,420
when someone puts in effort.

67
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,180
I am

68
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,940
dirt poor,

69
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,600
with only a criminal record.

70
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,250
Third, although she's back,

71
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,570
she's still saying on and off

72
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,530
that she wants

73
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,900
to bring Li Zan

74
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,130
back to Beijing.

75
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,880
You're still going to take me

76
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,950
to Beijing, right?

77
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,090
Of course.

78
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,380
This isn't just liking her anymore.

79
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,810
You're in love.

80
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,410
My heart aches.

81
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,220
Enough joking.

82
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,900
I won't joke anymore.

83
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,900
Let's be serious.

84
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,580
Based on my sensitivity,

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,700
He Guangyuan at Highland

86
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,610
has definitely set his sights
on Liu Yan.

87
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,930
Don't be foolish or fake generous,

88
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,340
or you'll regret it.

89
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,020
(Cough relief tea,
liver protection tea, cooling tea)

90
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,010
It's delicious.

91
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,980
Really?

92
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,660
That's my secret.

93
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,490
I'm a junior chef now.

94
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,660
Congrats.

95
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,500
Thanks.

96
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,970
You didn't come

97
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,220
just to let me eat this, right?

98
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,580
I checked the footage.

99
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,870
You got hurt, right?

100
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,490
Did it leave a scar?

101
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,140
Did you name it?

102
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,970
I'm not into that.

103
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,500
Once the scab falls off, it'll be fine.

104
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,980
Oh, Liu Yan.

105
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,490
This is for you.

106
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,530
Another supplementary contract?

107
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,370
A notice letter.

108
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,620
The previous

109
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,900
service agreement

110
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,970
has basically been fulfilled,

111
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,850
so the legal relationship between us

112
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,900
is now officially over.

113
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,930
This is just a notice.

114
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,850
By procedure, it should be handed

115
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,620
to the client.

116
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,060
Lu Tianchi,

117
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,850
I'm not mad anymore.

118
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,500
Look.

119
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,660
You broke the rule by drinking,

120
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,100
and I broke it by fighting

121
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,220
after I came back.

122
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,820
We're even now.

123
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,050
Beijing specialty.

124
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,980
One sip to wash away bitterness.

125
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,580
I've really quit drinking this time.

126
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,100
I hit Philip

127
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,050
not because of you.

128
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,850
I just couldn't stand his cooking.

129
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,410
You're just trying to mess with me, huh?

130
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,900
I sincerely wish you well.

131
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,460
I hope everything goes great
for you at Highland.

132
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,140
I hope things keep getting better

133
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,290
for you in Jaya.

134
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,420
Our contract is up,

135
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,410
right?

136
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,620
Fine.

137
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,100
I'd better do the math carefully.

138
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,780
Don't try to fool me.

139
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,770
Take it.

140
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,030
Stop it if you can't stand it.

141
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,200
I'll see you after work.

142
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,500
(4 hours later)

143
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,660
Did you calculate that right?

144
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,500
Lu Tianchi.

145
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,970
You left my brother and me
on the roadside that day,

146
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,170
saying you were off work.

147
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,930
- I'm off work.
- You...

148
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,770
Where are you going?

149
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,740
You decide.

150
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
This isn't right either.

151
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,490
The day we signed the supplement,

152
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,720
you said you'd drive me home,

153
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,080
and that was part of the service,

154
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,470
so it shouldn't be charged, right?

155
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,230
Your service includes
taking me home, right?

156
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,850
Of course.

157
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,660
And these ones here.

158
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,820
You're counting my cooking
as working hours?

159
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,260
Unbelievable.

160
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,660
I made the egg custard.

161
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,460
I taught you how to make it.

162
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,460
So, Mr. Lu,

163
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,730
you still owe me

164
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,340
6 hours and 18 minutes

165
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,420
of service time.

166
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,690
Alright.

167
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,650
We're clear now.

168
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,320
Mr. Lu, thanks for your hard work.

169
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,300
Watch carefully.

170
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,890
6 hours and 18 minutes.

171
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,490
That's 378 minutes in total.

172
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,340
Alright, countdown starts now.

173
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,340
Are you crazy?

174
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,770
Did someone put a curse on you?

175
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,180
I won't lose out again.

176
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,370
I'm going to record

177
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,370
every minute left on the contract.

178
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,220
Since when did I ever let you lose?

179
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,490
What now?

180
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,100
Yesterday, I asked Mr. He

181
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,460
how to become a good chef.

182
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,220
He flat-out said there's no chance.

183
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,700
To hell with him.
He's the one with no chance.

184
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,820
Why believe him?

185
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,850
Before, I cooked for hungry people.

186
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,890
Now, I have to learn

187
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,520
how to cook for people
who aren't hungry.

188
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,060
Are you speaking human language?

189
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,580
I knew someone put a curse on you.

190
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,860
You're going to watch a concert,

191
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,720
not attend some ritual.

192
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,690
You say that

193
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,970
because you don't understand art.

194
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,610
It's called listening to a concert,
okay?

195
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,180
Who watches a concert?

196
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,220
Still, you do look good.

197
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,580
The slit on that dress is way too high.

198
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,890
I'm driving.

199
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,770
Stop wasting
your client's precious time.

200
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,420
Okay.

201
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,140
Still playing?

202
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
You probably slept for 15 minutes.

203
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,970
What does that have to do with cooking?

204
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,690
What does it have to do with it?

205
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,650
Mr. He said it matters.

206
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,100
And you believe him?

207
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,580
He said if I want to stay at Highland,

208
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,820
I have to understand Highland.

209
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,440
They play this kind of music

210
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,580
at Highland every day, okay?

211
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,660
Liu Yan.

212
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,450
Mr. He.

213
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,370
Do you also like Bach's solo pieces?

214
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,850
I...

215
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,730
I'm here to learn.

216
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,580
You are here today.

217
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,010
How does it feel?

218
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,380
Honestly,

219
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,850
I was mostly sleeping.

220
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,370
I couldn't understand.

221
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,490
Actually, music and food

222
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,770
are very similar.

223
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,340
A great musician

224
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,250
is just like a great chef.

225
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,580
Hello, Mr. He.

226
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,650
Hello, Mr. Lu.

227
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,130
Oh, you two know each other.

228
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,820
Mr. He, iced Americano.

229
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,780
Here you go.

230
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,770
Thanks, thanks.

231
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,820
I just happened to feel sleepy.

232
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,890
I charge by the hour today.

233
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,820
So, please respect

234
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,660
our contract,

235
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,180
and stop chatting here, okay?

236
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,300
I decide how to use the time

237
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,010
in our contract, right?

238
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,070
I think I've enjoyed enough

239
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,010
of your service time today.

240
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,940
You can go now.

241
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,650
Just now,
Mr. He was talking to me about Bach.

242
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,490
I think

243
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,370
I need to study more.

244
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,340
The seventh row

245
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,420
is the best seat at a live concert.

246
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,730
I still have some seats left.

247
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,830
You two can come together.

248
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,820
- Thanks.
- You can't understand it.

249
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,660
You can go back now.

250
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,010
Thanks for the coffee.

251
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,420
This is a good seat.

252
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,940
Is there an empty seat here?

253
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,490
Please sit.

254
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,850
Thanks.

255
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,780
I'll sit there.

256
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,370
Didn't I tell you?

257
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,180
The contract time is over today.

258
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,850
This is free.

259
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,070
You haven't left?

260
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,900
Here you go.

261
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,700
Impressive, impressive.

262
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,020
I don't have more.

263
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,320
This is last week's wages in advance.

264
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,160
What a loyal friend from the north.

265
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,370
What illness did you say your mom has?

266
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,250
Diabetes.

267
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,680
Last time you said it was heart disease.

268
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,460
My mom has diabetes,

269
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,580
which caused complications.

270
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,330
Bye-bye.

271
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,060
Wang Daxiang, do you gamble?

272
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,140
I admit it.

273
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,820
I used to gamble a long time ago.

274
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,180
But I quit now.

275
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,220
You can't deny someone

276
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,420
a chance to change, right?

277
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,720
Quit?

278
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,220
I've never seen anyone actually quit.

279
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,490
Of course, you can quit.

280
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,550
If there's something
more important than gambling,

281
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,460
you can quit.

282
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,370
People gamble because they're empty,
bored, and lonely,

283
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,370
looking for excitement.

284
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,850
If you're not empty or bored,

285
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,060
you naturally quit.

286
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,020
Look at me.

287
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,250
When I'm making desserts,

288
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,610
I'm so fulfilled.

289
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,420
Thanks, Liu Yan.

290
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
You're a man.

291
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,650
Why do you always make video calls?

292
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,600
What? Is that a problem?

293
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,560
You're a chef now
and don't want to talk to me?

294
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,690
It's in the middle of the night.

295
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,020
Why still wander the streets?

296
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,580
I had a day off

297
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,850
and went to a concert.

298
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,970
I didn't understand a thing.

299
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,850
How about you?

300
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,260
It was terrible.

301
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,130
Don't ask.

302
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:07,970
You know what?

303
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,850
My mom

304
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,890
rented out your room behind my back.

305
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,770
I was so mad

306
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,180
and had a big fight with her.

307
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,970
You didn't have to do that.

308
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,650
That house belongs to your family.

309
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,100
You don't need to check with me.

310
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,610
I'm just worried

311
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,300
you'd come back
and have nowhere to stay.

312
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,770
No worries.
I'm not going back anytime soon.

313
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,610
I plan to stay at Highland

314
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,730
and learn some cooking skills.

315
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,550
(Salty Resto)

316
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,700
Salty, are you in love?

317
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,180
Is that why you're distancing yourself

318
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,010
from me like others?

319
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,850
Why would I do that?

320
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,850
I've just been busy lately.

321
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,370
Is it that Lu guy?

322
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,180
Can we talk about something else?

323
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,940
Alright, I get it.

324
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,300
So, it must be him.

325
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,650
No doubt about it.

326
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,770
Wait a sec.

327
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,140
Hello?

328
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,690
Yan, where are you?

329
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,650
I switched shifts with Curly.

330
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,140
What's up?

331
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,370
There's a fire in the kitchen.

332
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,020
Who did it?

333
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,780
I didn't have a lighter
or matches on me.

334
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,780
Besides,

335
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,340
I wasn't the last one in.

336
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,210
Security is reviewing

337
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,650
the surveillance tonight.

338
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,210
Once they find out who caused the fire,

339
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,820
they'll be doomed.

340
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,240
Was it you?

341
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,580
Did you go to the storage room?

342
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,750
That's where the fire started.

343
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,820
I wasn't working today.

344
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,260
I'd been in less than ten seconds.

345
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,900
The fish got completely smoked.

346
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,940
Mr. He said it was supposed
to be dried overnight.

347
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,330
Now, it's all turned into jerky.

348
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,060
Nothing can be used.

349
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,020
Where's Wang Daxiang?

350
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,100
Right, it was him.

351
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,650
Wang Daxiang

352
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
was the last

353
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,650
to leave the storage at 3 a.m.

354
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,370
Shortly after he left, the fire started.

355
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,690
I called him,

356
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,680
but there was no answer.

357
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,980
He fled to avoid trouble.

358
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,140
Have they found him?

359
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,770
Call the police.

360
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,260
Have you checked?

361
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,210
How much is the loss?

362
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,170
The workroom needs repainting.

363
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,400
The restaurant is fine.

364
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,240
However,

365
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,250
this batch of fish

366
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,780
is basically destroyed.

367
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,650
Is security not responsible?

368
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,210
Who was on duty last night?

369
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,300
He can't take

370
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,210
all the responsibility alone, right?

371
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,850
If Wang Daxiang loses this job,

372
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,740
his mom will have no one
to take care of her.

373
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,410
Forget it for now.

374
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,260
Aren't we a team?

375
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,780
Things are still unclear.

376
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,060
Why rush to find a scapegoat?

377
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,920
I'm the one who let him rest

378
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,030
in the storage room.

379
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,680
Punish me with him if you want.

380
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,550
If the losses can be recovered,

381
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,790
can we not sue him?

382
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,020
Don't cancel
customer reservations just yet.

383
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,530
A week.

384
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,130
Give me a week.

385
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,780
If you're not satisfied

386
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,880
with my dishes after that,

387
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,020
Wang Daxiang and I will compensate.

388
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,020
If you're really a team.

389
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,820
Thanks, Mr. He.

390
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,020
Even gods can't save it, but you...

391
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,770
Yan,

392
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,340
if you need help,

393
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,340
just tell me.

394
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,890
Thanks, Matsuo.

395
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,500
Only you would trust a gambler

396
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,410
like Wang Daxiang.

397
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,060
His mom's not even sick.

398
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,170
Great.

399
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,880
Now, we're all dragged into this mess.

400
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
I'll take responsibility

401
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,200
for my promise to Mr. He alone.

402
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,850
I won't drag you all down.

403
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,410
Not wasting food is my backup plan.

404
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,950
Not wasting food is my backup plan.

405
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,890
Not wasting food

406
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,340
is my backup plan.

407
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,890
Important things
should be said three times.

408
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,780
I can definitely do this.

409
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,300
I'm back.

410
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,420
Back.

411
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,540
I don't want to be a guinea pig anymore.

412
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,770
- Promise me, okay?
- Sit.

413
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,020
One bite, and that's it, okay?

414
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,780
What is this? So awful.

415
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,980
This is the taste
of premium smoked fish floss.

416
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,610
Try another bite.

417
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,770
Wait a moment.

418
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,450
This kind of chunky,

419
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,500
dried fish

420
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,690
is a bit tough.

421
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,100
Try it again.

422
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,450
You have to chew

423
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,260
this kind of stuff.

424
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,410
You know, the layers of flavor

425
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,740
only come

426
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
through chewing

427
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,450
and mixing with saliva.

428
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,490
How is it?

429
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,820
It actually gets better the more I chew.

430
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,660
Right?

431
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,130
Our storage room caught fire.

432
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,820
Does that have anything

433
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,130
to do with you?

434
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,410
No.

435
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,410
A buddy got into trouble.

436
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,260
I'm helping him out.

437
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,450
You have a buddy at Highland?

438
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,430
Does my brother-in-law know about this?

439
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,620
Get lost.

440
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,550
Can I borrow your phone?

441
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,660
What for?

442
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,130
Just give it to me. Hurry.

443
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,540
Another buddy.

444
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,980
Hello?

445
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,260
You jerk, Wang Daxiang.

446
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,540
Why didn't you answer my calls?

447
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,490
Hello?

448
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,100
Well...

449
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,100
Good buddy, good buddy.

450
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,490
Found him.

451
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,100
This is definitely the nursing home

452
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,410
of your buddy's mom.

453
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,000
I checked his social media.

454
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,370
- This place?
- I'm sure.

455
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,690
Sis, don't just call anyone

456
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,650
your buddy outside.

457
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,780
Don't let anyone fool you.

458
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,260
How much time do I have left

459
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,300
on our contract?

460
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,180
(Zone A, Zone D)

461
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,370
Ms. Li?

462
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,850
Are you Wang Daxiang's mom?

463
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,690
Daxiang?

464
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,690
Ms. Li, hello, I'm Liu Yan.

465
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,100
This is Highland's salted pudding.

466
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,370
I brought you one.

467
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,610
I'm Wang Daxiang's coworker.

468
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,500
I've been trying to contact him,

469
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,810
but no luck.

470
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,170
We've been looking for him for a while.

471
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,170
Do you know...

472
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,660
Daxiang.

473
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,860
Son.

474
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,860
Son, you're here.

475
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,180
Ms. Li,

476
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,170
he's not Wang Daxiang.

477
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,740
Someone's coming to catch you.

478
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,490
Hurry, hurry.

479
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,580
Someone's here to catch you.

480
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,240
Hurry, hurry.

481
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,400
- Ms. Li.
- Someone's here.

482
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,440
Son, my son.

483
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,100
Mr. Lu.

484
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,410
She really can't pay the debts.

485
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,300
Her son's telling everyone

486
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,850
his mom is sick and needs money,

487
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,610
but he gambles it away.

488
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,170
He says he quit gambling.

489
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,010
Quit?

490
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,690
That's not gonna happen.

491
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,850
Wang Daxiang is such a jerk.

492
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,930
He owed me money before.

493
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,160
Now, he's screwed me up again.

494
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,050
He even left his mother here.

495
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,540
What are you trying to do?

496
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,980
You wouldn't understand.

497
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,370
So, your real reason to help him

498
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,340
is that you subconsciously think

499
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,130
you can reform a gambler,

500
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:24,970
right?

501
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,300
What are you talking about?

502
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,650
Don't compare Wang Daxiang
to Jiang Fang.

503
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,130
How can you say that?

504
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,450
Watch your tone

505
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,370
during service.

506
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,060
That was indeed rude.

507
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,900
Sorry.

508
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,270
But I'm an observer.

509
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,210
Observers see clearly.

510
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:46,860
I don't want you

511
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,270
to keep draining yourself over this.

512
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,220
Do you know what I mean?

513
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,890
Tang Shuangshuang was right.

514
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,690
You always

515
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,170
analyze others perfectly,

516
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,580
but have you

517
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,610
analyzed yourself?

518
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,100
I have.

519
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,370
What did you find?

520
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,260
I found

521
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,460
there's only 1 hour and 17 minutes left

522
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,500
in our contract time.

523
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,980
Then stop wasting time talking

524
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,210
about Jiang Fang.

525
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,930
No one can change my mind.

526
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,060
Why not go see

527
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,930
a psychologist?

528
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,210
If you're looking for a doctor,

529
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,340
only on the third floor.

530
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,450
Thank you.

531
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,540
No problem.

532
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,380
See you.

533
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,530
Bye-bye.

534
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,730
What did he say?

535
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,900
Guess.

536
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,050
Fine.

537
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,210
He said if you want a doctor,

538
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,300
go to the third floor.

539
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,060
You should see one.

540
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,850
Aren't you coming back tomorrow?

541
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,650
I missed you so much

542
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,890
and wanted to surprise you.

543
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,980
I missed you.

544
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,950
I missed you too.

545
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,650
This is for you.

546
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,290
What?

547
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,540
Oh, my god.

548
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,780
Are you serious?

549
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,780
Is it pretty? Come.

550
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,620
This...

551
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,690
Oh, my hair.

552
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,780
It's so beautiful.

553
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,650
Do you like it?

554
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,020
I love it so much.

555
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,890
Look, are these flowers on my skirt
also fine?

556
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,730
Looks great.

557
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,370
I plan to wear this

558
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,370
for afternoon tea.

559
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,540
I postponed a meeting

560
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,650
and came back for you.

561
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,580
I arranged it with them beforehand.

562
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,170
Why not come with me?

563
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,880
They all want to meet you.

564
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,300
It's at the café across the street.

565
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,650
We'll come back after tea.

566
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,060
I came back for you,

567
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,100
and you want to go out?

568
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,300
I didn't know you'd come back early.

569
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,390
Come on. Let's go.

570
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,340
Alright, let's go.

571
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,780
We'll be back soon.

572
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,340
Who's more important than me?

573
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,500
Don't make me mad next time,

574
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,340
okay?

575
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,820
I wasn't like this before.

576
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,340
I just love you too much,

577
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,550
so I get out of control easily.

578
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,020
Cause I love you too much.

579
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,340
Do you understand? I love you too much.

580
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,930
Baby, baby, I love you so much.

581
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,020
I really love you.

582
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,930
I'm scared of losing you.

583
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,060
I can't lose you.

584
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,130
Stay with me.
You have to stay with me, okay?

585
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,260
Me too.

586
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,930
Liu Yan, are you awake?

587
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,490
Shuangshuang.

588
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,500
Why are you here?

589
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,650
I smelled something delicious outside.

590
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,820
Really?

591
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,650
You can't eat this.

592
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,020
It's spoiled.

593
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,850
You can't eat it.

594
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,690
Is there other food?

595
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,610
They're all test samples.

596
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,020
I want something sweet.

597
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,100
The kind that makes you happy.

598
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,410
Why not make a cream cake?

599
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,250
Wait.

600
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,260
Aren't you afraid of getting fat?

601
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,540
Happiness makes you fat, you know.

602
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,260
I'm not afraid.

603
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,450
Not anymore.

604
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,370
I want it.

605
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,740
Then I'll give it a try

606
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,370
with some cream in this dish for you.

607
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,890
I'm getting married.

608
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,780
I'm really getting married.

609
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,820
Isn't that a bit big?

610
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,850
You don't understand.

611
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,610
Listen, it was so romantic today.

612
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,980
I'll show you.

613
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,580
This is the street

614
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,130
under my hotel.

615
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,170
We were walking

616
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,410
down there.

617
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,650
Suddenly, he shouted
in the middle of the street,

618
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,370
"Who can sell me a ring?"

619
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,500
Then a man came out and said,

620
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,020
"I can sell you one."

621
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,450
He bought that ring,

622
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,980
then knelt down, and proposed to me.

623
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,450
You know? He looked very handsome.

624
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,260
So many people were watching.

625
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,130
Right there, in front of everyone,

626
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,300
he proposed.

627
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,740
And you said yes?

628
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,180
Wow.

629
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,380
Well.

630
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
It's indeed romantic,

631
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,580
but isn't it a little impulsive

632
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,060
for you to marry him?

633
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,650
No.

634
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,780
With my situation,

635
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,880
how could I possibly marry

636
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,820
someone like Pierre?

637
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,450
I have to thank his impulsiveness.

638
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,260
Why do you say that?

639
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,690
You're amazing.

640
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,300
You're beautiful and smart.

641
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,690
There are lots of smart,

642
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,820
beautiful girls.

643
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,740
But rich, single,

644
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,500
and handsome men aren't common.

645
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,650
This is marriage, after all.

646
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,370
I truly like him.

647
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,450
No.

648
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,170
I love him.

649
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,690
I feel like I'll never have to count

650
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,980
every grain of rice again.

651
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,060
No more worrying or fearing.

652
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,740
Someone can pay

653
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,500
for the long-term hotel room I rent.

654
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,100
Though he can be

655
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,690
a bit emotional sometimes,

656
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,930
he really loves me.

657
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,450
Glad you're happy.

658
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,730
Try this.

659
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,740
I think I finally get

660
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,580
what you meant by saying,

661
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,060
"When you hit rock bottom, eat first."

662
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,340
Are you okay, Shuangshuang?

663
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,020
I'm starving.

664
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,950
You're messing with me again.

665
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,180
How is it?

666
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,850
So good!

667
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,410
I knew it.

668
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,580
The cream worked.

669
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,890
Try it.

670
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,930
Really? That good?

671
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,780
Isn't it amazing?

672
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,140
Really amazing.

673
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,690
So sweet.

674
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,850
Cream really makes it better.

675
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,610
This dish is a winner.

676
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,410
You asked Mr. He to stay so late

677
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,130
just for this?

678
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,980
Sorry, you two.

679
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,130
I was worried I'd be late.

680
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,740
Why don't you taste it first?

681
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,690
If you like it,

682
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,170
I'll bake the fish tomorrow morning.

683
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,690
Why does it smell so bad?

684
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,740
It's not bad.

685
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,340
It's the smoky smell.

686
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,610
I think it's quite unique.

687
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,690
Is this fish floss made
from the smoked fish?

688
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,530
Yeah.

689
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,210
It wasn't just my idea.

690
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,890
Curly and Matsuo helped out.

691
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,820
It's a team effort.

692
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,410
That bamboo shoot

693
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,650
is probably impossible to get in Jaya.

694
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,580
Where did you buy it?

695
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,340
A childhood friend from Beijing

696
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,540
sent it to me.

697
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,820
He bought it from a street vendor.

698
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,180
There's no manufacturer.

699
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,330
Ingredients without a stable supply

700
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,210
for development

701
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,450
are pointless.

702
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,540
Alright, alright.

703
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,740
About the fire,

704
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,170
we'll compensate if needed

705
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,540
and pursue if necessary.

706
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,310
It's not your job to clean up the mess.

707
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,540
Stop causing trouble.

708
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,340
Can you fix

709
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,210
the supply problem in two days?

710
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,930
I want to add this dish

711
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,020
to the new menu.

712
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,220
Yes.

713
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,570
Yes, I can.

714
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Yes, yes!

715
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,380
Thanks, Mr. He.

716
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,650
Thanks, Kanta.

717
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,650
I'm off to prepare.

718
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,210
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

719
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,060
Leave it to me.

720
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,020
She's showing no respect.

721
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,060
This dried bamboo shoot
tastes different from mine,

722
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,610
but with a bit of tweaking,

723
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,540
it's usable.

724
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,960
- Really?
- Yeah.

725
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,780
Well,

726
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,100
go in to talk to the boss then.

727
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,940
Ma'am, I want to buy
your dried bamboo shoots.

728
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,810
No more left.

729
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,770
What about those over there?

730
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,290
They're booked.

731
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,170
Please.

732
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,210
Just one basket.

733
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,810
Fine. Order now,

734
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,120
and you can pick it up next month.

735
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,380
Even the daylilies will be spoiled then.

736
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,460
We don't dry daylilies.

737
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,460
Come in.

738
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,020
- Get out.
- Is Mr. Bai here?

739
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,690
No. Get out.

740
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,580
- Mr. Bai.
- Get out.

741
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,110
- Mr. Bai.
- Get out.

742
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,170
Lu Tianchi.

743
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,210
Fake lawyer.

744
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,050
Real scammer.

745
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,730
- Lu Tianchi.
- What?

746
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,770
Fake lawyer.

747
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,130
Real scammer.

748
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,250
Lu Tianchi.

749
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,060
Fake lawyer. Real scammer.

750
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,000
What is that saying?

751
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,290
Lu Tianchi.

752
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,330
Fake lawyer.

753
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,580
Real scammer.

754
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,860
Lu Tianchi.

755
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,900
Fake lawyer.

756
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,130
Real scammer.

757
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,900
Stop filming.

758
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,800
Lu Tianchi, fake lawyer.

759
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,980
Real scammer.

760
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,290
Lu Tianchi.

761
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,490
Fake lawyer.

762
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,670
Real scammer.

763
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,100
- Long time no see, Mr. Bai.
- Fake lawyer.

764
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,430
Real scammer.

765
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,060
I've never seen anyone

766
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,290
so shameless.

767
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,320
Lu Tianchi.

768
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,420
You're mad at me over Feng.

769
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,810
That means you respect my work, right?

770
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,730
This time I'm here

771
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,900
to help you make money.

772
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,130
You helped that lazy bum

773
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,810
and scammed me out of a lot of money.

774
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,330
How dare you show your face?

775
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,580
Don't be so mad.

776
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,590
Calm down, calm down.

777
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,500
Just calm down.

778
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,340
It's okay.

779
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,650
Hello, Mr. Bai.

780
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,860
I'm Liu Yan,

781
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,060
a chef at Highland Restaurant.

782
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,610
Highland held the Two-Diamond rating

783
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,730
for three years in a row.

784
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,540
Now, we have

785
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,610
a new dish,

786
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,690
and dried bamboo shoots are crucial.

787
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,610
I just tasted your product.

788
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:48,970
It's excellent.

789
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,640
If you put the dried bamboo shoots,

790
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,170
scallions, ginger, and Huangjiu

791
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,130
into a pressure cooker

792
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,290
for 5 to 10 minutes

793
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,810
and soak them in water boiled
with Zongzi leaves,

794
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,290
it restores

795
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,500
the original fresh flavor

796
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,580
of the bamboo shoots.

797
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,960
It can be the ingredient

798
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,900
for our future star dish

799
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,610
that earns us diamonds.

800
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,290
A diamond earner, huh?

801
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,810
Aren't you tired of that?

802
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,060
Many restaurants

803
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,500
don't have

804
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,940
your so-called diamond rating,

805
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,540
but their food is delicious.

806
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,610
Yes, yes.

807
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,330
I agree with you completely.

808
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,770
I think if you try it,

809
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,690
you might understand

810
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,730
what I mean.

811
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,060
It smells so good.

812
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,540
Do you want to try some, Mr. Bai?

813
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,020
The meat's juicy.

814
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,770
Not dry or bitter.

815
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,130
That's a whole different...

816
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,540
Miss Liu, right?

817
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,860
Just call me Liu.

818
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,980
The man you brought here

819
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,290
is no real lawyer.

820
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,210
I'm telling you.

821
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,540
I don't trust anyone

822
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,590
who deals with him.

823
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,290
Mr. Bai,
I hardly have dealings with her.

824
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,940
Please reconsider, Mr. Bai.

825
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,060
I really need

826
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,130
to make this dish.

827
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,630
Your dried bamboo shoots here

828
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,530
are for hungry people.

829
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,420
But at Highland,

830
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,330
they're for people who aren't hungry.

831
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,690
You understand

832
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,690
the difference, right?

833
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,200
What do people who aren't hungry eat?

834
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,620
I'll eat it if he doesn't.

835
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,130
Lu Tianchi.

836
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,100
What's going on today?

837
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,420
Why does Uncle Bai look at you

838
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,450
like he's seeing a ghost?

839
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,530
You really fooled him?

840
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,770
Don't listen to his nonsense.

841
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,720
I had some trouble with him

842
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,500
for survival reasons.

843
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,420
He holds a grudge

844
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,940
and makes up lies.

845
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,300
Enough.

846
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,690
I don't care about your past.

847
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,930
If I can't get the bamboo shoots
because of you,

848
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,820
I won't let you off.

849
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,130
You're fierce.

850
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,460
Alright, just a heads-up.

851
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,460
30 seconds have passed.

852
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
Please keep track of time, too.

853
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,610
As for me...

854
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,860
How's it going?

855
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,500
- Not bad.
- Not bad, my foot.

856
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,940
Something's wrong. It's harsh.

857
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,860
Look at this clause.

858
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,900
"Report every hour".
What does that mean?

859
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,000
You're not an alarm clock.

860
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,130
And the next.

861
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,650
A 24-hour driver

862
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,900
and a personal bodyguard?

863
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,580
Is this care

864
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,860
or surveillance?

865
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,330
It's just because he loves me.

866
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,660
(Prenuptial Agreement)

867
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,650
Do you really want

868
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,770
to trap yourself?

869
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,940
How long have you known him?

870
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,100
How long have you known Liu Yan?

871
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,290
It's different.

872
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,690
How?

873
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,880
You're worse than me.

874
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,740
(Jiang Fang: Mr. Lu,)

875
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,510
(I need to see you.)
At least I don't weigh

876
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,410
(What's wrong?)
pros and cons in relationships.

877
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,600
You don't weigh pros and cons?

878
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,690
You calculate everything so precisely.

879
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,610
Why lose your senses this time?

880
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,690
I want to gamble.

881
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,860
I haven't gambled

882
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,940
in Jaya anyway.

883
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,610
Gamble what?

884
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,940
I hate gambling the most.

885
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,170
Listen, you're just overly anxious.

886
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,500
I'm not anxious.

887
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,240
Look into the tiger's eyes
when you're free.

888
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,770
(Jiang Fang: It's about Liu Yan. Hurry.)
Inner peace, okay?

889
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,500
(A location is sent to you)
Try to find it.

890
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,650
Hey, sir.

891
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,770
You need a ticket to enter here.

892
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,170
I'm looking for Jiang Fang.

893
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,250
Fang, someone's here for you.

894
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,580
Let him in.

895
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,250
Mr. Lu,

896
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,730
long time no see.

897
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,980
Weren't you staying

898
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,310
at Ganga Hostel a few days ago?

899
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,690
Life's ups and downs.

900
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,100
It's always like this.

901
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,580
Come on.

902
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,210
Have some water.

903
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,220
It's clean.

904
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,500
No need, thanks.

905
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,340
Come on.

906
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,580
If Liu Yan finds out

907
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,690
you're staying here...

908
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,980
Don't tell her.

909
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,380
I don't want to cause her trouble.

910
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,610
What do you want?

911
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,140
I've made

912
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,730
some friends here.

913
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,690
A bunch of like-minded lowlifes.

914
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,610
How rude of you to say that?

915
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,690
Let me tell you.

916
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,810
Don't underestimate this place.

917
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,130
There are hidden talents.

918
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,210
Many talents here.

919
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,330
Before their downfall,

920
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,500
they

921
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,340
did so well.

922
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,170
This isn't a downfall.

923
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,480
This is just what they deserve.

924
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,380
Fine.

925
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,020
Your moral standards are so high.

926
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,610
Gambling addicts deserve to die.

927
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,420
Gambling addicts deserve to be killed.

928
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,380
Right?

929
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,810
But the people I mentioned

930
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,250
were all victims

931
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,330
of a long con.

932
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,650
If you could help them

933
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,810
get their money back...

934
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,810
What are you saying?

935
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,420
Why don't you understand?

936
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,500
If you could help them

937
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,170
get their money back,

938
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,420
we could both profit.

939
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,130
Everybody wins.

940
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,130
Jiang Fang,

941
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,900
you're Liu Yan's mom,

942
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,740
so I will

943
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,330
help you

944
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,210
as much as I can.

945
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,500
But now, you want a lawyer

946
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,940
to help you raise gambling funds.

947
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,210
Are you crazy?

948
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,540
Don't believe in flattery, okay?

949
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,540
Are you a real lawyer?

950
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,770
This is us teaming up to help everyone

951
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,730
recover their hard-earned money.

952
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,940
To be honest,

953
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,290
the reason I want

954
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,940
to cooperate with you

955
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,060
is that you're not a real lawyer.

956
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,610
You don't have

957
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,060
a formal lawyer's license,

958
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,030
but you're kinder than they are.

959
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,200
- I don't deserve your flattery.
- It's a great merit.

960
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,580
Take care of yourself.

961
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,530
Also,

962
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,060
stay away from Liu Yan.

963
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:08,690
Think about it.

964
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,540
Think about it.

965
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,900
