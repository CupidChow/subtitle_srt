Is this the place?

20
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,650
Can you ask again?

21
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,720
- When will she be out?
- Sorry.

Sis!

00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,540
Sis.

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,860
Sis!

26
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,540
What did you call me?

27
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,340
I called you... Liu Yan.

28
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,110
That's not respectful.

29
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,870
Don't call me by my name again.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,130
Liu Yan, you can't

31
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,020
hide things from me...

32
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,620
I just said that.

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,260
What should you call me?

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,940
Sis.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,720
Mr. Lu, talk to her.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,080
You really scared us both.

37
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,880
He thought you wouldn't make it back.

38
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,500
Today's not my treat, by the way.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,760
Don't try to overcharge.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,540
Alright, Sis.

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,380
Let's go.

42
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,940
Come on, let's go.

43
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,980
Is the ground burning?

44
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,940
A little bit.

45
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,630
I was afraid you'd make a fuss,

46
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,380
so I asked you to stay at home.
Why did you tell him?

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,250
Mr. Lu was really great today.

48
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,730
He didn't even mention money all day.

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,420
And he had a client to meet today,

50
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,280
but he skipped it.

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,290
Kids can't tell who's family, huh?

52
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,680
Mr. Lu was concerned

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,640
about Mr. Luo.

54
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,470
Don't say I'm out to hurt anyone.

55
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,950
That never crossed my mind.

56
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,540
I said it, so what?

57
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,640
What do you think of me?

58
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,650
Hey, you tied me up

59
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,530
like I'm your prey.

60
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,480
What else would I think?

61
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,580
Go get a manicure?

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,010
Didn't delay your work, did it?

63
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,620
No.

64
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,500
You came out with all limbs intact,

65
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,780
which calls for a big celebration.

66
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,840
Didn't they give you trouble?

67
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,140
No.

68
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,680
I do use my brain, you know.

69
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,500
I had a complete

70
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,900
offense and defense strategy planned

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,810
before daring to approach Mr. Luo.

72
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,180
Alright, alright.

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,520
I suggest you

74
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,300
abandon these dangerous ideas.

75
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,340
Don't even think about it again.

76
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,460
Remember that, okay?

77
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,620
That's a lot of money, so much!

78
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,400
- Don't touch it.
- You killed someone

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,450
- Put it down.
- or set a fire?

80
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,250
What did they force you to do?

81
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,980
Take him to school.

82
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Take me to school?

83
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,030
Taking me to school right now?

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,780
Did you do something illegal?

85
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,290
Did you skip class again today?

86
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,410
Li Zan, can you please stop skipping?

87
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,310
Is this the right time

88
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,150
to discuss this?

89
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,940
How am I supposed to go to school
with all this money?

90
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,260
Can't you see she is crazy?

91
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,710
What are you doing?

92
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,420
Should we go to the Civil Affairs Bureau

93
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,280
to prove she's insane?

94
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,130
Then she wouldn't have

95
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,190
to be your guardian, okay?

96
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,300
Right, I can't be your guardian.

97
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,930
I'll take you to see Ms. He.

98
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,770
Let her take care of you.

99
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,010
I...

100
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,640
I want to make a will.

101
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,130
Mr. Luo and I signed

102
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,380
a new fight agreement.

103
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,980
A real fight.

104
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,010
I've never heard

105
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,590
of making a will before boxing.

106
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,810
So what's with

107
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,260
this bag of money?

108
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,620
Tell me the truth.

109
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,090
Otherwise, I won't take it.

110
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,660
I'm going to fight the Big Beast.

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,390
If I win,

112
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,860
the debt will get cleared.

113
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,590
Plus, I'll get an appearance fee.

114
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,740
But if I lose...

115
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,020
I can't lose.

116
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,470
This is the advance appearance fee.

117
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,180
Big Beast is...

118
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,750
Yeah, that Big Beast.

119
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,960
That guy's arms are
as thick as my thighs.

120
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,440
You can't fight him.
He's like three of you.

121
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
You know that?

122
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,620
So the draw of this match

123
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,740
is spectators watching you

124
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,880
get beaten to death live?

125
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,980
If I lose,

126
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,340
all the money goes to Li Zan.

127
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,490
That won't even cover your debt!

128
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,460
If you lose,

129
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,580
what happens to Li Zan if you die?

130
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,060
You shouldn't fight.

131
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,040
Mr. Luo doesn't allow backing out.

132
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,220
It's not without room for negotiation.

133
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,060
I have some money left.

134
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,400
I could loan you some.

135
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,540
Being alive is good enough.

136
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,750
Why risk your life for nothing?

137
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,200
I've thought about it.

138
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,050
I even thought of going back to Beijing.

139
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,590
Jiang Fang's been gone for years.

140
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,030
I can consider her dead.

141
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,310
Li Zan and I aren't even related.

142
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,580
I could pretend he doesn't exist.

143
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,920
But even if I go back to Beijing,

144
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,340
what's there?

145
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,820
Just a childhood friend

146
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,310
who always gets scolded because of me.

147
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,020
I used to live as a sparring partner,

148
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,260
waiting for my mom.

149
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,420
Now I live to repay debts.

150
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,060
Nothing more.

151
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,620
Your arguments are...

152
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,830
Maybe I should go find Tattooed Arms.

153
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,850
There must be another way.

154
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,120
Don't worry about it.

155
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,500
I've already made up my mind.

156
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,020
Can't you ever listen to advice?

157
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,340
I get what you're saying,

158
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,820
but sometimes I don't want to hear it.

159
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,340
I can't explain why.

160
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,920
Do you think everything

161
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,350
you do for Jiang Fang is worth it?

162
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,380
I want to add another clause.

163
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,700
If I die at the match,

164
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,990
cancel my family's debts.

165
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,090
Don't make my brother or my mom repay.

166
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,100
Is your life

167
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,860
that valuable?

168
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,140
Not really, Mr. Luo.

169
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,430
But it'll make the match intense

170
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,660
and marketable.

171
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,820
You know that better than I do.

172
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,540
That kid isn't your real brother, is he?

173
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,580
He's not, actually.

174
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,430
But the debts belong to me and my mom.

175
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,140
He's not involved in this.

176
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,180
Yet he genuinely

177
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,210
suffers because of my mom.

178
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
I'm obligated

179
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,340
to make up for her mistakes.

180
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,460
I'm her daughter after all, right?

181
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,510
Is it really worth all this for her?

182
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,340
If I really lose it all,

183
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,750
Li Zan will finally be free.

184
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,500
Jiang Fang will be free too.

185
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,620
I don't lose out.

186
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,350
So you've made up your mind?

187
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,220
Yeah, I'm sure.

188
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,180
First, let's open a bank account

189
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,510
and deposit this money.

190
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,060
Sign some authorizations.

191
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,820
I'll handle the will

192
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,080
for you.

193
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,140
Lu Tianchi, you're such a worrier!

194
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,380
Look at you, all nervous.

195
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,850
Alright, stop joking.

196
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,720
Hurry up and get it done.

197
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,050
I'll handle other matters for you.

198
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,940
Why'd you run off?

199
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,340
(Lin's Herbal Tea, Grocery)

200
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,220
(Call me and you'll win.
There must be money.)

201
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,420
(Will)

202
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,460
What brings you here?

203
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,080
Uncle Lu,

204
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,020
my sis took so much money.

205
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,900
Is she becoming someone's mistress?

206
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,890
As a young person,

207
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,780
isn't this mindset

208
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,780
rather abnormal?

209
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,650
Do young women have to

210
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,580
give in to some older guy

211
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,720
just to get ahead?

212
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,100
Or is she selling a kidney now?

213
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,750
Are you insane?

214
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,830
She's selling her kidney?

215
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,960
You think she runs a butcher shop?

216
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,460
Listen,

217
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,760
don't try to get info out of me.

218
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,540
Your sis is my client.

219
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,020
I must respect

220
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,940
her privacy.

221
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,860
Right, Uncle Lu.

222
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,310
But my sis, you know,

223
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,240
is pretty hot-tempered.

224
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,740
If I ask her,

225
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,300
she'll likely beat me up.

226
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,900
You've tasted her fists before,

227
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,100
right?

228
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,060
Don't act chummy with me.

229
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,370
Calling me "Uncle Lu" won't help.

230
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,190
Who's your uncle?

231
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,180
Uncle Lu,

232
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
I'm like half-family to her.

233
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,940
Only we two can truly

234
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,660
rely on

235
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,400
and look out for each other.

236
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,900
Don't you agree?

237
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,480
Do you really mean that?

238
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,060
I swear, I really do.

239
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,820
She has her own plans.

240
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,420
My advice is,

241
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,820
don't get in her way.

242
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,750
She has plans? What plans?

243
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,350
Come on, give more details.

244
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,620
You're cunning, huh?

245
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,700
Hey, it's just a chat.

246
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,500
Your free time

247
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,340
is almost up.

248
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,660
Want me to give you

249
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,080
a special discount slot?

250
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,380
You go do your thing.

251
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,630
I'm heading home to do homework.

252
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,490
Fix that broken door, okay?

253
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,200
I've realized

254
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,130
it's dangerous to live with you

255
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,030
or Jiang Fang.

256
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,750
It's too easy to get brainwashed

257
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,880
by your cooking.

258
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,610
Eat later.

259
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,300
Have some when it's ready.

260
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,660
I'll just have one bite.

261
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,200
It won't make a difference.

262
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,180
- Tastes amazing.
- It'll get even better!

263
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,810
Look.

264
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,500
Look at these layers.

265
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,540
So good. I...

266
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,500
Let's toast.

267
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,340
Alright.

268
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,100
Hold on!

269
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,940
May I gain weight successfully.

270
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,420
This is just delicious.

271
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,940
Best thing I've ever tasted.

272
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,740
Well,

273
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,260
that thing with Mr. Luo...

274
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,820
I advise caution.

275
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
What do you even know?

276
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,020
Mr. Lu told me everything.

277
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,380
No way that's true.

278
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,290
He never spills secrets.

279
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,500
Everything has a price.

280
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,820
He has to handle this stuff.

281
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,000
My sis took so much money.

282
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,060
I'm giving you this info

283
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,020
about her plan.

284
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,180
Alright, that's how it is.

285
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,120
Just get the gist, okay?

286
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,930
I've got my own plan too.

287
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,760
Traitor!

288
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,710
I repeatedly told him

289
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,020
that it has nothing to do with you.

290
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,020
There are skills in boxing, okay?

291
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,730
Sure, Big Beast looks tough.

292
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,550
But I'm not out of moves.

293
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,680
I've still got ways to score.

294
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,780
A match?

295
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,130
You're entering another match?

296
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,540
Don't worry about it.

297
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,130
I've been boxing for over ten years.

298
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,700
You think I'd risk my own life?

299
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,780
The will is just in case.

300
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,620
The will?

301
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,500
The will written by Mr. Lu

302
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,250
can actually prevent

303
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,610
some what-ifs.

304
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,380
He's gone way too far.

305
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,140
That's not professional at all.

306
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,700
- Lu Tianchi!
- Seriously?

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,290
You're shameless!

308
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,500
For money,

309
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,450
you just treat

310
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,400
the client's confidentiality!

311
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,850
Li Zan came to see me.

312
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,220
But I didn't say anything, okay?

313
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,210
Now you're lying.

314
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,090
What lie?

315
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:09,930
He recorded it!

316
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,780
What did I say to him?

317
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,800
Did I mention Mr. Luo?

318
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,300
Did I say you were making a will?

319
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,810
You said you only said that much.

320
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,650
Never again.

321
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,390
See, you're guilty.

322
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,260
Was it you yourself

323
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,250
who spilled everything to him?

324
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,100
That little brat.

325
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,670
Tricked me again.

326
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,510
Sorry about that.

327
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,350
Sorry for what?

328
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,120
Come on, give me a quick massage.

329
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,140
That muscle is tense.

330
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,780
Seriously, with your brain,

331
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,250
still talking about boxing techniques?

332
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,180
A little brat like him

333
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,240
can mess you up so easily.

334
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,500
My bad.

335
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,540
I did get a bit anxious just now.

336
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,300
I blamed you by mistake.

337
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,980
It's fine.

338
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,040
Mr. Lu, about that match
against Big Beast,

339
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,300
I have a feeling I can win.

340
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,340
I don't comfort clients.

341
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,890
The higher the hope,

342
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,160
the bigger the letdown.

343
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,500
Seriously?

344
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,920
It's hard to talk to you properly,

345
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,800
right?

346
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,010
Why can't we talk properly?

347
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,710
Why do you always...

348
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,720
- Mr. Lu.
- pull me...?

349
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
I'm done showering.

350
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,250
It's almost time.

351
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,500
We should probably

352
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,980
head inside now.

353
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,440
Then wait for me.

354
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,710
You... you go ahead.

355
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,560
I still have things to do.

356
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,980
No, I'm not that busy.

357
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,820
Anyway...

358
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,140
Try it.

359
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,790
Go for that smart vibe.

360
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,500
Much better.

361
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,260
How's the effect?

362
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,930
You're really impressive!

363
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,280
Winter melon is on sale now?

364
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,810
Where did you get so many?

365
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,780
They're useful.

366
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,040
Useful? How exactly?

367
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,600
Besides eating, what else?

368
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,020
Don't worry about it.

369
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,900
Even if I told you, you'd be lost.

370
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,860
Eat more, maybe I can beat you.

371
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,980
You're usually pretty sharp.

372
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,660
Why not use your head now?

373
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,500
You'd better

374
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,690
prepare some earplugs these days.

375
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,520
Earplugs? What are those for?

376
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,350
To eat with the winter melon?

377
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,500
Aren't you embarrassed?

378
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,540
Not at all, honestly.

379
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,820
You always claim

380
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,940
you're an adult.

381
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,510
Yet here you are, slacking off.

382
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,380
You're a grown man, do something.

383
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,020
Come on, hurry up.

384
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,140
- Hurry up.
- I'm moving.

385
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,810
But you can't beat him.

386
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,940
You won't get hurt, right?

387
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,980
I'll be fine.

388
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,850
Don't get beaten up.

389
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,730
What if you get crippled?

390
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,750
I'm at least

391
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,780
a professional player.

392
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,000
Getting crippled isn't that easy.

393
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,980
Really capable?

394
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,100
Yeah.

395
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,140
Don't really hurt yourself.

396
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,380
If you can't do it, just say.

397
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,320
We can stop if you want.

398
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,540
I'm good.

399
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,500
Move aside.

400
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,850
This winter melon is so heavy.

401
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,580
Are you sure you can handle it?

402
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,780
Our coach usually

403
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,940
calls boxers like this big guy

404
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,900
"Iron Tower".

405
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,540
Set him as your screensaver?

406
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,780
If I go head-to-head with Iron Tower,

407
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,260
there's really no chance for me.

408
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,780
I have zero advantage at all.

409
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,780
But Iron Tower

410
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,820
has one weakness.

411
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,060
He's not very quick.

412
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,220
That's my only shot.

413
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,970
But what's that got to do
with winter melon?

414
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,340
What are you doing?

415
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,260
Wow, you broke it with your hands?

416
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,940
What do you think?

417
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,280
It's so thick, how'd you snap it?

418
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,300
Like this.

419
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,820
This is Big Beast's neck.

420
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,020
Just... like that.

421
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,180
Like this, it broke?

422
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,490
You were holding the winter melon.

423
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,540
Check where my hand is.

424
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,020
Like this.

425
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,670
Honestly, you barely

426
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,560
need force...

427
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,480
You okay?

428
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,570
Fine, I didn't break it.

429
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,530
So you're using this thing

430
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,370
to deal with him?

431
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,100
Yeah, it's all I've got for him.

432
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,420
Can... can it work?

433
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,020
It's his home field.

434
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,860
It looks like he's got a lot of fans.

435
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,620
I'm on away ground here.

436
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,890
Feels like I'm at a disadvantage.

437
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,340
I need to train hard.

438
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,860
Big Beast is huge.

439
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,980
Can you get close to him?

440
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,430
I'm small, but I'm quick.

441
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,330
As long as I get a chance,

442
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,340
I'll take him down.

443
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,970
Alright, what about this?

444
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,420
What do we do with the rest?

445
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,300
Let's cook it up tomorrow.

446
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,540
Wow, you really twisted it off.

(Li Zan)
Uncle Lu,

448
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,580
my sis really made up her mind

449
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,590
to fight Big Beast.

450
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,930
Is there any way you can

451
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,760
talk her out of it?

452
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,740
(Will)

453
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,840
(Lu Tianchi)
From what I see,

454
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,340
she's totally focused on this.

455
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,080
It's not easy to convince her.

456
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,700
Let's wait for another chance.

457
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
What are you doing?

458
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,970
I'm seriously filming you.

459
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,830
When you get famous one day,

460
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,100
this will be your documentary.

461
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,540
Take a look.

462
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,200
Look, I filmed you pretty well.

463
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,380
Isn't this a bit funny?

464
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,460
Didn't you love filming?

465
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,460
Go ahead, keep filming.

466
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,140
Don't stop now.

467
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,380
Ready, action.

468
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,100
What? Planning to fight?

469
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,680
Let me tell you something.

470
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,980
Wrong direction.

471
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
Big Beast is huge.

472
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,110
If you go up, face it first.

473
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,540
You get what I mean?

474
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,380
Yeah, you have to show confidence.

475
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,360
Come on, speak up a bit.

476
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,310
Ah!

477
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,150
Ah.

478
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,420
Try it again.

479
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,390
Ah!

480
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,900
No, not "ah", it's "oh"!

481
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,760
Give it one more shot.

482
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,460
Use your whole body like this.

483
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,180
Oh!

484
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,660
Oh!

485
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,870
Let the sound out, let it out.

486
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,010
It's not coming. Try harder.

487
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,980
Aren't you practicing...?

488
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,050
Let your voice be heard.

489
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,880

Stop napping. Don't break winter melons!

494
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,560
I saw Big Beast in person.

495
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,630
He's seriously strong.

496
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,960
Like a bull on its feet.

497
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,820
Don't break winter melons!

498
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,860
You can't beat him at all.

499
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,700
If he goes after you,

500
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
he could take you out quickly.

501
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,640
You get what I mean?

502
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,220
You don't stand a chance...

503
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,060
You...

504
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,380
Fine.

510
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,700
Let's grab some late-night bites.

on the invite list.

What's this invite for?

514
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,100
Do I need

515
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,500
an invite list to come?

- I'll find him myself.
- Go!

526
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,230

528
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,980
does it have to be

00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,220
this grand?

530
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,500
Go back.

531
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,140
Sorry about that.

533

of the money she owed to Mr. Luo.

535
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,660
than her boxing.

Don't go around telling people

541
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,180
you're close with Mr. Luo.

542
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,040
He is furious.

543
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,320
You're getting real comfortable now.

544
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,820
I made this winter melon tea.

545
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,380
It'll help with that hangover.

In other fields,

552
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,520
I'm definitely not sharp.

553
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,580
But in this field,

554
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,460
you can't fool me.

555
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,880
Tell me, who hit you?

556
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,460
I'll stand up for you.

557
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,200
Stand up for what?

558
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,780
Stop being so aggressive all the time.

559
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,620
Can you chill out?

560
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,430
I told you

561
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,820
that I hate violent people like you.

562
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,310
It's not your business.

563
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,270
How about I teach you
a couple of killer moves?

564
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,810
Killer...

565
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,280

can you take on ten guys?

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,460
I could take on 20.

567
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,640
I'd take them down one by one.

568
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
Alright, fine.

569
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,820
What's going on? Tell me!

570
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,190
I want to calculate

571
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,630
the odds for my match.

572
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,650
What's there to calculate?

573
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,620
Obviously, you're walking to death.

574
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,800
Yeah, that's true.

575
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,360
Even you can tell

576
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,380
I'm heading to my death, right?

577
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,850
Why don't those spectators

578
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,860
get it?

579
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,580
My odds are too low now.

580
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,430
Do they think

581
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,270
I can actually beat

582
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,160
Big Beast or something?

583
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,550
I even asked the manager

584
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,100
to help raise my odds.

585
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,970
But he ignored me.

586
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,570
Here, take this card.

587
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,640
Use the money inside if you need it.

588
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,300
Hold off a while, don't risk your life.

589
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,980
Honestly,

590
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,060
I've already used up

591
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,010
every possible chance to bargain.

592
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,340
No matter how much I borrow,

593
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,220
it only buys a little time,

594
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,230
but it can't solve the problem.

595
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,210
Let me handle it, you're struggling.

596
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,520
It's almost time. We should probably...

597
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,300
You... you go ahead.

598
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,410
Thanks.

599
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,330
It's getting tough out there lately.

600
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,740
Things are dangerous now.

601
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,990
You really need to stay careful.

602
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,930
Remember that flashy girl

603
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,970
you met the other day?

604
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,300
She's a client of mine, too.

605
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,900
Something happened to her recently.

606
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,940
We just sorted it out.

607
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,540
Does it hurt?

608
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,380
Yeah.

609
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,340
(Mixed Boxing. Big Beast; Liu Yan)

610
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,100
Lu Tianchi,

611
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,860
can you take a new photo for me?

612
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,260
What do you mean?

613
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,100
You should

614
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,460
film my weak points,

615
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,290
like I could be knocked out in one hit.

616
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,900
But the main thing is...

617
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,660
You shouldn't play up the misery.

618
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,500
There should be a selling point.

619
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,140
A selling point?

620
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,100
Why did you give me

621
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,260
this hairstyle?

622
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,530
Looks like a Chinese New Year painting.

623
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,620
What painting?

624
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,930
It's Chunli!

625
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,820
You know?

626
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,180
First, relax your mouth.

627
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,100
Do it with me, come on.

628
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,850
Okay, okay.

629
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,710
Alright, got it, okay.

630
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,550
Yeah, that's right.

631
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,750
Relax your mouth, just a bit.

632
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,700
Just a bit of a smile.

633
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,560
Lift the corners slightly.

634
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,420
Alright, let's do it.

635
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,720
A little innocent vibe.

636
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,830
Yeah, that innocent look.

637
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,440
What are you laughing at?

638
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,530
I can't do it.

639
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,740
Look at you.

640
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,420
Why do you look so stiff?

641
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,880
Make your eyes a bit blank.

642
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,660
- A bit empty.
- Blank?

643
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,200
It's fine, the shot looks great.

644
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,430
We've shot for ages, won't let me see?

645
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,250
Still need editing?

646
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,060
Come over a little.

647
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,990
Move your gaze this way.

648
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,820
Perfect, perfect.

649
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,080
That's the one.

650
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,920
Yeah, that's it!

651
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,220
Alright, that's good!

652
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,510
This task isn't complicated,

653
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,390
but

654
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,690
we need everyone's energy,

655
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,950
lots of energy.

656
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,260
During the event,

657
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,740
there's unlimited ice cream!

658
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,300
Great!

659
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,290
Let's try the performance again,

660
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,430
so Zan can see it.

661
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,420
Three, two, one!

662
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,580
(Salty is above all)
Liu Yan!

663
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,540
Liu Yan!

664
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,010
Pickles love Salty!

665
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,860
Louder!

666
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,520
Liu Yan! Liu Yan!

667
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,570
Pickles love Salty!

668
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,520
Liu Yan! Liu Yan!

669
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,700
Shout it out!

670
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,340
Pickles love Salty!

671
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,510
Liu Yan!

672
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,360
Liu Yan...

673
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,600
Can you get me

674
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,670
two A's?

675
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,690
If I get them, my dad will

676
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,180
send me a huge red envelope.

677
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,060
There's one more thing.

678
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,500
No way, absolutely not.

679
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,700
The car's expensive. I can't lend it.

680
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,940
Just let me borrow it once.

681
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,670
I'll give you
my strongest Star River Hero.

682
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,620
Is that a deal?

683
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,180
Wait!

684
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,940
The hero

685
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,690
plus the top 20 in the grade

686
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,460
by the finals.

687
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,460
No problem,
you'll make your family proud.

688
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,380
(Filming in progress)

689
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,810
Are you out of your mind?

690
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,180
You're the crazy one.

691
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,550
You really want to mess with them?

692
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,640
What are you thinking about?

693
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,570
If you don't cause me trouble,

694
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,530
your day just isn't complete,

695
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,340
is that it?

696
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,600
You hit him with the car,

697
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,820
so I don't have to compete?

698
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,940
I'm telling you, Mr. Luo could

699
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,980
find me a more beastly opponent.

700
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,980
What about the aftermath?

701
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,990
Have you thought about it,

702
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,940
Li Zan?

703
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,260
I'm 17, still a minor.

704
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,850
Even if I mess up, it's less serious.

705
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,220
Whose car did you borrow?

706
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,420
Hurry up and return it.

707
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,400
That car looks expensive.

708
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,670
If you break it,

709
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,820
I can't afford to pay for it.

710
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,000
Forget paying for that.

711
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,140
I gave him

712
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,980
my strongest hero.

713
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,630
Plus, I have to take his exams.

714
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,980
He owes me!

715
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,910
When you fool me,

716
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,220
you always seem so clever.

717
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,660
How did you come up

718
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,920
with such a ridiculous idea?

719
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,700
I lost my mom.

720
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,540
My dad's gone too.

721
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,080
I really don't want

722
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,900
to go through that again.

723
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,940
Morning, Grandma.

724
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,820
Isn't unlicensed driving illegal?

725
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,080
Shouldn't the police arrest him?

726
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,020
What do you mean?

727
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,210
You came to me so early,

728
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,000
hoping someone would
lock up your brother?

729
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,540
I'm just afraid

730
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,200
he'll cause trouble on match day.

731
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,900
Having him in the police station

732
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,060
would actually put me more at ease.

733
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,940
Help me think of a way

734
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,820
to arrest him.

735
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,170
Don't show contempt for the law, okay?

736
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,620
The police can't

737
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,530
arrest people for no reason.

738
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,380
What are you thinking?

739
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,900
This is for you.

740
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,040
Thanks for your photo.

741
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,700
Thanks to you,

742
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,330
my odds are crazy high now.

743
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,100
Tickets are hard to get.

744
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,850
Scalpers are charging a fortune.

745
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,660
The photo looks great.

746
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,780
Come on, over here.

747
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,280
If your brother isn't caught,
do I still get these?

748
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,740
Of course, it's yours.

749
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,250
You take such good photos.

750
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,680
On match day, take some for me, okay?

751
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,260
I've been boxing for so long.

752
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,560
No one's ever taken photos of me.

753
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,060
If that day...

754
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,020
something happens,

755
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,680
these photos can serve as that thing.

756
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,900
That thing?

757
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,940
Yeah, you know.

758
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,300
A memorial photo.

759
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,700
A memorial photo?

760
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,320
Memorial photo, my foot.

761
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,630
Let me tell you two things.

762
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,560
First, watch what you say.

763
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,190
Second, get out of here now.

764
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,260
It's better for you and Li Zan.

765
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,660
Can you help me

766
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,660
think of something?

767
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,460
This place is too exposed.

768
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,500
Are we really running from here?

769
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,670
So much talk when escaping?

770
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,980
Those big ships stay
in international waters.

771
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,070
Haven't you seen cop movies?

772
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,180
Such a grown man, yet no sense at all.

773
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,280
How do you look after your sis?

774
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,620
Thank you, really, Uncle Lu.

775
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,520
About your withdrawal from school,

776
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,570
I've sorted it out, don't worry.

777
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,980
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

778
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,140
You're welcome.

779
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,550
It's a lovely day today.

780
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,540
Everything seems fine.

781
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,050
I'll leave you here then.

782
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,100
Okay, we're heading off.

783
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,180
Let's go.

784
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,580
Well, you...

785
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,140
take good care of yourself.

786
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,780
Then after that...

787
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
you two chat a bit more.

788
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,230
Take good care of yourself.

789
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,780
Drink less.

790
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,780
And don't be so stubborn, okay?

791
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,860
Anyway, if anything happens,

792
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,980
just...

793
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,090
send me a message.

794
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,060
Once I'm settled.

795
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,660
You too, don't make your sis worry.

796
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,460
Set sail.

797
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,580
Enjoy your break.

798
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,500
Wait, no.

799
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,540
Someone's not on board yet.

800
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,620
Wait... What are you two doing?

801
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,280
Bye.

802
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,340
Wait, sir, stop it.

803
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,220
Stop it.

804
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,620
- I can't swim.
- Enjoy your break!

805
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,070
I can't swim!

806
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,920
- Bye!
- Hang on.

807
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,820
Wait for me, Liu Yan!

808
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,300
And you lawyer, stop looking!

809
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,500
You traitor!

810
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,780
Stop it! Let me go back!

811
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,980
Liar!

812
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,020
Liar.

813
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,560
Let me go back!

814
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,500
You're a genius.

815
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,540
You really lived up to my trust.

816
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,270
Liu Yan!

817
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,700
Tomorrow...

818
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,090
Do your best.

819
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,820
Don't forget to take pictures.

820
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,840
Got nowhere to vent, huh?

821
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,620
Let's go.

822
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,300
Li Zan,

823
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,650
the bank card password is

824
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,620
530530.

825
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,780
(Lu Tianchi)
You haven't paid the consultation fee.

826
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,780
Don't die.

827
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,500
(Liu Yan)
I'll try my best.

828
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,220
(Liu Yan,)

829
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,780
(is it worth it?)

830
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,900
(Waiting 12 Years)

831
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,950
(for the one who abandoned you,)

832
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,780
(is it worth it?)

833
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,900
(Accepting a brother not by blood,)

834
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,700
(is it worth it?)

835
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,290
(Risking death for a gambler,)

836
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,260
(is it worth it?)

837
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,840
(I honestly don't know.)

838
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,800
(All I know is)

839
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,530
(what I really want to do.)

840
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,060
(If I don't make it,)

841
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,660
(Sexy girl)

842
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,500
(Jiang Fang,)

843
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,780
(Fight)

844
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,880
(having me,)

845
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,420
(is it worth it?)

846
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,640
Do you get a phone?

847
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,540
Let me borrow it.

848
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,740
Your family

849
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,710
only promised they'd cover your meals.

850
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,400
They wouldn't cover your phone bill.

851
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,340
It's urgent. I need to get off here.

852
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,420
How much are they paying?

853
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,780
I'll pay double, okay?

854
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,070
Let me get off!

855
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,920
Pay me now.

856
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,760
I...

857
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,730
My sister is in mortal danger.

858
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,570
My sister...

859
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,540
Can you let me get off?

860
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,480
Do you understand me?

861
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,660
Your boss

862
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,130
told me specifically.

863
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,860
He said you got hooked

864
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,950
on online games.

865
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,980
I can't trust a word you say.

866
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,330
He's a total liar!

867
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,380
But my sister is my real sister!

868
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,740
I'm jumping!

869
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,690
Go on, jump.

870
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,880
I'll count to three.

871
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,040
Hey man,

872
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,590
come on, just let me go down.

873
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,430

880
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,590
We owed a mountain of debt.

881
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,050
She's about to pay it back
with her life.

882
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,880

Finally, I had a sister.

887
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,930
