Salty, listen to me.

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,180
If I were you, things like

19
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,860
"first class" and all that,

20
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,100
I wouldn't care about any of it.

21
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,930
At least, I need to

22
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,950
get a inheritance lawyer.

23
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,100
To arrange a private jet
for me to try out.

24
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,700
Once I get to Jaya,

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,540
I'll have the driver

26
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,700
waiting for me at the airport.

27
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,740
Once I'm done there,

28
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,630
I'll fly straight back.

29
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,460
How great is that?

30
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,910
You're not planning to stay there

31
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,990
and be a rich lady, are you?

32
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,980
Me? I...

33
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,050
You wouldn't even get
their language.

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,650
Once business is done, just go home.

35
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,380
I can't really call Beijing home.

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,140

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,780
My mom yesterday...

38
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,060
She didn't mean that.

39
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,420
Don't overthink it.

40
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,860
That's just how she is.

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,580
When you return triumphantly,

42
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,820
forget my mom.

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,280
Even the people in our compound

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,940
will fall over themselves
to fawn on you.

45
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,740
Alright.

46
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,060
Stop acting funny with me here.

47
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,020
It's not that bad.

48
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,980
Hurry back.

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,540
Oh, right.

50
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,060
What?

51
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,180
It's not for you.

52
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,500
Help me give it to your mom.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,780
No idea the exchange rate

54
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,740
over there,

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,300
or if you can spend it.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,420
If not enough,
I'll send more.

57
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,620
Thanks.

58
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,420
Don't forget.

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,060
You got a home in Beijing.

(Int'l/China HK, China Macau,

61
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,220
Hello, Miss Liu.

62
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,460
We've prepared

63
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,260
champagne, coffee, and tea for you.

64
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,220
What would you like to drink?

65
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Just this champagne then.

66
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,060
Okay.

67
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,140
Excuse me,

68
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,700
is the welcome champagne

69
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,980
still the same one as last month?

70
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,790
Yes, it is.

71
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,260
It tastes like sugar water.

72
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,740
Then give me the white wine

73
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,900
on the far left of the bar.

74
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,100
That's the best-tasting one.

75
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,180
Alright. One moment, please.

76
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,020
Thank you.

77
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,540
Miss!

78
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,620
Yes, Ms. Liu.

79
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,300
I'd like another drink.

80
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,420
I'll have what she said,

81
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,380
the best one you've got here.

82
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,660
Certainly.

83
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,100
One moment, please.

84
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,300
Ms. Liu, your wine.

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,540
Thanks.

86
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,700
Miss!

87
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,340
Hello, Ms. Liu.

88
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,540
When are we boarding?

89
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,380
Your flight has been delayed.

90
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,000
About another hour and a half.

91
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,820
I'd like another of this one.

92
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,860
Sorry about that.

93
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,900
That wine you requested is finished.

94
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

95
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,420
That wine you recommended earlier

96
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,860
was fantastic.

97
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,500
But it's all gone now.

98
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,260
Could you recommend another one?

99
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,780
You're already flushed.
And you're still going?

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,500
The food here is awful.

101
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,860
Drinks are all I can enjoy.

102
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,260
It's awful, yet you ate so much?

103
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,140
Well, the food can't go to waste.

104
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,460
No recommendation?

105
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,100
Sorry to bother you.

106
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,060
Jiang Fang,

107
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,620
thanks to you,

108
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,700
I'm really learning
to appreciate drinking.

109
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,300
(You left so much behind.)

110
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,460
- (I'll never worry about food or drink.)
- Take a nap.

111
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,100
(But I don't want it.)

112
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,460
(I want you back.)

113
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,820
Let me see how to play this card.

114
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,370
- Got the three of diamonds?
- No.

115
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,300
I've got it.

116
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,140
Right here.

117
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,020
You're so lucky.

118
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,260
Come on, your turn.

119
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,420
Excuse me,

120
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,580
has that pot of water boiled yet?

121
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,100
- Just a moment.
- Got it.

122
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,540
Please hurry up, I need it urgently.

123
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,120
You don't drink the water,

124
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,380
just constantly refilling it.

125
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,940
What do you know?

126
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,900
Constantly touching the pot has meaning.

127
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
It's calling for winning.

128
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,040
- Seriously?
- The expert knows best.

129
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,910
Of course.

130
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,100
If you want to play cards, go outside.

131
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,460
Our head nurse has already said it,

132
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,500
and we've told you many times.

133
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,940
This is a hospital, pick up the pace.

134
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Hurry up, play your card.

135
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,380
Wait...

136
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,460
This round, almost ready...

137
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,860
K.

138
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,980
Wait for me a second.

139
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,960
I'm getting the medicine.

140
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,420
I'm good now.

141
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,180
Good? How so?

142
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,460
You're still running a fever.

143
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,420
That's not right.

144
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,890
How come I'm losing so badly today...?

145
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,660
No, not losing.

146
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,980
Come here, sit down.

147
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,980
Watch my stuff.

148
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,300
I'll go find a nurse.

149
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,180
I adjusted it myself.

150
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,820
You adjusted what?

151
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,580
I sped it up.

152
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,580
You... You can't adjust that!

153
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,900
It's bad for your heart.

154
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,900
Are you feeling okay?

155
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,220
I don't want
to come for the IV tomorrow.

156
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
Not coming?

157
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,900
Did the nurse hurt you

158
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,180
when inserting the needle today?

159
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
No.

160
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,700
I don't want you playing cards
in the hospital.

161
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,540
Did I embarrass you?

162
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,580
Hungry?

163
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,220
Order whatever you want.

164
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,700
I'd rather eat your cooking at home.

165
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,060
My cooking, huh?

166
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,460
Trying to save money?

167
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Whatever I want?

168
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,980
Yeah, anything you like.

169
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,740
Jiang Fang, you're the best.

170
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,820
Let's go home quickly.

171
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,660
(Jiang Fang,)

172
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,620
(you think you can leave like that?)

173
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,180
(I won't let you off that easily.)

174
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,660
(We're not finished.)

175
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,500
(Just wait for me)

176
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,820
(in that... something Jaya.)

177
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,380
(Jaya)

178
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,100
Women like her,

179
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,500
you can tell she's trouble.

180
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,420
Help her with her stuff?

181
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,940
Are you that cheap?

182
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,460
She said her phone died.

183
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,660
It's a pickup tactic.

184
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,760
Ever heard of a sting operation?

185
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,610
Well, I think

186
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,250
if you're not willing to help,
forget it.

187
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,820
But no need to be so rude.

188
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,660
Me sting

189
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,700
him?

190
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,380
I have a boyfriend.

191
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,340
Stop trying that on me.

192
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,080
If not a pickup,
even more suspicious.

193
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,300
What do you have inside?

194
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,350
Who are you trying to harm?

195
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,820
Give it to me.

196
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
Everyone, look!

197
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,020
These are fakes.

198
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,860
Take a look.

199
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
They're fakes.

200
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,020
What are you doing?

201
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
Don't try to deny it.

202
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,380
Are you okay?

203
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,100
Who are you?

204
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,820
How dare you bully her?

205
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,260
She's my assistant.

206
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,420
Why are you only here now?

207
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,420
I've been totally misunderstood.

208
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,980
Sorry, Miss Tang.

209
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,820
I had too much to drink earlier
and threw up.

210
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,420
Everyone, look at this woman.

211
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,220
She just doesn't look honest.

212
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,260
Are you bullying her?

213
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,380
What do you mean?

214
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,660
Who sells fakes

215
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,900
in first class?

216
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,140
Being in first class
makes you a good person?

217
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,740
Miss, it's like this.

218
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,860
I've only ever heard

219
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,320
of people bringing stuff
from Jaya to China

220
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
to profit
from the price difference.

221
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,620
Who would bring things

222
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,900
from China to Jaya?

223
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,940
These watches aren't for sale.

224
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,420
I'm gifting them to friends.

225
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,500
Do you have that many friends?

226
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,420
Stop making things up.

227
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,620
You're definitely not
in legitimate business!

228
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,980
Customs! Police!

229
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,940
I want to report you!

230
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,780
I swear, none of this is fake.

231
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,140
These aren't fakes.

232
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,300
I'm telling the truth.

233
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,060
How can I explain this?

234
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,620
You can't just accuse people like that.

235
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,380
How dare you bully her?

236
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,460
My mom passed away.

237
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,220
We have a family tradition.

238
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,020
Everyone at the funeral

239
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,260
must wear identical watches.

240
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,860
Miss Tang prepared them to help me

241
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,540
organize the funeral.

242
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,140
She prepared them to help

243
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,500
organize my funeral!

244
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,220
Here's the letter from the lawyer.

245
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,780
Who wants to see it?

246
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,620
See?

247
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,260
Hello.

248
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,780
I'm not from Thailand.

249
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,940
Hello.

250
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,260
Please focus on driving.

251
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,060
Are you from Korea?

252
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,700
Don't talk anymore.

253
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,140
Just drive carefully, okay?

254
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,500
Chinese.

255
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,100
Oh, Chinese.

256
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,940
Beijing.

257
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,460
Peking duck.

258
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,660
Yeah.

259
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,820
Welcome to Jaya.

260
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,420
We are good friends with the Chinese.

261
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,700
Thank you.

262
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,660
Thank you for today.

263
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,220
Otherwise, it won't be

264
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,300
just a fine.

265
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,420
This watch.

266
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,820
If you like it,

267
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,660
keep one.

268
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,100
You're rich.

269
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,260
Even with a fake watch on,

270
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,460
others still think it's real.

271
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,420
No need, I don't wear watches.

272
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Thanks for giving me a ride today.

273
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,560
Fair enough.

274
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,260
For an old-money heiress like you,

275
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,740
this style is too flashy.

276
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,060
I'm not an heiress.

277
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,860
But you flew in first class.

278
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,260
I didn't pay for the plane ticket.

279
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,740
Of course, you didn't buy it.

280
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,860
No way you'd book it yourself, right?

281
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,460
Judging by your look,
haven't been to Jaya before?

282
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,260
Do you know anyone here?

283
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,980
Sort of.

284
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,540
My mom.

285
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,220
Jaya Island isn't that big.

286
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,900
I know all the wealthy folks.

287
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,060
What does your mom do?

288
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,060
Maybe I know her.

289
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,660
Honestly, I have no idea.

290
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,140
I...

291
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,740
lost contact with her many years ago.

292
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,230
Got it.

293
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,620
These big families'

294
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,740
internal relationships are messy.

295
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,300
No wonder no one's here for you.

296
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,220
I won't ask anymore.

297
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,580
It's not what you think.

298
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,500
I already told you.

299
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,620
My mom passed away.

300
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,340
I thought you made that up.

301
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,260
We're in the old town.

302
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,300
Excuse me,

303
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,940
are you Miss Liu

304
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,460
from Beijing?

305
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,220
Sorry.

306
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,020
Hello,

307
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,780
are you Miss Liu

308
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,620
from Beijing?

309
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,900
That's me. And you are?

310
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,460
I'm the lawyer you spoke with.

311
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,820
I'm handling

312
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,860
your mom's inheritance transfer.

313
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,420
Hello, I'm Kevin.

314
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,380
Hello.

315
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,900
Ms. Liu, this way, please.

316
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,860
Come in, please.

317
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,940
This is Jiang Fang's house?

318
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,620
Yeah, she lived here for ten years.

319
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,900
Only unoccupied

320
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,990
the year before her accident.

321
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,620
My condolences.

322
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,980
Ms. Jiang,

323
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,340
your biological daughter
came to see you.

324
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,300
Jiang Fang.

325
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,140
It's me, Salty.

326
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,660
Only around here can you tell

327
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,750
that Jiang Fang lived here.

328
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,620
Where is she staying now?

329
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,900
She's at the Holy Spirit Cemetery.

330
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,900
Row 5, No. 166.

331
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,700
Excuse me, Ms. Liu,

332
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,020
did you bring
the original lawyer's letter?

333
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,260
Yes, I brought it.

334
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,940
Alright, this way, please.

335
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,500
These are

336
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,260
two third-party notaries

337
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,660
hired by our firm.

338
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,140
Our purpose today

339
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,620
is to confirm the details

340
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,420
regarding your inheritance transfer.

341
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,700
Are you Jiang Fang's daughter?

342
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,940
What did he say?

343
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,260
He asked if this was your mom.

344
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,340
Yes.

345
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,580
Finally, I've found you.

346
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,550
Her debts.

347
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,840
When will you pay them back?

348
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,380
He said that...

349
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,980
he was sorry for your loss

350
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,540
and asked if you wish to receive

351
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,380
the inheritance

352
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,780
soon?

353
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,340
Yes, soon...

354
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,140
Why is it all in English?

355
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,660
Jaya people are tough.

356
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,500
The weather here is too hot.

357
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,220
Refined people like me are rare.

358
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,340
You'll get used to it.

359
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,580
Sign... Sign here.

360
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,420
This inheritance should be processed

361
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,420
in a day or two.

362
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,180
Soon...

363
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,340
Passport and the bank card.

364
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,500
Passport and the bank card.

365
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,260
Offices in Jaya close early.

366
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
They're closed now.

367
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,220
I'll take them
to handle for you.

368
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,420
We'll return them

369
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,820
after making copies in a day or two.

370
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,780
Your bank card can receive

371
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,940
foreign currency, right?

372
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,780
I'm not sure.

373
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,780
There's not much money in this card.

374
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,620
That's not an issue.

375
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,900
I was your mom's lawyer.

376
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,500
I'm obligated to handle this.

377
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Then we'll take our leave now.

378
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,660
Feel free to explore Jaya these days.

379
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,380
Welcome to Jaya.

380
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,420
Thanks.

381
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,460
My condolences.

382
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,220
Kevin!

383
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,820
Did Jiang Fang leave a will?

384
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,620
This huge house is the will.

385
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,900
Bye.

386
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,990
I walked over here.

387
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,380
Everyone else lives in row houses.

388
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,000
Only you got a standalone villa
on the hilltop?

389
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,980
Getting pretty fancy.

390
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,300
Look what I brought you.

391
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,500
Pots, bowls, and utensils.

392
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,380
I figured you might miss them.

393
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,580
Dumplings.

394
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,180
Fennel stuffing.

395
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,420
I ran all over to find fennel.

396
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,500
No idea how it tastes.

397
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,620
Just try it.

398
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,340
It definitely
can't compare to Beijing's.

399
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,300
This Erguotou for you.

400
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,980
Add a little Jaya flavor.

401
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,820
Give it a try.

402
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,940
Wang Yang also sent this for you.

403
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,020
It costs a fair bit.

404
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,700
Spend it carefully.

405
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,780
And this one too.

406
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,140
Your favorite.

407
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,540
Don't know

408
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,700
if you can claim prizes over there.

409
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,420
This one's tough to scratch off.

410
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,300
You scratch it yourself.

411
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,700
Jiang Fang,

412
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,100
didn't you say

413
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,220
once you found a place to settle,

414
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,420
you'd come pick me up?

415
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,620
That's what you said, right?

416
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,540
You left when I was 13.

417
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,500
You didn't even call once

418
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,660
to tell me,

419
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,940
"I'm doing fine now.

420
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,940
You're just dead weight."

421
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,740
Was it so hard?

422
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,140
I knew

423
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,300
I was dead weight.

424
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,100
But Jiang Fang,

425
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,780
you still owe me a cat.

426
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,660
You owe me Chinese New Year's money,

427
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,340
a pair of sneakers,

428
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,420
and my toys.

429
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,100
You owe me so much!

430
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,300
You bought them for me,

431
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,660
then sold them all away.

432
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,300
How will you pay me back?

433
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,220
I'm not a kid anymore. I'm 25 now.

434
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,580
I know this is

435
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,780
a childish thing.

436
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,500
But I still kept it.

437
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,780
What about yours?

438
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,260
Did you sell it or toss it?

439
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,660
Or did you give it away?

440
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,940
I can help you find it.

441
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,300
Did you

442
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,320
bury it with you?

443
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,220
Are you never going to see me again?

444
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,180
What kind of awful place is this?

445
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,500
You don't belong here.

446
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,860
You can't just leave me like this.

447
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,880
You can't!

448
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,200
- What are you doing?
- Let's go home, okay? Jiang Fang.

449
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,610
- Let's go home.
- I'll call the police!

450
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,940
- Don't touch me!
- I'm calling the police!

451
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,780
I'm going to call the police!

452
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,860
Help! Come here!

453
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,740
Don't touch me!

454
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,020
Someone, please, over here!

455
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,860
I'm going to call the police!

456
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,210
So,

457
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,700
based on what you described,

458
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,020
you received inheritance documents

459
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,540
in Beijing.

460
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,800
Then you flew to Jaya yesterday

461
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,980
and gave your passport and bank card

462
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,380
to your mom's lawyer

463
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,860
to process the inheritance.

464
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,700
Miss Liu,

465
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,260
don't you think

466
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,420
something's off here?

467
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,260
I... I know

468
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,420
this sounds

469
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,100
unbelievable.

470
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,420
But I truly did get

471
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,180
a letter from an inheritance lawyer.

472
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,820
The lawyer even used inheritance funds

473
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,940
to buy me a first-class ticket.

474
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,860
That's how I came to Jaya.

475
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,980
We've looked into it.

476
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,260
There's no such law firm

477
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,540
by that name in Jaya.

478
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,060
Impossible.

479
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,820
I've met that lawyer before.

480
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,220
His name is Kevin.

481
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,950
Let's get back to our topic.

482
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,660
Your mom did live in Jaya

483
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,740
for many years.

484
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,220
But according to our records,

485
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,260
her status is...

486
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,580
missing.

487
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,340
There's no proof she's dead.

488
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,860
Sorry...

489
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,820
Jiang Fang is alive?

490
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,140
Where is she now?

491
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,540
Is she still in Jaya?

492
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,860
Here we go again.

493
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,300
Also, surveillance shows

494
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,820
that the guy named Kevin

495
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,860
isn't a lawyer.

496
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,140
He's your...

497
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,220
brother.

498
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
My brother?

499
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,460
I don't have a brother!

500
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,120
I'm the only unlucky child
in this family.

501
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,660
Okay,

502
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,780
so your mom

503
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,300
was once married in Jaya.

504
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,780
The man she married

505
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,860
had a son with him.

506
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,780
His name is Li Zan.

507
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,740
He's 17 now.

508
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,180
Excuse me,

509
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,940
are you Miss Liu?

510
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,780
No wonder

511
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,140
something felt off.

512
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,340
Clumsy

513
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,220
and sneaking around all the time.

514
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,580
You two aren't related by blood,

515
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,820
but under the law,

516
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,380
you two are siblings.

517
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,940
Also, Miss Liu,

518
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,940
your ticket was prepaid
by Grand Sands Casino

519
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,620
for guests.

520
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,220
We've contacted the hotel.

521
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,100
Your passport and bank card

522
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,620
are on file.

523
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,560
You'll still have to pay

524
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,260
for that ticket yourself.

525
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,220
Also, your mom's well-known

526
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,100
at our police station.

527
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,740
She was always in trouble for gambling.

528
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,060
This likely connects to her.

529
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,260
She's still gambling?

530
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,340
Calm down!

531
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,620
My mom's "dead",

532
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,500
then "not dead".

533
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,980
And you're telling me...

534
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,380
so-called brother scammed me?

535
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,940
Now you want me to pay

536
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,060
for this first-class ticket.

537
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,100
Officer,

538
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,380
this is too much.

539
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,100
How am I supposed to stay calm?

540
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,220
I even let

541
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,380
the club's bird go.

542
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,420
Please let me go too.

543
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,500
But when you dug up someone's grave,

544
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,260
did you think about the fallout?

545
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,260
The victim's family and lawyer

546
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,080
are on their way.

547
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,900
Wait,

548
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,580
I'm a victim here, too.

549
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,660
Go find that Kevin.

550
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,940
Bring him here.

551
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,340
He tricked me into coming to Jaya!

552
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,660
Why aren't you going after him?

553
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,060
Why pick on me?

554
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,820
Are you finished?

555
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,540
It seems like

556
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,140
you don't grasp the mess you're in.

557
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,500
You dug up the grave

558
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,940
of Gaodi Group's CEO.

559
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,140
Who?

560
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,300
Her company is famous

561
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,460
in Jaya.

562
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,460
Her son, Mr. He Guangyuan,

563
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,660
is famously filial.

564
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,750
Think about
how you'll explain this to them.

565
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,620
Explain what?

566
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,500
What do I explain

567
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,540
to them?

568
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,580
If you have a lawyer,

569
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,620
I suggest you call them now.

570
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,060
I don't!

571
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,620
I know no one in Jaya.

572
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,580
I didn't know it was their grave!

573
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,420
I...

574
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,420
You...

575
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,020
(Call me and you'll win.
There must be money.)

576
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,780
(Lu Tianchi Legal Advice)

577
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,380
(Must be money)

578
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,700
Hello?

579
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,700
Hello, can I speak to Tang Shuangshuang?

580
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,900
Wrong number.

581
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,430
Could you please tell me

582
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,900
her number?

583
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,740
She gave me

584
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,060
this one.

585
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,980
It's really urgent.

586
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,780
I told you, wrong number.

587
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,180
Please, I'm begging you.

588
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,500
I'm honestly desperate here.

589
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,580
I have to reach her.

590
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,980
Then don't hang up.

591
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,980
Okay, I can wait.

592
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,820
I can wait, really.

593
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:21,220
(Lu Tianchi Legal Advice)

594
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,820
Probably partying.

595
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,420
Who told you to leave?

596
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,540
Get back here!

597
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,750
Sky!

598
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,630
Chi.

599
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,340
Long time no see.

600
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,500
Any music festivals lately?

601
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,360
Yeah.

602
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,900
What about those performance contracts?

603
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,940
Want me to handle them?

604
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,060
Hello?

605
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,740
Hold on a second.

606
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,580
Show some respect

607
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,860
when asking favors.

608
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,540
No, I wasn't rushing you.

609
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,100
Pay back what you owe me last time.

610
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,980
You can pay.

611
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,620
Uncle Lin, put it on Shuangshuang's tab.

612
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,420
Poor Miss Tang, meeting you.

613
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,220
Always slacking off all day.

614
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,740
It's so hot today.

615
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,140
Hello, Miss Tang.

616
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,620
I wasn't talking about you.

617
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,300
Morning.

618
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,940
This one's a gift from a friend.

619
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,300
Absolutely genuine.

620
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,180
I got the rest

621
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,580
from different sources.

622
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,460
Take a look for me?

623
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,620
See anything to improve?

624
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,900
I'll let them know.

625
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,300
What do you think?

626
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,770
Hello.

627
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,420
Weren't we meeting at four?

628
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,140
- Miss me?
- Alright, alright.

629
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,860
It's for you.

630
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,020
It's the middle of the day,

631
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,100
and you're already drinking.

632
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,820
How will we discuss business?

633
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,260
Answer it.

634
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,820
Sorry.

635
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,020
I forgot again.

636
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,220
Someone asked for my number.

637
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,700
I gave them yours without thinking.

638
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,780
Don't forget. Don't call me again. Okay?

639
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,220
That means you're on my mind.

640
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,220
Hello?

641
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
Hello, Miss Tang.

642
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,380
It's me, Liu Yan.

643
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,780
Remember? We met at Jaya Airport.

644
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,220
No, the airport in Beijing.

645
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,260
Miss Liu, here's the thing.

646
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,540
I'm not feeling well right now.

647
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,380
Sorry about that.

648
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,260
Miss Tang, please don't hang up.

649
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,140
It's critical.

650
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,220
I dug up

651
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,940
He... He Guangyuan's

652
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,100
mother's grave.

653
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,660
What?

654
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,140
The He Guangyuan from Gaodi Group?

655
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,460
Well, I didn't know

656
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,140
it was hers.

657
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,180
I can't explain briefly.

658
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,020
How did you two meet?

659
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,500
- On the plane.
- Can you come here now?

660
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,380
First class?

661
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,380
Could you help me out?

662
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,940
Or maybe suggest something else?

663
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,300
I've got no...

664
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,540
no other options.

665
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,820
Miss Liu, here's the thing.

666
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,460
Frankly, with money,

667
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,540
hiring a Jaya lawyer

668
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,580
is very...

669
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,420
Hello, is this Miss Liu?

670
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,260
Hello,

671
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,860
my name is Lu Tianchi.

672
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,660
I can provide

673
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,900
full legal consultancy

674
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,980
and assistance in Jaya.

675
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,300
Clear prices, no tricks at all.

676
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,860
That's a steep price.

677
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,060
Your case

678
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,500
isn't simple.

679
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,300
You've provoked

680
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,860
Gaodi Group.

681
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,540
Money can't fix this kind of thing.

682
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,420
Of course,

683
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,300
I've already

684
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,180
bought you time

685
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,860
through professional means.

686
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,980
Right now,

687
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,500
you should use it wisely.

688
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,700
Can you really solve this for sure?

689
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,620
Without Miss Tang,

690
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,500
I wouldn't even take such a small case.

691
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,300
Deal?

692
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,820
Deal.

693
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,300
Wipe your face first.

694
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,100
Here, wipe it off.

695
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,380
Here. Hug this.

696
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,980
Do exactly as I say.

697
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,460
Prepare carefully.

698
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,100
Mr. He.

699
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,900
Hello, are you Mr. He's lawyer?

700
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,100
And you are?

701
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,620
I'm a friend of Liu Yan.

702
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,700
My client, Miss Liu Yan,

703
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,340
is from Xiya.

704
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,700
They dig up

705
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,100
relatives' remains

706
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,860
to spend a day

707
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,540
with their belongings.

708
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,140
It's like

709
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,300
the deceased never left.

710
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,580
It's about remembrance.

711
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,060
Her mom was a chef.

712
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,820
So she took the kitchen tools

713
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,620
to honor her. Fitting, right?

714
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,900
Her background resembles Mr. He's.

715
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,660
Miss Liu Yan holds

716
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,580
a Chinese passport.

717
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,820
Since when is she from Xiya?

718
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,220
It's because of her mom,

719
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,180
who holds a Chinese passport.

720
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,260
Her dad is from Xiya.

721
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
She wanted the Xiya Consulate

722
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,860
to handle this here.

723
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,500
But I convinced her.

724
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,820
I think

725
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,780
it's for your client's sake.

726
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,420
Mr. He's mother

727
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,700
trending repeatedly

728
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,220
isn't ideal, right?

729
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,180
We apologize

730
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,580
for this mistake.

731
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,060
But I hope you can understand

732
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,460
her longing.

733
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,740
Here, take a look.

734
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,100
The pot she's holding

735
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,940
belonged

736
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,180
to her mom.

737
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,020
She did it to show her love for her mom

738
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,120
and how much she missed her.

739
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,020
She tried to defy

740
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,060
time and space

741
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,940
to love relentlessly.

742
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,060
I think this spirit

743
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,780
can move us all.

744
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,820
So, honestly,

745
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,980
I think reconciliation is best.

746
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,660
Especially someone like Mr. He,

747
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,900
who is so devoted to his family.

748
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,620
He wouldn't crush
a daughter's love, right?

749
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,500
None of this

750
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,860
would impede our legal work.

751
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,540
This demands serious handling.

752
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,460
Desecration of remains

753
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,860
and intentional property damage.

754
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,580
The harsher one
could mean a year in jail.

755
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,140
I didn't expect Mr. He's lawyer

756
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,140
to stay professional

757
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,460
amid such devotion

758
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,100
between mom and daughter.

759
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,180
So professional.

760
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,780
I really respect that.

761
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,140
Mr. He said

762
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,900
he understood.

763
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,140
So...

764
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,660
That fast?

765
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,980
It all wrapped up in five minutes.

766
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,340
Don't question my skills, okay?

767
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,180
We bill

768
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,620
by the minute.

769
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,460
Actually, I've...

770
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,060
Mr. He.

771
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,260
Goodbye.

772
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
What just happened?

773
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,220
Why'd you make me smile, wiping a pot

774
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,260
like an idiot?

775
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,270
No issues.

776
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,460
Don't ask.

777
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,380
It got settled so fast.

778
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,980
You really charged me a lot.

779
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,020
Are you scamming me? I'll ask...

780
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,820
No...

781
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,140
My work efficiency.

782
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,980
Got it?

783
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,060
Alright. How do you want to pay?

784
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,340
WeChat, Alipay,

785
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
or credit card?

786
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,220
Scan here.

787
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,380
Can I pay in installments?

788
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,540
I'll repay you

789
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,780
after finding work in Beijing.

790
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,260
Stop joking.

791
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,900
Weren't you in first class?

792
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,100
First-class folks need installments?

793
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,700
Didn't the police tell you?

794
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,660
Li Zan

795
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,980
booked

796
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,980
that ticket

797
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,340
under my name.

798
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,180
Casinos lure gamblers

799
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,980
with prepaid tickets and hotels.

800
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,860
They pay with their lives in Jaya.

801
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,220
I'm really out of money.

802
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,620
I don't even have my passport now.

803
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,820
- I'll show you...
- You...

804
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
You can't dodge me.

805
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,660
I've met plenty just like you.

806
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,820
I think you can...

807
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,180
I've worked hard helping you.

808
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,380
Why are you running off?

809
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,350
You're pretty fierce, huh?

810
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,060
- Let go!
- I won't!

811
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,180
Pay first!

812
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,460
You can't be short even one cent.

813
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,420
You're no saint.
You're exploiting people!

814
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,900
Don't try to wriggle out of this.

815
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,380
- Let go.
- Pay first!

816
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,340
Hand over the money.

817
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,620
If you don't, I'm not letting go.

818
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,880
That's all I got. Take it or leave it.

819
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,940
- Let go!
- No way.

820
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,780
500.

821
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,830
No.

822
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,610
- 2,000. Not a cent less.
- 500.

823
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,500
No way. 2,000.

824
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,820
- 500!
- 2,000!

825
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,260
500...

826
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,460
1,000...

827
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,540
500.

828
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,500
What are you doing?

829
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,100
What are you doing? Filming?

830
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,580
No fighting.

831
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,100
Break it up. Move along.

832
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,180
What are you staring at?

833
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,260
Looks sweet, right?

834
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,060
If you like it,

835
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,100
I can send you a copy.

836
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,950
Like? What are you saying?

837
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,940
Are you out of your mind?

838
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,140
Why did you delete it?

839
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,980
No filming.

840
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,660
I'll report you.

841
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,140
I'm in a rush, hurry up.

842
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,060
I'll send it to you now.

843
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,500
Done.

844
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,980
Smart move.

845
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,780
Good eye.

846
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,980
You brat.

847
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:01,760
Say it.

848
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,300
If you don't tell me where she is today,

849
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,090
