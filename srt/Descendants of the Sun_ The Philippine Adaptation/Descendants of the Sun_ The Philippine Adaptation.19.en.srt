1
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,916
Just relax. Don't worry next time,

2
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,853
I will not steal a kiss
nor will surprise you

3
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,955
-for we'll be a couple by then.
-Wow.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,259
I'm going to town later.
I'll buy medicine for your wounds.

5
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,627
<i>Greg will take care of that.</i>

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,496
<i>We are running out of funds.</i>

7
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,730
<i>Time to do some collections.</i>

8
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,065
<i>Oh, no. That's danger.</i>

9
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:36,002
Moira might end up with someone else
because you keep avoiding her.

10
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,504
I'm just a fan of "GoRa".

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,272
-"GoRa"?
-Diego-Moira.

12
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,374
Doc, it's better if you obey the Captain.

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,309
You should go back to the camp.
You're safer there.

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,779
You mean Lucas is in danger right now?

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,747
-Greg.
-Long time no see, Bok.

16
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,282
What are you doing here in Urdan?

17
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,251
I lend money, with interest.

18
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,019
It looks like you've been here
in Urdan for a long time.

19
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,221
Do you know about the movements
of PRG here?

20
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:59,259
How can I not worry
when risking his life is part of the job?

21
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,707
-Maxine?
-Lucas, help me, please.

22
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:18,011
Please, I don't want to die.
Please come here. Please.

23
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,648
What are you doing?

24
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,818
We will really fall!
What's with you, Lucas?

25
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:28,888
Maxine, the car is too heavy.
We will slide off the rocks.

26
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,024
This is the only way for us to get out.

27
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,325
How?

28
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,299
Don't move a lot.

29
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,201
What are we going to do, Lucas?

30
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,404
Maxine…

31
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,407
I won't let go of you, okay?

32
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,510
You will not die.
I'll get you out of here.

33
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,613
-What? I'm scared.
-This is the only way, Maxine.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,281
Take your foot off the brake.

35
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,317
-I don't want to.
-Release the brake, Maxine.

36
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,451
I don't want to!

37
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,887
Lucas, what are you doing?

38
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,989
Are you hurt?

39
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,692
No.

40
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,298
Let's go back to the camp so you can rest.

41
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,700
What? What did you say?

42
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,171
You're unbelievable! Are you a robot?

43
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,275
Can't you see I'm still weak?
I'm not used to these things.

44
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,880
My heart is beating fast.

45
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,451
What are you doing to me?

46
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,222
Why is it like this?

47
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,490
So, I make your heart beat faster?

48
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,632
Lucas, what are you doing?

49
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,669
Just because you saved me
and our lips touched,

50
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,904
does not mean you can do this.

51
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,772
I don't want to. I don't want that, Lucas.

52
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,642
I'm just giving you this to wear.

53
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,112
Your blouse is wet
and I can see through it.

54
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,015
Give me that!

55
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,706
Dr. Maxine and Captain Lucas are back.

56
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,875
I think something happened to them.

57
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,543
They were soaking wet.

58
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,845
They went for a swim?

59
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,383
Please inform Dr. Maxine
that the patient on bed number 5

60
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,717
is ready for discharge, okay?

61
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,687
-Nurse Emma, kindly process.
-Yes, Doc.

62
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,523
Doc Maxine is on her way
back for her shift.

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,994
Why?

64
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,030
Don't you want Dr. Maxine to come back?

65
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,935
No, not really.

66
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,371
Well, I like Dr. Moira.

67
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,074
I mean, there's something
I'd like to ask Dr. Moira.

68
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,210
That's why I want to talk to her.

69
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,812
What is it you want to ask?

70
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,818
If she's happy being a military doctor.

71
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,255
because you know,
I'm interested. That's all.

72
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,891
You're interested in being
a military doctor

73
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,293
or interested in a military doctor?

74
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,601
Interested in being a military doctor.

75
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:40,573
That's good. We need more people like you.

76
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,809
We need a lot of doctors.

77
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:50,750
Well, if I get in, can you mentor me?

78
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,386
Of course.

79
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,690
Captain Defensor.

80
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,694
Sergeant Ramos, is there a problem?

81
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,464
My wound needs cleaning.

82
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,099
I don't trust…

83
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,267
Talledo.

84
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,170
Okay, I'll clean it myself.

85
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,272
Nurse Emma, please.

86
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,208
Thank you.

87
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,452
Thank you for saving me earlier.

88
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,724
I don't know if you normally do that,
but put yourself in danger because of me.

89
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,329
But nothing happened to us, right?
We're fine.

90
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,299
We even had time to swim.

91
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,771
But don't you realize,
it's a good thing I'm a soldier.

92
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,606
What if I was really an accountant?

93
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,443
I probably wouldn't know
what to do in that situation.

94
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:29,916
You still joke after what happened.
But seriously, thank you.

95
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,920
I don't know what would've happened
to me if you weren't there.

96
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,625
There's something I want to ask you.

97
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,196
Where did you go earlier?

98
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,731
You look after Doc,
I just have to check something outside.

99
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,200
Why? What is it? Will it take long?

100
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,835
-You head to camp.
-I still have a shift.

101
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,304
I'll leave the car keys with you.
I'll meet you there.

102
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,806
Okay.

103
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:59,178
Daniel told me I shouldn't follow you.
It's dangerous.

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,314
It was nothing.

105
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,068
Moira,

106
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,905
Please stop encouraging Dr. Ralph
to enter the training.

107
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,744
I'm telling you, he will not get past me.

108
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,346
Why is that?

109
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,114
Look at him.

110
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,551
He's such a pretty boy. He's a weakling.

111
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,387
Ask him to do drills.
Let's see how long he can take it.

112
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,822
Are you jealous?

113
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,224
What I'm saying is,

114
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,095
he's no good for you, okay?

115
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,097
You will get bored with someone like him.

116
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,332
Do you want something
that does not challenge you?

117
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,003
Is that why you're playing hard to get?

118
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,338
To challenge me?

119
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,076
Don't worry,

120
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,849
because the one I want
is already in front of me.

121
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,025
Ramos.

122
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:19,992
Sir.

123
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:21,994
We need you there.

124
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,307
I saw Greg Abad in town earlier.

125
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:35,775
Greg Abad…

126
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,245
your former buddy?

127
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,348
You weren't able to meet him.

128
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:47,219
Greg quit from service
a long time ago after an encounter.

129
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,889
He was your buddy? So you were very close.

130
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,457
We were like brothers.

131
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,326
What did I tell you?

132
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,095
You will inevitably cross paths
with your former buddy.

133
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,264
So, was he suspicious of you?

134
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,068
He is very sharp,
a highly skilled soldier.

135
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,639
But of course, I'm better.

136
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,712
Don't worry, Bullet. I misled him.

137
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,115
He's not the same Greg
that I used to know.

138
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,919
There's something different about him.

139
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,254
Sir, we can contact our other asset.

140
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,190
Maybe they know something about him.

141
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,860
Are you thinking he's connected
with the PRG here in Urdan?

142
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,162
He has a point.

143
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,265
He's been out of the military
for a long time.

144
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,368
That's not impossible.

145
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,070
Does he know something about
at happened with General Manalo?

146
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,540
Even if we used to be buddies,

147
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,610
If he has something to do
with what happened to my father,

148
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,314
then I can never forgive him.

149
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,032
So, here you go.

150
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,335
Just put it in Channel 7,
that's the channel of the medical team.

151
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:15,441
Just press it, wait for a second,
and you can talk already.

152
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,978
Why do we need this again?

153
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,048
In cases of emergency
like what happened to Dr. Maxine.

154
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,817
We can contact you
even if there's no mobile signal,

155
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,985
because it's a radio.

156
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,922
If that's the case,
we don't need a walkie-talkie.

157
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,590
What we need is to go home.

158
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,625
What?

159
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,760
Well, Via is right.

160
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,897
We've gotten into trouble
countless times in this place.

161
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,701
Doctor, maybe we can ask Dr. Chavez.

162
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,036
Let's cut short this medical mission.

163
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:48,074
We still have scheduled activities
and the people of Urdan are expecting us.

164
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,974
That's right.

165
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,044
In a few weeks, our medical mission
will be over. Then, we can go home.

166
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,748
That's right.
Just be more patient. I got your backs.

167
00:11:55,815 --> 00:12:01,787
Our new toys will go to waste.

168
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,391
I know what to do.
Let's choose our call signs.

169
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,525
Call sign?

170
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,429
Call sign. It's what you use
when talking over the radio,

171
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,666
just like code names.

172
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,838
I think I know a code name that suits you.

173
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,107
How do they call you here again?

174
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,208
How?

175
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,644
Oh, come on.
Doc Beauty is feigning ignorance.

176
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,082
Let me try it.

177
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,084
Let's try it.

178
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,954
-This button, right?
-Yes.

179
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,395
How are you doing?

180
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,823
Wow, it suits you.

181
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:14,693
Nice.

182
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:27,173
Our asset doesn't know Greg.
But he provided information about PRG.

183
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,441
They are scheduled to return
to Sitio Santos,

184
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,510
and they are asking money
from the residents.

185
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,648
Maybe that's what Greg was doing
when you saw him in town, Big Boss.

186
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,582
Seems like it.

187
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,186
If that's the case, it's possible
that they're in Sitio Santos.

188
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,621
We can catch them in the act.

189
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,290
We will block their operations.

190
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:48,394
They should stop abusing
the people of Sitio Santos.

191
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,838
Lucas…

192
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,942
you're leaving?

193
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,581
We'll patrol around Sitio Santos…

194
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,584
for peacekeeping.

195
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,555
Rodel, be careful, okay?

196
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,824
They are the ones who
should be careful of me.

197
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,758
Oh, wow.

198
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm serious. Please, be careful.

199
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,598
Of course.

200
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,837
What was the last thing my brother
told me before he was deployed,

201
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,340
but he never returned.

202
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,042
Maxine.

203
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,979
Be careful,

204
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:42,982
Lucas.

205
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,621
Hey, are you alright?
Why don't you sit first.

206
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,658
What is it?

207
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,694
Is Junior giving you a hard time?

208
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,062
Junior?

209
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:36,101
I told you, I can feel our baby is a girl.

210
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,339
Oh no. I'm dead.

211
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,041
Happy days are over.

212
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,376
I'll have to devote my time
to keeping an eye on her.

213
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,512
You've had experience, right?

214
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,149
You took care of your sister
when you were growing up.

215
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,687
Too bad, I haven't met her.

216
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,058
Don't worry, we'll get there.

217
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,729
We can go to Manila
once things are settled here.

218
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,065
We'll bring our baby with us.

219
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:10,502
And then, I'll introduce you
to my family and to Maxine.

220
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,075
And you, my baby, will study in Manila.

221
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,012
You'll be a good doctor
just like your Aunt Maxine.

222
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,483
Our family will be complete.

223
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,490
-Why?
-It hurts, Rodel.

224
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:32,958
What?

225
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,128
-It hurts so much.
-What?

226
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,530
Rodel, take me to a doctor.

227
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,699
I can't take you there.
It's too dangerous.

228
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,768
Rodel, something might happen to our baby.

229
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,802
Tong!

230
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,138
Tong!

231
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,541
Tong! Come here.

232
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,345
Take your Madame Janet to a healer.

233
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,548
A healer? Come on, Rodel.

234
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,684
Janet, I'm sorry but…

235
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,320
It's safer there than the Medicube.

236
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,155
The healer in Sitio Santos is good.

237
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,123
Come on, let's go.

238
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,129
Take her to the healer and come back soon.

239
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,418
There's a lot of people here.

240
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,155
Big Boss, this is the hideout
mentioned by our asset.

241
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,790
There are no other options.

242
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,596
We have to be careful.

243
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,800
Make sure there will be
no civilians involved.

244
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,346
Someone's coming.

245
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,184
I can no longer wait, Tong.

246
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,885
My stomach hurts!

247
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,922
Okay, ma'am, I'll talk
to the healer inside.

248
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,989
Please stay here.

249
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,691
Okay.

250
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,328
How far along are you in your pregnancy?

251
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,864
Five. Five months.

252
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,203
Oh, my god! You're bleeding.

253
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,672
Please, bring me to the doctor.

254
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,507
I don't want to lose my baby.

255
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,342
I'm begging you.

256
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,044
Have mercy!

257
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,913
I'll bring her to the Medicube.

258
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,814
What?

259
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,350
The healer needs you here.

260
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,852
I'll take care of Miss…

261
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,321
Janet… Janet is my name.

262
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,157
Please bring me to the doctor. Let's go.

263
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,668
You know what to do in Sitio Santos.

264
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,070
We won't fail, Rodel.

265
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,906
Has Janet returned?

266
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,214
Tong, didn't I tell you to come back soon?

267
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,350
We have an operation there.

268
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,654
What?

269
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,123
What the…

270
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,260
Janet is missing.

271
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,062
I'm going with you. I'll look for my wife!

272
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,279
The healer's patients are leaving.

273
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,748
That's good, so they won't get involved.

274
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,251
We've been here for a while
but there's no sign of PRG yet.

275
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,155
What if they got a tip
that there are soldiers here?

276
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,164
We'll check the perimeter.

277
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,366
Randy, come with me.

278
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,327
Let's put our masks on.

279
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,967
Pistol will take care of you.

280
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,402
-You're not coming?
-No.

281
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,538
I need to find Janet.

282
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,876
Let's go.

283
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,861
Help!

284
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,563
Help!

285
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,499
-Help!
-What happened?

286
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,202
I'm begging you, help me and my baby.

287
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,304
She needs a doctor.

288
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,239
-Let's go to the Medicube.
-Come on, help me.

289
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,678
Janet…

290
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,717
Janet…

291
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,586
Janet?

292
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,790
You think one person can save you?

293
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,693
Hey, maybe you've forgotten?

294
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,061
This is our territory!

295
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:44,936
Janet?

296
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,773
My baby…

297
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,441
Help me and my baby!

298
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,342
Where is the doctor?

299
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,576
-Please calm down.
-Doc!

300
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,711
-The doctor is on her way.
-Doc!

301
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,579
She's on her way.
I'll get your blood pressure.

302
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,983
-Just relax.
-I'll get your blood pressure.

303
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,484
Where is Doc?

304
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,286
-Doc…
-She's on her way.

305
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,588
Just relax.

306
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:05,891
Janet!

307
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,128
Janet!

308
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,232
Janet…

309
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,535
Janet…

310
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,337
I don't think
who you're looking for is here.

311
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:23,975
Hands up.

312
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,882
She's coming.

313
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,417
She's here. The doctor is here.

314
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,685
-What happened?
-Doc…

315
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,221
Doc, save my baby.

316
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,090
What are the vitals?

317
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:42,494
Her blood pressure is 160/90.
Her heart rate is 90 bpm.

318
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,198
Hands up.

319
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,437
Sir, I'm just looking for my wife.
She's pregnant. She needs me.

320
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,377
I would've believed you
if I didn't recognize your voice.

321
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,012
We've met already.

322
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,216
I even gave you that injury.

323
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,496
Turn around.

324
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,297
I don't know what you're
talking about, sir.

325
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,833
-Turn around.
-What if I don't turn around?

326
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,402
Will you shoot me?

327
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,805
Sir, you can't hurt a civilian.

328
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,774
Let's cut to the chase.
You're not a civilian.

329
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,009
You can't go far because you're limping.

330
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,411
Turn around!

331
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,478
Sir…

332
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,460
Even if you arrest me,
you don't have anything against me.

333
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,661
Turn around.

334
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,230
You talk too much.

335
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,065
Turn around!

336
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,935
Attack!

337
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,016
Enemies!

338
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,812
Snoopy, what's your situation?

339
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,248
Big Boss, we're still here.

340
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,816
There are PRG Members outside.

341
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,686
We're being ambushed.
I repeat, we're being ambushed!

342
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:01,766
Sheila!

343
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:05,971
Get down!

344
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,539
Bullets can get through the walls.

345
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,440
Get down!

346
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:09,708
Where is Biboy?

347
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:14,446
He's still in the camp.
Good thing our son is not here.

348
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,515
Let's stay here.

349
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,783
Let's not go out.

350
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,558
Doc?

351
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,795
Biboy… thank you for bringing her here.

352
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:32,764
You did the right thing.

353
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,965
That's nothing, Doc.

354
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,803
Well, it's already late.

355
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,639
Why don't you stay the night?

356
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,040
Just go home tomorrow.

357
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,243
Marty, take care of him.
Please feed the boy.

358
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,444
Yes, doctor.

359
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,346
Okay. Thank you, Doc Beauty.

360
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:53,518
Do you know where she lives?
Or, do you know her family?

361
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,886
Sorry, I don't.

362
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,165
What can you say, Bullet?

363
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,269
This is the end of the Special Forces Team
that they brag about.

364
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,511
Wolf, this is Big Boss. Come in.

365
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,581
We're at nine o'clock.
What's your position?

366
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,493
Big Boss is here!

367
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,162
Snoopy, can you still make it?

368
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,599
I can. Come on, let's end this!

369
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,444
Damn it!

370
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,381
If only I wasn't injured,
Manalo would be dead by now.

371
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,849
We need to go.

372
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,084
We're in danger here.

373
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,785
For sure they'll patrol the perimeter.

374
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,256
Big Boss is coming.

375
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,767
Big Boss, Snoopy is wounded.

376
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,076
-Let's go. Can you walk?
-I can.

377
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,144
Let's go.

378
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,284
Your blood pressure is high,

379
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,453
according to your test results,

380
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,156
the protein count in your urine is high.

381
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,692
What does that mean, Doc?

382
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,229
These are signs of preeclampsia.

383
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,735
It can put you and your baby in danger.

384
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:53,638
What?

385
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,941
But don't worry,

386
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,678
we'll take care of you here
in the hospital.

387
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,147
But you have to stay here,

388
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:06,351
so we can monitor your vitals
and the condition of your baby, okay?

389
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,388
Take care of yourself for your baby, okay?

390
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,159
What's important is
we already know your condition.

391
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:20,331
Now, we can take care of you
and help deliver your baby safely, okay?

392
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,867
Thank you very much, Doc.

393
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,705
What's your name again, Doc?

394
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:53,565
Captain Manalo and I knew that
something was wrong with the operation.

395
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,166
It was me. This is my fault.

396
00:28:56,167 --> 00:29:00,905
Lucas, that made me realize that
I can't stand that kind of life,

397
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,875
where I am always worried and scared.

398
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,178
You said you'll wait for my next move.

399
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,314
This is it.

400
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,716
-Let's have lunch together?
-I'll wait for you in the mess hall.

401
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,885
-You patched things up?
-You got back together?

402
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,487
-Since when?
-How?

403
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:16,855
<i>I knew it.</i>

404
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,456
Did you know that I looked
for you everywhere?

405
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,291
I did this for our baby.

406
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,260
You're in the territory of our enemies.

407
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,795
<i>What if they find out about you?</i>

408
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,330
No one will suspect me here.

409
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,665
No one will arrest me here.

410
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:28,967
Madame…

411
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,137
are you okay?

412
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,738
Is there a problem?

413
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,242
Marty!
