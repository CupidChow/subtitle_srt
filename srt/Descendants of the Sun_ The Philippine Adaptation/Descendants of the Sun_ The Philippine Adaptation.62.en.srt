1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,547
-They are the ones who attacked us.
-Confirmed. It's Greg.

2
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,517
Pistol, you animal!
Don't drag my sister into this!

3
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,785
Don't worry, Bullet.

4
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,620
It will just be a quick exchange.

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,190
Your head for your sister's head.

6
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,192
Whoever among you here is the traitor,

7
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,928
tell your boss that I'm coming for him.

8
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,008
Where is Maxine?

9
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,376
I did not take Maxine.

10
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,712
-My former men took her.
-Hey.

11
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,548
Careful with your next move.

12
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,452
Take care of them.

13
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,763
Big Boss, this is Snoopy.
I'm behind you. Seven o'clock.

14
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,800
The transmitter is on Doc Maxine's
right shoulder.

15
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,202
Once it's destroyed,
the detonator will be useless.

16
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,605
Run!

17
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,081
Snoopy, go with Maxine.

18
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,416
Lucas.

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,458
You really are a traitor, Greg.

20
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:35,495
I know you were with Bullet
when you kidnapped my father.

21
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,664
His anger towards your father
was very personal to him.

22
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,265
There was nothing I could have done.

23
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,101
It doesn't matter.
We got our revenge, right?

24
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,270
-His sister, the doctor, already exploded.
-That's where you're wrong.

25
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,872
Maxine is safe.

26
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,575
She's with the best bomb expert
in the army.

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,545
So if I were you, just surrender.

28
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,782
<i>I'd rather die than surrender.</i>

29
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,421
Don't!

30
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,679
Buddy.

31
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,949
It doesn't have to end this way.

32
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,086
I know you.

33
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,456
You can still change.

34
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,527
Buddy.

35
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,531
You don't really know me.

36
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,335
Maybe this is who I really am.

37
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,373
I have no regrets.

38
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,741
Just surrender!

39
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,843
You're all by yourself.

40
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:35,682
Pistol and I will make sure
that you will all die tonight!

41
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,713
Whatever you and your boss are planning
is not gonna happen!

42
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,614
It's over!

43
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,816
Pistol is already dead.

44
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,191
Big Boss foiled his plans.

45
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,760
Just surrender!

46
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,869
Show yourself!

47
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,720
It's okay.

48
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,188
You're safe now.

49
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:54,193
How about you? The Alpha Team?
Lucas and Diego, where are they?

50
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,962
They are strong.

51
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,964
Don't worry about them.

52
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,302
My brother?
Do you know where my brother is?

53
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,807
-Let go of my sister!
-Brother! Snoopy.

54
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,516
Maxine, let's go.

55
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,851
Doc!

56
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,328
Bullet took Maxine.

57
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,330
<i>I repeat. Bullet took Maxine.</i>

58
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:32,191
Brother, enough. Let me go.
I don't want to go with you.

59
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,793
-Brother!
-Bullet!

60
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,929
Bullet, let Maxine go.

61
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,433
If she doesn't want to go with you,
let her go.

62
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,391
Brother, enough.

63
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,226
Enough!

64
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,598
Brother, just let us go.

65
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,170
I want to go home, brother.
I want to go back to Manila.

66
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,640
Just let us leave, please.

67
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,480
-Maxine, stay out of this!
-Rodel, I can't go with you.

68
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,649
I can't die here.

69
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,620
Think about our mom.

70
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,822
I'm the only one she has.

71
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,293
You left us, remember?

72
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,832
You left your family
because of what you're fighting for.

73
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,270
But is there still something
you are fighting for?

74
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,640
Or are you just after revenge?

75
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,148
Rodel!

76
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,243
Can't you really let go
of your anger for my sake?

77
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,947
For your sister?

78
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,588
Don't worry, brother. I understand you.

79
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,959
I know you really love your job
as a soldier.

80
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,795
I will support you all the way.

81
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,565
Rodel, you are my brother.

82
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,501
<i>Of course, I won't abandon you.</i>

83
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,172
My brother.

84
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,178
Brother please, just let me go.

85
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,614
Just leave me and Lucas alone.

86
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,786
I will just pray that…

87
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,189
you will come back to me and Mom.

88
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,168
Someday, our family
will be complete again.

89
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,608
Piccolo, let's back up Big Boss.

90
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,777
Harry Potter, take care of Snoopy.

91
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,173
-Go ahead and gang up on me!
-No! No!

92
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,441
You bastards can't kill me!

93
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,844
-No!
-Brother!

94
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,512
Brother!

95
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,682
You are a traitor, Maxine!

96
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:57,917
Brother!

97
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,419
You are a worthless sister!

98
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,555
-Don't!
-Brother!

99
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,559
Lucas needs treatment!

100
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,574
Snoopy lost a lot of blood.

101
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,717
Lucas, you too.
We need to take you to the Medicube.

102
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,454
Doc, I already called for backup.

103
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,889
They are coming.

104
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,759
Harry Potter, Piccolo.

105
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,863
Go with Snoopy and Maxine
to the Medicube.

106
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,799
Wolf and I will stay behind.

107
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,934
What? Lucas.

108
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,436
I'm fine, Maxine.
This is only a flesh wound.

109
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,505
Diego and I still have work to do.

110
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,607
No. Let's leave. Let's go.

111
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,410
Maxine, I'm the leader of the Alpha Team.

112
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,248
And besides, Snoopy needs your help.

113
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,298
We'll be right behind you.

114
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,203
I will not let you miss me
too much, okay?

115
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,383
We'll wait for you at the Medicube.

116
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,461
Be careful.

117
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,066
Be careful.

118
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,208
We've been looking for you.

119
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,444
-Are you wounded?
-No.

120
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,347
The Alpha Team are all here.

121
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,749
But they are weak. They are wounded.

122
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,818
We can attack them.

123
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,586
But how about your sister?

124
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,221
Is she not with them?

125
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,858
She already chose sides.
I no longer have a sister.

126
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,164
There's Manalo.

127
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,066
He's with his right-hand man.

128
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,204
Get ready.

129
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,340
We will finish them.

130
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,890
Big Boss, run!

131
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,923
Go to the window facing the cliff.

132
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,198
It looks like there's nothing left.

133
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,634
I think the Alpha Team has been destroyed.

134
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,259
Let's go.

135
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,967
-Doc Maxine?
-Gun shot on the right leg.

136
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,037
Gun shot on the right leg.
He lost a lot of blood.

137
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,638
We'll take care of him, Maxine.

138
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,747
Doc Maxine?

139
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,716
Are you okay?

140
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,119
Are you hurt? Are you wounded?

141
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,055
Doc, we're so worried about you.

142
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,294
What happened, Maxine?

143
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,730
Where is Lucas? And Diego?

144
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:21,727
It will be difficult for us to identify
which among the bodies are of our enemies.

145
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,063
Wolf and Big Boss are not here.

146
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,433
Where are they?

147
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,577
Sir.

148
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,718
Don't worry, Maxine.

149
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:24,223
I'm sure they found a way
to save themselves from the explosion.

150
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,560
I've known Diego and Lucas
for a long time.

151
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:34,166
They always face danger,
but they also managed to get through.

152
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:41,473
So, we have nothing to worry about
because they are good soldiers.

153
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,554
Where is Diego and Lucas?

154
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,223
Where are they?
Are they in the Medicube?

155
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,495
Answer us.

156
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,240
What is that?

157
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,245
They found these
along with the two bodies.

158
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,649
It's hard to conclude
if they're Captain Manalo

159
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,851
and Technical Sergeant Ramos.

160
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,724
With the force of the explosion,

161
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,694
-the bodies were severely burned…
-No.

162
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,231
That's not Diego.

163
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,172
It will take a while before they can
identify all the victims of the explosion.

164
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,009
This can't be Diego.

165
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,545
It can't be Diego.

166
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,982
No, it can't be Diego.

167
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,884
No.

168
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,252
No.

169
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,026
Diego.

170
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,832
It can't be Diego, right?

171
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,468
No.

172
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,791
No.

173
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,302
No.

174
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,340
It's not Diego.

175
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:25,170
Nurse Emma and Nurse Via were given orders
to pack your things.

176
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,408
Doc, it's better if we just leave.

177
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,177
Let's just wait for updates in Manila.

178
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:36,181
No. We're not leaving.

179
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,550
Give me that.

180
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,018
Give it to me.

181
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,020
No one will leave.

182
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,022
Captain Defensor.

183
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,795
You need to report to Camp Aguinaldo.

184
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,932
You are no longer safe here.

185
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,334
Especially you, Doctor Dela Cruz.

186
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:01,006
You said your brother is very mad at you
and you are his target.

187
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,308
You are not the only one
who could be in danger.

188
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,612
It's also the camp
and your patients in the Medicube.

189
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,449
How about Lucas?

190
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,985
Where are they right now?
What will happen to them?

191
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,922
You're not even sure
if you have found their bodies.

192
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,326
We will update you wherever you may be.

193
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,164
I'm in charge here.

194
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,502
No.

195
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,138
You can't just send us away.

196
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:40,679
Doctor, I won't hesitate to use force
if you will not follow my order.

197
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,516
I know what happened
is difficult for you.

198
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:49,654
But I have to think about the safety
of the entire camp.

199
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,425
So, I suggest you just cooperate.

200
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,837
Is there really no update yet?

201
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,339
Colonel Garcia is probably
annoyed with me already.

202
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,941
What?

203
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,410
Haven't they returned yet?

204
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,847
We found that along
with Technical Sergeant Ramos' stuff.

205
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,181
What is the meaning of this?

206
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,917
<i>I'm still not losing hope.</i>

207
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:55,253
As long as they are not sure
it was their bodies that were found,

208
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,322
I won't believe they are dead.

209
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,394
It is the team's practice
to write a letter to our loved ones

210
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,896
before a mission or assignment.

211
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,965
Just in case something ever happens.
