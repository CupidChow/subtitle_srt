1
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:15,048
The pregnant lady they're calling "Madame"
is Janet.

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,018
The leader of PRG is dead.

3
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,719
This shouldn't happen.

4
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,223
No one should die just because
they fight for what they believe in.

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,059
<i>Finally, we succeeded.</i>

6
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,161
Any news? Was it Janet?

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,896
It's Janet.

8
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,465
-I thought it's already a closed case.
-Not yet.

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,734
You need to face
the repercussions of your actions.

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,369
And you too, Ramos.

11
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:40,106
You are immediately relieved
of your services here in Urdan.

12
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,308
I'm going back to Manila at midnight.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,377
The conflict here is not yet over.

14
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,213
I cannot stay any longer
even if I want to.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,049
<i>It's the CO himself who gave the orders.</i>

16
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,020
Are you afraid
you won't see each other again?

17
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:03,096
Where is Dr. Maxine? I need to talk to her
before I return to Manila.

18
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,331
Captain Lucas has been looking for you.

19
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,134
-Why?
-They're leaving Urdan tonight.

20
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,103
Go, see him. Hurry.

21
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,710
It's all my fault.

22
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,413
There was trouble because of me.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,285
You got involved, your men,
Janet and her baby.

24
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,921
Maxine, everything happened for a reason.

25
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,691
It proved that you were right.

26
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,959
I am right?

27
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,162
Right about what?

28
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,731
That we are not really meant
for each other.

29
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,569
I'm a soldier and you're a doctor.

30
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,473
We won't really get along.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,208
You're a good soldier.

32
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,179
I was wrong before.
It was wrong for me to judge you.

33
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,854
Lucas, don't leave me, please.

34
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,060
This is what I have been telling you.

35
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,629
This will always happen.

36
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,432
This is my job.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,169
This is part of my job as a soldier.

38
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,939
I will always have to leave.
I will go wherever I'm needed.

39
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,843
I will always leave.
I will always say goodbye...

40
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,681
even to this place

41
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,685
even to you.

42
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,439
Call Captain Manalo.

43
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,556
Sir, he's not answering.

44
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:46,993
Lucas is a headache.

45
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,742
I'm leaving now.

46
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,011
The Commanding Officer is waiting.

47
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,119
Everyone I love always leaves me.

48
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,989
Will you do the same?

49
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,461
I'm leaving because I am following orders.

50
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,368
I'm leaving because this is going nowhere.

51
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,006
This between us.

52
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,445
Will you still come back?

53
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,559
It's 12 midnight.

54
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,715
Take care.

55
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,616
Finally, you're here.

56
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,459
Dr. Moira,
it seems you're in deep thought.

57
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,863
It's amazing, Ralph.

58
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,234
What is?

59
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:06,212
I found a way so I could be with Diego

60
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,781
and come here.

61
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,554
But just when things are working out,
we got separated again.

62
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,825
It's like fate is playing tricks on us.

63
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,865
Diego and I haven't really
spent quality time together

64
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,333
that had no complications.

65
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,937
You really love Sergeant Diego.

66
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,407
He's so lucky.

67
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,776
I really love him.

68
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,816
You know, Doc, in the short time
that I've known Sergeant Diego,

69
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,719
I can say that he's a decent person,

70
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,155
so, whatever you're going
through right now,

71
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,793
just smile always because you can do it.

72
00:09:55,561 --> 00:10:00,700
Just like med school.
It's difficult, tiring, and long.

73
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,170
But at the end of the day
when everything is over,

74
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,273
it's worth it, fulfilling, and happy.

75
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,009
Just like love life, right?

76
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:15,481
-Ralph, that is so cliché.
-Why? Is it corny?

77
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,617
Just a bit more and you're almost there.

78
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,992
Well, I thought I was doing okay
after the soldiers forgave me.

79
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:31,130
But when Janet died,
it seems all the guilt came back.

80
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,666
<i>And then the baby died...</i>

81
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,003
Lucas left.

82
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,805
That is common among us doctors.

83
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:45,111
<i>We'll never get used</i>
<i>to the feeling of losing a patient.</i>

84
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,080
<i>But it doesn't mean</i>
<i>you have to be burdened by that</i>

85
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,649
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

86
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:54,954
Maxine, you're one of the gentlest
and kindest people I've known.

87
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,492
Your heart is pure,
that is why you always get hurt.

88
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,396
<i>That's how I am.</i>
<i>I can't help but worry and think.</i>

89
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,069
Let's just be thankful
that you are all safe.

90
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,838
That everybody's alive, including you.

91
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,941
-<i>So, I hope...</i>
-You hope what?

92
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,910
...that you quit being stubborn.

93
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:22,048
<i>Before you do something risky,</i>
<i>think about it many times.</i>

94
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,017
Don't be too impulsive.

95
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,760
Wait, you said Lucas left already.

96
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,429
<i>Will he be coming back?</i>

97
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,597
I don't know.

98
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,068
Things became more complicated
because of me.

99
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,602
There you go again.

100
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,307
We're just going in circles.

101
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,576
<i>Maybe Lucas is right.</i>

102
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:56,482
Our situations tell us that
we're really not meant for each other.

103
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,684
What if there's still a chance?

104
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,722
Didn't I tell you before
that I don't want to be with a soldier.

105
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,890
But when Lucas left me...

106
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,462
it really hurt.

107
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,797
<i>I wasn't able to give him a chance.</i>

108
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,937
A new day, a new beginning.

109
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,206
<i>Forgive yourself first.</i>

110
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,375
<i>Heal yourself and then when you're okay,</i>

111
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,879
maybe you can start all over again,
even with Lucas.

112
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,648
But if you're really not meant
for each other,

113
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,218
just try to learn to accept it.

114
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,224
I will do that.

115
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,204
Dad?

116
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,440
Son?

117
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,309
Oh, son.

118
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,088
Thank God you're safe and okay.

119
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,528
Of course, I take after my father.
I don't get easily defeated. I always win.

120
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,596
Thank you.

121
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,569
Lucas, I missed you.

122
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,139
How are you?
Do you have a boyfriend already?

123
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,074
Father, did she entertain suitors?

124
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,109
I don't know.

125
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,411
-I only see her here at home.
-I didn't.

126
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,014
-But I don't know what she does in school.
-Father!

127
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,516
Father, I don't have a boyfriend.

128
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,785
I really don't.

129
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,054
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

130
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:46,058
Go ahead and prepare food
for your brother. I'm sure he's hungry.

131
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,726
Can you smell that?

132
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,829
I cooked something for you.

133
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,397
I knew it. Come on, father. Let's eat.

134
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,833
Come on, let's eat.

135
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,035
Let's go, let's go.

136
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,306
Let's eat.

137
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,542
Yesterday, an unmarked grave
was found near a lake in Urdan.

138
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,978
And upon further investigation,

139
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,217
it was discovered that it was the grave
of the alleged leader of PRG

140
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,653
or Philippine Revolutionary Group
who goes by the name Bullet,

141
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:19,258
and his wife Janet Fuentes
who goes by the name Madame.

142
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,729
You've finally made them pay
for what they did to me.

143
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,631
What you said was true.

144
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,299
We always win.

145
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,568
We never give up.

146
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,107
Thank you, son.

147
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,911
You don't know how much you made me happy.

148
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,263
We are soldiers.

149
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,333
Our job is to defend the country
and its citizens.

150
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,774
Even the medical team of our
partner hospital got involved.

151
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,878
They didn't like what happened.

152
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,488
It will affect your promotion
to a higher rank.

153
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,993
If that is the appropriate punishment,
then I will accept it.

154
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,264
But I believe what I did was right
in Alif's situation.

155
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,669
It's no different from a war.

156
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:41,840
Soldiers like us, we do everything
to rescue our comrades

157
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,575
no matter what it takes.

158
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,910
That's just what I did

159
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,280
when I let our doctors
save the life of a VIP.

160
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,257
Thank you, Captain Lucas Manalo.

161
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,844
Okay, here it is. Thank you.

162
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,247
-Hey.
-Hello, Doc Beauty.

163
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,950
Hi, Biboy.
You haven't been coming here lately.

164
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,320
My father told me
not to come here for a time.

165
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,090
But he finally allowed it,
that's why I'm here.

166
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,125
Everything's fine now.
There's no trouble anymore.

167
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,928
Our medical mission
in the Medicube will continue.

168
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,797
Where is Captain Lucas?

169
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,400
He already returned to Manila.

170
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,135
Is he not coming back here?

171
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,937
I don't know, Biboy.

172
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,375
You know, soldiers get assigned
to different places.

173
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:53,579
That's sad to hear.
Captain Lucas is my idol.

174
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:58,317
That really happens, Biboy.
We'll meet different people.

175
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,352
They will come and go.

176
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,256
There's some who will leave,
but someone will take their place.

177
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,159
But every time they leave,

178
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:11,730
there are memories that will be left
that will change our lives.

179
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,766
What does that mean?

180
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,670
Biboy, you will understand all of this
once you grow up.

181
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,240
Captain Lucas said I'm already a big boy.

182
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,443
You're really something!

183
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,713
Wait, come with me. Wait a minute.

184
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,284
Hazel, Dr. Ralph, we'll leave for a while.

185
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,920
-Let's go.
-Are we going back to the forest?

186
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,688
No. Just come with me.

187
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,524
We will be back.

188
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,792
Let's go.

189
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,361
Just wait.

190
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,678
Wait. Okay.

191
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,080
Here.

192
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,401
Why are you putting flowers?

193
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,836
Did someone die?

194
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,275
It's my friend and her baby.

195
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:35,514
Wherever they are right now,
I hope they are happy.

196
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,284
And they will be together forever.

197
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,624
There's no more trouble and no more pain.

198
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,561
Goodbye, Janet.

199
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,570
Thank you.

200
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,440
Thank you for everything.

201
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,786
Dad, stop doing that.

202
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,455
You're only making it strained.

203
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,392
This will soon go away, son.

204
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,860
I'll be able to walk again.

205
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,063
I can feel it.

206
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,999
We'll get rid of these, too.

207
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,405
What is the update
about the investigation on the VIP?

208
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,275
I gave my statement, Dad.

209
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,342
And?

210
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,279
And it looks like they accepted it.

211
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,150
I can't ask for anything more.

212
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:47,986
Thank you.

213
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:53,992
For the Manalo family, who always wins.

214
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,770
What is your name?

215
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,071
I'm Hazel.

216
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,973
How old are you?

217
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,441
I'm twenty-five.

218
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,111
How many employees
of the mining company need vaccination?

219
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,480
One hundred thirty employees, Doc.

220
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,983
One hundred thirty?

221
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,718
Then, we still need one more box.

222
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,287
We'll get it.

223
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,992
Doc Max, this is the last box.

224
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,263
Thank you.

225
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,798
Is everything set?

226
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,734
I'll come with you to the mining site.

227
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,670
-Okay.
-Okay.

228
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,109
Do you need assistance
on the vaccination in the mining site?

229
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,978
I'm always ready.

230
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,687
I'm glad you two are doing well.

231
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,357
I am really sorry.

232
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,161
Doc Max, we're both doctors.

233
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,266
What happened in the past
is part of the hazards of our job.

234
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,369
We're here to help the people of Urdan.

235
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,604
So guys, let's get to work.

236
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,646
We will be out in the field again.

237
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,015
I just want to remind you
that there are rules and protocols

238
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,418
that we need to follow
to ensure everyone is safe.

239
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,288
I understand, Captain Moira.

240
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,290
Don't worry, I won't make a mistake again.

241
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:34,693
I now know what to do
and I know where to put myself.

242
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,529
I have to protect myself.

243
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,398
Thank you.

244
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,934
Come on.

245
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,637
Doc, let me do that.

246
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,305
Good morning.

247
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:24,076
Thank you for coming to our mining site
even though it's too far,

248
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,143
and the weather is hot.

249
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,512
It's okay. We're used to it.

250
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,848
I am Lito.

251
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,418
I'm one of the managers of the mines.

252
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,521
Did you eat breakfast already?

253
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:40,525
Don't worry about us. Thank you.
We brought water and food.

254
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:45,330
Okay, I'll introduce you to the miners.

255
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,698
Okay.

256
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,100
Come on, hurry.

257
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,971
-Come here.
-Father, they're here.

258
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,774
It's Doc Beauty. They're here.

259
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,075
Wait.

260
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,112
Hi, Biboy. Good morning!

261
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,880
Go ahead, father. You go first.

262
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,315
Stop it, Biboy.

263
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,284
If you want, you can go first.
You go first.

264
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,786
No, let's just stay here.

265
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,889
Good morning to all of you.

266
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:15,327
For those who don't know me,
I'm Dr. Maxine.

267
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:19,965
We are from the Medicube
at the Urdan military camp.

268
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,534
-We also call her "Doc Beauty."
-Shut up.

269
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,303
Good morning.

270
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,839
I'm Captain Moira.

271
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,408
Together with Dr. Maxine,

272
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,476
we are part of the Medical Mission Team.

273
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,945
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

274
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:38,717
We heard that many of you here
in the mining community

275
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:43,889
have wound infections and tetanus cases.

276
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,591
The local government of Santa Rosa

277
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:50,629
requested that we help you guys
by giving vaccinations.

278
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:55,200
We understand that
the source of your livelihood is mining.

279
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,237
But it's also important for each of you
to take care of your health.

280
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:07,446
That's why we're here to give you Tdap
or the anti-tetanus vaccine.

281
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,816
-That's good.
-Alright. We can start.

282
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:16,087
Please, fall in line
so we can start the vaccination.

283
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,089
Put that on the table. Thank you.

284
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,659
-Sir, just put that here.
-Thank you.

285
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,801
-Okay.
-Will that take long?

286
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,271
The miners are just on standby.

287
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,473
We're wasting time.

288
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,608
Sir, we have permission
from the local government.

289
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,944
I personally took care of the permits.

290
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,847
Then, hurry. Gold is waiting to be mined.

291
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:47,052
Sir Ed, leave this to me.
The central office knows about this.

292
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,421
Didn't you receive the email?
They agreed to this.

293
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,991
-Time is running.
-Don't worry, sir.

294
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,495
We will do it quickly
so the miners can go back to their work.

295
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,363
You can't mine a vaccine.

296
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,433
Hurry up.

297
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,470
Sir Ed is really arrogant.

298
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:06,872
He acts like he's the owner.

299
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,540
I hope the mine swallows him.

300
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,809
Sir Lito is a better manager than him.

301
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,944
Are you saying something?

302
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,814
Norman, what is it? What is it this time?

303
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,583
-Nothing, sir.
-What are you doing?

304
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,255
Don't worry. We'll do it fast.
We'll finish in thirty minutes.

305
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,626
I'll be back in thirty minutes.

306
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,330
You better make sure of it, okay?

307
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,200
<i>The report of the military</i>
<i>about the incidents in Urdan</i>

308
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,169
has reached Doctor Chavez.

309
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,139
-You will be returning to Manila tomorrow.
-What?

310
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,275
There is an earthquake in Urdan!

311
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:23,315
<i>The province of Urdan in Visayas was hit</i>
<i>by a 6.7 magnitude earthquake.</i>

312
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:29,387
<i>As of now, there is no official count</i>
<i>as to how many are dead and wounded.</i>

313
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:30,822
It's Captain Lucas.

314
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,002
<i>Aren't you worried about Maxine?</i>

315
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,537
<i>Of course, I'm worried.</i>

316
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,507
<i>I don't know what I'm gonna do</i>
<i>if something bad happens to her.</i>
