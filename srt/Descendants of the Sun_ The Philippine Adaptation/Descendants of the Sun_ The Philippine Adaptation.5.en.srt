1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,612
Today is my rest day.

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,315
So, don't expect me
to answer your calls or messages.

3
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,217
-<i>I have plans.</i>
<i>-Where are you going?</i>

4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,651
-On a date.
-Really now.

5
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,320
<i>-How was the shower?</i>
<i>-Good.</i>

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:24,624
I saw a notice
of temporary water interruption.

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,926
Scheduled at 4:00 p.m.
Did you make it on time?

8
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,995
<i>I hate some soldiers.</i>

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:33,233
My brother was a former army soldier.
He was kicked out because of corruption.

10
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,571
<i>Years passed</i>
<i>and he was declared legally dead.</i>

11
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,174
I'm sorry but I have to leave.

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,142
Maybe another girl?

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,244
<i>It's just right that you followed him.</i>

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,713
You've had enough of men like that, right?

15
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,348
Lucas?

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,824
Maxine.

17
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,061
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,633
What is your business here
in Camp Aguinaldo?

19
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,304
Are you following me?

20
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,811
Answer my question first.
Why are you here?

21
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,482
We're working here.

22
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,755
Boys, you can go ahead.
We will stay behind.

23
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,134
Why are they saluting you?

24
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,637
Because he's the assistant of our boss.

25
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,373
So, of course,
we treat him like a boss, too.

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,875
Isn't that right, Big Boss?

27
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,978
We have an emergency meeting.

28
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,282
We met up here
so we can all go together, right?

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,152
-Yes.
-Didn't our Big Boss tell you that?

30
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:03,590
He did not.

31
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,561
But he did mention that his boss
supplies equipment to the military.

32
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,699
Do you have a transaction here?

33
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:17,170
No. Our boss just left.
He has another meeting, right?

34
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,805
-Yes, he has.
-He went ahead already.

35
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,541
We just waited for Big Boss to get here.

36
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,478
Are you telling the truth?

37
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:30,383
You came here to see your boss
and nothing else?

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,351
Yes.

39
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,520
Of course.

40
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,956
Wait. Why do you ask?

41
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,026
Nothing. It's nothing.

42
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,462
Seriously, why are you asking?

43
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,463
Nothing.

44
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,464
Come on.

45
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,465
Just forget it.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,269
Maybe you thought I'm dating someone else.

47
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,306
Of course not. You're assuming things.

48
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,378
I'm not seeing anyone else, okay?

49
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,046
It's just you.

50
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,275
Who's paying for drinks later?

51
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,644
Wait.

52
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,347
Fix your things first before you leave.

53
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,984
Squad, attention!

54
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,757
You did good in your last operation.

55
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,460
-Did anyone of you get hurt?
-None, sir.

56
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,563
That's good.

57
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,899
I want to inform you, Captain Manalo…

58
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,607
You will be assigned
to the town of Urdan in Visayas,

59
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,443
the center of gravity where PRG is hiding.

60
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,522
According to the intel that we gathered,

61
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,158
they are getting more support
on the ground.

62
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,327
We really need to crush them.

63
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,598
They are aggressively recruiting
the young and the poor

64
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,534
not only in the province
but also here in Metro Manila.

65
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,904
I'll give you two weeks…

66
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,007
to prepare and say goodbye
to your families.

67
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:33,399
-Comrades, are you ready?
-Yes!

68
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,135
It's time for us to help each other.

69
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,304
That's right!

70
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,973
It's time for us to wake up!

71
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,975
Yes!

72
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,311
Father, you want some water?

73
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,048
Yes, my child. Just hurry.

74
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,417
We must get rid of terrorists!

75
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,486
Get rid of them!

76
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,520
PRG!

77
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,755
Destroy them!

78
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,391
-Terrorists!
-Destroy them!

79
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,993
-PRG!
-Stop them!

80
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,894
Terrorists!

81
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,396
Stop them!

82
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,932
-PRG!
-Destroy them!

83
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,301
-Terrorists!
-Stop them!

84
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,603
-PRG!
-Destroy them!

85
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,039
-Terrorists!
-Stop them!

86
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,842
-PRG!
-Destroy them!

87
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,945
-Terrorists!
-Stop them!

88
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,079
My fellowmen...

89
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,615
enough is enough.

90
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,317
Let's drive them away!

91
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,352
Yes! Let's drive them away!

92
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,322
-PRG!
-Destroy them!

93
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,891
-Terrorists!
-Stop them!

94
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,427
-PRG!
-Destroy them!

95
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,029
-Terrorists!
-Stop them!

96
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,765
PRG!

97
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,323
Father!

98
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,459
Father!

99
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,161
Father!

100
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,578
Hey.

101
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,647
<i>Brother!</i>

102
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,881
<i>It's father!</i>

103
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,318
<i>A bomb exploded and he was hit!</i>

104
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,255
Calm down. Where are you?
Don't panic. I'll be there.

105
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,558
<i>At the Bonifacio Shrine.</i>

106
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,692
Okay.

107
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,715
Father!

108
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,494
How is our father?

109
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,531
Don't worry. His condition is stable.

110
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,933
Thank you, doctor.

111
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,906
Hello, aunt.

112
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,129
You have to see Dr. Chavez.

113
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,966
The hospital will send you
to guest on a TV show.

114
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,101
Hey!

115
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,873
Hey! I'm guessing
you won't be able to sleep later.

116
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,608
I'm not in love.

117
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,310
In love? Look at that!

118
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,749
You've had two cups of coffee.
Don't be so defensive.

119
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:30,389
I thought you're mad
at Mr. Accountant Hunk

120
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,758
because he left you during your last date?

121
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,828
How come you were affectionately
hugging each other?

122
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,364
Affectionate hug? That didn't happen.

123
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,033
You can't deny it.
There are a lot of witnesses.

124
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,270
So, stop denying it.
Tell me, what is up between you two?

125
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,138
I don't know.

126
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,508
There's no formality yet.

127
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,111
But do you love him?

128
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,980
Well…

129
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,618
Take good care of it.

130
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,390
Because love is just like coffee.

131
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,192
It gets cold.

132
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,880
Is Doctor Maxine here?

133
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,783
I think she already went home.

134
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,885
Okay.

135
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,654
-All right. Thank you.
-Sure.

136
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,237
Are you looking for me?

137
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,118
You always assume things.
I'm just checking on my patient.

138
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,822
-Really now?
-That's right.

139
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,993
You're off duty already?

140
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,230
You're so hard working.

141
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,965
That's exactly my type.

142
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,167
A dedicated woman.

143
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,811
A special delivery for you.

144
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,698
My child…

145
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,503
When are you going to
introduce your boyfriend to me?

146
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,908
He's not yet my boyfriend.
Just relax, Mom.

147
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:13,045
If he professes love to me,
I won't hesitate.

148
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,918
I'll count on that.

149
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,122
It's beautiful. He should give you more.

150
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,256
Just one.

151
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,763
We've only known each other
for a short time,

152
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,833
but I feel she's the one for me.

153
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,606
-Then marry her.
-I just started seeing her.

154
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:47,313
Before you continue seeing her,
you should fix the mess you made.

155
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,350
I know that.

156
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,520
That's why later, I'll tell her the truth.

157
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,956
Later?

158
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,358
All right.

159
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:16,775
I'm Doctor Maxine. I'm your surgeon.
How are you?

160
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,544
I'm doing fine, doctor.

161
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,813
Thank you for saving my life.

162
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,515
You're welcome. That is our job.

163
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,720
It's good none of the shrapnel
hit your vital organs.

164
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,855
The length of time for treatment
is just minor.

165
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,157
Doctor, when can our father go home?

166
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,360
He can go home after three days.

167
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,328
-Really?
-Yes.

168
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,365
Thank you, doctor.
My brother will be very happy.

169
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,300
Is your brother at work?

170
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,402
Yes. He is in the camp.

171
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,373
-Camp?
-Yes, in Camp Aguinaldo.

172
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,776
Most of the time, he's in the province
for special missions.

173
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,480
He is the Captain

174
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,983
of the First Special Forces
of the Philippine Army.

175
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,154
He's not an accountant?

176
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,056
No.

177
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,227
He's a soldier, just like me.

178
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,730
But I'm retired now.

179
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,295
Why did you do that?

180
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:48,734
Well, because I'm an accountant.
I can't get into trouble with the police.

181
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,070
If that happens,
my job will be put on the line.

182
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,005
Why did your wound open up? What happened?

183
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,707
My boss got into a fight.

184
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,846
I helped him. I had to defend him.

185
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,650
Is that part of an accountant's job?

186
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,585
Well, no.

187
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,788
But I'm his right hand man, you know?

188
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,426
You are not a soldier, right?
You are an accountant.

189
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:18,030
My boss is connected with the military.

190
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,433
He asked them to pick me up here.
So, I can get to Camp Aguinaldo faster.

191
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,107
Lucas?

192
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,578
What is your business here
in Camp Aguinaldo?

193
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,714
We are here for work.

194
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,005
Is Maxine here? Doctor Maxine.

195
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,942
Oh, over there. She's on TV.

196
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,645
<i>There are a lot of categories</i>
<i>of arrhythmia…</i>

197
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,281
-Excuse me.
-Okay, thank you.

198
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,751
<i>If that's so,</i>
<i>what are the treatments available</i>

199
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,220
<i>for patients with arrhythmia?</i>

200
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,657
<i>Nowadays, because of advancement</i>
<i>in technology,</i>

201
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:56,695
<i>there are a lot of methods</i>
<i>being discovered to treat arrhythmia.</i>

202
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,831
<i>The good thing is,</i>
<i>it has lesser side effects.</i>

203
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,333
<i>Is that so?</i>

204
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,404
<i>Doctor, you don't seem nervous even</i>
<i>if it's your first time to appear on TV.</i>

205
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,941
<i>-Oh, my.</i>
<i>-You explain very well.</i>

206
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,578
<i>Actually, I am nervous.</i>
<i>It's just not obvious.</i>

207
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,247
<i>Is it the same feeling</i>
<i>when you see your crush?</i>

208
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,315
<i>Gosh.</i>

209
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,084
<i>Yes, something like that.</i>

210
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,554
<i>Actually, the feeling</i>
<i>of having arrhythmia...</i>

211
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:32,130
<i>Like you're going through something,</i>
<i>but people don't notice.</i>

212
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,267
<i>Doctor, it seems like</i>
<i>that's based on experience.</i>

213
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,652
Why did you lie to me, Lucas?

214
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,830
I wanted us to become closer…

215
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,669
because…

216
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,738
I know…

217
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,615
you hate soldiers like me.

218
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,055
Because of what you did…

219
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,559
you gave me more reasons
to get mad at you…

220
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,930
and people like you.

221
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,878
I admit what I did was really wrong.

222
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:34,219
But please don't hate all of us.

223
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,027
You know soldiers like us are not perfect.

224
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,197
We're also humans who make mistakes.

225
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,434
But I assure you…

226
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,539
there are a lot of good people
in the force.

227
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,410
I understand.

228
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,881
But you know there are still some...

229
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,386
Especially those who hurt my brother.

230
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,726
My family will forever
be burdened by the pain.

231
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,133
You even added to that pain, Lucas.

232
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,806
I thought you were different
from other men I've met before.

233
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,109
But you're just like them.

234
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,132
I don't want to see you getting hurt.

235
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,111
I don't know if you can ever forgive me.

236
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,214
It's easy to forgive.

237
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,220
But the pain that you gave me…

238
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,860
I think…

239
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,300
whatever we have right now…

240
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:33,205
the special feelings
we have for each other…

241
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,708
let's just end all of it.

242
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,280
This is going nowhere.

243
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,301
Are you sure about that?

244
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,512
Yes.

245
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:28,426
If that's what you want,
then there's nothing I can do about it.

246
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,729
Okay.

247
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,247
Always take care of yourself.

248
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,036
Thank you for coming.
Things are tense here.

249
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:55,440
What if we die in the encounter?
Let's just surrender, please?

250
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,876
I'll die first before that happens!

251
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:04,149
<i>We'll finally see each other</i>
<i>Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos.</i>

252
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:14,392
<i>I've just decided to volunteer in Urdan.</i>
<i>I don't want to see that Lucas anymore.</i>

253
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,027
So you think volunteering is a sign?

254
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,132
<i>Maybe it's about time for me</i>
<i>to listen to the universe.</i>

255
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,704
<i>What if this is the best decision</i>
<i>I'll ever make in my life?</i>
