1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,713
In five days, Mr. Alif Fayad
will be arriving here.

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,283
He is a philanthropist
and a son of the Prince of Brunei.

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,820
He's coming to give assistance
to the residents of Urdan.

4
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,857
The medical team will be assisting him,
under my supervision.

5
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:26,793
Please be gentle with Diego.
Don't embarrass him.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,862
Just leave it alone.
This is between the two of us.

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,699
Unless you want me to tell my dad
that you want to ask me out.

8
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,368
Is he your soldier boyfriend?

9
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,271
No. It's Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos.

10
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,907
Actually, we're in a love triangle.

11
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,542
<i>I'm pissed at Lucas.</i>

12
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,878
Good thing, I didn't give him
another chance.

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,448
So, he tried to ask you out again?

14
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,417
It's over. I already turned him down.

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,388
I don't want to be involved
in his love triangle with Diego and Moira.

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,490
Why are you letting her order you around?

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,259
Stop it, bro.
You're in the Special Forces.

18
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,694
I'm just letting her release
all her anger towards me.

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>When she's done, maybe her feelings for me</i>
<i>will</i> <i>be gone too.</i>

20
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,468
Hey, everyone!
The medical mission team is here!

21
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,437
<i>If the military has Special Forces,</i>

22
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,672
<i>the PRG has an Elite Team.</i>

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,375
So, they better be ready.

24
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:26,853
You should be on your best
behavior when Alif arrives, okay?

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,356
Don't forget, we are professional nurses.

26
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:35,929
Nobody giggles. Nobody steals a kiss.
And most of all, nobody faints, okay?

27
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,165
Seriously? You think we will faint?

28
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,903
I wouldn't be surprised if you fainted
because of too much excitement.

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,107
Nurse Emma, Doc Maxine asked me
to give these to you.

30
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,210
Okay. Just put it beside Nurse Hazel.

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,548
-Let me help you.
-Okay.

32
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,666
Nurse Via, prepare some
ammonia inhalant too.

33
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,269
It looks like someone
is actually going to faint soon.

34
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,570
Okay. Put it here.

35
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,442
Faint? Who is going to faint, Nurse Emma?

36
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,911
That's the trend here in Urdan.

37
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,081
Because the sun shines here like love.
It heats things up.

38
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:34,454
Anyway, I also need to get the supplies
for the medical mission tomorrow.

39
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,588
Go ahead.

40
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,058
Nurse Hazel, why don't you show Marty
where he can get it?

41
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,060
-Yes. Sure.
-Wait a minute.

42
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,996
Don't you have a lot more things
to do in here?

43
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:46,065
Go on your own, Marty.
It's just right there. You'll be fine.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,967
-Go.
-Okay.

45
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,840
-How exciting!
-You have a crush on him?

46
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,841
I don't.

47
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,710
You don't?
You look as if you're possessed.

48
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,679
Whatever.

49
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:06,052
Hurry up, because we have to welcome
my Papi Alif tomorrow morning.

50
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,594
Wow.

51
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,728
Papi Alif?

52
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,571
Thank you very much.

53
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,269
To those who will donate blood,

54
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,306
we will keep it
in the blood bank in the Medicube.

55
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,443
You and your relatives
will benefit from it

56
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,879
if the time comes that you need blood.

57
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,281
So, who is willing to donate?

58
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:23,916
-Me!
-Us.

59
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:24,884
Great!

60
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,257
Okay, sir. Over here, on the second bed.

61
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,293
What is your name?

62
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,698
Who is next?

63
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,233
-Me, Doc.
-Okay.

64
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,368
Over here.

65
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,205
Nurse, our injections please.

66
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,342
You can now lie down.

67
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,744
-Okay.
-Okay.

68
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,692
Finally, they're done.

69
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,010
If you need help
and if you need consultation,

70
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,879
don't hesitate to come
to the Medicube, okay?

71
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:31,083
Especially now that we have new
and good equipment from Mr. Fayad.

72
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,852
Thank you.

73
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,923
We better get moving.

74
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,157
Yes. Alif.

75
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,466
We'll leave you in charge.
Please, wrap things up.

76
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,468
Okay, Doc. Take care.

77
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:51,838
Can you help me?

78
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,885
Bullet.

79
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,120
We're getting impatient here, Greg.

80
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,156
We have a visual of Alif Fayad.

81
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,258
We're ready to move.

82
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,830
This is going to be a big ransom.

83
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,755
You are all so tense.

84
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,926
Maybe your blood pressure
is always high, Captain Lucas?

85
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,496
That is why we always need
a doctor by our side.

86
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,399
Fayad is in the middle car.

87
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,160
Attack!

88
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,416
Big Boss!

89
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,251
Secure the medical team.

90
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,893
Get out! Where do you think you're going?

91
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,894
-Fayad!
-Fayad!

92
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,532
We'll get you out of here.

93
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,114
They are coming.

94
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,051
PRG, let's go!

95
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,239
No one got hurt among the medical team.
But Alif's bodyguards are wounded.

96
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,107
We need to take them to the Medicube.

97
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,008
Tamayo.

98
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,577
Take care of them.

99
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,847
Secure the whole medical team,
the civilians, and Fayad's security.

100
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,349
The Medicube is just near here.

101
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,053
Sir, we'll take care of it. But Alif…

102
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,863
Put that on him.

103
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,920
Come on.

104
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,565
Let's finish this off, Big Boss.

105
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,152
I'll take the right.
You guys take the left.

106
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,086
You'll go alone?

107
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,423
There's five there.
There's just three here.

108
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,438
-Micropore, Nurse.
-Doc Beauty!

109
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,675
Biboy, what are you doing here?

110
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,077
We heard the gunshots.

111
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,549
We were worried about you. What happened?
Where is the Captain?

112
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,318
We were ambushed.

113
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,821
-What?
-They took Alif.

114
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,557
I hope they rescue Mr. Fayad.

115
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,852
Just let him go.

116
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,004
You think you can be saved by one man?

117
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,174
Hey, you might have forgotten
that this is our territory.

118
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,154
-I think Big Boss needs backup.
-Let's finish this off, sir.

119
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,267
Hey! Just surrender!
We know you have a fake hostage.

120
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,505
Just promise that you won't hurt us.

121
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,440
Put your gun down, now!

122
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,143
I will put it down!

123
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,016
Hands up!

124
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,365
Doc, we can't afford to stop.

125
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,802
What about Lucas and your teammates?

126
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,471
Something might happen to them.

127
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,406
They might be injured.
They need first aid.

128
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,408
Doc, they'll have to go straight
to the Medicube.

129
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,410
-What? How?
-Let's go.

130
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,012
Don't you care about them?

131
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,316
Benjo is right, Dr. Maxine.
We can't be emotional in this situation.

132
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,052
We have to keep moving for their sake.

133
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,598
It seems like your troop
has been wiped out, Captain.

134
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,507
Big Boss, we're still here.

135
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,642
The two PRG members escaped.

136
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,577
Any casualty?

137
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:52,978
None.

138
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,520
I'm just waiting for this fool
to make a mistake.

139
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,856
Okay. Just wait for us, Big Boss.

140
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,851
Can you handle it, sir?

141
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,942
Mr. Fayad, stop!

142
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,823
Mr. Fayad!

143
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,459
I'm scared, Doc.

144
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,864
Biboy, you have to be brave.
We'll get out of here, soon.

145
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:27,940
Let's go.

146
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,438
We need to get out of here.

147
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,940
Retreat back to camp. Hurry.

148
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,342
Leave him.

149
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,355
Big Boss.

150
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,381
Doc Beauty.

151
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,515
Biboy.

152
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:46,919
How are you?

153
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,588
You said I need to be brave.

154
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,725
Besides, I want to be a soldier
just like Mr. Lucas.

155
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,095
You still want it
even after what happened earlier?

156
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,230
Yes, Doc.

157
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,933
Because they were able to defend you.

158
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:06,338
And I also want to defend my mother
and our neighbors, too.

159
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:11,109
I hope Mr. Lucas
can save the kind foreigner.

160
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,345
I hope so, too.

161
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,449
Alif?

162
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,718
Alif?

163
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,653
Alif!

164
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,372
Doc, please do everything to save him.

165
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,636
You won't walk for a few days.

166
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,972
That's good.

167
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:19,244
Why do you look happy
that we failed and lost people?

168
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,614
Didn't I tell you
not to push through with the plan?

169
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,949
We don't have enough people.

170
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,985
You think I didn't worry
about you guys? About you?

171
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,423
Why don't you just think
about me and our baby, Rodel?

172
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,159
Why? That's what I have in mind.

173
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,328
If we had got Fayad,
that would've been sure money.

174
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,764
But because you keep contradicting us,
the plan failed.

175
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,532
Don't worry.

176
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,834
Fayad got hit by a bullet.

177
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,370
I'm sure that's a problem
for their camp too.

178
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,258
Doc, we've prepared the OR.

179
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,396
As of now, sir,
Mr. Fayad's condition is still unstable.

180
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,733
But the medical team
is doing everything they can.

181
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,935
What kind of negligence is this, Manalo?

182
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,038
How did it come to this?

183
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,341
I thought you were the best

184
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,409
<i>because you're Special Forces?</i>

185
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,315
Of course you should be blamed!

186
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,961
What's happening there?

187
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,308
What are you guys murmuring about?

188
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,143
That gauze pads that we used…

189
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,046
And the instruments.

190
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,281
Did you check the scalpel?

191
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,516
Are you telling me
we left it inside the patient?

192
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:17,055
All the calls I made
were for the safety of Mr. Fayad.

193
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,957
Now, if that's the punishment

194
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,393
for the wrong decisions I made,
I will accept it.

195
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,329
Stand by those decisions
while the mosquitoes feast on you here.

196
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,630
He just did what is right.

197
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:29,234
That's why I'm not surprised
that the General chose him for you.

198
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,235
What?

199
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,237
Talledo, is that you?

200
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,507
Hey, Marty, what did you cook?

201
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,641
Lucas?
