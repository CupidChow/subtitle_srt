1
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:16,282
<i>She's the woman I was telling you about</i>
<i>who saved the man in the grocery.</i>

2
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:17,250
<i>Amazing, right?</i>

3
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,952
She's amazing or…

4
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:20,820
she's beautiful?

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,422
Both.

6
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,424
<i>If that doctor has my phone,</i>

7
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,559
<i>it means the kid we're looking for</i>
<i>has escaped?</i>

8
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,395
<i>I can pay whatever he owes you.</i>

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>Moira is in the emergency room.</i>

10
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,100
Moira Defensor?

11
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,770
<i>The one who stole your guy</i>
<i>when we were still in med school?</i>

12
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:37,904
<i>You also hate soldiers?</i>

13
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,072
Not really.

14
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:40,940
<i>Just some of them.</i>

15
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,743
<i>I'll be honest with you.</i>

16
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,414
I'm an accountant.
I can't get into trouble with the police.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,816
If that happens,
my job will be put on the line.

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,185
I will only believe you when

19
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:57,690
<i>the CCTV footage of Marty's mauling</i>
<i>is released by the officials.</i>

20
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,160
We have a dengue patient
with thrombocytopenia.

21
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,728
Doc, the ambulance is stuck in traffic.

22
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,196
I have a motorcycle.

23
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,497
We'll bring it there ourselves.

24
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,232
Is it your first time
to ride a motorcycle?

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,434
Yes.

26
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,902
Just hold tight.

27
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,012
Can we still get through that?
There's a lot of traffic.

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,713
We need to bring this to the patient.

29
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,781
You're right.

30
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:23,817
I'm pulling over.

31
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,541
Lucas. Your stitches.

32
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:55,915
That's nothing.

33
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,860
There's the ambulance!

34
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,567
Don't worry, I got you.

35
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,629
You can do it.

36
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,705
Thank you very much, Doc.

37
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,462
Thanks for your help.

38
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:01,668
Even when your wound was bleeding,
you still accompanied me.

39
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,769
Don't worry about it.

40
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,505
You're also injured,
yet you continue with your duty.

41
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,633
Are you okay?

42
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,439
I'm okay.

43
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,507
It's embarrassing.

44
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:47,013
I'm just happy
that another life was saved.

45
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,119
I'm happy because both times
we were together…

46
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,358
I saw how good a person you are.

47
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,973
Bye, take care.

48
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,224
Hey! You guys!

49
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,639
Tamayo, which is better? This?

50
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,141
That other one looks better
on you, Captain.

51
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,142
I agree.

52
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,811
-This one?
-Yes, that one.

53
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,479
-Are you sure?
-That one, Captain.

54
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,614
-You'll look handsome in that.
-Isn't this one good?

55
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,782
Where are you going?

56
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,352
-I'm going back to the hospital tomorrow.
-But, Captain…

57
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,455
We also have a clinic here.

58
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,524
He's right. Why are you going back
to a hospital that's so far away?

59
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,660
Of course.

60
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,863
I'm Captain of the First Special Forces
of the Philippine Army.

61
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:48,501
I need to go to the best hospital

62
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,605
because I need to be strong
for our beloved motherland.

63
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,874
-That's right.
-That's right, sir.

64
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,846
Or is it because
the doctor there is beautiful?

65
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,614
-There you go!
-I told you.

66
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,748
So that's why.

67
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,717
-I knew it.
-Don't look at me.

68
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,987
There's no beautiful doctor
in our clinic, that's why.

69
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,989
-There you go.
-No, there is.

70
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,257
-Who?
-There is?

71
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,494
There is. It's Captain Moira Defensor.

72
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,062
She is beautiful,

73
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,464
but I heard her boyfriend
broke up with her.

74
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,533
At least that's the rumor
going around in the camp.

75
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,804
If I see that guy,
I'll teach him a lesson.

76
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,839
-Come here, buddy.
-Buddy, look at this.

77
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,074
Let him try it on.

78
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,775
-What are you doing?
-Just try it on.

79
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,111
-But it's not mine.
-You're about the same size.

80
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,946
-What are you doing?
-Just try it on.

81
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,548
Did I say something wrong, Captain?

82
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,450
Nothing.

83
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,453
I'll come with you
to the hospital tomorrow.

84
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,321
There's something I need to do.

85
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,225
What are you going to do there?

86
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,363
That's all you need to pay, sir.

87
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,938
-How much?
-It's 1,600.

88
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,409
Here.

89
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,046
You better get you life straight.

90
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,552
Stop doing stupid things.
We'll be watching you.

91
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,125
-I'll go ahead.
-Okay.

92
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,194
-You still have change.
-Hey.

93
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,264
Here's your medicine.

94
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,869
Take them so you can recover soon.

95
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,371
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

96
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,341
You know I don't have any money.

97
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,245
Are you doing this to teach me a lesson?

98
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,413
You're wrong.

99
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,715
Just go home.

100
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,451
Wait a second.

101
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,462
About what I did to you…

102
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,664
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,032
Don't worry about it.

104
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,068
But…

105
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,604
just some brotherly advice.

106
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,308
Don't throw your life away.
There are a lot of challenges, but…

107
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,177
it's still better to live.

108
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,983
It's not too late
for you to better yourself.

109
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,086
I will help you.

110
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,556
Get your things.

111
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,492
Let's go.

112
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,443
Out of the way!

113
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,849
-Via, Hazel, I need blood.
-Okay, doctor.

114
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,916
-Batchmate?
-Batchmate.

115
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,184
What are you doing here?

116
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,887
We accompanied Chief
for his executive checkup.

117
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,288
What are you doing here?

118
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,324
I'm just waiting for someone.

119
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,960
-I'll go ahead.
-Okay.

120
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,885
Lucas!

121
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,588
This is Maxine.

122
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,492
Hey, Doc!

123
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,193
How are you?

124
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,129
<i>How was the operation?</i>

125
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,331
I heard you were there earlier?

126
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,501
My doctor stood me up.

127
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,403
It was an emergency.

128
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,938
So how was the operation?

129
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,106
<i>Is she safe?</i>

130
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:55,975
What?

131
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,210
The one you operated on.

132
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,647
Yes, she's safe.

133
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,383
Good.

134
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,719
Is this your number?

135
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,387
Yes.

136
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,589
So you got my number?

137
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,226
Just save my number.

138
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,061
Okay.

139
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,197
So you found my number.

140
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:20,766
What?

141
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,941
I'll visit you tomorrow.

142
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,477
Are you always like that
to all your women?

143
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,612
I'll just have my wound cleaned.

144
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,518
Yes, that's right.
That's what I meant to tell you.

145
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,121
Oh, really now?

146
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,591
It really was
what I was going to tell you.

147
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,860
Are you taking your medication?

148
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,963
If I don't take them,
will my wound get worse?

149
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,365
Does that mean
I'll need to be hospitalized?

150
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,367
What?

151
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,437
What time will you be here tomorrow?

152
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,939
Can I go there now?

153
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,006
What?

154
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,675
Don't you want me to?

155
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,644
Well, you can!

156
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,980
All right, see you.

157
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,316
Okay, bye.

158
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,927
<i>Senator Ricardo Santillan was kidnapped</i>
<i>by the Philippine Revolutionary Group</i>

159
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:59,064
<i>from his ancestral house in Zamboanga City</i>
<i>just moments ago.</i>

160
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,242
<i>The group is against the proposed</i>

161
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,713
<i>additional two pesos per liter</i>
<i>fuel excise tax on diesel and gasoline.</i>

162
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,883
<i>They are also asking</i>
<i>for a five million peso ransom</i>

163
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,919
<i>in exchange for the Senator's release.</i>

164
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,255
I'll see you in camp in 15 minutes.

165
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,992
The Defense Secretary and I
have an emergency meeting.

166
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,361
I'll have a chopper pick you up.

167
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,679
I'm on my way up, sir.

168
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,165
Lucas?

169
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,734
Are you here already?

170
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,836
I'm sorry, but…

171
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,872
I need to leave right away.

172
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,441
What? Where are you now?

173
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,844
I'm on the rooftop.

174
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,178
At the rooftop?

175
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,914
Which rooftop?

176
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,593
What are you doing here?

177
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,830
I'm sorry.

178
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,967
It's my turn to ditch you now.

179
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,842
I think it's an emergency landing.
Come on.

180
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,412
No, it's here for me.

181
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,181
For you?

182
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,552
My boss is having me picked me up.

183
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,639
You are not a soldier, right?

184
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,607
You're an accountant.

185
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,187
Yes, that's right.

186
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,324
My boss is…

187
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,228
connected with the military.

188
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,930
He's a supplier.

189
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,099
He is talking right now
with the Commanding General

190
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,434
and he wants me to be there.
I need to be there,

191
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,670
so he had me picked up.

192
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,840
So I can reach Camp Aguinaldo quicker.

193
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:31,844
Okay.

194
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,379
Big time.

195
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,849
Yes.

196
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,120
But next week…

197
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,255
let's go out on a date.

198
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,359
A date?

199
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,260
A date.

200
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,229
Next week.

201
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,499
I still have to treat your wound, right?

202
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,168
My wound will be healed by then.

203
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,170
Come on, please.

204
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,905
Even if we just watch a movie.

205
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,342
No?

206
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,146
Yes, okay.

207
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,580
-Yes?
-Yes, sure.

208
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,218
I'll see you.

209
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,569
Doc Maxine, what are you staring at?

210
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,604
What's up there?

211
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,041
Nothing, just someone I know.

212
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,813
Then why are you staring at the sky?
Who is that acquaintance?

213
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,849
Is he a person, a superhero, what?

214
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,985
The helicopter he took just left.

215
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,488
You know, Doc Earl…

216
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,458
I think he's the kindest…

217
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,497
sweetest and most gentle man
I have ever met.

218
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,266
Whoever your friend is,

219
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,336
he's full of good vibes
and positive influence.

220
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,671
Look at yourself.

221
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,906
His effect is very obvious.

222
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,877
You're blooming, Doc!

223
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:52,944
Really?

224
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,713
What is his name?

225
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,850
Wait, I think I know who it is.

226
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,286
I know it's…

227
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,821
It's…

228
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,523
"Love."

229
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,726
You're thinking too much.

230
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,328
-Come on, let's go downstairs.
-Okay.

231
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,663
-What are you doing here anyway?
-Nothing.

232
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,406
-You're so thin and sexy.
-Really?

233
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,859
It's been five years
since you last visited me in New York.

234
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,496
Good thing I kept the key to the house.

235
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,833
I checked your closet.

236
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:02,207
You didn't wear the fabulous
pre-collection that I designed.

237
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,210
Mom, you know
I don't have a social life, right?

238
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,747
If I'm not at home,
my life revolves around the hospital.

239
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,987
But we should change your routine.
Let's have this house renovated.

240
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:22,027
Let's consult my friend
who is a feng shui expert.

241
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,965
And also, why don't you get a makeover?

242
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,935
So you could get a boyfriend already.

243
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,338
Mom, I'm okay.

244
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,609
Being single doesn't make a person ugly,
and my ovaries are perfectly happy.

245
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,581
Wait, why did you visit us
all of a sudden?

246
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,419
You two had a fight?

247
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,626
I just really missed you.

248
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,562
-Really?
-Yes.

249
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:03,502
The truth is, I'm worried about you.

250
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,270
You might be getting depressed.

251
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,377
I am happy you are moving on

252
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,514
from the death of your dad,
and brother, Rodel.

253
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,685
To be honest, Mom,
I've accepted what happened to Dad.

254
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,288
But with Rodel…

255
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,694
Are you still thinking
that he's still alive?

256
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,266
Whatever they say…

257
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:40,839
even if the military say
that Rodel is gone…

258
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,180
Rodel is alive.

259
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:46,471
It's my rest day so don't expect me
to answer any of your texts or calls.

260
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,373
-I have plans.
-And where are you going?

261
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,141
-On a date.
-And that's what you're wearing?

262
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,078
I'll take a shower first.

263
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,312
-Shower?
-Okay, I'll go now.

264
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,280
You can order already.

265
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,516
The flyers are there on the fridge,
the details, and the address.

266
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,821
What are you going to do with those?

267
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,556
-Nothing.
-Hey!

268
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,925
I'm very excited
when the lights are still on.

269
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,331
This is the first time
I got excited over a movie.

270
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,368
Because of the beautiful woman beside me.

271
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,670
PRG!

272
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,510
<i>It's father!</i>

273
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,880
<i>A bomb exploded here. He was hit.</i>

274
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,315
Don't panic. I'll be there.

275
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,483
Okay.
