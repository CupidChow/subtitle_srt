1
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:15,882
<i>Lucas, that made me realize</i>
<i>that I can't stand that kind of life,</i>

2
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,052
<i>where I am always worried and scared.</i>

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,389
You said you'll wait for my next move.

4
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,556
This is it.

5
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,459
You are in the enemy's territory?
What if they find out about you?

6
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,528
No one will suspect me.

7
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,330
No one will arrest me here.

8
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,531
Are you okay?

9
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,999
Is there a problem?

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,368
How about your husband?
Is he not with you?

11
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,469
<i>I have a suspicion.</i>

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,905
-I just want to confirm it.
-That's why you're harassing her?

13
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,174
I was not harassing her.
I was just talking to her.

14
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,443
From now on, you're not allowed
to come near her.

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,414
Sir, I highly recommend
we reinforce security in the camp.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,584
There is a suspected PRG member
who entered the Medicube.

17
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:55,455
-Where is she?
-She escaped before we could identify her.

18
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,758
Doc, it seems there's no way
for us to find the patient.

19
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,759
That's unacceptable.

20
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,628
Janet and her baby
are in a delicate condition.

21
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,196
How can we find her

22
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,199
if we don't even have her last name.
What more her address?

23
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,600
<i>My pregnancy is delicate.</i>

24
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:12,806
I need a doctor and a hospital,
or else we might lose our child!

25
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:16,242
That's why I don't want you
and our baby in the military camp.

26
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,078
<i>Who knows what they can do to you</i>

27
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,480
<i>once they find out</i>
<i>how important you are to me?</i>

28
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,683
I believe I've encountered
the leader of PRG in Urdan last night.

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,653
I have reason to believe
that the woman in the Medicube

30
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,754
has connections with him.

31
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,890
You're delaying us by contacting him.

32
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,259
We need to leave
so we can get back right away.

33
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,861
Right, Captain Moira?

34
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,197
Escort them. Come back safely.

35
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,705
We've encountered
these people several times

36
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,507
since we arrive here in Urdan.

37
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,046
It's obvious our enemies are outnumbered.

38
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,380
And according to Captain,

39
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,983
their leader is injured.

40
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,153
Let's not wait for them
to be able to bounce back.

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,223
Are you saying you want
to attack the PRG Camp?

42
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:08,394
How are you going to do that
when your people are injured, Manalo?

43
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,898
That's why they won't be
expecting our attack, Sir.

44
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:16,436
They'll think we're still resting
and regaining our strength.

45
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,505
But we're ready, sir.

46
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,240
Our team is strong, sir.

47
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,309
This is really our mission here in Urdan.

48
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,944
It's best if we'll end it now.

49
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,717
We'll attack their camp.

50
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,321
They're no match for us, sir.

51
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,643
Biboy, are you sure this is the right way?

52
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,746
Yes, but I can't come with you
all the way there, Doc Beauty.

53
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,281
I'm not allowed to go there.

54
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,849
Why not?

55
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,351
That's what my mother said.

56
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,688
Okay, do not disobey your mother.

57
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,356
We'll take it from here.

58
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,490
Okay, just take care.

59
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,658
Take care, thank you.

60
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,559
Take care, Biboy.

61
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,794
-Yes.
-Take care, thank you.

62
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,830
Wait, aren't you wondering why Biboy
is not allowed to go beyond this point?

63
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,398
Well, he's still young.

64
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,567
Maybe that's why
he's not allowed to go far.

65
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,203
Let's go.

66
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,238
Come on.

67
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,106
Miss…

68
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,710
Miss, don't be scared. We are doctors.

69
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,080
We just want to ask if you know Janet,

70
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,514
the pregnant woman.

71
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,016
Is she from here?

72
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,517
You can't go there.

73
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,119
You better leave. Just leave!

74
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,293
What now?

75
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,665
Let's proceed.

76
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,085
Pistol!

77
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,557
-Somebody's coming.
-Who?

78
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,259
-Soldiers!
-Where?

79
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,227
Give that to me.

80
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,708
It looks like we have VIP visitors.

81
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,951
Where are we going?

82
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,156
We won't find Janet
if we'll just stay here.

83
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,791
What? Wait.

84
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,093
Didn't you hear what the woman said?

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,430
She's asking us to leave
so please, let's not proceed.

86
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,898
Come on.

87
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,634
Doc, they're right.

88
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,969
Let's just go back to the camp

89
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,739
we're not even sure
if who we are looking for is here.

90
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,642
I told you.

91
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,543
I'll go ahead.

92
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,644
Hey, wait.

93
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,579
Suit yourself.

94
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,448
Come on, we're almost there.

95
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,116
Stay right there!

96
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,454
Stop it.

97
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,756
Don't hurt us!

98
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,124
Give me that!

99
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,325
What is that?

100
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,226
No, please.

101
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,261
-Don't.
-Marty!

102
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,351
Tie them up.

103
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,854
Please don't!

104
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,522
Hurry! Move it.

105
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,440
Dr. Moira,
please try to understand Dr. Maxine.

106
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:51,043
She can be really stubborn
when there's something she wants to do.

107
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,612
No one can stop her.

108
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,982
Most of the time, she's right.

109
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,483
That's how good she is.

110
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,619
I have no doubt if she's good or not.

111
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,356
On one hand, I admire
her commitment with the patient.

112
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,259
But on the other,
she shouldn't be so smug in this place.

113
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,861
This is unfamiliar territory for her.

114
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,165
She shouldn't be insisting
on what she wants if it's wrong.

115
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,537
What's happening?

116
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,471
Where were you?

117
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,639
We couldn't contact you.

118
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,341
We came from a debriefing
so outside communication was not allowed.

119
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,342
Is there a problem?

120
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,545
Dr. Maxine left.

121
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,314
She went to look for Janet.

122
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,582
Janet?

123
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,451
No one will suspect me here.

124
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,619
No one will arrest me here.

125
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,223
Madame.

126
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,530
The patient who escaped earlier.
Her name is Janet.

127
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,800
<i>Hurry.</i>

128
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,470
-Keep walking.
-Ouch!

129
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,542
Keep walking.

130
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,915
Hurry up!

131
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,685
Bring them in, hurry!

132
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,091
Sit down.

133
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:16,963
Bullet,

134
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,865
they're here.

135
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,021
Who are you?

136
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,571
If you see my face, that means
you can't get out of here alive.

137
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,072
Please, don't!

138
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,942
Please. Don't hurt her.

139
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:04,810
One…

140
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,879
Please don't!

141
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,749
-Two.
-Don't.

142
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,588
Let go of her!

143
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,358
What are you doing here?

144
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,826
Let them go.

145
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,328
They are doctors.

146
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,863
They are not your enemies.

147
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,898
-Come here.
-Ouch!

148
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:26,899
Let go of me.

149
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,806
Don't be scared.

150
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,174
They need us.

151
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,043
They can't hurt us.

152
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,012
You think Captain Manalo can save us?

153
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,318
Sir, it's positive.

154
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:49,488
The woman Dr. Maxine visited
and the one who escaped from Medicube

155
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,290
<i>is connected with the leader of PRG.</i>

156
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,027
We're just waiting for your order, sir.

157
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,430
We're ready to mobilize an Urdan company.

158
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,132
<i>I know I asked you</i>
<i>for 24 hours to prepare.</i>

159
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,534
But in situation,

160
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,869
we have no choice but to attack
their camp right now.

161
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,871
That doctor is really something else.

162
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,207
She messed up our operation.

163
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,775
Are you sure you can move right away?

164
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,986
I don't want premature action, Manalo.

165
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,856
Is there a way to confirm
that Dr. Dela Cruz is really in danger?

166
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,193
<i>Or maybe she's on her way</i>
<i>back to the Medicube as we speak?</i>

167
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,261
He went to the Medicube.
He's looking for you.

168
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,797
-Biboy?
-It's Doc Beauty.

169
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,165
They kidnapped Doc Beauty.

170
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,436
What's wrong with you, Janet?

171
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,772
You almost mentioned my name
to those civilians.

172
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,806
Let them go.

173
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,875
They are kind, Rodel.

174
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,244
They helped me.

175
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,946
This is my hostages, Janet.

176
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,381
I won't set them free.

177
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,149
They came here voluntarily.

178
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,685
They are doctors.
Of course, they are concerned.

179
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,888
Don't involve them
with your anger towards soldiers!

180
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,924
They want to help, right?

181
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,262
They should help me defeat
the Special Forces.

182
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,502
Stop crying, Maxine.

183
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,537
This is my fault.

184
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,608
I shouldn't have brought you here.

185
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,478
I shouldn't have involved
you in my foolishness.

186
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,114
We won't leave you whatever happens.

187
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,215
This is your fault.

188
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,251
We should've listened to Dr. Moira.

189
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,020
Now, we are in this mess.

190
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,088
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,523
I'm really sorry.

192
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,158
Shut up, Ralph.

193
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,193
Nobody wanted this to happen.

194
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,797
You want to be a military doctor, right?

195
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,499
You should be brave.

196
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,667
Why?

197
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,071
Even Marty wasn't able
to fight them, right?

198
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,105
Marty…

199
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,476
Is that the name of the soldier
who was with you?

200
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,245
Where is Marty? Where is he?

201
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,481
Just relax, Doc.

202
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,384
We'll take care of him.

203
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,226
Come on, pretty boy.
Can't you take it?

204
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,465
Are you still going to fight?

205
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,905
Yes, you should fight.

206
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,643
Show us what your fool
of a Captain taught you.

207
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,878
Fight!

208
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:39,692
Go ahead and laugh.

209
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,028
You can only take on people like me.

210
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,732
But once the Special Forces get here,
we'll see what you've got.

211
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,702
Okay…

212
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,005
we'll wait for that.

213
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,199
You shouldn't have come along.

214
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,001
You should've waited in the Medicube.

215
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,336
I'm the one who asked Talledo
to escort them.

216
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,139
He's not yet ready
for situations like this.

217
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,708
He's in danger because of me.

218
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,511
Let's just trust him,

219
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,080
and Dr. Dela Cruz.

220
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,650
They'll get through it.

221
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,885
They'll hang on until we get there.

222
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,889
We will save them.

223
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,117
Face the camera.

224
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,257
Say your name,
and beg the hospital in Manila

225
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,862
to pay a ransom
of ten million pesos per head.

226
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,897
What?

227
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,665
Ten million?

228
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,303
You think they will
give that amount for us?

229
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,907
Doc, come on.
Let's just do as they say, please.

230
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,344
How sure are we that you will not kill us
once you get the money?

231
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,246
Don't worry, Doc,

232
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,548
you are important to Bullet.

233
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,751
Not like the soldier
you brought here with you.

234
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,992
What? Where's your guts?

235
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,102
What? Are you still going to fight?

236
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,312
Where is Marty?

237
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,147
Where is Marty?

238
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,852
We'll send his body to the military camp
together with your video.

239
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:26,191
So the soldiers will learn not
to mess with the PRG.

240
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,027
You fools!

241
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,121
Damn you!

242
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,061
Nobody shoots.

243
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,545
Just stay with me.

244
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,463
We're not going to record
the video until we see Marty.

245
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,632
Bring him here safe and alive!

246
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,237
Doc…

247
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,108
It seems like we don't understand
each other, Doc.

248
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,881
You are in our territory,

249
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,053
and you will do as we say.

250
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,618
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

251
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:33,819
You will kill me?

252
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,290
Then you lose ten million ransom money.

253
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,960
You think that's the only thing
we can do to you?

254
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,898
We just need to return you alive.

255
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,008
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

256
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,850
Please, stop this.

257
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,652
You want to go first?

258
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,455
Enough.

259
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,492
Sir, I'll do it. I'll give the message.

260
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,165
I'll record the video.
Please, let go of them.

261
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,573
What if I just kill you?

262
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,084
Bravo, who fired a shot?

263
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,153
I haven't given orders.

264
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,187
<i>Negative, Captain.</i>

265
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,656
<i>Negative too, Captain.</i>

266
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,627
If it wasn't us who fired the shot,
it most likely came from the PRG.

267
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,299
Madame.

268
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,201
Let go of her.

269
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,439
If not, Bullet will find out
what you're doing

270
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,607
and he wouldn't like that.

271
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,609
I'm just giving them a warning.

272
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,978
They're so hard headed.

273
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,646
Go ahead, Pistol.

274
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,914
I'll take it from here.

275
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,582
On whose order?

276
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,518
Bullet's.

277
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:13,986
We talked already.

278
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,687
I know the hostages.

279
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,123
I'll be able to make them follow me
more than you could.

280
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,324
So, you better go.

281
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:20,759
Go.

282
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:27,699
Let's go.

283
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,068
They're hiding here.

284
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,236
There's a lot of them.

285
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,172
There's at least thirty of them
guarding outside.

286
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,740
All of them are armed.

287
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,276
We don't know who are inside the huts.

288
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,713
We can't do this quietly.

289
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,682
What's our strategy, Big Boss?

290
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,853
Wolf, Snoopy, we'll be the Alpha Team.
We'll split into three.

291
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,256
I'll go with you.

292
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,425
Moira?

293
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,895
Don't argue anymore.

294
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,864
Captain Defensor, you'll go with us.

295
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,967
I know you can handle yourself.

296
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,420
Ma'am, won't you untie us?

297
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,958
You should still look like
hostages so they won't suspect.

298
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,328
I'm sorry, but you have
to wear these again.

299
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,365
Just trust me.

300
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:10,869
It's not that we don't trust you,
but what about you?

301
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,272
Won't your husband get mad at you?

302
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,075
Janet, just go with us.

303
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,080
You shouldn't be here,
especially your baby.

304
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,950
You are in a delicate condition.

305
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,119
It won't be safe
if you'll give birth here.

306
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,522
Do you want your child to grow
in this kind of environment?

307
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,292
I know you want to save us

308
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,829
but this is your chance
to save yourself and your baby.

309
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,616
Come on. We're not yet done!

310
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,956
Have you taken their video?

311
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,693
Madame said she will take care of it.
She said you've talked already.

312
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:08,593
We didn't.

313
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:09,961
Damn it!

314
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,263
Fire!

315
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,201
We're being attacked by soldiers.

316
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:17,736
Damn it!

317
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:18,704
Where are you going?

318
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,339
I need to get the hostages.

319
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,107
You take charge here.

320
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,543
Make sure they won't get him alive.

321
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,578
You two, come with me!

322
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,647
Spread outside.

323
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,782
Hurry!

324
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,685
That's what I'm talking about.

325
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,022
The Special Forces will wipe you out.

326
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,871
Is that Lucas?

327
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,140
Yes, we're safe now.

328
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,375
Don't wait for them.

329
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:00,045
What's important is you get out
of here so you'll be safe.

330
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,547
Trigger, you guys go ahead.

331
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,548
Bring those two.

332
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,053
Hurry.

333
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,589
We'll wait for you.

334
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,791
Janet, thank you.

335
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,595
Janet, thank you very much.

336
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,964
Please think about what I told you.

337
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,532
I can help you and the baby.

338
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,072
Where are you going?

339
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,107
Where are the other two?

340
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,781
Just let them go, Rodel.

341
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:36,982
Let them go!

342
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,450
I still a human shield.

343
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,384
Give her to me!

344
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,221
You, take your Madame away.

345
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,493
There's something you have to do.

346
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,922
Snoopy, come with me.

347
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,091
-Wolf…
-I'll go with Diego.

348
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,026
We'll look for Marty.

349
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,100
Move.

350
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,774
You think your buddies will find you here?

351
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,012
You have guts.

352
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,352
But you are no match for this.

353
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,222
Move over.

354
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,759
I will kill him.

355
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,548
Maxine…

356
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:27,719
Maxine.

357
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:30,956
-Maxine.
-Lucas.

358
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:34,326
I'm here.

359
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,094
I will save you.

360
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,140
You fell into my trap, Captain Manalo.

361
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:56,815
Put down your guns.

362
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,752
I said, put down your guns!

363
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,096
I'm not afraid to die.

364
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:14,733
How about you?

365
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:48,967
How are the men?

366
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,703
They already infiltrated
the PRG camp as of 1900, Sir.

367
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,772
<i>I asked for help from the Navy</i>
<i>and the Air Force</i>

368
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,174
for air and water surveillance
of the PRG hideout.

369
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,546
Madame, please. Bullet will get mad!

370
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,547
Let me go!

371
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,365
Doc, are you okay?

372
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,866
Can you see me?

373
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,668
-Captain Lucas…
-What?

374
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,837
Don't kill Captain Lucas.

375
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,940
<i>-No, no.</i>
<i>-Don't kill Captain Lucas.</i>

376
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,076
<i>-Not Captain Lucas.</i>
<i>-No, no.</i>

377
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,478
-Captain Lucas…
-No, Doc…
