1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,513
Come on, we're almost there.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,581
Stay right there!

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,584
-Marty!
-Marty!

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,485
<i>What happened?</i>

5
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,320
Where were you? We couldn't contact you.

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,989
We came from a debriefing.
Outside communication was not allowed.

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,125
Dr. Maxine left.

8
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,593
<i>She went to look for Janet.</i>

9
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:29,729
Who are you?

10
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:31,898
Let go of her!

11
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:33,867
Let them go.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,934
They are doctors.

13
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,504
Is there a way to confirm
that Dela Cruz really is in danger?

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,505
Biboy?

15
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,740
It's Doc Beauty. She was kidnapped.

16
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,976
Beg the hospital in Manila

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,080
to pay a ransom
of ten million pesos per head.

18
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,884
How sure are we that you will not kill us
once you get the money?

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,352
You are important to Bullet, too,

20
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,155
not like the soldier
you brought here with you.

21
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,356
Go ahead, Pistol.

22
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,524
I'll take it from here.

23
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,792
On whose order?

24
00:00:58,858 --> 00:00:59,993
Bullet's.

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,262
You should still look like hostages
so they won't suspect.

26
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,297
There's over thirty of them
guarding outside.

27
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,532
All of them are armed.

28
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,300
We can't do this quietly.

29
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,837
That's what I'm talking about.

30
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,039
The Special Forces will wipe you out.

31
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:14,908
Where are you going?

32
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,176
Let them go.

33
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,611
You know I need a human shield.
Give her to me!

34
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,081
There's something I need you to do.

35
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,407
Maxine…

36
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:51,744
Maxine.

37
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,115
Lucas?

38
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,384
I'm here now.

39
00:01:58,985 --> 00:01:59,986
I will save you.

40
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,432
You fell into my trap, Captain Manalo.

41
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:19,939
Put down your guns.

42
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,977
I said put down your guns!

43
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,354
I'm not afraid to die.

44
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,957
How about you?

45
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,111
You're brave.

46
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,781
It's only you and your men
who are cowards.

47
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,484
Let's see where your courage
will take you.

48
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,453
What now?

49
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,764
When you bring back the hostage dead,

50
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,534
it will still be a failed mission
even if you kill me.

51
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,813
Put your gun down or else!

52
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,343
Get their radios!

53
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,030
You got nothing!

54
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:04,003
She will bring us the money
so why would I kill her?

55
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,873
Tell me again how you became a soldier?

56
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,909
Go ahead. Take those two.

57
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,945
You know what to do.

58
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,760
Moira.

59
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,830
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

60
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,931
Marty.

61
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,101
Help Marty.

62
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,302
Bring him outside.

63
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,141
Men, let's go.

64
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,318
Madame, please. Bullet will be angry.

65
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,686
Let me go!

66
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,279
Damn it!

67
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,300
Go that way, I'll go this way.

68
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,802
Hold on.

69
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,036
We can't go separately.

70
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,304
Stay by my side.

71
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,364
Save the doctor!

72
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,817
They've escaped.

73
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,147
Janet.

74
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,650
What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you to leave?

75
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,084
I came back for you.

76
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,321
You shouldn't have come back.
It's dangerous for you and our child.

77
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,389
Please?

78
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,658
This is not the time for us to fight.

79
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,662
You need to get out of here
before the soldiers catch you.

80
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,874
Come on, let's head to the lake.

81
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:37,910
Why?

82
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,716
Let's go.

83
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,157
Did you hear that noise?

84
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,558
Yes.

85
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,128
It might be from just around here.

86
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,402
<i>The number you have dialed…</i>

87
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,072
-Did you get to contact them?
<i>-…or out of the coverage area.</i>

88
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,474
Earl is still out of coverage area.

89
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,376
<i>-The subscriber cannot be reached…</i>
-Marty too.

90
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,911
<i>Please try your call later.</i>

91
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,579
What are we going to do now?

92
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,282
Nothing.

93
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,985
Let's just pray.

94
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,799
Lord, please take care of Doc Maxine,
Ralph, and Earl.

95
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,339
<i>We came here to Urdan as one team.</i>

96
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,575
<i>I hope we'd still be complete</i>
<i>when we leave.</i>

97
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,547
<i>Lord, please guide the soldiers</i>
<i>who are with them.</i>

98
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,217
<i>We know that they are used to combat,</i>

99
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,020
<i>but their survival is still all up to you.</i>

100
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,059
<i>Captain Lucas and his team</i>
<i>have also become our friends.</i>

101
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,895
<i>They are good people.</i>

102
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,369
<i>I hope none of them loses their life.</i>

103
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,413
<i>I hope they will all return alive.</i>

104
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,381
How is she, sir?

105
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,950
Her pulse is strong
but she looks traumatized.

106
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,158
Sirs, these are the doctors
who were taken hostage.

107
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,026
They need to be taken to the hospital.

108
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,161
Thank you.

109
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,962
Thank you so much. Be careful.

110
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,534
Diego!

111
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,038
Moira!

112
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,075
What is it, Janet?

113
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,795
Where?

114
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,533
Moira!

115
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,302
Surrender, Bullet!

116
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,137
I will not surrender!

117
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,412
What? Are you out?

118
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,650
Rodel!

119
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,418
Rodel!

120
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,220
Rodel, you're shot!

121
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,092
Rodel, let's just surrender.

122
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:48,894
What?

123
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,597
Rodel, you might die!

124
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,232
Let's just surrender!

125
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,734
I will not surrender,
especially to soldiers!

126
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,976
Hands up.

127
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,549
Hands up.

128
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,557
Give me the gun.

129
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,727
Give me the gun!

130
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,910
Walk.

131
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,791
-Emma! Via!
-They're back.

132
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,362
Tend to the others.
I'll take care of Doc Maxine.

133
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,830
Doc? Are you okay?

134
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,398
Can you see me, Doc?

135
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,300
Doc…

136
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,835
Let's sit down here.

137
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,739
Doc, are you okay?

138
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,107
-Marty!
-Marty!

139
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,541
Can you see me?

140
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,144
Doc…

141
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,812
What if I just kill you?

142
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,747
Doc…

143
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,751
Captain Lucas…

144
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,920
What? Captain Lucas?

145
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,988
-Captain Lucas…
-What about him?

146
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,258
You fell into my trap, Captain Manalo.

147
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,260
Please don't kill Captain Lucas.

148
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,361
No, no…

149
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,297
-Please don't kill Captain Lucas.
-No…

150
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,832
-Not Captain Lucas…
-No…

151
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,634
-Captain Lucas!
-Nurse Via…

152
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,870
-Give me a sedative, please.
-Captain Lucas.

153
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,105
He's fine…

154
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,310
-Captain Lucas!
-He's fine…

155
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,211
Captain Lucas…

156
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,014
-He's fine.
-Captain Lucas…

157
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,850
Captain Lucas!

158
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:53,919
Don't!

159
00:15:56,255 --> 00:16:00,225
-Not Captain Lucas…
-No…

160
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,828
No, he's fine.

161
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,964
Captain Lucas…

162
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,001
He's okay.
He can take care of himself, don't worry.

163
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,803
He's fine.

164
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,609
Rodel!

165
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,846
Rodel, that's enough!

166
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,917
Rodel!

167
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,920
Rodel, that's enough!

168
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,566
Rodel!

169
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,508
Rodel!

170
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,382
Rodel, hurry!

171
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,084
Let's go!

172
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:40,993
Moira…

173
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,361
Moira!

174
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:43,762
Moira!

175
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,298
Where is he?

176
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,300
I better get you out of here.

177
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,169
-I can do this.
-You're wounded!

178
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,004
I'm okay as long as you're with me.

179
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,247
Just a second.

180
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,086
Have you seen Pistol?

181
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,222
It's negative.

182
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,024
We're still looking for him, over.

183
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,428
Looks like he's escaped from us.

184
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:17,996
Let's look some more.

185
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,012
Take me back to Manalo.

186
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,483
I will make sure he's dead!

187
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,854
Janet!

188
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,528
You're bleeding, Janet.

189
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,465
Janet…

190
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,739
How are the men?

191
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,976
They've already infiltrated the PRG camp
as of 1900, sir.

192
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,712
I've asked help from the Air Force
and the Navy

193
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,448
for air and water surveillance
of the PRG camp.

194
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,784
Thank you, sir.

195
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,646
Go after him!

196
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,950
Big Boss, are you okay?

197
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,554
Big Boss, are you okay?

198
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,590
Wait a second, Big Boss.

199
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,291
Hold on. Sit down first.

200
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,926
-Buddy?
-Buddy.

201
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,094
-What happened?
-Moira.

202
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,295
What happened?

203
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,863
Ma'am, the PRG almost killed him.

204
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,832
-Where is he?
-Piccolo went after him.

205
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,067
Big Boss.

206
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,902
Did anybody catch Bullet?

207
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,071
No one's seen him yet, Big Boss.

208
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,173
Wolf, come with me.

209
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,242
I'll take care of this. Get out of here.

210
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,610
I'll come with you.

211
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,781
I'll come with you, too.

212
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,383
No, you're wounded.

213
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,218
I told you, I'm okay.

214
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,554
Moira, go get treated. Go!

215
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:58,924
Harry Potter.

216
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,301
Ma'am, let's go.

217
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,903
-Ma'am, let's go.
-Okay.

218
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:13,905
Let's go.

219
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,974
Go on.

220
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,876
Just leave me behind.

221
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,146
I won't leave you and our baby.

222
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,882
Janet, we're almost at the lake.

223
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,684
Come on.

224
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,053
When we reach the town,
I'll take you to the hospital.

225
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,356
Janet…

226
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,427
Janet…

227
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,529
Janet, fight.

228
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,197
Fight for our baby.

229
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,618
Come on, let's go.

230
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,390
The lake is just here.

231
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,227
This is where they've escaped to.

232
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,830
We have assistance
from the Air Force and the Navy.

233
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,799
We will catch them for sure.

234
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,474
Janet.

235
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:23,842
Rodel!

236
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,646
We're near the lake.
Come on, just hold on.

237
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,448
We're almost there.

238
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,783
Just hold on.

239
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,699
Someone's here.

240
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,542
I've misled them.

241
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,444
We can escape.

242
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,180
Let's just wait a while.

243
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:16,721
Janet?

244
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,223
Janet?

245
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,294
Janet?

246
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:24,930
Janet?

247
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,821
There's the boat.

248
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,843
Don't move.

249
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,689
Wolf, call for backup.

250
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,396
This is Wolf, requesting for backup.

251
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,698
We caught a PRG woman.

252
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,311
Is anybody with you?

253
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,272
Rodel…

254
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,214
I love you so much.

255
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,818
I love you so much too, Janet.

256
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,120
Just hold on, Janet.

257
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,057
Just hold on for our baby.

258
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,398
Nurse Via?

259
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,101
Sir, this way.

260
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,004
-Is she a civilian?
-PRG.

261
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,106
Why are you bringing PRG members here?

262
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,341
They're the enemies, right?

263
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,043
They are still our brothers
even if they have different beliefs.

264
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,546
What do we have here?

265
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,647
Moira?

266
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,382
Why are you not resting?

267
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,784
Sir, she won't be tied down.

268
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,553
Diego, I can't rest.

269
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,189
All the doctors have been traumatized,
especially Maxine.

270
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,291
Where is she?

271
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,627
She's in the other wing.
I'll take you to her.

272
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,265
What can I do to help?

273
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,214
How is she?

274
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,051
She was uncontrollable earlier.

275
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,287
She kept on calling your name.

276
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:42,027
She was so scared
that something bad happened to you.

277
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:45,797
I'll go ahead, Sir Lucas.

278
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,732
I'll help with the others.

279
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,801
If you need anything, just let us know.

280
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:53,538
Thank you.

281
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,660
I got scared for you, too.

282
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,431
I thought I'll never see you again.

283
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,700
You scared me earlier.

284
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,235
You shouldn't have saved me.

285
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,870
You're the one who got shot instead.

286
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,571
I don't know what I'll do if…

287
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,776
That will never happen, okay?

288
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,346
I will not let this be the end of us.

289
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,047
I won't allow it.

290
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,949
How is Lucas?

291
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,684
-Is he wounded?
-Not really.

292
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,187
That guy is incredible.
It's like nothing happened.

293
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,990
He even watched over you last night.

294
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,391
He watched over me?

295
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,427
<i>Go on and continue pretending</i>
<i>to hate Maxine.</i>

296
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,997
You'll end up getting fat
from eating your own words.

297
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:04,836
Please, stop!

298
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,640
-Marty!
-What happened to Marty?

299
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,113
Father.

300
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,953
There's an earthquake in Urdan!
