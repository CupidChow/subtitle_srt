1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,079
Moira, what is the meaning of this?

2
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,648
Are they saying
that Lucas and Diego are gone?

3
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,117
<i>That they are no longer returning?</i>

4
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,653
<i>Dad won't tell me anything.
I'm also losing hope.</i>

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,391
<i>That can't be the last time I saw Lucas.
No, I won't allow it.</i>

6
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,900
Hurry, they might come back.

7
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,570
I'm almost done, Big Boss.
I'm almost done.

8
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,179
I will not say goodbye to Diego.

9
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,747
I don't want to.

10
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,783
Are you ready for your last mission?

11
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,251
What do you want us to do?

12
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,719
You'll just wear that vest.

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,822
Then we will take you
to your camp in Urdan.

14
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,692
Aren't you going to the memorial service
of Master Ramos?

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,728
I can't say goodbye to him.

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,431
I know this is also hard for you.

17
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,865
I'm still going.

18
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,769
<i>I'm going to give honor to the person
who gave direction to my life.</i>

19
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,842
We will die together!

20
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,715
Now I can kill Alpha Team's Big Boss!

21
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,352
We will die together!

22
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,755
<i>I wonder how this ship got here?</i>

23
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,896
It's here because it has grown
to love this place.

24
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,536
Like me…

25
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,040
I've also grown to love you.

26
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:45,458
I don't care if it's difficult,
complicated, or scary.

27
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,027
At least I will have no regrets.

28
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,464
I will not regret that I did not tell you.

29
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,902
I love you, Lucas.

30
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,170
Is what you said true?

31
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,706
What did you say?

32
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,742
-You don't want it?
-No, no.

33
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,178
I've waited long for this.

34
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,381
I didn't know you kept this.

35
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:16,489
If it's special to you,
you'd take care of it.

36
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,622
I'm sorry, Lucas.

37
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,199
I don't have the courage to go.

38
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,119
Please take care.

39
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,235
Lucas, you said you will come back.

40
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,177
You said you will not allow me
to miss you too much, remember?

41
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,055
I still have a lot of things to tell you.

42
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:12,799
I want to say sorry because…

43
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,637
I didn't fight for you.

44
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,643
I'm sorry if I ran away.

45
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,713
I know I shouldn't have done that.

46
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,122
I love you, Lucas.

47
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,325
I love you so much.

48
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,686
You came back? I don't have to go away.

49
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,887
No need, Moira.

50
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,957
Never again.

51
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,675
It's not true what they say
about this place.

52
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,017
I will never come back here
because I will just miss you.

53
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,485
I will only get sad.

54
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,122
I will be sad because…

55
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,493
the person I want to be with is gone.

56
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,464
Is that really you?

57
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,371
I'm sorry.

58
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,576
It took me a while to come back.

59
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,915
Not a day went by
that I didn't think of you, Maxine.

60
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:28,220
Even though it was hard,
I forced myself to stay alive for you.

61
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,557
So I can fulfil my promise to you.

62
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,464
I hate you.

63
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,599
How dare you!

64
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,269
I have been crying all this time.

65
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,840
I thought I was going to die of sadness.

66
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,509
-I hate you.
-I'm sorry.

67
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:54,180
I was so worried. I was so sad.

68
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:00,052
I thought I was going to die of sadness.

69
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,122
I have been crying a lot.
How can you do this?

70
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,057
You're so annoying.

71
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,993
I'm sorry.

72
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,863
I heard everything you said.

73
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,065
I knew it.

74
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,402
You love me to death.

75
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,473
No, I don't want to hear that.

76
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,742
Nothing about death.

77
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,410
-Please.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

78
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,246
I won't say it anymore.

79
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,525
I also love you so much, Maxine.

80
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,171
Although I know you can't say
the same about me.

81
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,306
That's not true, sir.

82
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,847
When we were abducted by the PRG,

83
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,618
I prayed every day for Big Boss
and I to survive.

84
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,588
Not so I could return to your daughter,

85
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,861
but to correct the wrong things
I have done to you.

86
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,068
I blamed you for something
that you didn't want to happen.

87
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,273
I hope you can forgive me.

88
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,209
I'm the one you should forgive, Diego.

89
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,250
I'm ready to forget the past.

90
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,854
If you will permit…

91
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,458
I want to start a new life.

92
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,837
With your daughter.

93
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,708
I want the two of you…

94
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,347
to live happily and love each other…

95
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,645
Good bye, brother.

96
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:20,219
And I hope you find the peace
that has been elusive to you.

97
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,193
You are now with Janet and your baby.

98
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,540
Are you still mad at me
after all that happened?

99
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,783
My brother has changed.

100
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,487
He even tried to hurt me.

101
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,262
And I believe you

102
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:08,534
when you said you needed to do all that
to protect the people around you.

103
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,808
It hurts me because…

104
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,047
he chose to do that…

105
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,818
instead of returning to us.

106
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,860
I thought we'd never go back here.

107
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,332
I thought Colonel Garcia
would ban me here in Urdan.

108
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,734
He will never do that.

109
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,072
We're in good terms now.

110
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,307
Yes.

111
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,978
And he knows I really want to go
back to this place.

112
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,813
Especially if I'm with you.

113
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,919
Me too, Lucas.

114
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,424
There's no one else
I want to be with, but you.

115
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,194
We've been through a lot.

116
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,231
You confessed your feelings to me.

117
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,333
-Where?
-Over there.

118
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,938
Then I rejected you.

119
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,908
Do you remember that?

120
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:05,150
But, look, we're still here.

121
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,089
I have no one else
I want to be with, but you.

122
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,763
That's why I want to do this here.

123
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,995
I can't promise that I will not leave you.

124
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,401
But I will do everything
to always come back to you.

125
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:03,509
There are many challenges
in the life of a soldier, right?

126
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,380
But I'm sure…

127
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,185
that I will love you forever.

128
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,672
I will marry you.

129
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:17,082
My life becomes bright when I'm with you.

130
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,353
I like that. It's like in a commercial.

131
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,590
Go on. What else?

132
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,093
-What else?
-What else?

133
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,495
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

134
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,630
Okay.

135
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:38,737
That's why I'll make you happy every day
for the rest of our lives.

136
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,038
How does that sound?

137
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,310
-Why?
-This is it. I'm so happy.

138
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,511
-This is it.
-That's it?

139
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,547
-Yes!
-Okay.

140
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,018
How about you? What do you have?

141
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,019
Me?

142
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,127
I'm not difficult to please.

143
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,366
You alone are enough for me.

144
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,374
What can you say?
I put up a good fight, right?

145
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,812
-You still have something?
-Yes, I have more.

146
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,314
-Okay, go.
-I have more.

147
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,949
Go ahead.

148
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,449
How long have you been there?

149
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:36,988
You too?

150
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,057
When are you getting married?

151
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,160
Soon.

152
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,399
You want to have
a double wedding, Big Boss?

153
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,002
Sure.

154
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,407
Diego, it looks
like you've really replaced me.

155
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,908
Hey.

156
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,910
You did it first.

157
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,215
Excuse me, ma'am, sir.

158
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,685
We interrupted Big Boss
and Doc Maxine's kiss.

159
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,155
You should get back to it
before this story takes a different turn.

160
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,126
You too, Sergeant Ramos and Captain Moira.

161
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,298
Let them do it.

162
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,835
Kiss her!

163
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,280
What's that?

164
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,652
It looks like it came
from the power plant.

165
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,460
Wolf, call the camp.

166
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,431
It looks like it's going to be
a long haul.

167
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,567
Wait.

168
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,636
Help me.

169
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:08,613
Okay.

170
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,418
Can you do it?

171
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,387
Of course, I can!
