1
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,480
I still can't believe it, Big Boss.

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,218
The person who hurt your father
turned out to be Doc Maxine's brother.

3
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,020
You already know everything?

4
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,890
Now that the military knows,
will she be punished?

5
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:28,361
You can help us in our military efforts
to defeat the rebels.

6
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,130
You can be our asset inside the PRG.

7
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,966
Don't think
that you're betraying your brother.

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,538
If we let the PRG continue,
Bullet will harm even more people.

9
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,173
You should think about it carefully.

10
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,811
Even though her brother
is the leader of the PRG,

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,846
Doc Maxine is a different person, right?

12
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,849
<i>All units, keep a close watch
on Doctor Dela Cruz.</i>

13
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,618
<i>Report to me if she goes out of the camp.</i>

14
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,955
I wonder what Doc Maxine did this time.

15
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,291
That's good, so she won't get in trouble
outside the camp.

16
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,959
The colonel probably got fed up with her.

17
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,096
Bullet is Doc Maxine's brother.
That's what I heard.

18
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,532
Big Boss might get into trouble again
because of her.

19
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,835
You seem to be asking too much
from Doc Maxine, Dad.

20
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,371
So you think she will not agree?

21
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,239
She will not help us?

22
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,075
Well, as you know, Dad,

23
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:19,446
it's hard to overpower feelings,
especially when it comes to family.

24
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,214
You and Diego are still not okay?

25
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,350
I don't know if he can separate
his feelings for me

26
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,219
from what happened
between the two of you, Dad.

27
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:30,657
I'm sorry, Moira…
if I am the reason you're unhappy now.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,562
<i>Your brother is alive!</i>

29
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,898
Mom, even I was shocked.

30
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:44,003
I told you not to lose hope.

31
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,140
<i>But I lost hope.</i>

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,480
<i>I'm his mother, but I gave up easily.</i>

33
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,050
<i>I just accepted that your brother is dead.</i>

34
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,786
It wasn't easy for you, too, right?

35
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,922
You really had a hard time moving on.

36
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,491
<i>But you…</i>

37
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,061
<i>You didn't move on.</i>

38
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,932
<i>You didn't give up on your brother.</i>

39
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:19,639
<i>Maybe that's why
you're the one who found him.</i>

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,774
<i>I will come home.</i>

41
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,245
<i>I want to see your brother.</i>

42
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,815
I'm sorry, but the reunion you want
will not happen.

43
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,886
Mom…

44
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,022
Rodel is…

45
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,661
He is the leader of the PRG here in Urdan.

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,632
<i>How did that happen?</i>

47
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,203
<i>-Oh, my god, Maxine. Your brother.</i>
-Mom…

48
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,105
What's wrong?

49
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,647
I spoke to my mom. I told her everything.

50
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,885
You mean everything?

51
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,188
Everything.

52
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,176
This is all I can do for you right now.

53
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,280
It's okay.

54
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,052
That's okay.

55
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,822
The important thing right now is…

56
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,794
I'm no longer hiding anything,
especially to you.

57
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,669
You probably know that Colonel Garcia
wants me to be an asset

58
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,704
against the PRG and my brother, right?

59
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,311
They asked me to talk to you.

60
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,617
They think I can convince you.

61
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,786
Convince me?

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,791
What do you mean,
they want me to betray my brother?

63
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,501
Will you really make me choose
who's more important to me?

64
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,348
Lucas, I'm the one
who's caught in the middle here.

65
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:21,087
No matter what I decide to do,
I will end up losing.

66
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,925
Whatever choice I make,
I will hurt someone.

67
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,962
How about you?

68
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,968
Won't you get hurt if I don't choose you?

69
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,008
Have you decided already?

70
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,249
But I'm sure you will get hurt.

71
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,991
Now, I'm sure that you'll resent me
if I don't help you.

72
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,297
But if I help you…

73
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,770
my brother will never forgive me.

74
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,218
I won't deny that I will be hurt if…

75
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,755
if you don't choose me.

76
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,426
But I will understand.

77
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,965
I know how hard it is for you
to make this choice.

78
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,203
I will respect that.

79
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,349
If I help you,

80
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,154
can I get the assurance
that no one will get hurt,

81
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,789
especially my brother?

82
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,091
Lucas, a lot of people there are sick.

83
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,860
Many are wounded.
I don't want them to get involved.

84
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,834
Lucas, tell me the truth, please.

85
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,280
I can't promise that.

86
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,920
Especially if…

87
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,690
if your brother fights back.

88
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,162
Maxine, you have been here
in the camp long enough.

89
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,904
There's no certainty in things like this.

90
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,632
<i>Rodel is…</i>

91
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,468
<i>He is the leader of the PRG here in Urdan.</i>

92
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,907
<i>-Oh, my god, Maxine. Your brother.
-Mom.</i>

93
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,643
Mom, I also don't know what to do.

94
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,446
Of course I want to save my brother.

95
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,682
I want him back,

96
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,818
but I can't do that
as long as he is with the PRG.

97
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:50,156
<i>But can you ensure
the safety of your brother</i>

98
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,024
<i>if you cooperate with the military?</i>

99
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,529
I can't answer your question.

100
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,299
Mom?

101
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:06,639
<i>I just found out
that your brother is alive.</i>

102
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,943
<i>I want to see him, I want to hug him.</i>

103
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,082
<i>What if your brother gets hurt
because of what you're planning to do?</i>

104
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,219
<i>I don't want to lose your brother again.</i>

105
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,800
Rodel.

106
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:54,754
You can help us in our military efforts
to defeat the rebels.

107
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,724
You can be our asset inside the PRG.

108
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,092
Are you serious?

109
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,330
If you won't betray your brother,
you will betray your country.

110
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,599
If you protect your brother…

111
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,735
it's like you're supporting
their terrorizing here in Urdan…

112
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,204
harming people…

113
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,073
and the killing of soldiers.

114
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,976
Soldiers like the man you love.

115
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,378
Can you take that?

116
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,749
Don't think
that you're betraying your brother.

117
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,852
The truth is, you'll be saving him.

118
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,655
If we let the PRG continue…

119
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,459
Bullet will harm even more people.

120
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,396
And the cases against him will pile up.

121
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,699
And the military will have no choice,

122
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,334
but to increase operations
against the PRG.

123
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:48,107
And surely, your brother will likely die
in an encounter.

124
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:54,146
But it will not come to that
if you help us catch him.

125
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,218
<i>If I help you,</i>

126
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,956
can I get the assurance
that no one will get hurt,

127
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,291
especially my brother?

128
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,593
I can't promise that.

129
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,263
Especially if…

130
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,201
if your brother fights back.

131
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,577
There's no certainty in things like this.

132
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,127
I've also talked to my dad last night,

133
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,963
and he is also anxious
about Maxine's decision.

134
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,167
Well, no matter what Maxine's decision is,

135
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,603
the operation against the rebels
will continue.

136
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,507
Big Boss, we will still face the PRG.

137
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,844
You might still have an encounter
with Bullet.

138
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,516
I already thought about it.

139
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,286
I'm thinking of asking for a reassignment.

140
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,758
So I would not be involved
in the operations here in Urdan.

141
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:15,594
Really?

142
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,531
What are you talking about, Big Boss?

143
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,933
The General will not allow it.

144
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,602
You are the Big Boss of the Alpha Team.

145
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,641
We were all sent here with a mission
to defeat the rebels.

146
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,975
And now you are leaving?

147
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,782
It's a conflict of interest.

148
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,588
Your relationship with Maxine
is more important…

149
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,925
than your sworn duty?

150
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,728
So that's how it is now?

151
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,567
Diego, stop it.

152
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,037
Can't you see that
what's happening to them is similar

153
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,672
to what we have been through?

154
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,419
Can we talk?

155
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,776
I have three things to tell you.

156
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,813
You're making me nervous.

157
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,090
First.

158
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,528
I'm not agreeing to be a military asset.

159
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,198
I can't do that to my brother.

160
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,769
Well, I understand that.

161
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,440
Second.

162
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,378
I'm leaving Urdan.
I'm going back to Manila.

163
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,214
Hold on.

164
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,085
-Lucas…
-You don't have to do that.

165
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,458
I don't want you to be conflicted
because of me.

166
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,093
It will just be harder for you.

167
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,565
And third.

168
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,240
It's better if we break up.

169
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:50,983
What do you mean?

170
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,755
Maxine, we already talked about this.

171
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,093
We agreed not to give up.

172
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,462
What are you talking about?

173
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,930
I know, Lucas.

174
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,600
But I can't bear to see you suffer.

175
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,071
As long as I'm here in Urdan…

176
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,841
this conflict will not end.

177
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,344
Colonel Garcia will only continue
to pick on you.

178
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,313
-General Defensor might get mad at you.
-So what?

179
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,382
They're not part of our relationship.

180
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,452
Let's not fool ourselves, Lucas.

181
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,062
Things will only be harder for us.

182
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,768
Whenever you have an operation,
all I'll be thinking about is…

183
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,574
Will you and Rodel have an encounter?
Will you kill each other?

184
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,411
Do you think…

185
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,714
Do you think we will be happy then?

186
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,486
I can resign.

187
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,055
Or I can request for a reassignment.

188
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,923
-Lucas!
-There are a lot of options.

189
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,996
I will not let you turn your back
on your job, Lucas.

190
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,067
Because I love you. I love you so much.

191
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,502
There you go.

192
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,537
If that's the case…

193
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,906
Then why?

194
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,551
When you are caught in the middle
of two opposing rocks,

195
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,655
there is no better solution
than to get out.

196
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,091
So that's why you're leaving?

197
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,627
That's why you're leaving me?

198
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,497
I thought…

199
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,203
Maxine, we already talked about this.

200
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,339
That you will not give up.
We will not give up.

201
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,077
Maybe you just don't understand it now.

202
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,815
But someday,
you will realize that I'm right.

203
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,650
No. This is wrong.

204
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,718
Because If you love me…

205
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,722
If we really love each other,
we will fight for it.

206
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,025
Even if I get wounded…

207
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,661
Even if I get hurt or die,

208
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,896
as long as I accomplish my mission,
that's what counts.

209
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,466
And what's important
is we will do it together.

210
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,305
Maxine, let's not give up.

211
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,580
Lucas, you are a soldier,
that why you see things that way.

212
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:41,386
I'm a doctor
and I believe in doing the least damage.

213
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,399
I don't want us to get to a point
where we can't stand each other.

214
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,935
And you and my brother
are at war with each other.

215
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,178
I still want to remember
all the good memories that we've shared.

216
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,749
So while it's still not too late…

217
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,152
let's end this.

218
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,007
I have made my decision, Lucas.

219
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,348
I hope you can respect my decision.

220
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,443
If I can't help in the way you want me to…

221
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,347
it would be better if I just leave Urdan.

222
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,449
You're really unbelievable.

223
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,918
You already have an exit plan.

224
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,988
I thought you talked to your girlfriend?

225
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,624
You made her understand…

226
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:12,397
that her cooperation is important
in our operation.

227
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,665
Garcia, that's enough.

228
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,802
I can't influence the decision
of Dr. Dela Cruz.

229
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,739
She has a mind of her own.

230
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,709
And we can't force her to do anything.

231
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,880
Lucas is right.

232
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,859
You should leave Urdan
so there will be no more trouble.

233
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,097
Pack your things, you leave tomorrow.

234
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,004
Go ahead.

235
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,148
Hello, Maxine?

236
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,216
Rodel.

237
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,178
I really regret that I hurt your mother.

238
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,251
I love you so much, my child.

239
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,188
Are you mad at me?

240
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,124
Do you think I'm taking you away from him?

241
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,361
<i>I can't take you to the airport.
I've assigned Tamayo to go with you.</i>

242
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:59,030
<i>You said you wanted me
to respect your decision.</i>

243
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,333
<i>If I come send you off,
I won't be able to do that.</i>

244
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,267
I might stop you.

245
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,036
I might force you
to change your mind about us.

246
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,442
-We got ambushed.
-Where is Maxine?

247
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,010
Where did she go?

248
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,414
You animal! Don't involve my sister!

249
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,017
Looks like you are in no position
to make demands.

250
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,187
<i>So you will do everything I say.</i>
