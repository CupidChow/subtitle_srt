1
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,347
-I thought you're not coming.
-You know I can't do that.

2
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:18,151
I told you I won't abandon you.

3
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,553
I'm sorry. I'm not good at lying.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,855
What's the problem?

5
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,656
There's something I need to tell you.

6
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,291
Just stay here, Maxine.

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,494
I'm leaving. People are waiting for me.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,962
Don't let her go.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,797
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,499
Don't worry about that, Big Boss.

11
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,634
<i>We owe Doc Maxine a lot.</i>

12
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,771
You think Lucas can still save you.

13
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,773
As long as I'm alive,
he can't get you from me.

14
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:40,707
Do you understand?

15
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,244
<i>Answer me.</i>

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,056
Let me go!

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,559
-That hurts. Let me go!
-You really won't quit!

18
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:00,660
Let her go!

19
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,196
Put your guns down
or the doctor gets hurt.

20
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,130
Put your hands up.

21
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,934
Maxine, run!

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,676
Big Boss, I got this.

23
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,414
<i>Don't move.</i>

24
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,450
<i>There are land mines scattered around.</i>

25
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,051
<i>How do we get out of here?</i>

26
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,486
<i>Just trust me.</i>

27
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,579
You're safe now.

28
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,251
Let's go.

29
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,923
How can you do that, Doc?
We were worried sick about you.

30
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,561
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

31
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,064
What really happened?

32
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,835
My brother didn't want me to leave.

33
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,505
What? Your brother held you hostage?

34
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,406
Something like that.

35
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,109
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,479
Does Captain Lucas already know this?

37
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,316
But…

38
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,920
I really feel so guilty.

39
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,226
Because of my foolishness,
a lot of people are getting involved.

40
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,530
Especially Lucas.

41
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,906
I'm sorry. You got involved because of me.

42
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,109
Big Boss, come on. We are a team.

43
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,211
That's right.

44
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,613
Good thing we were not given a sanction.

45
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:08,421
With all your mischiefs, Big Boss,
it's a wonder you're still here in Urdan.

46
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,557
Don't get smart with me.

47
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,592
-Are you feeling better now?
-Yes, of course, Big Boss.

48
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,229
Our medical team takes good care of us,
especially Doc Maxine.

49
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,270
This place is really dangerous
for Doc Maxine.

50
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,306
I'm worried about her.

51
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:32,245
But it seems danger
always find its way to her.

52
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,546
That's the thing, Big Boss.

53
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,383
Have you asked her
how she got into the PRG camp?

54
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:44,357
I asked her earlier,
but she doesn't want to talk.

55
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,227
Could she be hiding something?

56
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,636
It looks like you're in a hurry.
Where are you going?

57
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,008
I'm going to Sitio Santos
to see Miss Sheila.

58
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,010
I will bring some medicine.

59
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,179
Do you want me to come with you?

60
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,449
I'll just ask Nurse Hazel.

61
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,217
I just remembered.
There's something I have to do.

62
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,192
Is that blood?
Where did you get it?

63
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:22,996
Where have you been?

64
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:27,300
I came from the other Sitio.

65
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,035
Don't tell Lucas, okay?

66
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,840
What is it that you won't tell me?

67
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,745
She went to…

68
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,847
Where?

69
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,050
Where did Maxine go?

70
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,152
She went to the PRG camp.

71
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,903
Doc Maxine, do you know
why we asked you to come here?

72
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,043
Don't worry.

73
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,514
This is just a standard debriefing
for civilians like you

74
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,384
who went through a traumatizing situation.

75
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:58,391
What do you want to know?

76
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,729
First of all, where is the PRG camp?

77
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,467
Maxine, you have no right to judge me.

78
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,536
You don't know what I went through
in the hands of those soldiers.

79
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,140
I don't know.

80
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,710
I was blindfolded
when I was brought there.

81
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,146
What were you doing there
in the first place?

82
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,555
I'm your older brother, but you prefer
to listen to those soldiers.

83
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,892
So whether you like it or not,
you are now a member of PRG.

84
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,061
You can longer go back to your camp!

85
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:43,403
I heard that many people were injured
in the encounter.

86
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,707
I went there
to conduct medical assistance.

87
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,078
But they held me hostage.

88
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,314
But you know that the PRG are our enemies.

89
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,350
And because of what you did…

90
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,189
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,996
I apologize. I thought I was helping.

92
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,865
You are not of help all the time, Doctor.

93
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:18,571
How did you gain access to the PRG camp?
Do you have a contact inside?

94
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:29,081
It is impossible for you to go there
on your own without a contact inside.

95
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,454
You can be a valuable asset to the group.
We need a doctor in the camp.

96
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,690
Have you gone mad, Rodel?
Are you out of your mind?

97
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,393
I am your sister! You can't do this to me!

98
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,295
I'm sorry, my sister.

99
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you have a contact inside the PRG?

100
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,072
You think Lucas can still save you.

101
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,641
As long as I'm alive,
he can't get you from me.

102
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,542
Do you understand?

103
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,912
I will repeat my question.

104
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,950
Do you have a contact inside the PRG?

105
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,990
-Do you want the soldiers to kill me?
-They won't kill you!

106
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,658
You don't know what you're talking about!

107
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,364
Why won't you speak?

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,002
Are you protecting someone?

109
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,977
Brother.

110
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,565
Sir, we can't force Maxine to speak
until she's ready.

111
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:56,068
Clearly, she's still traumatized
by what happened.

112
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,371
Lucas is right.

113
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,613
Sir, if she will not talk,

114
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,017
we can't gather intel about the PRG.

115
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,021
Let's just wait until she's ready to talk.

116
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,824
I'm sure she will give us what we need.

117
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,119
I'm sorry you had to go through
the interrogation earlier.

118
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:55,328
Do you think they will give me a sanction
because I didn't cooperate?

119
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,865
They can't force you
if you are not ready yet.

120
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,869
I'm sorry, Lucas.
I wasn't of help in the interrogation.

121
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,341
Why weren't you able to speak?

122
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,611
Is something holding you back?

123
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,882
There are many things going on
in my mind right now.

124
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,651
That's why I am rattled.

125
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,037
<i>Really, sir?</i>

126
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,473
Doc Maxine refused to talk?

127
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,842
That's what I'm wondering about.

128
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,811
Because when the Colonel asked her…

129
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,114
I will repeat my question.

130
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,416
Do you have a contact inside the PRG?

131
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,620
Why can't you speak?

132
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,456
Are you protecting someone?

133
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,327
She didn't say a word.

134
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,463
She didn't answer.

135
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,500
Could the Colonel's suspicion be right?

136
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:12,772
Maybe Maxine really knows someone
inside the PRG.

137
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,242
What makes you say that?

138
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:22,882
I'm wondering how Maxine was able
to go there alone.

139
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,053
We've been searching for the PRG camp
for a long time.

140
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,455
And we never found them.

141
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,192
Who could her contact be inside?

142
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,962
Did she mention anything to you, Big Boss?

143
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:39,832
No.

144
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,403
Big Boss, you should be ready.

145
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,406
For sure, the Colonel
will give Maxine a sanction.

146
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,290
We reviewed your conduct here in Urdan
for the past few weeks.

147
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,193
You have violated many policies.

148
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,364
This is the last time
you will violate the protocol here.

149
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,236
I promise, it will never happen again.

150
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:23,008
Because you need to leave, ASAP.

151
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,545
You're asking me to leave Urdan?

152
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:34,320
But we need to follow the rules
for the safety of everyone.

153
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,237
We can't do this to Maxine.
We can't ask her to leave.

154
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,407
Sir, Maxine is a big help here in Urdan.

155
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,977
It'll be a big loss if she leaves.

156
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,483
You are defending her
because she is your girlfriend.

157
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,118
No, sir.

158
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,588
What I mean is,
Maxine is helping a lot of people, sir.

159
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,725
And one of them is Captain Moira.

160
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,826
We know that.

161
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,901
Coronel, let's talk in private.

162
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,296
What, Doc?
They're asking you to leave Urdan?

163
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,330
Why?

164
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,668
I made a lot of violations.

165
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:59,471
General Defensor decided
to send me back to Manila.

166
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,509
They can't do that.
How about the medical team?

167
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,278
You can do it.

168
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,515
It's probably better if I'm not here.

169
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,716
No.

170
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,820
If Doc Maxine is leaving,
then I'm leaving too.

171
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,656
How about Nurse Via and Nurse Emma?

172
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,993
Do they know this, too?
I'm sure they will leave, too.

173
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,695
Yes, me too.

174
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,432
Wait, don't think like that.

175
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,235
Remember you have responsibilities here.

176
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:33,372
Doc Maxine, we can't do things
without you.

177
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,275
If not for you,
the medical team will not be complete.

178
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,744
-You are our source of strength.
-That's true.

179
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,082
Whatever happens,
you're still our leader.

180
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,105
<i>-Can you save him?
-What?</i>

181
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,840
I need to hear it from you.

182
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,141
I can do it.

183
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,978
Do it.

184
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,784
Captain Manalo's duty
is to obey the orders of his superiors.

185
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,353
But what did he do?
He disobeyed it because of your operation.

186
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,622
Do you know what might happen to him?

187
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,225
Not only will his career be destroyed,

188
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,161
he can also be imprisoned
if Mr. Fayad will not wake up.

189
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,497
Why didn't you tell me?

190
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:37,169
You could've stopped me.
You shouldn't be there right now.

191
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,570
I could have.

192
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:43,142
But I know you will be frustrated
if you can't save his life.

193
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,311
Because of you, I disobeyed direct orders.

194
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,713
I sacrificed my career because of you.

195
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,685
Shouldn't it matter more
we saved Mr. Fayad than listened to them?

196
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,520
It's an honor to save lives.

197
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,922
But, Maxine,
there are no perfect institutions.

198
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,925
You have to accept
that there is dignity in humility.

199
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,161
Because no matter what we say,
what I did is still wrong.

200
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,463
Whatever we say, I'm still a soldier!

201
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,532
I will not ask if you are mad at me.

202
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,603
But I hope you understand
that I did it for my patient.

203
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,173
<i>You put all my men in danger,
Doctor Dela Cruz.</i>

204
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,142
<i>You risked their lives
just for the sake of a PRG member.</i>

205
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,511
<i>Now tell me, are you a good doctor?</i>

206
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,882
<i>Being a doctor doesn't suit you.</i>

207
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,720
You'll be responsible
if any of my men dies.

208
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,957
I hope someday you can forgive me.

209
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,592
It's not that easy.

210
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,329
Especially when my men
are fighting for their lives.

211
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,741
<i>I promise it will never happen again.</i>

212
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,410
Yes, we know, because you need to leave.

213
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,646
Maxine is a big help here in Urdan.

214
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,982
It's a big loss if she leaves.

215
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,589
You are defending her
because she is your girlfriend.

216
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,224
No, sir.

217
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,293
What I mean is,
Maxine is helping a lot of people.

218
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,085
Maxine, I talked to General Defensor.

219
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,254
He reversed his decision.

220
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,658
You can stay. You don't have to leave.

221
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:47,499
Hey, Maxine, that's good news.
Why does it seem like you're not happy?

222
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,148
Lucas, I already made a decision.

223
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,118
I've come to realise that…

224
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,023
I've put you in danger too many times

225
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,993
because of my selfishness.

226
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,198
Even your job is getting affected.

227
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,635
Maxine, you know that I will defend you
at all cost.

228
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,307
I will do everything for you,
even if it affects my job.

229
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,410
I know that, Lucas.

230
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,980
But you don't have to sacrifice your job
because of me.

231
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,383
And you don't have to defend me
all the time.

232
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,420
Why not? You are my girlfriend.

233
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,856
That's the thing. I'm your girlfriend.

234
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:48,127
I should be lifting you up,
not pulling you down.

235
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,396
Wait a second. Maxine, I don't get it.

236
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,237
I have decided.

237
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,573
I'm leaving Urdan.

238
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,612
Maxine, why?

239
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:13,452
So you can concentrate on your job
without any distractions.

240
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,194
I'm more inspired because you are here.

241
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,496
I'm inspired to work harder.

242
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,165
So what are you talking about?

243
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,344
Lucas, I already made a decision.

244
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:14,880
Lucas, please.
Don't convince me to stay.

245
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,522
I don't want you to leave.

246
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,639
You are most important for me.
I'm willing to take a risk right now.

247
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,642
What's important for me
is I'm always with you.

248
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,646
I'm Technical Sergeant Ramos
of the Special Forces.

249
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,516
Tasked to take care
and make Captain Moira Defensor happy.

250
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,025
The reason why he used to be
against our relationship

251
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:39,364
is because he's afraid for us to find out
about his connection with my mother.

252
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,669
He left my mother for you and your mom.

253
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:47,306
I'm sorry, Moira, because I've hurt you.

254
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:52,711
But every time I see you, I remember
all of the pain, and all of the anger.

255
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,079
What about us?

256
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,984
Is it that easy for you
to give up everything we fought for?

257
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,503
It hurts.

258
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,540
Don't move too much,
your wound might open up.

259
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,048
How are you feeling?

260
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,254
My body feels heavy.

261
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,558
That's normal.

262
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,467
Did you watch over me the whole time?

263
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,304
I just want to make sure you'll be okay.

264
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,664
I just want to thank you.

265
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,508
Despite everything that I did to you.

266
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,014
You don't have to thank me.

267
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,722
I'm just doing my job.

268
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:55,467
Anyway, you should focus on your recovery.

269
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,636
Captain Lucas needs you.

270
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,971
The Alpha Team is not complete
without you.

271
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,475
I'll be back to check on you.

272
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,323
Lucas won't allow me to leave Urdan.

273
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,760
He really loves you.

274
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,895
He does not want to be away from you.

275
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,699
But because of me, his job is affected.

276
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:36,274
If only my brother did not become a rebel,
things wouldn't be this complicated.

277
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,777
I don't know.

278
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,582
My life is such a mess. What now?

279
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:48,320
Doc, why don't you tell Captain Lucas
about your brother?

280
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,692
They hate each other to the bone.

281
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,695
It will only make matters worse,
believe me.

282
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:00,832
But, Doc, don't you trust Captain Lucas?

283
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,467
I do, of course.

284
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:06,171
So you should not be afraid to tell him.

285
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,374
Because if Captain Lucas really loves you,

286
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:13,545
he will understand your situation,
whatever it is.

287
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:46,645
If you want a lasting relationship,

288
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,147
you should start
with a foundation of trust.

289
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:53,985
Do not let your relationship be destroyed
and end up like me and Diego.

290
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,989
Captain Moira Defensor, don't leave.

291
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,860
Remember, I am your superior.

292
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,564
My rank is higher than yours,
Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos.

293
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,033
Yes, I know your rank is higher.

294
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,036
But I think we are equals.

295
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,337
What do you mean?

296
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,939
Have you seen Lucas?

297
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,273
Yes, he was there earlier.

298
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,342
The young rebel just woke up.

299
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,978
Are they talking?
What are they talking about?

300
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,913
We have another camp
that you don't know about.

301
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,948
Where?

302
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,317
Maybe it has something to do
with your brother.

303
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,922
This is your end.
