1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,913
Lucas won't allow me to leave Urdan.

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,082
He really loves you.

3
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:21,788
If only my brother did not become a rebel,
things wouldn't be this complicated.

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,592
Why don't you just tell Captain Lucas
about your brother?

5
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:31,031
If Captain Lucas really loves you,
he will understand your situation.

6
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:35,101
He just woke up
after being in a coma for several days.

7
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,170
It's safe to talk to him.

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,571
I'm begging you.

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,209
The PRG will kill my family
if they find out where I am.

10
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,813
I will help you,
but you also need to help me.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,983
You will tell me where the PRG camp is.

12
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,688
<i>Where is Moira?</i>

13
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,023
I need to talk to her.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,826
I heard her talking to her dad.

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,829
<i>They were talking
about Doc Moira's reassignment.</i>

16
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,731
Why didn't you tell me
that you're leaving?

17
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,902
Captain Moira Defensor, do not leave.

18
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:15,241
You'll lead me on
and then break up with me again?

19
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,943
No, Moira.

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,078
Master Ramos?

21
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,346
What is it again, Talledo?

22
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,915
It's Big Boss.

23
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,452
He hasn't been responding to our calls.
Colonel Garcia is looking for him.

24
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,187
Where did he say he'll go?

25
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,564
This is your end.

26
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,799
Lucas!

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,968
Don't kill him!

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,472
He is my brother.

29
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,541
He's my older brother, Rodel.

30
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,377
So please Lucas, don't kill him.

31
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,445
Please.

32
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,587
-Rodel!
-Now, this is your end.

33
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,526
Rodel, stop it! What's wrong with you?

34
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,029
I won't allow you to hurt Lucas.

35
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,666
Are you really choosing that soldier
over your brother?

36
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,071
I'm choosing that none of you get hurt!

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,442
Rodel, just let us go.

38
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,610
We're leaving now.

39
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,211
You can't!

40
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,248
You saw him trying to kill me earlier,
didn't you?

41
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,618
-But he didn't do it!
-Well, that's his fault.

42
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,755
Lucas Manalo owes me big time.

43
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,960
Maxine, he came here defenseless
and with no backup.

44
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,531
-So it's my chance to kill him!
-Rodel!

45
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,904
<i>We're looking for Doc Maxine.</i>

46
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,643
They are not in the Medicube.

47
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,179
They are not also in the barracks.

48
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,183
Doc Maxine and Big Boss are both missing.

49
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,385
Could they be just out on a date?

50
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,624
They won't go without letting anyone know
if it was just a date.

51
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,927
I have a bad feeling.

52
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:15,962
It's Doc Maxine.

53
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,630
What about her?

54
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,875
Let him be or I'll be forced to hurt you.

55
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,644
Go ahead! Hurt me!

56
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,048
You already did, remember?

57
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,917
You held your own sister hostage.

58
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,654
I trusted you, Rodel.

59
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,258
Maxine, in the world I belong to now…

60
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,029
You can even ask your soldier boyfriend.

61
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,565
He'll do everything
to accomplish his mission!

62
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,204
That's the truth, right?

63
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:03,776
He killed Janet and my child
just to defeat the PRG!

64
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,178
That's not true.

65
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,983
I would never hurt women,
especially those who are pregnant.

66
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,118
I know Janet.

67
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,955
I know her because she was our patient
in the Medicube.

68
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,758
The truth is, we were helping Janet.

69
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,159
-Liar!
-That's the truth!

70
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,361
No!

71
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,330
Lucas is not lying.

72
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,334
We took care of Janet and her baby.

73
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,938
We can take care of you
here in the hospital.

74
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,140
But you need to stay

75
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:38,444
so we can monitor your vitals
and the condition of your baby.

76
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,046
Okay?

77
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,016
You should take care of yourself
for your baby.

78
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,852
I had the entire Medicube checked
before I called you,

79
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,387
but she's really gone.

80
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,324
You should come with us.

81
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,828
Your pregnancy is very delicate
and it's not safe if you give birth here.

82
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,998
Do you want your child
to grow up in this kind of place?

83
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,034
I know you want to save us.

84
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,571
But this is your chance to save yourself,
especially your baby.

85
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,745
Don't blame Lucas.

86
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,449
Don't blame him
for something he didn't do.

87
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,717
Shut up!

88
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,990
You know what, Maxine?

89
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,859
You are blinded by your love for that man.

90
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,096
-That's why he deserves to die!
-Rodel!

91
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,295
Just go.

92
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,899
Go back to where you came from.

93
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,568
Leave!

94
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,342
We'll see each other again, Manalo.

95
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,991
Lucas, we need to stop the bleeding.

96
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,592
We have to get out of here.

97
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,498
Hurry! Those gunshots
are not far from here.

98
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,667
Bullet!

99
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,602
What happened?

100
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,071
Captain Manalo is still in the area
with my sister.

101
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,340
Go after them! They haven't gone far.

102
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,771
Why did you mention her name?

103
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,873
She was asking me earlier…

104
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,676
about the PRG camp.

105
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,780
She wanted to know where it is.

106
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,315
Maybe that's where she went.

107
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,653
Why would she go back
where she was held hostage?

108
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,131
If you know something, please…

109
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,133
tell us now.

110
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,661
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,898
This is all I can do now.

112
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,303
Wait, let's try to call again.
Maybe there's reception here.

113
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,374
Before we return to the camp…

114
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,748
I want to know why.

115
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,696
We were both looking for the same person.

116
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,271
When did you find out?

117
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,777
Why did you hide it from me?

118
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,148
I got scared.

119
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,687
I didn't know what your reaction will be.

120
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,690
-That's why you lied?
-Lucas, no.

121
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,891
What do you mean?

122
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,860
You never lied?

123
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,533
You've never lied…

124
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,171
for your brother who is part of the PRG?

125
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,755
It seems you're in a hurry.
Where are you going?

126
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,659
I'm going to Sitio Santos.

127
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,862
I'm going to Mrs. Sheila.
I'm bringing medicine.

128
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,732
This is blood. Where did you get this?

129
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,636
Where have you been?

130
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,907
I came from the other Sitio.

131
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,110
You left without a military escort.

132
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,481
Sorry, I wasn't able to think.

133
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:52,952
Someone called me, it was an emergency.
Someone is wounded.

134
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,054
Don't tell Lucas, okay?

135
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,159
What won't you tell me?

136
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,194
Captain Moira is missing.

137
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,864
What? Where did she go?

138
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:12,204
What I mean, is she was missing earlier,
but she has been found.

139
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,373
It is impossible for you
to go there alone…

140
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,742
if you have no contact from inside.

141
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,113
Do you have a contact inside the PRG?

142
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,818
Why can't you speak?

143
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,290
There's a lot
going through my mind right now.

144
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,092
That's why I'm rattled.

145
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,716
Sorry for what?

146
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,788
Are you sorry for lying?

147
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,761
Or because you're already one of them?

148
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,666
Have you joined the PRG?

149
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:25,611
Remember what I told you before
that I'm mad at some soldiers.

150
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:26,679
Yes.

151
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,347
Why is that?

152
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,617
My brother is a former army soldier.

153
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:37,189
He got expelled from military service
for alleged corruption.

154
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,358
But I don't believe it.

155
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,594
There are many good people among us.

156
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,362
I know that.

157
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,332
But there's still a few who aren't…

158
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,003
especially some of you
who hurt my brother.

159
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,074
It's a pain that my family will carry
for the rest of our lives.

160
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,444
Tell me, what is a more justifiable law?

161
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,179
The law of your profession?

162
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,452
Is it blind obedience,
or the most important law of saving lives?

163
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,187
Saving someone's life is honorable.

164
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,756
But, Maxine,
there is no perfect institution.

165
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,492
You must accept
that there's dignity in humility.

166
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,895
Because whatever we say,
what I did is still wrong.

167
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,464
Whatever we say, I'm still a soldier.

168
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:26,205
-What kind of question is that, Lucas?
-Just answer me, Maxine.

169
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,242
When I met you…

170
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,280
you were angry at soldiers
because of what they did to your brother.

171
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,949
Now that you found him…

172
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,752
What did you do?

173
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,688
Did you join them?

174
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,194
Did you believe in him already?
Are you one of the PRGs?

175
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,378
I admit.

176
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,716
He was forcing me to join them.

177
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,622
But I didn't do it, Lucas,
because I'm not a PRG member.

178
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,001
I'm so torn.

179
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,908
I wanted to come to you.

180
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,386
There are many things I want to tell you,
but I can't.

181
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:56,028
Because my brother and the man I love
are mortal enemies.

182
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,410
Did it change how you see me, Lucas?

183
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,353
Did it change
because Bullet is my brother?

184
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,366
Just tell me.

185
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,569
I will understand.

186
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,617
Do you think this is the end for us?

187
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,631
Because for me, it's not.

188
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,504
I won't break up with you, Maxine.

189
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,479
I love you.

190
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,652
Yes, you hurt me, but I love you.

191
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,408
I'm sorry if I doubted you.

192
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,811
I shouldn't have compared you
with your brother.

193
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,184
You are not Bullet.

194
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,497
I should be the one to apologize.

195
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,200
Because I lied.

196
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,370
Because I got scared.

197
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,543
But it scares me more to lose you.

198
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,649
You will not lose me.

199
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,187
From now on, you will tell me everything.

200
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,558
All your fears, everything you feel.

201
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,927
If you want to tell me something…

202
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,030
if you want to cry…

203
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,800
I'm here, Maxine.

204
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,502
Thank you, Lucas.

205
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,075
I love you so much.

206
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,680
Why is this happening to us?

207
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,752
What are we going to do now?

208
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,057
Admit it.

209
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,726
This will affect our relationship.

210
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,496
You are a soldier.

211
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,166
My brother is a rebel leader.

212
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,471
I have a feeling
Colonel Garcia already knows about this.

213
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,773
That's why I'm scared.

214
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,512
They might suspect me for a rebel.

215
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,413
And you.

216
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,185
You might get involved.
They might do something to you.

217
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,823
Nothing will happen to me, Maxine.

218
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,859
Are you sure?

219
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,001
What if they find out the truth?

220
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,670
Are you obligated to tell them?

221
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,445
Boys, keep your eyes open
while we are approaching the camp.

222
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,347
There might be traps in the area.

223
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,223
I wonder what happened to Big Boss?
I still can't contact him.

224
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,025
I hope the PRG didn't capture him.

225
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,862
He should've taken us with him.

226
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,010
The truth is,
I don't know what I should do, Lucas.

227
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,449
I don't want Rodel to get hurt,
especially by the soldiers.

228
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,586
I don't want him to die.

229
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,990
Especially in your hands.

230
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:13,705
I cling to the hope that time will come
when everything will be all right.

231
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,077
When soldiers and rebels will forge peace.

232
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,035
-What is it?
-Wolf, we have company.

233
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,804
The PRG rebels who were after us
are engaged in a gunfight.

234
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,441
Does it mean
soldiers are here to rescue us?

235
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,676
I'm sure it's the Alpha Team.

236
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:38,784
Snoopy, flank.

237
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,763
The gunshots are nearby.
It looks like they're coming.

238
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,633
What if they question us in the camp?

239
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,870
What if they ask what we're doing here?

240
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,605
What will we tell them?

241
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,347
Wait a second! Hold on.

242
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,317
Our priority is Big Boss, okay?

243
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,810
Wolf, there's a hut here.

244
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:40,879
Maybe they're here.

245
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,756
They're here.

246
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,631
-Lucas? How…
-Maxine.

247
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,000
Listen to me, I will protect you.

248
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,003
Don't say anything.
I'll take care of everything.

249
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,378
Do you understand?

250
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,514
Yes.

251
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,869
You're a smart person, doctor.

252
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,873
You know a doctor can't do anything
if the rebels take her boyfriend.

253
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,143
Sir, please don't pick on Maxine.
This is my responsibility.

254
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,311
I'm not talking to you!

255
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,014
-I'm just saying what's right.
-You dare answer back!

256
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,216
Coronel, that's enough, please.

257
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,385
<i>Forgive me if I let go of your hands.</i>

258
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,787
I will never do that again.

259
00:25:55,854 --> 00:26:00,525
I hope you can give me another chance
to show you how much I love you.

260
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,961
Do not cover up for your girlfriend.

261
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,732
Is she more important
than all your hard work and training?

262
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:08,800
No!

263
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,104
I won't allow Lucas to turn his back
on his sworn duty just because of me.

264
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,741
I will answer all your questions instead.
